Hmmm... I suggest you try and solve them yourself, and then post questions back on SO with your attempted solutions. Just asking people to do the work for you kind of defeats the purpose, you know?
@Benjamin, it's almost the same but for weighted matching. Do you know how to find _lexicographically smallest_ matching using it and can you give me proof?
You could simply use a bunch of XML files in a zip file, and whatever file extension you want. Why the verylongtagnumbers???
Is the graph that the MST is created from a unit graph (meanining all edges have a weight of 1)?  Is the graph directional?
a bit late I know but I just saw this question. Shouldn't it be on http://www.superuser.com ?
Is there some reason that you want to build vs. buy a premade headboard?
Wow, this really is a broad question! Can you mention what you already tried?
I would also alter the title; currently it looks like an auto spambot. Maybe 'How to develop a concept and gain funding' might be good?
I know `in` is a keyword, used in loops, is it a method too? If so, can you give us an example of usage?
@Jamie, please explain your intention in a few words. Is it your intention to create a buffer overflow exploit?
What error message do you get, if any? How is the table Employee defined?
How are you getting the parameters? How are you calling the exe?
@skywaddler. Sorry, but I got to ask for clarification: In your terminology, do you distinguish between a _function_ and a _functional_ ?
Straightforward solution with iterating over sub-array to find an average, won't it have `O(n)`? Why `O(n^2)`?
When the breakpoint 'activates' is the `struct frame` in scope? Do you have more variables named `Frame`, possibly static to another translation unit or local to some function ... ?
You're using `::` for type annotations and `\x -> ...` for lambdas, the combination of which is, to my knowledge, unique to Haskell and things closely related to it. Given that, why not just type `:t \f x -> \g -> g (f x g)` into GHCi and see what it tells you?
Do you need to return all 3 values? only 1?
I've never heard of this happening. Is this one of the core widgets?
@jnpcl: Yes, that is what I would like to prevent on my site. The question is how to do it?
Your use of `n` is rather ubiquitous. Every student must like and dislike the same number `n` of people?
Despite my answer, your question is too broad, if a question at all (no question mark). What I understand your question to be is how to use Google?
If it's read-only ... what exactly are you testing? I presume (because it's read-only) that the data is input from somewhere else and Rails is just consuming it?
I have one question, but if don't want to answer it's also ok... Where did you took Scala exam? Is your company makes it for the employees or at school or may be you own initiative to learn Scala and take exam?
Can you provide more context for your second code example? Specifically, how is $doc defined?
While this is obviously possible, it is far from trivial if you want it to look decent. Can you maybe get away with having several pre-rotated tower images and flip between those?
You want the chart to have a click event?  Or a certain part of the chart?
@Mr blue: it's possible that this question makes sense to those with an HCI background, but my gut tells me it doesn't.  Can you elaborate on your question?
It's 2011. By the time they grow up (20 years from now), which career path would be bereft of some form of programming?
I don't think the name's gonna help much since whatever I've played is going to be the Dutch translation. The cow shooting part had something to do with counting though, right?
I have never heard of a smart switch and have wired several homes.  Do you have any examples or links?
what exactly do you have in mind? Sampling or search applications?
Your image link is broken. Can you try to find new image and link to that?
homework? or you write software for Somali pirates?
Find what? How much paper is covered?
You never said *why* you want to do this. What's the problem with the current setup?
It should work. Why do you say it doesn't?
I put your code in a [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/JDrb8/) but I don't see the next or previous arrows. Am I missing something?
What do you mean by "How to calculate"? Do you actually want to know the how the algorithmic complexity of stack operations is derived, or do you just want to know the answers?
What is wrong, are you making a comment to Elderathis answer, or are you adding your own answer? If you're adding your own answer please expand a bit on this, I don't believe the base Clockworkmod can help you unless you've previously done full ROM backups, or follow the links on Elderathis post to get hold of the approriate ROMs (stock or custom)?
what do you mean by 'events'? string data like from calls to TRACE, software events (dll load/unload) or hardware events (device plug/unplug)?
We don't have master switches for stoves in the US. Could you explain how this works?
I don't understand your reference to "Appid". Are you able to clarify a bit more?
1. Which Database are using?
2. What is the type of the field?
What exactly do you want the result to be after parsing? I.e., how do you want the data stored/returned?
@Thomas P: hahah!! apropos Dijkstra huh?!
How have you stored it in the database? Are the strokes stored as XML?
seems I have done that just had my set to "false". Does that make difference?
@Zoozy: As Andrew asked, What led you to this problem? What are the practical uses of such a sequence?
Thanks, though. This was a much more interesting question than "how do you make a positive number negative in C#?"
"while function"?  Do you mean "while statement"?
doesn't a gaussian distribution by definition also include negative numbers, i.e. no matter how big (positive) your mean is, the left tail will always span to negative infinity?
did you read the "permission denied" message in that trace? why are you swallowing exceptions (`catch(TwitterException te) {}`)?
Which is the plain text field you are referring to? Is it a field you added, or is it added from a third-party module?
Are you using GRUB2 or GRUB Legacy?. Can you post your grub config files?
Is it easy to use the small pump? Have you noticed some differences?
*@asksuperuser* - These generally are not some the open-source WordPress community focuses on doing. Do you need these for your own use or because someone you are developing a system for has stated that having them is a requirement?
@gabriel looks like he's setting up his cells. how would you accomplish that?!
*in some conditions i want this tag to be completely disabled*: What does this mean? What conditions?
Mac OS X Server comes with an FTP server built in.  Is there something specific you're looking for that it doesn't do?
The question implies that free software is good for programmers. I would prefer the question "Is free software good for programmers? Why?"
If you know how to get the bits into a string, then do that, and get the first five of them using a substring. Which part do you need help with?
Jonas, as a matter of interest, what is your native language?. Do 'is' and 'are' not have straightforward equivalents in your own language?
According to google this is likly to be a bug in your TeX distribution. What operating system and TeX distribution are you using?
I'm not sure I understand your question.  Can you put the first sentence into a complete sentence?
It depends on language/platform. Or it doesn't matter?
what environment/operating system do you use? (Mac, PC, iPhone, etc?)
I'm ambivalent as to whether it's ok to copy questions like that (even linking them)... shouldn't we wait for them to be asked organically? Or are you really interested in an answer?
Well it looks like a basic hill-climbing problem, for which my favorite method is [Metropolis-Hastings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm). What's all that business about patents?
This is something I haven't tried yet.  Do you use a cutting board for this or do it straight on the counter?
I've never heard that. Any links to horror stories?
You can narrow this down a bit; are you on a mountain bike? A road bike? A 16" folding bike?
How do you bind zones to drop down list? What `TimeZoneInfo` properties are assigned to value and display text?
What GUI framework? What OS?
I bet this is not what you're looking for. But according to my experience the error should be really small... Have you tried replacing the 2 with a 2.0?
@hop: i didn't know about the fallback, thanks for reference. I think you meant RFC 2821?
What kind of `N` are we talking about here? i.e. what's the maximum number of bits to sort?
Thanks for the detailed answer, that's really helpful. Is there a way to recognise double/triple butted tubes on eg used frames? Can you hear the thickness change by flicking it with a fingernail?
What logic does the conversion follow? Divide by 100?
Have you tried running with breakpoints on?  Have you tried enabling NSZombies?
Just out of curiosity, how did you do the eye tracking?  Are you open sourcing this code?
Why do you think the crawler ignores invisible text? (how can it even tell if a text is white-on-white, too small or out of bounds?)
Are you wanting a single array when this algorithm finishes?  E.g. an array which stores all elements from `a`, `b` and `c` in a sorted order?
You're welcome. And now, could you give a more detailed description of the problem?
Just to clarify, the circle comes in to the definition of what it means to be adjacent -- element n is adjacent to element 1 -- but you do not consider rotations of the same bit pattern to be the same.  Is that right?
Huh?! You really want to use browser-side JS to create a cookie, receive it with server-side PHP, and store in a cookie.jar file for use with PHP's curl library?
Do you retrieve only exact matches? What is the sorting criteria?
This can be done in a number of ways. Do you want the user to select nodes to hide, or do you want certain nodes to be hidden from all users?
Why on earth would that make for bad chicken salad?
Hello Arosboro, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. May you report the code of `vtiger_portal_user_form_validate()`, which I think it is your custom form validation handler?
possible duplicate of [Simple algorithm for online outlier detection of a generic time series](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1142/simple-algorithm-for-online-outlier-detection-of-a-generic-time-series) This question is proposed to be closed as a duplicate. Could you please let us know at the meta thread if and how your context is different from the question I linked?
I assume you have artwork that is actually of a higher resolution? Or would you just be scaling up the lower-resolution ones?
@Jacques: “M is the disjoint union of the level set approximations to the complement of the Mandelbrot set.”  Yes, if by disjoint union you mean discriminated union (“disjoint union” sometimes means the usual union of pairwise disjoint sets, and I want to avoid this ambiguity).  Have I ever suggested otherwise?
PS. You mentioned 'typical issues'. What problems do you have?
OS?  OpenGL implementation vendor?  Can you post a complete, minimal program that demonstrates the problem?
@Atishay- It seems that you've changed the requirements of the problem to work with o(N) space (little-o of N here).  Any reason for the change?
I'm speculating that the rotation of the wheel should sorta match the movement of the road, and thusly it would be nice to have some JavaScript variables to work with that would allow these to sync up. Is that a fair guess, @KThornbloom?
Under "normal" circumstances, that space shouldn't be there, unless explicitly added. Can you please add to your question a [minimal working example](http://www.minimalbeispiel.de/mini-en.html) illustrating how your footnotes generate the extra spacing?
I think what #8 means is: that it has either one value or all nulls. Wouldn't  Min(Null) = Null return all nulls?
Ok, it turns out that taking the advice from the log and using Serial, instead of Integer, :serial => true, fixes it. But my question still stands, Why did this work locally, and not on Heroku's server?
Please clarify - are you going to charge your boss for this? Or is your boss going to charge a client?
That depends; is the lemon there to help balance out the spice in a hot dish, or is it part of a recipe with the word "Lemon" in it?
This is exactly what I am looking for: http://limi.net/articles/resource-packages/. Does anybody know where to find more information about this?
Please specify the environment/language in the question/tags. Is it .net/winforms?
@Kerrek SB : What do you think about when talking about a formatted output ? stringWithFormat does not do the job ?
Would HE HF and HG also be considered bottlenecks? Do you have a different definition?
You want to partition the map into subgraphs. The size of the subgraphs has to adhere to some bounds (max, min size) and the number of edges between partitions shall be minimized?
brian speaks truth.  The best answer is "don't" followed by "why did you want to do that?"
Show more declarations, what is the type of the curr_time2 variable? How is the get_time_in_seconds() function declared?
How are your PC and PS3 connected to the network (i.e. wirelessly or via ethernet)?
That is awesome! I would love to see bikes like that on sale and on the roads over here. Interesting that the frame geometry is 'relaxed' a lot more than most UK bikes. Any idea on price?
I love it. Two immediate thoughts (1) what about mapping the space based on probabilities (2) what would a scheme to try and identify the or incorrect answers look like?
You are passing a URL string into a method that takes a file path. Did you try initWithContentsOfURL and passing an NSURL instead?
Writing your own utility to parse this would not take long at all, probably 15-20 minutes - is that an option?  What language would  you use?
"The Bounce Rate as shown in Google Analytics started to increase from about 2 to 75% since I have detected PHPSESSID two weeks ago." Why are you thinking a URL parameter would be causing a bounce rate?
Thank you for your answer. For the acidic rub, do you mean like lemon juice? Or more like yoghurt to permeate/tenderize the meat?
@Chubsdad - my point was that there is a very small amount of memory being allocated above.  Even if we were using a non-throwing version of `new`, what's the likelihood of `new` failing to allocate the insignificant amount of memory in that program?
This depends on the distribution you are using and the xorg it ships. Could you add these informations?
@space_cadet: that is again confused viewpoint of what entropy means. I guess you'll now start telling us that broken egg has lower entropy than unbroken egg (because you can store more information in the egg that is ordered) and so second law predicts that broken eggs will jump back to their shells, right? :-)
What do you mean by 'variable'? More specifically, are you including fields and properties, or are you referring specifically to method-local variables?
are you refreshing the cache on deleting the post? and what type of caching you are using page, action or fragment?
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by the first bullet item.  Can you elaborate?
To quote Scott Meyers: "`make`? Who needs stinkin `make`?".
@Butts Fredkin: I'm sure you can back this claim up with some facts.  Can you please provide specific quotes or a links that illustrate what you're talking about?
I don't understand this sentence "We are to find such placement of this polygons (we could make rotations and movements), when rectangle, which circumscribes this polygons has minimal area." Can you clarify?
You say they are in `/stylesheets/images/XYZ/`, but you are searching them in `/images/dookum.in/` (no stylesheets). Is a mistake on the post, or is this inconsistency what's preventing the images from being found?
did you mean `{:a => ["val1", "val2", ...],  :b => ["valb1", "valb2", ...], ...}`?? so that the output will include, say, `:c => "valc1"`, blah blah blah?
Please explain the kind of statistics you are trying to gather. Is it just number of loads or urls or is there some callback info you want when the user is using your widget?
thanks for taking the time to answer my question! can you please point out WHERE should i add the call?
I don't understand the "go all the way until the end" part. Why wasn't 4 highlighted in the third line in your second example, and why wasn't 2 highlighted in the second line in the same example?
do you mean the apparent brightness? as in a grayscale?
@Evan: ? Is this a car thing?
I'm not sure your question makes sense. Do you mean, how do you measure the length of the red or blue lines?
Also, the last time you asked this, 100 worked but 190 didn't work. Why the change?
Suggestion to edit the title?  "Free/Open-Source Theme Frameworks as an Alternate to Thesis?"
your're title of your question says 'smokey flavor', yet in the body of the question it says 'charcoal flavor', which is it?
Yes, but how big can it be? Do you have an upper bound on it?
@code: **Come on!** I have *already* made an end-user friendly site at http://stacklist.quickmediasolutions.com - can we stick to what we already have?
I tried this for some of the code but immediately ran into problems - the code for some reason it went over the book's margins. Please take a look here: http://i.imgur.com/7S9cE.png Any ideas how to make it wrap nicely?
Hello Lina, and welcome to _Drupal Answers_. For which Drupal version is your question?
I mean, are you adding some form fields in a node edit form, or are you creating a custom form in a different page? In the latter case, how do you get the node ID for which the form would show the coordinates?
Can you explain what you mean by "base"?  Do you mean the crust?
I'm confused. Why does `\begin{figure}...\end{figure}` not work for you for setting figures in only a single column?
Please post the relevant lines from the log.  Do you intend for these commands to run as you, or as root?
The answers here (http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/8618/stopping-water-from-bubbling-over-when-cooking-rice) may be of help to you.  For example, do you wash your rice before cooking?
No. Distribued between what and what? Are those numbers independent or not?
There are already plenty of reasonably commonplace words presented in answers, but (slipping into 'armchair philologist' mode) I can't help wondering if the process of 'word-sharing' between languages is skewed more towards *importing* rather than *exporting* in the case of Far Eastern languages. Might the supposedly more self-effacing character of such speakers make them quicker to adopt the foriegner's words rather than keep pushing their own?
Why voted down?  Fair enough question, yes?
make a c program to echo a php script? something like that?
Time to register and start giving some votes to the people that are giving you free consulting. All : Is a feature on Stackoverflow that if a user doesn't register that there is no calculation of acceptance rate?
What results do you get? Does the debug console tell you something?
Am I missing something, or what specifically are you coding this in? JavaScript?
Question is unclear to me. What do you want to do with WMI on this DLL?
I absolutely don't understand the question. What is this supposed to mean "and the difference between the scores of 10 and 18 relatively more higher than 18 and 20"?
Good advice, @Spacedman. Care to write that down in a form of an answer so I can upvote you?
I can't repro, have you tried decompressing the payload with gzip?  Is it valid?
What kind of routing logic would you provide at the host-level?  Are you talking about routing to various servers in a pool, or using something like IP source-routing?
@henchen: Sorry to ask, but doesn't an extractor suffices? Why are you considering hash functions?
What do you think is wrong with using a hidden form field? What do you want to achieve on a higher level?
Should we understand the outermost pair of curly braces `{}` to be a reference to a Perl hash?  Are you just asking how best to format a lengthy hash in Perl?
You want to compress strings from argv, really?  Or do you mean you want to treat argv's elements as names of files to compress, like gzip the program does?
@Peter: How about calling it the "necessary"? That's discreet, right?
I'm sorry, but it's still not clear.  Are you saying that it _is_ correct grammar?
what database is this?  SQL Server?
Does the application run ok locally when you're not trying to debug?  Do any other web apps allow you to debug?
Good question, actually. I really hope it's not homework... is it?
Can you please post the some sample code.To which panel you are adding this horizontal panel?Is there any spacing between the widgets added in the horizontal panel? or space is there on left side of whole horizontal panel?
George, would you mind if I 'borrowed' your stackoverflow icon? At least until there are "official" releases of icons/images?
Do you mean tough? Is it dry as well?
Wasn't me, but I assume it's because the question is "Can we please have?" rather than "Why does mine not work?"
"Generates" from what kind of data? Can you show an example?
@pimvdb, No I don't. Do you have something which could lead me to a solution or just wanna make some pointless comments?
", actually the application crashes..." We need the crash info. Is it a BAD ACCESS ?
How is "17:18:3600" supposed to be understood? Is this a standard format?
Could you clarify to which goto doesn't it go?.. What's the expected/real output?
I know little about compilers. Isn't cygwin just a compiler?
Why is updating the display immediately an issue? Doesn't that make your application seem slower than it actually is?
I'm a little confused by the title, but I don't know much about corn varieties.  I know candy corn as [this sweet confection](http://www.reagantales.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/candycorn1.jpg); is there a variety of corn that is grown that's commonly referred to as candy corn?
Have you tried writing some output to the console to see how far the method gets or where the blocking begins? Is the lock to `syncLock` possible or not?
All, I have some ideas for Palm Springs meetup locations (just by looking on Yelp). Should I start a question in main or meta, add my locations as answers so people can vote and also add their ideas for meetup locations?
This is still, even after the edit, unclear. Do you want to say that she is right and this was the best she could have said in this situation, or do you want to ask her whether she has nothing better to say, or do you want to add to the answer and propose the best follow up to her remark?
Major grammar reconstruction from @chills42 and myself. Maybe it's a clearer question now?
I hate to betray my ignorance but what is a self-saucing pudding?
the amount of time you might end up spending trying to figure out a noisy power supply might offset the cost of picking up an adjustable power supply, or even a decent single voltage Meanwell (or similar) 5VDC power supply.  That said, maybe an LM6805 or LP2954 will do the trick?
Could you please give a more detailed description of your problem. When did it start, etc?
You will need some code on the server side for this to work. What environment are you going to host this in / what scripting languages might be available on the server side?
I had to look at the source of if_javascript() to understand how atrocious it is. There are plenty of alternative solutions for any problem if_javascript() was trying to solve, so could you give us some specifics?
I wonder if your instance(s) of Persist are in a local scope that gets destroyed upon exiting that scope. Have you looked into that?
Your problem is not fully specified - when there is a blob you wish to identify, may there be other filed cells on the board separate from the blob? Also you talk about "similarity" - but are you after a precise pattern match or an approximate one?
I'm surprised no-one's mentioned calzone (unless it's lurking under an alias). Am I the only one who eats this when I'm in the States?
I see you have `Debug` enabled during `MIME::Lite->send`.  Can you post that log?
@cvondrick, in that case I'd rather use binary insertion and sorting. My problem now, is however how I can combine two dates to one number?
My brain has been scrambled a bit by your sentence: "Essentially there is no way to distinguish between an object at rest or moving at a constant velocity." - can you elaborate please?
what's wrong with this place? how has this question been up for an hour and no one has made a Bob Ross reference?
This should possibly be a comment/clarification to original question.  Can they be merged?
What do you need MySQL for? To store the hints?
@Mat is there a NOP for oracle? how can I abort the statements from being executed from within the trigger?
The best thing would be to output the array in XML, json, or plist format instead of using php's `var_dump()`. Is there a reason you cannot do that?
Its not. But if it were balanced, is there an optimum way?
You ask and answer your own question? Or am I completely missing out on something?
I think, the point here is I should have checked for error when i am doing "ptr[0] = new char[strlen(psError) + 1];"

This might be the reason that it is throwing error when i am trying to delete it later?
Who said the bunks are equidistant? Also, what is a "bunk"?
It seems this could actually occur easily if the user copy-pasted the null character in. (Maybe the user got it from a website or Word doc?)
This is a standard homework problem for an undergrad QM course. Do we really want questions like this and answers to them on MO?
Do you actually have a system with `sys/ioctl.ph` properly installed on it?  Which one?
@Scott - The title really does look like it's a typo of "saddle sores". Perhaps it could read "prevent chafing in the saddle"?
*@Scott B* I mean why did you support a file on disk rather than an place in the admin? For multiple, have you considering created a "Sales Letter" custom post type?
Also note that I know this question has been asked before and the general consensus was to avoid rebuilding your code if you didn't need to, then you don't have to deal with the changed assemblies, which apparently is a part of the deal. May I ask why you need to rebuilds to be identical, as opposed to just not rebuilding it if the code hasn't changed?
I feel I'm on the receiving end of a cross-cultural dialect issue :) What geographic location is this relevant to?
I've clarified the question, thanks ax. @runrunraygun: What is a community wiki?
It might be good to give some more context: What kind of computer? What operating system (version)?
Since you mentioned that P is PCP(0, log n), I'd like to add that it is also PCP(0, 0), PCP(0, log log n), etc. How does such a characterization help separate it from NP?
I haven't used those features much yet; can you explain what effect you'd like them to have on your blog? Should ignored tags make it so the user never even sees those posts, does it just affect the tag cloud, or something else?
Your examples have nothing to do with GLn. Are the coefficients always integers ?
Fails [1, 2, 4, and 5](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/q/350/209)?  Maybe 6?
I can't help but think that you're making this much more complicated than it should be.  HTML already handles word wrapping beautifully, why would you manually add line breaks to text that has characters with dynamic width?
Did you try both solutions suggested in the thread you linked to? Did they not work for some reason?
Sorry, just realized you were talking specifically about using the word in the title, which does make things a little trickier-- you probably don't want your app to have a different name on both sides of the pond, although it wouldn't be unheard of. Can't you just use "Plane" instead? :P
Testing is an art more than a science. Before you go off and read a book, tell me - what are you trying to accomplish?
No doubt, some comments are crazy. But getting rid of **all* comments?
Where does the menu show up on the page? Do you have HTML or (better yet) a [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) that we can look at?
What is the actual question: how to build ConnectionKit as a framework, how to use/link an arbitrary framework to a project in Xcode (which version?), or both?
So you're trying to use remote debugging? Have you set that up in VS 2010?
Are you looking to change the text field's height (if so, why?), or keep its height the same while resizing the window?
`for k in **kwargs:`? can you paste the actual code you are using?
Well I got it to return the correct height by returning findHeight(node)-1 in my public method. However I just feel like this is sloppy code, any suggestions on a revamp?
@ypercube hmm, never know it is there. **DATE** doesn't issue time, right?
Ian: There are such books. Is this not the place to recomend them?
I've always been under the impression that most quick-sort implementations will switch to merge sort after descending a predetermined number of levels of recursion. Would you mind posting your code to see areas for improvement?
What kind of shell tools are available?  E.g., awk, pure bash, perl, python, ... ?
Can we pass a law that cars may not be operated within 100 yards of children under the age of 6? Which law would have a greater impact on public health?
It sounds like this is just a simple round-robin tournament which isn't too hard to code; however, what sort of scoring rules should be used? Is the winner the one with the most wins, or are you using a point system where strength of play comes into account?
Its related to an algorithm for finding unique sets of a given number of items, so I just wanted to know if that had a name or if I was already looking at it.  Is my question still off topic?
He's aware of "perdoc", but he doesn't know how to search? And he's annoyed by it having MORE than just a list of functions?
Are the box's sides always oriented parallel to the x and y axis? Or is it sometimes tilted by some angle?
Of the two answers, you chose to accept the one with 3 downvotes vs. the one with 7 upvotes?!
How big is an integer?  Is this a 10G file that contains integers stored as text, or in binary format?
@Jrg I can only see two questions in total by Markus, unless one's been deleted. Where's the third?
The funny thing is that you explained in the detail any part of the question (what you mean by integers, what comparison operators are), but what _short circuited_ mean. What is it?
If I recall from my college days, shouldn't you be able to do this by setting up a set of equations and solving for the transformation?  By the way, is this your homework?
Target platform is OS X. @Bavarious What alternatives?
two questions 1) wich database are you using? 2) are you using BDE?
Sorry, I'm actually talking about the μF, not the voltage. What do you think about that?
Wow! Trivial answer converted to comment! Is this new?
A perfect hash is only possible in this case if you don't want to hash any arbitrary combination of 17 digits, but only a limited list of keys all known in advance.  Is that what you have?
From the error message, your jQuery file seems broken. What happens if you open it in the browser?
Can you please show me how to do it with colorbox?
What is the question? How to debug?
@phoog Ah, and haha, read this question: "it's not homework". It seems that he's creating square wheels in some company (or maybe he's freelance?).
Problem description has only inputs defined not what the program is supposed to solve. What kind of optimization is needed here?
@ANdrea: I don't that is right. What if all the numbers were negative?
Have you checked the actual SVN server to make sure the file was added?  

Did they Add and check in or just Add?
If you had such a list, what on earth would you do with it? The list of names in each category doesn't seem very interesting by itself; surely you don't want to actually process the content of all those grammars?
I'm not entirely sure what the question here is. Are you asking about specific forms of matrices, or the general case (in which case a simple counting argument seems to work)?
please can you add to your question the results of the following: `sudo lshw -class network` followed by `rfkill list`. Also - what happens if you deactivate the B43 driver and activate the STA driver?
I updated original question with persistentStoreCoordinator method which I got from my AppDelegate.m.  Regarding the two different managed objects, I guess I messed this up, am I only supposed to have one in the app delegate?
what can i do about that? Make a new one??
Since you're only trying to detect gnome vs kde, is there a particular set of distros or configurations you're targeting? How general does the solution have to be?
Interesting how the possible duplicate question is flourishing with a score of +21 and 26 answers, and this one is closed as off-topic. Is it because the asker said "I think this is way better"?
@Qiang Li: okay. Is this question drawn from a specific programming challenge ?
How did you import it into the project? "Add to build path..."?
If you add bbcd to the list, then some of your items will have no unique characters. How will this affect your goal?
@Alan: Do you mean to say that you are looking for image editing software which will automatically spit out the hex code/array you can use in your Arduino code to display said image? If so, why not let them write it (perhaps based on some codebase you write yourself) taking a [PBM image](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pbm.html) to start with?
finding GCD recursively is the fastest known method. Do you want some kind of special optimization?
Can you please provide all of the code between your $sql lines an when you actually query the DB? Are you calling `strip_tags` on your sql statement?
Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string-to-int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to "re-convert" the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?
What OS? Can you establish a link local IP address?
You're just discarding any useful exceptions that download() will throw - Image.open() might be trying to read "" being returned by download(), which would explain the current error you're receiving. If you remove that try..catch block, do you receive any more informative errors?
Can you clarify the question a bit? Do you want to simply get the third element from the list (which in this case is the list of lists) or do you want to find the element which is a list of lists (without knowing at which position it will be)?
Should string2 be rist or tisr?  And in that case wouldn't the output be "st str"?
In this case, posting the code that causes the error, and just the exception _without_ the full trace would probably be more helpful. The error message says that you're passing a `nil` argument to `-[NSURL initFileURLWithPath:]`; have you looked into that?
where are you seeing this error? Do you have the site set up to login when permission is denied?
Could we have a question concerning the GPL without discussions about whether the GPL is good or bad sometime?  Please?
do you include libfoo.h in libfoo.cpp? If you do an `nm` on the libfoo.a do you have the c++ name for the foobar() function?
Why was this closed? Is this question answered elsewhere on SE?
Are you looking for something that gives you a global view? For instance to see the difference in load time from Texas and Tokyo?
What operating system? What kind of device connection?
What does `which python2.5` return? What about `which python`?
Hot d*mn, this is more complicated than I thought at first. Week 1 is the week that contains the calendar year's first *Thursday*!?!
Would you be able to tell if more than 24 hours elapsed between start and stop time? Or is this not an issue with your data set?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_revision_control_software is a great comparison table for exactly this.  Discussion question... community wiki ?
please clarify the scenario please. What exactly is the purpose of finding out?
You seem to have missed the whole point of templates, there. Why create the text manually using concatentation and then "rendering" something that contains no template syntax, rather than actually using a template file with proper template logic that can do all that for you?
I have to say that I don't like the output, harder to read and code isn't formatted with the correct colors. Could there be an optional output for how it is printed?
Unicode contains only four double-struck Greek letters: ℽℼℾℿ (γπΓΠ), and since the Unicode repertoire is quite comprehensive (and much larger than the Comprehensive Symbols List), I'd conjecture that this character is very uncommon. Could you give an example where this character is used?
Cool idea. I'm curious, though, how can one drill all the way through 80" of door in a straight line?
Jay--you've shown the ObjectiveGrid component crash only occurs when you open a MXD Map document saved with the Attribute table **docked open** for one of the layers, as you've nicely proven. Why not open a bug with ESRI and then avoid saving with a docked attribute table until ESRI gets the behavior corrected at the next SP or major release?
Hmm...  I don't know about this one.  Can you give a use case?
So? Are you expecting us to do your homework for you??? :-) Ok,here's a hint... what's the type of `"a" | "b"`?
What environment are you running the code on? Could you enclose the code as it would make it easier to help you for us SO'ers?
What is `a`? Is there a value or just 0?
What if I want to have another while loop within the main and split the record even further? I've noticed that then the first loop doesn't loop beyond just the first iteration, why?
Thank you for this code.But when I put it in my file the title "Table of content" doesn't change. Could you help me, please?
Subjective and argumentative?  Really?
Was there an exception thrown? Some type of error encountered?
For what it's worth, I haven't seen this. Can you please add your device and carrier to your message?
sorry, i meant after login. ok, what do i have to add to /etc/sudoers to start without password?
Did you try anything at all? Is this homework?
Sorry, but an additional: if I do not export it to SD, where they originally are? Can I see them from PC?
It's doing what you're telling it to do. Can you tell us what the problem is?
Where-how the reports will be viewed? Do you especially need them in PDF form?
So, you have duplicated records in the database, right? Also, why do you need `insertable=false, updatable=false` in join column?
What have you tried so far? Do you have any pseudo-code that you've come up with on your own that others can comment on?
Can edge weights be negitive? Can there be negitive weight cycles?
Can you specify the order of the layers if you make lasagne?
Looks like `CodeMirror.fromTextArea('code', options);` returns `undefined`. Maybe you are passing the wrong arguments to that function?
It's been four days.  Still haven't tried the hotfix?
Also, what happens when you compare 15 Jan to 10 March? 3? 2.xx?
This same question was asked almost word-for-word about two hours ago. Hasn't anyone ever heard of Google?
It is not possible to update primary key columns in a relational database.   Maybe you can use a surrogate key?
Homework? Who told you that checking the precondition is a bad idea?
you're twisted. Do you publish a newsletter to which I could subscribe?
What's the processor? What have you done yourself to answer the question?
Do you really want R_i <= D_x <= R_i+1? Or did you want R_i <= D_x < R_i+1?
Your function doesn't actually *return* anything. When you say "it just returns the matrix", what do you mean?
@George: I have started a project which uses your wrapper ... it appears that the site name is hard coded, but can easily be passed in as a parameter. Do you have plans to change this to be configurable?
why not `fprintf`? is this a homework?
Can you post a bit more context, please? What's in `$query_string` and where do you get it from?
i put the file on c:\. so where can i put this file?
For what its worth I have chrome 7. Is it possible that greasemonkey support was added at 7?
Did you already ask this question? But i think the file path for tabify could be playing up??
I once saw someone touch the (house)radiator to discharge before working inside a PC. Does that really help?
If your images are smaller than your threshold, why do you need to run them through ImageMagick with that parameter? Why not just convert them over, or do you require all images to be that exact size?
Can you create a short but complete program which demonstrates the problem? Are you sure you've got the right using directive *in the file which contains that line*?
have you tried this? What output do you get?
@jrista. can you please describe your setup?
Do your keywords always come in pairs? What's more important, having more matching words or better proximity?
Is there any other output in your script?  Is there any whitespace before `<?php`?
So the size of [-5,-2] is -2 - (-5) = 3? Wouldnt [12,-2] with -2 - 12 = -14 be better?
What makes you think that this is the reason for the memory usage diff? Are your results repeatable?
What is your definition of a "small change" in the output? Edit distance (treating hashes as strings) or mathematical distance of numbers (treating hashes as integers?)
Is it possible that it could be a passenger issue? Does devise/warden cache the current_user variable?
Please be more specific. Do you want to connect a device to your xperia and have the audio routed thru the loudspeaker?
Well, the title may say it all but _"all"_ isn't enough for me to understand what you are asking. Can you please elaborate?
To clarify, you are using a serial monitor program (eg. Hyperterminal) on a PC to communicate over RS232 to the Arduino's USART (Tx and Rx) pins, correct?
I assume the graph need not be connected (i.e. forests are acceptable)?
Well, dd style meaning that I could either name/number a frame for extraction to a pipe &| file or that I could specify frame ranges in the way that dd does skip|seek|count.  dd has it's own issues no doubt, but does dd_rescue support seek?
Version 2.6.6.  Is this addressed in a newer version?
Welcome to SO. What is a Try It Editor?
what are you trying to do with the ticket itself? Is it an option to generate tickets as needed using keytabs?
please add to your question details of your graphics card `lspci | grep VGA` - also have a look in the Additional Drivers window - which nvidia driver is installed - and most importantly, is it activated?  Does it say "activated but not in use"?
Why can't this work?  `var s1 = "a\"b"; var s2 = "\"" + s1 + "\"";` ?
Just curious. how do you end up with COBOL homework?
Please mention the version of ubuntu you are using, as well the catalyst ( fglrx) driver version. Do you experience tearing or any other distortion?
argmax on what? A function, a dictionary?
just a simple question: if you created a simple `Foo` object, how will you be able to cast it to `Foo<T>`? From where should it have the additional `Data`?
@hammar: Yes we can, assume it's a x86 architecture. Could you give a bit more detail on this approach?
Could you please explain. Since I'm not accessing the database while loading the page the first time, can it really be the reason, even if it is something I need to look into as well?
When you say "no other access to the dictionary of words", do you mean that you don't have access to the actual dictionary that `IsValidWord` is using, or that you cannot use a dictionary at all? Would using a separate dictionary be OK, in the hopes that it matches the one that `IsValidWord` is using?
What if the two dimensional array (7x9) is full ones?  Should it return a list of the 756 possible rectangles?
Apple => i = 0 => B[i + 101] = B[101] = "0069", not "0041". Am I wrong or are you?
I don't know much about gwt, but if the above methods exist, there should be a function to get the scrollX and scrollY just like in javascript. Then you would combine all of the above to be event.getNativeEvent().getClientY()-image.getElement().getAbsoluteTop()-(document.scrollTop?)
i update my question. I meant if i will use cron, i write this in console how my script (or cron) will be know that im using missed or oncoming?
Please expand on what you're trying to ask. Point out the differences of what?
The question is, which do you think would be easier? Port the C# code or implement the algorithm (second link) from scratch in Android?
Did you get any result? Are you sure that the numbers are not separated by an other whitespace character, like a tab?
Please edit your question and title to more clearly address what you're seeking. Perhaps something like "Is there an explanation, including diagrams, of Ubuntu's USB stack?"
Which call to Print fails?  The first call?
This seems OT?  @LBushkin, do you think this would be the right site for this kind of question?
What do you mean "wont"? What's the error or result that you aren't expecting?
What type of Lycra? Polyster or Nylon?
As a college student, what gear do you have available?  Just a hot plate, or an oven, microwave, etc?
How ridiculous is the answer you're looking for? Do you want a 3-layer solution, with `i % 3` as a configurable business logic?
As you say that you're not concerned about holidays (yet), is it fair to say that there's a fixed number of working minutes per week for a given SLA?  If so, can you just divide SLA time by minutes-per-week, and then sort out the remainder?
You could serialize Python objects to files and then load them. The problem is that model is too large?
What about a function like safe_free(void* ptr) { free(ptr); ptr = NULL; } or something like that?  Or what about some kind of struct wrapper and functions to manipulate it?
Did you try to go backward?  Have you found a function which actually *does* go backward?
I have, see comment in original thread. Maybe there's a configuration option for it, or some way to set up a "dummy target" for nose?
I am looking at a more brute force and exhaustive approach, I am curious as to your performance/memory concerns. Is this something being done a lot or just once for different sets of letter combinations?
There's too little information. How about posting some code?
You do realise that it's not likely to be much cheaper unless you rebuild the wheels yourself?
Um...if two n-state DFAs are acyclic, then each merely accepts a finite set of words of length at most n, in which case their intersection is just the intersection of the two labelled transition graphs, which will have n states and can be computed in linear time and space.  Or am I missing something?
This question is not clear - are you talking about a system you're developing, that needs to store a credential client side? Or are you talking about a home user / end user PoV?
This is a bit tricky to answer.  Does combinatorics fall outside classical mathematics?
Why not K&R? Was this just an excuse to bad-mouth some books you didn't like?
Sorry, I still have trouble grasping scope of your issue. May be you could add actual code to the question so it is more clear what it currently does and what needs to be improved?
This is a relative path, what means, that it is resolved against the current working directory (`getcwd()`). Did you checked the absolute path also (`realpath()`)?
Please edit your question and explain what isn't working. What errors are you seeing, or how isn't it working as you expect?
what does your databasemanager class look like? can you post some code pls?
You should know that adding the tag "homework" to your question still doesn't convince many people to do all the work for you. Could you at least show us what you came up with so far?
depends, there has to be a fraction of a triangle at the top, since it wont line up with the top of the screen. How do you handle that?
@Adam: Thanks! Any suggestions / comments for the site?
What about installing "TTS Service Extended"? Does that do anything for you?
this seems like an interesting question, but I can't make heads or tails of it.  Do you think you could edit it to explain in more depth, perhaps including links to some of the more technical terms?
`header("Content-type: image/jpeg");` does not set a header, instead it sends raw header to the browser. What do you want to achieve?
And this is why you're asking all the stupid questions?
Update: I have received the kit today, My friend suggested to use the onbard SD Card slot, that is, load the photos from PC to SDRAM card by a simple copy/paste, plugin the card in the SD card slot, and use the NIOS II or Altera modules to copy the images to the RAM, what do you think? Isn't this simpler?
(1) “Transitive closure” sounds as if you are looking for something like R∪R^2∪R^3∪…, but I guess that this is not the case and that you are looking for the H-representation of R^k for a given k.  Am I right?  (2) Sorry for my ignorance, but what is an open polytope?
And also ... what was the _starting_ temp. Was the food cold, or ambient temp when you started reheating?
Emmy,
Have you found a solution for this?
You can't just say 'this is the unit that counters everything' in Starcraft. What *exactly* are you trying to counter from terran?
isnt `tested` same as `i`. I that case will the `while` ever complete?
I reboot my phone lots.  What version of the Market do you have?
Something is wonky somewhere -- I've used the wininet libraries several times, and they behave as the documentation describes.  perhaps expand your troubleshooting to the wininet setup or the contents of the response?
Why do you have one currency to select? You are converting to the selected currency or from the selected currency?
I'm probably going to be sorry I asked, but what's a BA? "Bachelor of Arts", "Benefits Administrator", "Bad Ass"?
Hey, I think it broke again; the link doesn't show on [so].  Can you check?
Things are going to break if you get rid of the `.Designer.cs` file. Why do you want to do this?
@Mark, i.e. a perfect question for this StackExchange eh?
@ikegami: Can you suggest an easier one for beginners? SOAP::Lite seems to be advocated as 'the easiest' all around?
I'm using javascript to include other html files. <-- why?
DO you see any problem or any thing missing in my script. As I am new in python its fun working with it but running against time.. Does any one want me to add anything more in the script??
@Bill the Lizard: You deleted my answer: in this way this question will never be answered which will harm my accept rate. Or am I mistaken?
What about good old Boundschecker and Purify?  Are they stil the leading apps?
Using what? Html?
This is tough because personal environments are usually already customized, so apples-to-apples comparisons are hard to come by.  To start, you might indicate what your system is (Ubuntu version, hardware) and even include a relevant benchmark for your current set-up?
Please name the browser and version. Are you sure this is a WordPress related problem?
sorry to extend the question, but how would i block the ip address? (using PHP?)
Some prof once told me that 1N400x's are all made the same, just graded differently based on how they turn out.  Not sure how much I believe that, but if you look at [some datasheets](http://www.diodes.com/datasheets/ds28002.pdf) all specified parameters are the same except Vr and only two different capacitances (maybe they just make 1N4004 and 7's?)
what's a binding? And in what way is it temporal?
Sorry, reading a bit about alpha testing - it seems to come at the end of the pipeline, which introduces aliasing problems: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2011/05/06/antialiasing-alpha-cutouts.aspx. As a final question, do you happen to know how to do alpha testing in XNA 4.0?
Yikes. Don't stoves usually provide heat that's too uneven and would tend to stress and break glass?
What do you remember from gameplay? Something particular?
How exactly does a test fail, i.e. what do you test for?
A lil bit confusing here. Do you want to compare if the Person array have a repeated items?
You need to show the declaration of Patient. Are you sure you're not writing pointers instead of complete strings into the file?
Is this a exercise in ideology? Views is very well suited to this task, why not use it?
The data is dynamic for each particular user? Or is it dynamic for a particular period of time, but for all users during that time span?
Why are you passing an image object into jQuery. Shouldn't this be `$('<img>')` instead of `$(img)`?
No, it is for a student project (matrix calculation with multiple processes), but for this step I have to use mmap.
Is there another way to share the variable between all my processes ?
@Sunil: and what does you input look like? What's the contents of cb.Text?
You shouldn't need to do any of that stuff in code if your MVC app has a correct system.servicemodel web.config entry. Can you post it?
How is the structure "the same"? Do you need to capture the _letters_ between the _last slash_ and the _last dot_, or ..?
What? No warning that gender can change?
The question is ambiguous. Can you please be more specific?
updated the question. can i do that in a scope?
Can you be a bit more specific about what you want in the two result arrays?  E.g. @left = ('a', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h');  @right = ???
@David it is owned by MICROSOFT . what do you expect?
My concern would be that the doWork procedure will finish (going on to workComplete) while your timer is still running calling the OnTimerEvent.  Are you sure you just don't want a loop with thread.Sleep in the do work method?
This looks like it could be a fantastic solution. Could you please add it as an answer to the [other question](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/5345/mouse-and-keyboard-for-xbox-360)?
Yeah, and why don't it try to convert 'abc' to int and add to 1? Apples + Bananas gives you what?
Why a `BigDecimal`? Wouldn't `to_f` on the end of these values be enough?
also, did you read through the documentation of add_meta_box
 at http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_meta_box ?
what i mean is the php part is the part that you need to debug. what is the error that you are getting?
I changed your tags to "jruby" since that's an important restriction. Does Hpricot support namespaces at all?
Can you clarify what you're trying to do?  Are you just trying to replace one view with another?
Sp1 did not resolve my issues.  Any other ideas?
Nice! Can we get this for our Stack Overflow profiles, please?
Is it a directed, acyclic graph? or are cycles allowed?
What are you uploading the images for? Is it something that your theme will reference, or something that you want users to have access to and to be able to re-use images that you already posted in their own content?
is there another transparent view in front of the right 1/3? Or maybe your button has been moved outside of it's parent view's bounds?
Surely that would mean each camera only received half as much light? Wouldn't that be a problem?
@Noctrine I sincerely appreciate that. :)
@Frédérick Imbeault Can you share a link to the article you read?
You have a web service for multiplying numbers? What for?
*"I am going to be developing a real-time web application"* - good luck with that! How are you planning to get around the internet latency?
@zaf look at the picture here: http://i.imgur.com/22yAQ.jpg , perhaps slightly more rotated. How can you fit such a rectangle inside this one?
Do you want real data, or just test data (i.e. fictional)?
Are you sure you are getting the error on that line? What line are you trying to access the array on?
Maybe you don't have the CHUD tools (Shark, Instruments, etc) installed ? Or maybe you decided to move them and now Xcode can't find them ?
Is this for all of your tests?  Can you add a code example?
Hey Sai - I'm having trouble picturing it my head. Any chance you have a design or a sketch for it?
Can you clarify? What's the list supposed to contain?
Yes, also: what do you mean when you say that you want the existing elements of the list to update their start and end dates accordingly?  How does the newly inserted item cause those pre-existing items to change?
@Unreason, yes its not an natural thing to grasp, simply put: Possible Haiku combination = Infinite; Number of Monkeys OR Time required to produce said Infinite Hakim = NOT possible, as in order to generate those Infinite Haiku's you would need a greater than Infinite amount of time Or GREATER THAN infinite amount of monkeys. Now do you see the contradiction?
by "downloading by code" I meant downloading the picture bytes using a webservice and assigning it to the Image element. This could be the subject of another question, but what technique would you use to control the download sequesce by preserving the browser cache?
Is your host only blocking you from editing your php.ini?  If so can you set the memory in the script using ini_set('memory_limit', 64);?
What have you tried so far?  What problems have you encountered?
A clarification: Do you want generalisations in the sense that feasible solutions are matchings, but your objective function is different from the usual max-weight matchings (something like the case of stable marriages)? Or generalisations in the sense that feasible solutions are also some kind of generalisations or relaxations of matchings (something like independent sets or fractional matchings)?
Completely different approach - could you OCR the page, and see if it comes up with any characters? Or are you working from scratch and/or prefiltering the pages quickly before they even reach a much slower OCR step, and/or dealing with pages that might have illustrations but no text?
What have you tried? Where are you having difficulties?
@Klark Why is the solution to the second example "not possible"? How about `(2,9) (5,1)`?
You might want to explain a bit more of the *removing* business. Why is the first `remove` removing `2` (tail of the sequence), but the second removing `3` (which at the time is the head of the sequence)?
What do you mean by "character"? The drive letter?
native?  You compile to the microcode for your particular processor or the generic x86 instruction set?
@user303218: what's the range of val values? 0-255?
Can you explain your scenario better? Perhaps with an example?
You might want to make the title more specific.  For example, "How many generations of stars will exist before the universe's nuclear fuel is depleted?"
@shane87: How did you generate the managed type of the `photo` variable you are calling through? What is the IDL of the COM method?
but how?
where will i write the code snipt?
That is one looooooooong problem. Can you summarize it?
What do you mean by "will take an arbitrary number"? Do you think about some input (from user or file) or some other way?
What have you tried? Where exactly are you stuck?
I assume this is homework, yes? What have you tried so far?
I was under the impression that it was also more efficient (less air resistance in the ductwork).  Is that not the case?
What are you trying with
[Names init];  ????
What is your specific problem? How to transfer the data between pocket outlook and your application?
It's kind of like regexes. You start with one problem, who knows how many you'll end up with if you use Linq?
I didn't know that you had to use an email address instead of a username. When did that change?
you mean as if you'd print screen it ? or what?
Could you please clarify with an example? And are we doing your homework for you?
Did you manage to sort this out in the end and get the corners? Can you post your final code?
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I remember a nice theorem in one of Knuth's fascicles that said a boolean function is self-dual iff it can be expressed as the composition of majority functions. Has this observation been used in any algorithm for that problem?
and @pavium, if I just have to convert what I've got, do you know how I could do it in Ruby code? regex?
@FrustratedWithFormsDesigner: if it depends on the function, then the answer to the question is "no". At least, I interpret the question to mean, "is it true that for any two functions f, g, either f is O(g) or f is Big-Omega(g)?"
Is the question supposed to relate to programming (i.e. solve this using a program)?
@q0987 If that's the case, then you're leaving out some crucial information. Perhaps you could tell us why you think it's wrong as that might reveal what you left out in the question?
Sorry, let me be more clear - Is your router using 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, or a combination?  Does it broadcast at the 2.4GHz or 5.0GHz frequency?
can you clarify a bit. when you said 'I thought about adding some lists about science (500 users)...' are you talking about Following a list created by another Twitter user?
Are the objects with the same name, the same objects? Or do they differ in some other property?
I suspect that `'apt-get install libpq-dev` didn't work properly, as the 9.04 distro is no longer supported (too old). Can you run the `pg_config` command?
What is your first try? Why don't you think it's optimal, or where have you gotten stuck?
I'm not seeing a reason why it should be much slower then the 9 seconds. Can you provide a sample of the file you are reading?
What does the template end up rendering like as HTML?  Does it use display inline HTML5 style, or as an object, or is it referenced from an image tag?
I don't understand what's wrong with the standard C pre-processor. Can you clarify?
This looks useful. Please can you tell me more details about measuring the size of the saved box?
What is container? What is the number you get with `container.getWidth();`?
what have you tried? What did you find when you searched?
why doesn't `str(b)` work for you? What is the error message?
@Jennifer S Sorry, one more question: do you chop them before to sauté' them in a skillet ? Can I use olive oil as well ?
@sarnold It shows 
Number of input = 22936722 49.Can anyone rationalise this strangeness?
The real question is , what does First returns? Since Dictionnary uses hash values, First is first of what???
"on all complexity measures"? there's an O(1) space (if "10" is a constant), O(n^2) time algorithm, and an O(n) space and O(n) time algorithm, so which is better on all complexity measures?
What do you mean by "All rows are sorted, and all columns are sorted"?
for example, [1,4;2,3],how is that sorted according to your precondition?
Does it have to be exact, or is it also OK if e.g. 900 out of 1000 selected are among the closest 1000?
Are you only using T-SQL to access the data? In other words, will another language (such as VB or C#) be used at any point during the process?
I'd really like to know how to do this without a data plan.  An SMS autoresponder that replies with a google maps link to my latitude and longitude?
This feature is available on CM6.  Is it possible for you to upgrade?
ohh man it's messed up now. How do I add code to the comments??
@shodanex: The issue is likely to be specific to your particular hardware (or virtual machine), so you should describe it. Also, does the clock still drift if you turn “synchronize with internet” off?
I think the question is ambigious too. Did you get given an example set of files/directories to work against?
What have you tried yourself? Is it a homework/interview-question?
Just to clarify: Do you want your program to be notified of mouse click events so that it can act upon them, or do you want to inject mouse click events into the windowing system?  And what platform are you on (mac/*nix/Windows/etc)?
Any luck in figuring this one out?  Were any of the diagnostic steps in my answer useful?
Will k1,k2,k3 be 3,4,5 in all cases? or was that just an example?
Do you absolutely _have_ to concatenate? Can't you use parameters instead?
I am not familiar with the desired formatting. Could you please add an image of (or provide a link to) some example of what you want to achieve?
@DSchultz Tried adding the 'www' (no luck). How do I URL encode it?
Which views version are you using? Are you using the views-7.x-3.x-dev with the new UI?
According to the Microsoft KB ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974396 ) the PresentationHost.exe shouldn't depend on which version of IE you're using. Is your XBAP compiled to x86 or x64 (specifically)?
Thanks for the help, +1. Could you, please, specify, should I include the phrase "per the email..." before the salutation in the email or after it?
1. Could you please give us a small but complete example showing the problem. 2. Have you already tried replacing the float package by floatrow?
while that link is related things aren't quite the same in c++. For one thing isn't reference counting a lot more popular?
What language are you using?  What have you tried so far?
you can do this with a container that is positioned absolute/fixed with a width and height of 100%.  background can then be set to `background-position: center center` I think?
Huh? A downvote? What for?
Why are the results bad? Can you elaborate on what you did?
@karmicpuppet: No, but I notice that ImageBrush has Viewbox and Viewport properties. Should I try to set them manually?
have you tried any other patchlevel of 1.8.7 ? ruby-1.8.7-p352 for example ?
That's good news. Isn't there a Sherlock Holmes quote about how the answer to a mystery is never that something impossible has happened? :-)
Where is the object created? Is it created on the stack, on the heap, or is it a global variable?
BS of course you can. And I have tried Firebug....same fustration....cant get it to work either...want to teach me how to use it????
Another idea, looks like you are using `MBProgressHUD`, I guess your code is triggered from an animation callback, from memory, I think CoreData is not multi-threading safe. Try not to do this from `MBProgressHUD` or try using `performSelectorOnMainThread` maybe?
Track users? Keep statistics on what?
I'm a StatEt user, but I'm not aware of a debugger built into Statet.  Do you mean the debugging tools built into core R or some other aspect ?
all the paths from every node to every node or from the start to the end? and are there any cycles?
Do you mean it literally says "Unknown Sender?" Or the number is just unfamiliar to you?
There *is* no `RadioButtonList` control in WinForms. Which tag is correct?
@Thomas, could you provide any more detail about the "create a poly from overlapping triangles" method? (or should I start a new question?)
can you describe the problem with your first approach more clearly? what is the meaning of "elements with close statistical probability of selection" and "distant selection percentages"?
Thanks! Example of using breqn in my case please?
What exactly are you trying to do? Can you provide some sample data and expected output?
Sorry, what does "set your exposure such that that is 'properly exposed'" mean? Visually comparing the result of the camera with the colour of the card?
Is there any chance you could post some of the code, with an indication of where your break point is? Is it possible that the break point is in a non-executing code path (in an if/else block, etc)?
Do you really need to produce separate pdf files? Maybe the `\include` and `\includeonly` features would be enough for you?
@Mithun "*I must agree with you because there is a possibility that the asker may misunderstand the first phrase by insisting the context of what I explained for a situation where the context what you suggested would be needed*" - I asked this question without having any context at hand, I just happened to hear both phrases and wasn't sure if they meant the same thing. My main point here is this: Would you say "Bend your knees, please" to someone if you want him to squat down?
The code you've posted works fine for me.  Are you doing something like `get_simps(get_simps(20))`?
Have you tried upgrading using the tools provided with core? What errors have you encountered?
Gradient of a velocity vector? (Do you expect a rank-2 tensor?)
@freiheit: Thanks for the answer. Where can I get these items? Can I get some of them combined (whichever I want to have) or do I have to buy separately each of what I need?
I find your decision to put the deepest level element as value and all parents as key somewhat weird. How are you going to know what to take from the array - key or value?
Depends, where will you base the generated code on? Database, XML, Diagram?
agreed, but i am not seeing the checkbox. are you able to wiki-fy it? thx
miles per hour? really?
How is the complex number c given to the Turing machine?  Are you considering in terms of Turing machines over real/complex numbers?
Don't use the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol in inline event handler attributes; you're merely adding a useless JavaScript label there. Moreover, this should work as expected, what exactly does not work?
I have a small problem. When I tell Swatch to find my user name it returns an error "There was a problem with the request: Status code = 500" Any ideas?
What resolution? What do you consider low-cost?
Which part is inefficient? selecting an item from the table, or strings as keys?
Looks ok at first blush. I assume that <controller> and <action> are placeholders and you are really posting the proper values... Are you then actually following up with 103 bytes of data?
I want to mark this as the real answer to my question because I it is a "why" question but the spec does not mention anything abut Trash folders. Could you please explain how XDG spec affected the .Trash convention?
did you get it to work? how did you do it ?
* If the person doesn't know what time it is, but glances at the state of the bits, they should be able to deduce that the current time is within a certain range.
* The question you are posing is: What should be the on time / off time for each bit that would yield the min(max(deducible time range))?
What version of MATLAB are you using, and what version of MATLAB was current when the camera and MEX file were manufactured.

Has this ever worked before for you?
I am a bit confused. In the title you ask for a solution without locks and in the question you do want locking?
If there are duplicate items in the trees, should the duplicates be merged or not?  For example, if the trees are [1,2,3,4] and [1,2,5] should the result be [1,1,2,2,3,4,5] or [1,2,3,4,5]?
The meta topic you linked to is about Alcohol. What does that have to do with Lemonade?

Hi, thanks a lot for all your responses. I need the window the the maximum average value of x?
What's the problem with Gmail about privacy? The only issue I saw recently was Google Buzz but I'm not sure that affected the Google Apps accounts, did it?
@GoodEnough It's not about other people reading your mail but about giving Google all your data. You now, *Do be evil* (or how was their slogan?).
I have no idea what you mean, please describe your question better. What exactly are you doing, what is returned *where* and what would you expect?
That's a pretty simple way. Does it work?
Did you solve the other problem? The multiplication one?
As in my second comment...have you done some loggin to see where the application is hanging? Is the problem still the same if you don't run it from inside VS?
@Kavya: It should be `twisted` not `twistd`. Can you show the code that is throwing this error?

What's the point of subfeatures if you can't save them to a file? Is there some other format I can save that preserves subfeatures?
Your formatting makes it seem like your perl script actually calls each line in tick marks. Is that the way you're running it, or is it bad formatting?
Anyone? Any ideas?
This sounds like homework. Also, Lisp is built around recursion, why do you want to avoid it?
can you give a little more detail. Maybe paste the exact error message?
Can you post your declaration of the `share` property? Does it retain the value assigned?
seems fine in Chrome. How exactly does one reproduce the problem?
"ASDFG\SQLEXPRESS" looks correct.  Do you have a type-o in your question?
I'm suspecting a bad charger; most home screen I've used turns itself on when you just plugged the device in or plugged the device out, if a bad charger somehow causes the device to think that it had just been plugged off and/or plugged on, it could cause the symptoms you're having. Have you tried with a different charger and different wall socket?
What is in ExitListener.h? What happens if you insert the line `class ExitListener;` after the include statements?
Are you trying to create some type of tile system, or are you just wanting to draw different parts of the image at a time. What are you using it for?

DRM in eBooks is driving me mad.  Can we please please please hurry up the free market on this one?
The size of the summation sign might differ depending on your math font. Do you mean the computer modern \sum?
I never understand why people get annoyed at Python's required indenting. I *hope* you were going to indent your code anyway, right?
Thanks, Sorry I was meaning to say "past perfect" not "present past". And my question was asking about an explanation why they make sense, can you help with that?
The sum divided by 4 results in 6 minutes. How do you get 8 minutes?
I've reformatted your question. Is the table now correct?
What about 'Please use other paper'? Paper could be both plural and  non-plural but it's still grammatically correct I think?
Seems to work fine for me. What values are you passing to the method when it doesn't work?
Thanks for your answer, but i'm still not sure i understand. Would it be possible for you to provide any more pseudo code please?
Is there a performance requirement ? Should it be a fast method ?
ADT break encapsulation and hence do not exist in OOP. What is a Vulcan in Star Wars?
What does the java process do when you use kill -INT? Does it terminate, or keep running?

which instances of figure did you change (i.e. which lines)?
do you have to build queries to obtain results? SQL-style?
What's a `kill -9`? Can you explain your answer please?
In general, in questions like this it would be very useful to specify what kind of thesis you are supposed to write: For example, BSc, MSc, PhD, something else? In particular, are you expected to do new research or "just" organise existing knowledge?
I like your idea of relativ dimensions and positions. What didn't work well?
I think the key of your problem is "In some circumstances" meaning. In other words, can you give the exact steps that reproduce the problem?
do you want to send the 32bit number in binary form? or in ascii?
Please consider deleting your question or rephrasing it so we can answer with something useful for others. Can you link to where you got the linux 32bit drivers?
OK, so that works but out of interest, why? Why doesn't it store the number as 16.695 as was set?
What you want to read  from the URL? can you please explain ?
It would really help the many viewers of this question if you would edit it to be clear without having to follow links.  And what is DPAPT?
Guess that makes this community wiki. Don't you think?
@dan and sri, Sorry if this is too far from the original question, but is there a manner of linking (ie. the type of URL I use in my post) I can use to attempt to maintain the header (I'm *imagining* some `rel=` attribute to the effect of the capturing it), or does HTTPS always strip it out?
I'm going to say that this should probably be put on http://serverfault.com .  I believe you are wanting to set up Virtual Access Points?
@Praetorian: You had me into tears. I agree to you but is that going to help me with my question?
And then in addition to image tags and metadata, Lightroom stores a history of *edits* such as color tweaks, crops, and all that.  Where are those stored?
I'll never understand the alcohol thing.  Our brain is our livelihood, and so many of us spend so much time and money on products that poison it and decrease its effectiveness?
What do you mean by MobileMail? The Mail app on the iPhone?
@Silly Cow - another source of bitterness could be that your flour has gone rancid.  Do you experience bitterness problems with low sugar quick breads made using the same flour, or are you sure this is a yeast issue?
The normal way is: You startx on machineA, open xterm, ssh machineB, start there the applications you want which then run on machineB bit are displayed by machineA's xserver. Could you explain with more detail why this isn't sufficient for you and what you want to achieve instead?
Is this a homework? Have you tried to find out how to calculate Good Friday in general, independent of any programming language?
Also, that photo isn't showing up for me. Can anyone else see it?
Why is it important that there be two or more black holes? Is there something you expect to happen in those cases that wouldn't affect light that passes near a single, isolated black hole?
Also, there are two styles of dropouts on the Trek belt drives. Can you post a closeup photo of your rear cog and dropout?
Hi @OZ_ - can you educate me as to why? Is there a better way to store images?
I suspect some of your surface area suggestions might be right. Do you have an example of this we could critique?
Do you know how many pieces you have in total, in rows and in columns? Were they rotated?
I don't think this is a duplicate, mghie - JVNR seems to want to check if it ran as well, which I don't think that other SO question really addresses - and it's certainly not in the accepted answer.  Also, JVNR, I think you could edit the question title to be a bit clearer or help other people find the question - maybe mention "running" a Perl script, not "automate", and something about checking if it ran or not?
And another question about the question: What about the first people that are born, in particular the very first person, who are their parents? Do we just ignore that, and allow that each person has 0,1, or 2 parents?
This seems like a workable approach, but I don't see an actual question here. Are you asking how to make use of the result of your "direction" function to actually move an object?
There should be a reference table summary printed to the logcat log.  What's in it?
What is a bipartite graph, really? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph doesn't say the two node sets should have the same numbers of elements ... so one set can be just empty, is that also a bipartite graph?
Where's your public key token for the assembly?  Are you adding these manually to your config file or through the IDE?
15 boards per hour is four minutes per board.  How long does the PICkit 2 take to program your part?
I'd be surprised if the network is slowing you down that much...try those commands in the python window in ArcMap. Are they still slow?
Why community wiki? Isn't it expertise to show that you know a cool website dedicated to latex templates?
I'm sorry, but I can't understand what exactly you are looking for. What is your independent variable (the function), the dependent variables (the input values) and the parameters are?
Oh no! Is this related to the double roasted peppers from the salsa thread?
I'm not sure what you mean. The uploads will be public so you don't need to be logged in or anything, and the file checks can be done on the other servers after upload?
Windows has some of this functionality built in, [net send ...](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/net_send.mspx?mfr=true). Is windows-specific good enough?
Could you be a little be more specific. Where do you make the changes (in what project/module) and where don't you see them?
@Saurabh I don't think it is very clear. How is your group_name related to the child content?
@Colin why aren't they defined? Of course they are...or in which circumstances they aren't ?
What does "raw binary format" mean? The file is all ASCII 1s and 0s, with a new line in the file representing a new row of the matrix?
Similar to [this question](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1183/colons-and-semi-colons). Also, can someone with sufficient rep please add the "punctuation" tag?
If pin C0 floats HIGH and C1 is connected to AREF which is also HIGH, then there shouldn't be any change.  Did you try connecting C1 to ground to get zero when you run select_wire(1)?
@Aaronut Can't someone do this besides the OP? Don't we have some sort of mod people?

The "shaped bokeh" effect is a special case. Does http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/2706/what-is-bokeh-really answer your question?
you are not giving us **nearly** enough detail to answer your question. First things first - is this a top down game, isometric, side scrolling?
But the LoadWith - to my understanding should eliminate the lazy-load problem of serialization. What's more weird is that it's actually returned by a WCF service so It should already be serialized -right?

Boolean logic.  Does that apply?
Are they tied to specific users or just generic?  Are they grouped in any fashion?
If you stay at the CGI level _any_ language can be used for web development.  Anything in particular you need?
Sounds like a projection issue. Is the shapefile projected to a different coordinate system than you're used to using?
Might get better responses from Stack Overflow (http://www.stackoverflow.com/) - even though this applies to your games it's really programming. In the meantime... Can you not just put the DLLs in the same folder as your executable?
So who exactly is going to *teach* this topic in the class? Shouldn't the teacher be able to "show how it can be implemented"?
Also are you complete sold with VSFTPD? Or would you be interested in other types of FTP softwares like pureftp?

@Oli Because I believe that you're a troll, could you please not take part in any form in any of my future questions? Will you be able to respect my wish?

Is 'find . -name *.c' not simple enough?
@Trip: "I want to put an image on an element after a section which is some width. How can I do this?" :P
Where exactly are you stuck? What doesn't work?
How do you define optimal? How large are you data (is brute force an option)?
I've tried reading about them but most of the websites I've stumbled on don't really explain how one should actually use these. Do I just need a class which wraps my record header/data and then overloads << and >> to use these?
someone? anyone?
Ditto "look professional". What does that mean to you, exactly?
Solo, you really need to compare effective top tube length to truly understand the comparison. Make sense?
Have you tried connecting manually using telnet? If so what prompts do you get for username and password?
Define "same", i.e. do you mean = or == or something else?
I think the NVidia requirement alone makes that unacceptable for me, but if not, doesn;t Cude require compilation using nvcc command?  Or can I compile with MS VS 2005?
What have you tried so far?  Is this homework?
I have got a problem with your solution: the keys in your hashtable are not unique (if A[] = {1, 1, 1, 1} what is H ?). So how do you prove that H.get() is o(1) ?
The layout for this sample code seems incorrect: why do you have a larger gap between the second and the third columns? Shouldn't it be between the 3rd and 4th columns instead?
scheme is pretty easy to debug. What step does the stepper stop you at?
I'm sorry, but what is joejob? Or am I showing my ignorance?
It's not so clear here. You want to know how to use gcc to compile C program?
I couldn't understand what you were really asking until I read the answers; I take it that `midiIn.listPorts()` is not the part that actually "re-checks the ports", despite the name. I'm also confused when you describe `midiIn` as a "class object"; you do understand that classes define data types, and there is a separate `midiIn` for each instance of `foo`, right?
Could this be sublimed to something that is best described as a development manifesto? Is that what we should, essentially, be looking for?
I've had similar problems. Are you using any extension?
What do you know about the error in the two positions?  Do you have an explicit distribution, or just an error term?
Were you ill for that seminar?  Maybe ask your lecturer/prof?
I'm assuming that you want to delete the email messages on the non-Gmail account. Which email provider are you using?
@Mikle - This question is too open-ended. Can you please narrow it down, as per zenbike and Daniel's comments?
Voting to close as off-topic. This is a nice theme for sci-fi discussion but did you honestly believe anyone could answer this with *physics*? :-)
Yes, your description is correct at a general level. Is there something about that description which doesn't make sense to you?
What is the typical number of nurses required per shift?  How many days will you typically schedule for?
If I have a simple graph (tree) with 4 nodes: a start node with 3 successors, where rightmost successor is an end node, then all three algorithms (DFS, BFS, ID) will perform better backward than forward. Correct?
The specification of the problem is not clear. Why doesn't the whole space above `B` (the whole first row of `A`'s) constitute a rectangle but the whole space to the left (the resulting `C` rectangle) does?
I could make this work by defining the exact height and width of the "viewport": `<fo:external-graphic height="29.7cm" width="21cm" content-height="scale-down-to-fit" content-width="scale-down-to-fit" src="..."/>`. Can anybody explain to me why I apparently have to define that in my case?
This is argumentative. Are these kind of questions permitted?
"What's the best" is impossible to answer, as it implies subjectivity rather than objectivity. You'd be best asking (in the future) the question as "Given my situation (x), what's the recommended (y)?"
I agree this is subjective, but on the other hand I think this is a good topic to talk about. Perhaps if we elaborate a bit on the "why" part in the answers, it might be generally useful enough?
by "without a public facing server" do you mean the kml *has* to be on the local machine, or that you don't want to have to bother with installing/configuring/buying a public website? And, does the custom map you want to make need to be seen by others or just you?
Do you mean multiple categories of blogs?  Or multiple discrete blogs like CNN's blog site?
one other question. Would I still need to install mercurial on the remote server over SSH?
Variables should be extremely common, so why do you have to modify the most common with a $? Shouldn't something else get the $?
Could you please give me a reference, that 95% should lie between -1.96;1.96 . In other words, why should standardized residuals be $d_i\sim N(0,1)$?

The best case would be if the list were already sorted but I don't think that's what you're asking. Could you be more specific?
What do you mean by "how to charge"? Are you asking how much money to charge or how to implement an ad service and payment gateway?
can you clarify - do you have a time with timezone as input, and want time and different timezone as output?  Or is the input time GMT?
Wait, my previous comment may have been jumping the gun... What is it you're trying to do? Get access to someone else's record, or go for the bigger SQL Injection vulnerability there?
Wow, that thing looks awesome!  Is it quick/easy to attach?
Why do you need to do this? Why is having the row id sequential important and necessary?
I think I might know how you could test to see if there's even a path between start and end, but don't know (at least not yet) how to calculate the least number of circles to remove. Would this be at all useful?
It does seem a bit weird. You weren't doing it on a secondary thread by any chance?
@Jason: You're a harsh man. Millions of people also disagree it seems - go watch the show?
It's not very clear what you need, since TeX adds automatically `\hfill` at the end of a paragraph. Would you please add a "real life" example?
@Alexander I did not understand your last comment. Why can't you store positions?
It's unclear how "regression" could be invoked in a *univariate* dataset.  Also, exactly what distinction are you suggesting between the two bulleted methods?
The answers to the referenced question include two completely different ways of using Robot. Which did you profile?

"above code is not working" isn't very descriptive. What happens when you try it?
Please clarify your problem. Are you looking for some P2P solution, or want to play with the IP header?
Seems like a roundabout way to get an address structure to me. Why not just pass "2a00:1450:8006::68" to `getaddrinfo`?
You probably want to use your package manager, which depends on your distro. Which are you using?
"Google says they generally don't like pages with more than 100 links on them" -- out of curiosity what is your source on this? can you cite it in the post in a hyperlink?
Why do your tuples need to duplicate the index? Is `lines` not what you want?

Can you please describe in more detail what you mean with "inclined"? Should the line go from the upper corner of a cell to the bottom opposite corner of the same cell, or should it cross several cells?
Your edit makes parsenome's answer seem redundant. A bit unfair, no?
It may help folks zero in on your problem if you can point out which is line 77 in your source.  Maybe an end-of-line comment like "//dies here"?
You wouldn't be allowed to ask and post comments if you were not logged in. What kind of programmer are you?
How long does your regression test take to complete?  Surely it should be based on this?
Huh, language agnostic God objects. Ironic?
Why do you want to cook fish for someone who doesn't like it?  Why not just give her something else?
If it is always complete using numbers from 1..N you could just write the values 1..N to the input array.  So I'm guessing thats not going to cut it?
Are you really stuck specifically on radiator heating, or more just on hot water heat vs. forced air?
Does your log statement for the jobViewArray count in the notification show what you would expect? is jobViewArray a property?
This is most likely OS specific. Which operating system are you using?
@Chad now that I've eaten lunch, beer does sound better than bugs.  Any suggestions for a location?
i have edited my question.Can you elaborate on the triangle mesh concept,please? Or provide links to articles for the same?
Do you have problem with it? Does it work?
Could you tell which packages you have already tried? Would something like a long table, where you type each paragraph into a cell, be useful to you?
Is it popular open source web application? Can we know the name of open source?
@abeln - what inputs are you talking about ? Can you think of one set of inputs where the 2nd one will be better ?
Are you asking for a tool that does this? Or an idea how to do this in python?
What programming language does this regard? Could you elaborate on "Get the same parts between"?
Maybe I'm confused... isn't POD (perlpod) extra formatting?  Or can it work without adding *anything* to the existing code?
I had some issues that where solved by making sure that garbage collection don't remove objects that are sharing state between COM object. You could try making some of the variables static and release those after you finishing the whole operation?
Sorry. But, what is "Sym" button?
+1 timely question, but you might clarify "practical in the real world within the next two years": it exists, can be used for many of the tasks that perl5 is useful for, has lots of nice improvements (rules being my favourite), and does look on track for release in tha time.  So what's your threshold?
In the project settings under the web tab is it correctly set to use local IIS web server? Also did you build immediately before attempting to attach?
Also, does it have to be a hard disc? Could it be flash memory instead?
this is not merging, this is sorting. BTW what are those objects (a1 b1 ...) string?
Could you, please, point us to a correct calculation? ... in "as if" case?
@marknt15: Sounds like a poor design to mix "arbitrary XML-like tags" with real HTML. Where are you putting this text, that the HTML is dangerous but the arbitrary tags are not?
You mentioned OWASP, but not their [Web Application Firewall](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Firewall). Is there anything you'd like to do that isn't handled by the WAFs listed on that page?
I don't really know the answer to this, but have you considered lowering the quality or decreasing the size of the image yourself?  Maybe take the UIImage from the camera delegate event, scale it down and then save using UIImageJPEGRepresentation with a lower quality setting?
Thanks for your answer. Could you expand on what 2 hot wires are? Does that mean 2 live wires?
Isn't Scotland part of Britain? What would you call their variant of English?
+1 Cool, I think I have been invited to an event through this a very long time ago. Could you please make the link an actual link to the site and edit your answer to show anyvite measures up to the requirements?
@High Performance Mark, as far as I understand the pseudo code describes a path searching algorithm... so I'm trying to write a program that finds a Hamiltonian Path using the logic of the "DNA Algorithm." Am I on the wrong *track* here?
@damonokz Sorry maybe I misunderstood something but you said "Anyway, its a relief that somebody understands the situation". So the guys here who are trying to answer your question and spending their own time don't understand the situation?
Many languages can do this in their standar libraries. Any prefered language or do you want a "pure" algorithm?
Define *"complexity of a nested binary search tree"*.  For that matter, define *"nested binary search tree"* (do you mean subtree?)
A background image for what? How is the image being used?
Do all the points make up a single pattern? Or are you looking for multiple patterns in the same list of points?
Were you able to find a solution to this, Jrutter? Perhaps upvote or select an answer as correct?
I also want to know about this. How can I get notified when there is a reply to this question ?
It doesn't look like a Rails method. Perhaps some gem or plugin that does this?
Where is the question? What did you do, and what error did you get?
I am not sure what you are trying to achieve. Is it a non-convex hull that represents the shape of the point-cloud better than a convex one?
What does the repayment amount depend on? How is it calculated?
How are you measuring variation between paths? Via weights assigned to the edges or by the number of edges two paths have in common, or neither?
probably is recessed lighting.  is this the style of lighting you are referring to http://www.google.com/images?q=recessed%20lighting&safe=on&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1408&bih=800 ?
Changed tag to "copyright". Was there a specific tag you were looking to use?
I tried to edit this as best as I could, but I'm still really confused as to what you were asking. Could you please clarify the intention of this question?
I generally use evince which updates whenever the file has changed (also I generally compile directly to pdf). Maybe it is possible to configure xdvi so that it watches for file changes?
I have strict and warning set, but I when I run the script works fine but either gives a blank CSV as output or just re-prints the original. Am I missing something incredibly obvious here?
What is the problem? To identify the liars?
Wouldn't the time complexity depend on the type of tree? Could you elaborate on that point?
What's the purpose of this? How do you want to use them?
That it prints all `indent1` s for the first `tableheader` node is obvious as all following `indent1` s are siblings of this node. Can you please provide the exact output?
You've already said that you're using JPEG2000, which will work.  What do you have a question about?
My god, the code got all mangled. The insert code capability here is atrocious, just mangles the code and leaves out tags... How do I fix this?
Show some code. How to you show the csv file?
I think for #1 for sequential search the number is (n+1)/2.  Is that right?
You mean pick an arbitrary point along the edge of a shape, then place 4 more points, each 1/5 of the total perimeter from the last? Or by points do you mean vertices?
If I have been correctly informed, some languages support the construct `break N` where `N` is the number of nested loops to break out from. Am I right?
@Jen sorry to be patronising. Are you confusing *square numbers*  (numbers raised to the power of two) and *powers of two*?
How large is the file, would it fit into memory. How do you separate the emails within the file?
That is an interesting problem, but would be time consuming and costly to determine every possible result.  Why not create a buffer?
So you're basically looking for the intersection between two non-axis-aligned rectangles?  (Or, if they collide at all?)
Accepted! @Rory, one more thing - can you add a line about using the *right* hashing algorithms?
Some otherwise useless kitchen gadgets might have other valid uses.  I never use a garlic press (just another thing to clean, when I can crush it with the side of my knife), but they can make play-doh hair (or really small noodles?)
i want to insert data whole data of array into vector of a map without using for loops. is it possible to push back data set into vector of map?
Are those dimensions static that we see in your CSS? Are image dimensions also static so you know how big it is?
Also, I think it might not happen with all applications. Can you please use Banshee as the app we're testing with?
Maybe you are using an extremely old version of jQuery or the script is built weirdly. Are you getting any error messages?
Ok, now you got me. Where do I get the stack trace?
What are you programming on, where 16MB is too much? A phone?
Thank you, I will give this a try tomorrow but could you please explain how to do different validations. For example validating for an correct email address, validating that there are no more than or at least XX characters, that a form field is filled out... things like that?
Can you start X?  What resolutions do you have available?
I have seen 'webform-revisions' module, but it solves nothing to me. Have you got that functionality working?
To clarify - the retain count is 1 after initWithNibName and 4 after pushViewController...

Any ideas?
@brian, you cannot mark community wiki. Do you have a specific answer that you are looking for?
Any algorithm or algorithms in computational geometry? Also, is this homework?
Could you provide more details , the summary of that question seems to be that special characters are ignored in google search which applies to this case. Is this the start of an expression ?
Can you add some sample code here?  What is the type of the exception being unhandled?
@lev: sorry, i didn't notice we are oscillating. You are asking whether $O(n^3)$ is a lowerbound on the complexity of E.D., so this is a question on the complexity of a problem, doesn't this make it a [complexity](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tags/cc.complexity-theory/info) question?
You speak about a windows application, but used asp.net in your tags.  Which one is correct ?
I don't understand what your question is. Where are you stuck?
**@Karel** Can you expand on your comment about diffraction, perhaps as an answer? Why would the 7D differ in this respect to any other camera body - isn't all the glass in the lens?
For a single one-off script, for a web project (e.g. Rails, Sinatra, or other) or are you creating utility code that you want available for many scripts?
I let it accepted for the computation but it seems the link is not the good one as they're not talking about levels in this thread. Could you check please?
Sorry if this is a stupid question. Is the output exactly `<%= debug @articles %>` or is the output actually a yaml formated object?
Are those regexps? Otherwise you should probably use `str_replace` instead and see if that works better?
What is offensive in that question? And why is it downvoted?
I don't think it needs the Homework tag, as even though this is homework, the question and answer would be the same regardless of the source. Do other people have to tag their questions in regards to their current occupation on the project?
As far as I am aware you should be able to do this.  Did you receive any error message?
Check your references, do you have a reference to the output of the project, ie. a "reference to itself"?
It will show whichever class library you had selected as "Set as Startup Project", won't it? Did you mean "How can I select which *usercontrol* the testcontainer will show"?
Can you share some information about what does not work? What are you expecting that to do?
Can you please give us some additional information on your hardware/setup? Do you have data that need rescue?
What about invalid states (e.g. all Os or both sides with 3-in-a-row)?
You can use it quickly cut a straight cut on a 2x4 with a circular saw.  Any other uses?
You'll need to store something server-side. And I don't get what 'stand-alone' means in this case, how will it access the URL then?
I am not sure a staggered array is a way to go here, what if you need to do something like `{}_3 F_2\left(\begin{matrix}a-b+1& &b+a-1& &c+d-1\\&d-a+1& &e+d-b-1&\end{matrix}\middle;z\right)`, even if you make the the array tighter, there will still be a lot of space left.  How about something like this: `{}_3 F_2\left(\begin{matrix}a\quad b\quad c\\d\quad e\end{matrix}\middle;z\right)`?
I cannot see a problem with this. Do you get a completely blank cell of a missing image icon?
Interesting! What is the cider vinegar supposed to do?
Setting to "no color" works. Area there any issues with this technique?
Can you describe *awkward result* a bit more detailed? Also, how many images to you have?
What type is 'ch'?  Should it be a signed character?
What benefit will you gain if we do your homework for you? Why don't you do it yourself?
@Peter Shor: Of course.  Doesn't everyone?
Sorry for the late reply,I have taken view based template.Actually I need to convert the pdf page to image and in that process it's giving me error with the code above. Any solution?
convert it to float?  Catch the error and report to the user?
Can the polygon be self-intersecting? For example: (0, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0)?
Thanks a lot steve, I'm trying to implement the pseudo-code line by line very carefully, there is an extended pseudo-code that's written more clearly here: http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-0430102-111906/unrestricted/corourke.pdf  on page 27, I'm coding that carefully and i'm testing it with some sample answers given by NTRU, I think i'm also getting held back in understanding the pseudo-code, in my code I gave a fixed length and set of values to the polynomial f, and the infinite loop on 8-31 never ended, thanks for pointing out that f is a variable. Any more tricks to watch out for?
what value is imgRepGetCache? is it null?
When you call the C++ program by itself, does it return the desired output? I.e., `./PyTest Hello, world!` returns `Hello, world!`?
Are you looking for a total ordering? or just an ordering?
Can you please clarify your question so it's clear what you're asking for. Do you want examples of functional and non-functional requirements in the problem specification?
What is the problem? Does the timer continue to count down?
I don't know how generic you need this, but do you need to be wary of more than one where clause, e.g. in a subquery?
question is unclear. perhaps including an example will help?
What kind of processing will you perform?  Is it just a matter of setting up data structures to model a family tree?
Is there anything else about your system you'd like to tell us? for example, which OS?
@BlueRaja: the distance function is only part of the problem. How do you pick the colors from the color space so that the distance between them is maximal?
"invertHash", I suppose. But honestly, why does it matter what you name your own functions?
Why design a config file syntax that is very difficult to parse? Why not just set the relevant bash variables and source it?
It seems that this is not possible.  Are there any Intellij folks on StackOverflow?
You're probably trying to optimize the wrong thing. I'm wondering why you think this particular part of the language is so important?
@Sriram : yup I will think of it on a small scale first ..then perhaps later will look into the bigger picture :-) ..thanks for ur suggestions !! :-)  so what do u feel hw should one get started with this ?
What is this line graph that you mention? Are you saying that the smaller graph is always a simple path?
Can you be more precise about what exactly the system needs to achieve? Something like "Given X initial data, output Y"?
Do you want to check if it looks ok ? Do you want to check if the file exists ?
Sorry about that, clicked on that box without thinking.  Can I remove that status at this point though?
I hadn't heard of this. Googling suggested it's something to do with 3GPP?
Is the asterisk really an asterisk in the source code? Or just a wildcard?
Is the server side going to be written in Java or Python? Will a simple database on the server suffice or do you need to perform much game logic?
What's the benefit of the horizontal dropout? Is it safety? Is it just a style? Is it ease of maintenance?
What is it trying to do? What happens instead?
+1 Didn't know that about coated materials, do you know if the coating comes off in that situation or is it ruined and just stays on?
I'm sorry, but I do feel that this is *way* off-topic for a [programming/scripting website](http://stackoverflow.com/faq/). Perhaps [Super User](http://superuser.com/) might be a better fit; or [Doctype](http://doctype.com/)?
I'm confused: shouldn't the temperature of olive oil be lower than the one of sunflower or peanut oil?
Can you provide your own application (even a small one), or is it only web based? Also, is it acceptable to popup  user/password dialogs?
@Vor: Isn't this the same as asking "Which problems can be polynomial-time Turing reduces to integer factorization?" Or did you intend to ask something else?
I know what KMP stands for but not BM. Would you mind writing down what each of them stands for, in case others don't know?
That's an odd dimension for the height.  You're sure it's not 80"?
I guess it's kind of an obvious suggestion, but... Have you tried kohlrabi?
I'm not sure why you felt the need to make this question CW.  Do you see the question requiring collaborative effort from the community?
I'd have thought that was OK, although presumably you're using composite out as it predates HDMI? What "trouble with the install" are you having?
I'm still confused, unfortunately. Specifically, what could I do if I wanted to read the third line, for example?
(1) Thanks for the explanation that the verb “section” here is indeed an abbreviation.  (2) Can you please fix the link to “Blog”?
4 bytes will only limit the keys if you're actually trying to uniquely encode the VIN into the 4 bytes. Do you *need* uniqueness?
Maybe a filesystem issue ? I mean no free space, security issue ?
Can you specify "sometimes"? When does it work and when not?
Thanks Tom! Still getting 'broken/missing handler' errors when adding filters though... Any ideas?
What is not working? The speed or any of it?
Must it be dependent? Is GuiceFilter dependent on the container?
Mtrombley--you said you got a solution. Can you post it?
Could you please be a little more specific? Are you wanting to update from the Ubuntu terminal, or are you looking to make some update to the terminal itself?
if i'm not mistaken, this goes on the front, right?
Do the stream auto-close when it is deallocated? If not, does it affect the battery life?
I know, but your question implied that you have conductive tape and want to know if it is conductive. Another good question might be, Is there a conductive tape product and then have details in the question about what you need specifically?
@jleedev - I found the same thing (both in Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby Enterprise 1.8.7).  irb's great, but if you run the exact same commands from a file...  Do you think it's a bug in the Ruby implementation (REE mostly just redid the garbage collector)?
Ultimately, **every** file is represented using `0` and `1` only. What makes a "bitmap index" different?
I use the [full-size version](http://training.perl.com/scripts/rename) of the rename script everyday.  Why in the world would you *not* want to use existing code?
I notice that spell checkers complain if you don't capitalize Internet. Didn't yours?
Nice close shot, but almost too minimalist... Now I and James Barrie can't agree if this is the inside or the outside of the wok. Can you throw some light on the matter?
Your question is unclear. Could you please edit the question to more fully describe what you are trying to accomplish and what your different scenarios are?
The link here in your question is giving me a database error; did you paste it incorrectly? Also, if you solved it, could you please post your solution here as an answer? :)
Did the interviewer say _what_ he didn't like about your response?  Also, what in particular about your algorithm seems naive to you?
That the requirements are wrong?  (and the code right?)
And what you want to have after adding the kernel? Do you want a working OS that you can boot from?
You seem to have typed a small "x" in the modeline (`1360x1020`), but a capital "X" in `xrandr --addmode`.  Is this just a copy/paste error?
It seems like this area of the photo is out of focus, in which case the only fix is to bring it into focus. Does this also happen in focused areas?
hi Gabe what is your reason to activate the USB Debug with fastboot? why don't use Settings > Application settings > Development > USB debugging???
How exactly should the effect look like? Fading out at the borders or something similar?
Your problem is a little ambiguous. Could you provide sample output with the related database records?
Can you expand upon "my app screws up?".  What are you able to observe is happening?
@John, if so, bugger! I am still ranked well, I wonder if or when I will drop?
What does the label actually show? Are you sure you are setting the value *before* accesing it?
Are you sure we don't know anything else about these elements?  Do we even know if they are numbers or could they be arbitrary elements?
No, just a general question. However could you please answer it in context of patents too?
how to use drush? or database?
please help me more...?
Is your air conditioning running all day and not able to get the house temperature down to 78F?  Or is it on and off (like normal expected operation) all day long?
Try to phrase the question in language-neutral terms: how would you go about implementing a function that received a X and did Y to it? What is the merit of the FlyWeight pattern and could you sketch an implementation in C?
Do you just want to decrease the width of the image and that those 5px aren't visible anymore? Or do you want it to make it 5pixels less wide and resize to the new image size?
In general, the first field on a line can be empty, in which case it could start with a comma.  So, how do you know when the lines need to be combined?
No this is security. (what would server fault have to do with injection?)
What is the `^` symbol? Is it **XOR** (programming notation) or **to the power** (mathematical notation)?
Agreed. Can you tell at a higher level what you're trying to do?
I wonder why this is not possible by default, probably because the categories usage didn't need that in the past. Have you considered to add a feature request in [wordpress trac](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/)?
@hakre: I don't agree with the tag you added, `[work-for-free-for-me]`. I don't want to remove it without discussing it, so could you please explain the reason why you added this tag and what it adds to the question?
Do you want to do this search once or many times per page? I.e. how efficient does it need to be?
It's good that you stated your reasoning, but it would be even better if you could isolate the difficult ideas and ask a conceptual question rather than restating your homework.  For example, "What forces act on a ball that rolls without slipping, and what are their relative magnitudes?
By running, do you mean working? Or are you trying to upgrade php without taking the webserver down?
@D.W. if thats the case, as I thought, it's not really a security question, is it?
Your shortcode definition is `frame_left`, code examples use `frame_right`. Can I assume you have `frame_right` shortcode defined in same way?
1. Need table definition, data in the tables, etc 2. What have you tried so far?
@Michael: What purpose does this serve besides being a list of milk? If it's just a list of milk, is that really useful?
@Patric are you willing to share your implementation? And did you actually implemented them "word by word" from this particular book?
Maybe it's necessary to phrase this another way: is there any food that *everybody* can eat?
Have you tried reading the source? Or even asking Mark directly?
Sorry I figured the random characters in the receiving end of the socket gave it away. Why is the system receiving 94/64/and 7's (ascii decimal converted from ascii characters) and how can i fix it?
It doesn't increase exponentially (a^x); it increases quadratically (x^2).  Can you correct the title?
excuse me ? - class ?
I have updated question. Can you please look at it?
Have you made sure that these calculations take place in code that is executed often enough to cause a performance impact?  Or do I have to post the micro-optimization lecture again?
It looks as though the value of the `name` property is getting hosed in your `Subject` class. Is the value retained properly?
Can you tell me if there are _any_ other constraints?  Like a finite set of possible values?
What process are you starting? is it yours as well?
Even with big arrays, loops should not take much time. What's taking time I guess is comparing objects... Could you be more specific?
You're trying to call a JS function inside of an iframe? Am I understanding correctly?
This is currently used, com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.impl.XMLStreamReaderImpl. Is there a better one which I should be switching to?
Are you trying to print the possible ways to express your number as a sum? You know there are an infinite number of ways to do that, right?
Are you looking only for a count, or are you interested in an algorithm that could also potentially print the permutations? In any case, how efficient must this be?
Could you expand on what doesn't work? Is there an error, etc?
What Rake task are you trying to invoke? Is it one that you've written yourself?
You say that "it's no longer working", what have you changed? Does your `runcode2.rb` start with `#!/usr/bin/ruby` or something similar?
did you finally resolve your problem? did you file a bug-report?
Agreed, show us what you have and seek clarification on the hard parts. You won't get far asking people to do your homework for you (how would you learn?)
Also, can you please elaborate what you mean with "whenever I install some opengl related packages". Like which one?
I have no libGL.so(.1) in `/usr/lib` - only in `/usr/lib/mesa` and `/usr/lib/nvidia-current`. Can you please add the output of `update-alternatives --display gl_conf` and `ls -al /etc/alternatives/gl_conf` to your question?
@bbum - I'm not using isKindOfClass in the code above. Would you care to share the "easy way"?
I don't think it's just that "if I was" *can* be valid for the past -- "If I were wrong, please forgive me" sounds totally ungrammatical to me. (Am I alone in this...?)
What language are you trying to do this in? What have you tried?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/546505/calculating-future-occurences-of-friday-the-13th . And perhaps this fits better at Code Golf?
as far as I can remember Eclipse can generate the WSDL. What editor are you using?
You are getting an output `"     
     "`? (quotes containing a newline)?
There's no reason why any `img` tags loaded from the url at `$(this).attr('href')` shouldn't load the image. Do you get any errors in your error console (or JavaScript console, depending on browser)?
Sorry, can you explain your problem a bit better? Do you want to upload a wordfile to your media library and the footnotes of the .doc file were stripped out or do you want to upload a .doc file, extract the content and make a wordpress post out of it?
You say you declare `class myApps`, you go and declare `class myClass`, and in the other file you declare `class MyClass`. Is this the exact code that causes you the problem?
Do you mind also explaining why bikes have this feature?
It's not obvious to me that there is sufficient information to solve the problem.  How do we know that the answer does not depend on the particular way in which the child crawls?
sorry, but do not have the time to change all. Any way I can rotate only on of the tables?
Would you please make the question more clear? Do you want `\BRallowhypbch` activated when you set `\emergencystretch`?
The hash is used (often) to capture state, while a URL (as its [definition suggests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)) is for **identifying a resource**. So again, why would you push a non-existent url into the browser's history?
can you post an example for "language fieldset" on user-edit page, please?

I've created mymodule.module and pasted your code above, what to write in // Change $form array to alter form components? :)
It's not that I don't like to use `memoir` commands -- it's that I don't know what they are in the first place. =) Could you please extend your answer to include the code which produces the same result but uses only `memoir` commands?
I don't understand.  That call stack is all about the Debug Help Library; is this only happening when it is being debugged?
Have you ever been able to connect to a WLAN at all? Or did you never succeed?
What's your platform? FPGA or microcontroller?
GPRS? Do you mean GPS?
... since your're quoting something, mind sharing what you're quoting? A homework assignment perhaps?
alternative being things like skype? or many mainstream messenger client?
So currently, you're on 3.1.2, correct? When you downgraded, did you use a stock firmware, or did you just put the redsn0w image on there right away?
I think you have a point - but are these dishes popular with Indians because they are easily identified as vegetarian?
Just iterating.  Though I'm curious, what would be the difference in approach?
It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish. Do you have a user, entering a name and address, and you are going to show him all similar addresses to let him choose one manually, or are you going to group all Persons with similar addresses automatically together?
*"Use a JavaScript literal."* Huh?
@prp, regarding the edit, so you want after the first iteration and removal, to remove the new adjacent pairs that occur now? and continue that until no adjacent-pairs are left?
There is no answer without a specific question -- how is your code not working? What does the data look like that is being parsed by `split`?
Why did you edit out my 'Hi', and 'Thanks'? Is common courtesy not allowed any more?
Does the device have an accelerometer? Otherwise, couldn't you filter out jumps between points that would imply that the device has moved insanely fast?
You say sorted but your example isn't sorted using normal lexical ordering. Is this a mistake?
@omri yes you are right... I have applied the logic acc. to what I thought is right if somebody could tell me what's wrong I have done ?????
I'm sorry, but I find your question hard to understand. Could you perhaps add a picture or an example?
@ring0: Good idea ! Is there a way to do so ?
show some code ? what u mean not work ?
Bump. Anyone have any idea on this?
So the new account is for you to use? Or for the other person?
@Brendan personally I would tell your Host that CentOS 4.8 is not an option and you must have 5.0, generally speaking it's a giant no no for a host to change your version on you like that, esp if you have CLI access which usually means you're dedicated or VPS, they need to put you on the proper version. Outside of that would Mercurial or Git serve  your purposes?
This question isn't really on topic, in my view. It also might induce a holy war, along the lines of "vi or emacs?"
Adding window.id didn't help the issue. What is strange is that testing this as a file works fine even in Safari, testing it on a server (localhost or remote) it does not work which leads me to believe it's some sort of security 'feature' ?
Which version of Perl? Is it a system Perl?
What is on the other 9 pages? Are they blank?
What is the purpose of knowing if they are using the computer or not? What happens if they are not?
Could you post a small example code showing exactly which space do you want to reduce? Also which environment are you trying to redefine?
@Christoffer Hammarstrm: http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~kshedden/Courses/Stat545/Notes/AffxFileFormats/cel.html -- though in there specs I do not see the data I'm seeing in the file; that being the barcode. Why do you ask?
Aren't those that you listed sufficient? What are you looking for?
Mikael: so it's editor issue? i should change mode in kwrite or something?
Why are you using jQuery and not css? `.thumb:hover { border: 1px solid #000 }`?
That's odd that only certain notifications fire.  How are you setting up the observers?
Harmless for them? Or harmless for you when they come find their revenge?
Andy, that jars with my understanding of what a Sylvester matrix is. Do you have a reference?
Step 1: acquire a piglet. (seriously, what's your geography?)
You question is very incoherent. Can you ask it more clearly?
You do realize this is an example? And that Ruby find this problem at RUNTIME?
Windows server supports tens of thousands of simultaneous connections.  Have you actually tried to reach this limit and verified that you had a problem?
Please be a bit more precise.  What language are you developing in?
"issues"?  What issues?
Did you try anything yet? Have some code?
Well, when you call `new Class();`, it returns a pointer to the location of that instance of the class. Is that what you are referring to?
Any reason for not using `print join '+', 1..3`? I mean it's golf, right?
Internet Explorer may cause that. Can you check IE permissions please?
Link? Is this homework?
The resulting table shouldn't have that primary key. What provider are you using?
Yes, I am using an "ancient" version: OS X 10.4.11 and XCode 2.5!  Is that the problem?
what is the meaning of point 3? how is it different from a simple axis?
Can you show a CSS URL that doesn't work? What happens when you open it in your browser?
If we have A:[1,2,3], B:[1,2,4] and C:[3,4,5]. Do we first merge A and B to [1,2,3,4] and then merge it with C (because A+B has 2 in common with C while neither A or B has 2 in common with C?
You can't imagine any circumstance in which you would need a simple front end to enter information into your db? Really?
More like an API to be used by a mobile device. Does it matter what kind of client uses the API?
Are you trying to create an advert that plays video (which you will then host through Doubleclick), or are you trying to create a video player with advertising on it? If the latter, what is the connection between the advertising and the video?
you're gonna need to explain what you mean a little better.  Is this even a programming question or are you trying to figure out how yahoo mail works?
Might i also add that enabling iPad features in an iPhone app target seems silly. Why don't you do it properly and make the iPhone app a universal binary (iPad+iPhone) ?
Why are you hashing these values? In other words, are you using the hash to speed lookups (as in a hash table) or are you trying to create an almost-unique digest value for each?
This is a bit off topic for Home Improvement. Have you tried contacting the company's customer support?
It gave me an error saying it couldn't load mymodule.helper, and prepending the filename with its absolute path fixed everything! Firstly, can you tell me what the 2>&1 does, and secondly, why does __DIR__ show the directory the file I'm trying to exec is in, but trying to exec it doesn't work?
This is set theory and takes some pretty interesting uses of SQL. What database are you using (Oracle, SQL Server)?
Can you detail what you're trying to distinguish between?  I presume that you're asking 'Can I tell if my script was run from the command line, or from another application I didn't write and have no control over'?
yes, just put all these lines inside your function and replace the actual values with the argument names. what's the problem ?
Wow! Tricky... and interesting. Do you need a method that works externally, or can all of the array fit comfortably in memory?
Can you post the benchmark code to see how you are measuring this?   Are you using -d:DProf?
This is probably more of a timing issue than anything else. Can you provide some information as to the actual application of this to whatever you're doing?
Any errors? what is in the debug console?
In your picture, with the green wire, I see the magnetic field and the current, but where is the force pointing? And now what I am confused about is if you now coil this wire up in the picture I have attached, where are the force lines pointing?
It looks like you get either wrong character widths or kerning values. Did you try disabling the kerning altogether to check if you get correct character widths this way?
Could you add a bit more context please? e.g. what R function and package are you using?
@Gabi: what is the point of having n greater than say 32 or 64 ? It seems like an arbitrary and unnecessary requirement ?
is PTString a property/field? And what does the console say?
So is `$x` not set at all earlier in a.pl? Do you know what the value of `$x` and `$ENV{$x}` are before the `system()` call?
In what way does the daemon act differently in those two scenarios?  Form the perspective of your daemon, how is a shutdown + startup different than a reboot?
If the zeros are not valid data, why are they in the vector to begin with?  If they are valid, why would you not want to StdDev to account for them?
The title of this post is really unclear, and has unnecessary shouting. Something like "Tool to visualize metadata from many photos?"
... and why `preg_match_all()`? Why not just `preg_match`?
A user bar is not specific to WordPress, it's a HTML element with some links, the bar here for example is actually just an element sat inside the header, with a background that gives the impression of a bar(nothing spectacular). Do you want an example of how to create a div with some links in it?
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear, I'm asking why it isn't something you can choose to do every time? What is the reason you can't do that?
@kraceKumar: i have another prob...the file writing here that is done row-wise skips a row as it writes into "myfile.csv". how can i make it not skip a line while writing?
'Buffering of video for multiple channels' sounds likely to be problematic - if you're saying that the client will receive all channels and show only one, in order that the user can switch between them quickly.  Did you try posting to Stack Overflow?
What are your compression options?  Do you need lossless compression when you split the image up into tiles?
So the problem is that it crashes when you click the checkWord button?  What is the exact error you get?
Is the crop operation cheap? If you already have the image on disk you could just pass the XML filename and the crop parameters into the .ashx as a query string and do the crop again in the .ashx?
Just make a Facebook account? I thought other sites would just offer it if they can, you can't really force them can you?
"doing math on the file as if it were one long number" sounds like a bad idea!  What method is this?
Firstly, I think we're gonna need to see some source for the page you're having problems with.  Secondly, have you tried a "View source" on the resulting page to see if there's anything else in there?
I was somewhat confused, but after a while thinking I agree that although requiring the same answer, the question is different. Is there somewhere a guideline to this?
What operating environment are you in? Is this jQuery, WinForms, QT?
You query is somehow confusing: the title asks for tables with a given width, but the description of the problem mentions column width. Can you please describe clearly and in more detail your intent?
It's great that you posted this answer. Can you please also accept it so that the system knows that the problem is solved?
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "square(ish)"? How squarish is "square(ish)"?
what devices do you want to connect to your phone? A keyboard would be nice huh?
Thank you, that's exactly what I needed. I'm not completely sure of what you mean when you talk about the overdispersion (sorry, I'm not a statistician, maybe it's something very basic)... You say that the residual deviance should be equal to the residual degrees of freedom... how would I check that?
What is your relation to these authors?  Are you writing a package, or editing a publication?
I'm confused by this sentence - "I'm looking for an algorithm that will simplify and smooth the polygon, (reducing the number of vertices) with the constraint that the resulting polygon must contain all the vertices of the detailed polygon.".  How do you reduce the number of vertices, yet retain them all?
It is not clear to me: are the independent (i.e. right hand side) variable continuous or discrete ?
In 1., is "as id" a valid grouping?  I.e. does the grouping have to preserve order?
Give us some requirements? How much data will you be sending and is the data only across a local computer, or is it across a network?
What I find confusing is the connection between the title of your question and the actual question. Can you explain?
can you say some more about why you need to synchronize your collection, i.e. does your Data members depend on each other or do you have some kind of logic which looks at all the members at once and cannot handle add or removes?
Not my question, but okay. Would you care to elaborate on this and  tell me what exactly is wrong?
Yes, that's right.  What's in do_search_selected()?
What happens when you move the mouse fast?  Does it skip pixels?
There is no need to swallow initial whitespaces of lines; they are ignored anyway. Can you please edit your answer accordingly?
I just have to ask.  Why is that outside?  And why don't you reroute it inside (the way it probably should be)?
Have you looked JavaScript libraries to manipulate SVG, e.g. d3.js: http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ or isn't that what you want?
How far have you gotten?  What kind of code have you written?
did you miss "word1 word3 word2" and some others combinations on purpose ? edit: ie do you mean combinations in the mathematical sense (that is to say, not a permutation)?
That works just fine when I try it.  What error are you getting?
I can't think of a good reason to legitimately remove a watermark.  Is there one?
how are they going to be used/accessed?  through a bespoke app or what?
Are you using annotations or a mapping file? PATH-TO-OPENJPA.jar, which jar are you pointing at?
Is "Windows" a good alternative to Wine? Is there a stable release yet?
@yossarian: Have you made this yet? How did it work out?
Sorry for inconvenience. try any help here is it an error?
An empty inbox?  What's that?
Huh I hadn't thought of that. That is strange isn't it?
Why 2 is not the answer? Do you need any number or the largest number or just found, not found will do?
It reminds me of [APL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29). Tell me how comfortable you would be using that as a programming language?
Server code is only obfuscating the real code : your HTML + CSS code. Could you please provide an URL or the HTML + CSS of the containing block?
I wanted to chide for writing that in an answer and not a comment, but I see that the rep needed to post comments has been increased (so that new user cannot immediately post comments). However, could you please add which answer you are referring to?
It strikes me that you're not really looking for an algorithm. What inputs will you provide, and what output do you expect to have after you perform the algorithm?
what do you mean by lock? you can't click on lock icon and enter your password to unlock it?
sorry guys, i actually don't really know what acceptance that you guys mentioned. Can you guys explain please?
@tjameson Ok, If I keep the `{10}` I should be able to ditch the `length != 10` right? or is it better not to?
In the one that works, you've got a space between the URL and `no-repeat`. What happens if you add a space between the URL and `no-repeat` in the ones that don't work?
@bvr @chambwez I think my code is working fine now :) My last question would be, is session handling possible in XMLRPC? How do I maintain a stateful transmission between the client and the server?
You try thinking of algorithms (either new ones or ones you know) that satisfy the constraint, discarding the ones that don't. :-) Do you have specific examples?
Can you clarify? Do you want a substring that's complement also occurs in the string?
Looks like homework. What did you try so far?
How is your image encoded in the JSON? Base64?
Yes, that is the real source code. And the compilation has been performed without optimization, perhaps that is the reason?
"Initrd requires at least one file system driver be compiled into the kernel".. I dint get much idea on this. Could you please explain this??
@polyg: As I mentioned below, I'm not an expert in Java.  Why are enums more powerful in Java than C++/C#?
lol, WHAT? sry not making fun of anyone but this is hilarious the way it is asked?
Is it acceptable to build an auxiliary data structure to guide the decision process?  Could that data structure have size O(n) of the original list?
That's great. How am I supposed to execute this project which requires multiple video clips playing on the screen?
Could you precise your idea please ? Which expression of weights should I consider ?
How are you doing your shared memory? With shm_open and mmap?
Is there a "trap street" or "Fictitious entry" in it? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street otherwise you can probably get away with violating any copywrite?
Please provide more information about what you've actually tried.  By "not efficient" do you imply that it takes too long, but still gets the correct result?
Yes, but is "getting away" with it the best choice? What about ethics in GIS?
Homework?  Because there doesn't seem to be any other remote possibility in my mind why any sane person would want to do this?
I do not understand. Do you like to show your view inside a UIScrollView (so it can go down or up together) or you like to set the frame when you rotate your device?
This is a fun question.  What kind of device are you hacking?
I don't see how thinking of raster as a specialised type of vector is helpful to understanding. Could you please elaborate on how this perspective has helped you?
Could you post the image, or part of it along with the colours you're trying to apply and what actually happens to the image? (is it the whole image that changes colour or just the colour you're applying that's wrong?)
What's in your MANIFEST.MF file? Does org.eventService.ProactiveClientEventLogger have a main() method?
Can you post the actual calls you're making (the types and their `ToString` implementations may be important). Also, your `RollingFileAppender` configuration and how often is "sometimes"?
I could swear that a similar question has been dealt with here, but I can't seem to find it.  Anyone able to?
Is it the only code or did you cut this out of a bigger context? If so: could it be that in the bigger context one of your variables is shadowed by a local?
How exactly have you set its height?  Have you implemented heightForRowAtIndexPath?
Can you modify the source code of the objects class? IAW, can you make that class observable or do we need a separate Observer for that object?
@Daniel: Can't reproduce with Windows 7 `cmd.exe`, and I don't remember a ever using a text-only (no curses or anything) command line application that reacts on ESC. Perhaps some shells pass ESC one (but what character code would that be?).
and @Nico: Have you tried my solution? Did it fix  the problem?
Have you tried doing a whois? Can you give us a sample URL?
Thanks for the info! Did you need to do anything special to get theme preprocess hooks working?
Splitting the figure is likely to look very bad (unless you're writing a book and you have a figure that goes across facing pages like in the FAQ answer Lev Bishop mentioned). Why don't you let the figure float?
There's no apparent reason for the warnings to be caused by the `\cite` commands. Can you please add the exact warning message that you are getting?
Have you tried creating a symlink? Or changing the base url in your settings.php file?
The file was indeed locked. Could you please expand on how to identify the uchg flag in the ls output?
how is your data formatted for insertion i.e. what structure are keys and $val stored in?
thanks dana-- that's really great! any way to add a slider to control zoom level?
What are you doing with the XML? Reason I ask is this, instead of wrapping the XML library and exposing wrapper classes to your code, why don't you implement a simpler object model for what you are storing in the XML and expose that - then have a clean interface which can persist/extract that object model from the XML?
I don't see any inherent problem with what you have done above, and it looks like no one else sees anything, either; can you post more code?   How certain are you that the setfault happens at that particular waitall?
I don't have a 5770 but I do have a 5870. Is it of any value for me to test that out for you?
And the result of your first action is return in your second action ? Why don't do a redirection ?
The first (slightly stupid ;) ) question that comes to my mind is, do you really need to run as root? Or just need root access to some other stuff that you could sudo to, or use setuid rights to?
can you build the string with these bind variables explicitly mentioned?

i.e to construct the string by concatenating the string with both constant strings and the variables?
have you checked the add attachment block is getting called, ie. that the file exists?
The tweening part is easy; you just do simple linear interpolation in the 3-dimensional color coordinate space. But it's not clear what you want; do you want the initial color on page load to reflect the age, and then have the age continue to change slowly?
"ConTeXt, an excursion" *is* what I'd recommend to a beginner.  I had troubles with fonts, the internal state of the Context system, and trying to use not very well documented features early on, but not the command syntax or conflicts between commands: do you anything in particular in mind?
Please specify (1) what language you are using (eg PHP), (2) Any software you are using (eg Wordpress, Joomla, CodeIgniter and so on) and (3) what errors you are getting, if any. What do you mean by "down"?
What device do you have?  Does it have a custom UI like Sense or TouchWiz?
I'm inclined to think that something is shelling out an `http://` address request. Is Firefox your default browser?
What do you mean by coordinates (position on the screen I guess) ? Which layout are you working with?
Ebay links are ephemeral, and often disappear in time. Is it possible to find another example link?
Post you linked to also has non-edit filter solution by Otto. Had you tried that?
Your code will result in 0.5. So what's your problem?
The session.py [link](http://pastebin.com/65DNHqUR), the util.py: [link](http://pastebin.com/AXMM7ALK) and the const.py: [link](http://pastebin.com/ww2QQEtQ) (= the Yahoo information)
So I suppose the const.py is not correct?
did these suggestions help you? Are you able to accept an answer?
Are there any additional assumptions? E.g. O(1) size for the set of point-to nodes?
You might want to re-architect this; if you are counting the number of files/folders every minute, you are creating a race condition.  What about having each function update a counter, or use a lockfile to ensure that the periodic process doesn't update the count until both functions have finished executing?
hi zaky, i m using xcode 4 tat rename button doesnt exist anymore...
hi vakio, yes i can see "SimpleScrollView" still in the pbxproj, wat do u mean by "rename the executable"?
It's possible.  Do you have any code yet?
@Eric, I feel sorry for anyone still stuck with an [ATM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode)-attached host.  What did you do to the technology gods to deserve this?
Due to the different interpretations people have of "independent", can you please clarify your question. What do you mean by independent?
Your specs do not have span adjustment. Is there a typo?
@Nick Usually they are <div class="section"> but sometimes there are other classes.  Does that matter?
please provide a more detailed example, because I don't understand what you mean by concatenating objects. I know what it means for strings: `"a" + "b"` => `"ab"`, But what should the resulting Object (Person) look like?
You may want to define efficient/clean. Do you mean simplest in terms of expression, or efficient in terms of processing speed, or most generic in terms of possible strings handled ... ?
@jblue who said that hes not going to do any work himself. as you imply?
This is sort of a vague question. What sort of correspondence are you looking for?
Ok, thx for that. Can you put your comments into an answer so that it can be voted?
Yes, but the w doesn't have to be 2. What then?
^^ Yes it is very much for my self learning. Can you please guide me as to how to go about with the approach?
Are you using regular expressions?  How are you currently parsing the text?
@user597861: That looks like Java. Why aren't you just using `A.length`?
So, if I understand the issue, you need to find the superset of the vertices and get the centroid of each set therein. Then create every plane that intersects every two of those along with the centroid of the simplex... is that right?
I think your rules might need to be clarified. Is it "at least two decimal places, but more if necessary"?
What's wrong with Quickbooks Online? Is there something specific you're looking for that they don't offer?
There's almost certainly a better question to be asked lurking under this one.  Why do you want to change the Xorg video driver? :)
I'm starting to feel that the problem arises with interactionPointData, since this method does not own it.  Since I am pointing to it with model, will releasing model cause havoc upstream?
Are we talking about using online sites such as Hulu? Or like recording and watching cable TV?
How do you reference an image from CSS? Other than `background-image`?
2.1. looks like it is testing that pj is in the "interior" of the convex angle defined by pi-1, pi, pi+1. In that case, can't 2.2. be modified so that it tests that pj is in the "exterior" of the convex angle defined by pi+1, pi, pi-1?
wow, thanks! combined with baffledcook's tips this basically covers everything not covered by experimentation - would a lasagna freeze well? my guess is a definite no?
how are the cross sections given? polygons?
"MD5 and freeze but this give unreadable id". What does unreadable id mean ?
Smells like homework. How far did you get?
Why not mark your "parameters" as `"Hello ${world}"` or something like that? Are you trying to build a hand rolled Huffman coding?
Ow my eyes. Why are you not using `use strict; use warnings;`?
why do you want to view the code? Maybe if you give a better description of what you want to do? :)
'filtering' means 'message arrived - aplly it a label/archive/delete/forward. So what?
Shouldn't we create a format for posting the books? 
One book with a linked title and a short description of why it's recommended and what it's about per answer?
What do you mean with "deleted quicksilver" ? Did you just put it in the Trash ?
The code you show should work fine and not overwrite anything. Why do you suspect it is not working?
for whatever reason adding a ~/.irbrc like most people are suggesting isn't working for me.  any other tips?
In the title you say .doc but in your question you say .pdf. Which is it?
What kind of edging are you using?  quarter round?
Of course it does, and the damage is irreparable too, close to that from a large scale nukular explosion. I gather you had a disagreement with your parents over this, and you want someone to prove them wrong?
@Frog: Your question is only slightly clearer now.  Is the general rule "xyz" -> "myXyz"?
Could you pose a question here?  Is the question whether the paper is right?
Are these applications Swing based? What kind of communication is between them?
Please don't take this the wrong way, but this question doesn't really belong on http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/. Perhaps something like http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/ would be a better fit?
how do you load the php file? Are the folder/file permissions set to executable?
The easiest language to do a task in is often the one you know the best! Which languages/tools do you already know?

Are there also $2 bills?  If not, where do the 2's come from?
"with a vary of 0 or 1" doesn't really parse into something comprehensible. Rephrase?
Do you know the frequency?  Some bound on the frequency?
This is a philosophical question, not a physics question.  Maybe there's also a Philosophy Stack Exchange?
@Ray Toal: The regular expressions can contain + or * but a maximum string length would ensure there are not infinite possibilities.  Am I making sense?
@David: What *I'd* like to know is, how you managed not only to read the question directly from John's mind but also to post the answer at exactly the same time as when John posted his question. Does it require much practicing? :)
So? what is the question? "The code's not working", is that the question?
@ChrisW: I didn't edit because now it looks like we closed a legit question. Can it be unclosed?
I don't understand how it is related with row numbers, So does Lieven's answer is not fully correct ? Or what do you think about Lieven's answer ?
Which end are you talking about?  the part that plugs into the car for the part that plugs into the phone?
Could you share the relevant information with us *irrespective* of whether it is an exception, and error, or something else?  Also, what does because I must there KeyPairValuOfStringAndCarType mean?
I don't understand what you mean by groups. Are you asking for groups or points?
Hello vishal, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which version of Drupal are you interested?
How is suffix tree represented in practice? could we represent it using adjacency list as in graph?
@robin @peter: It isn't clear to me that it's an exact duplicate either.  Are you both referring to the one I linked above or another one?
Also: every app has XSS that could be displayed as HTML, XML, or a future markup language. Do you seriously want to have that argument?
According to the error message the second line of the file `/etc/apt/sources.list` is invalid. Could you please post that line?
I know that "click here" should be avoided, at least for semantics. Can somebody please explain "It ruins a perfectly good SEO opportunity"?
It's not exactly clear what you're trying to do. Do you just want get the text of the HTML table without the HTML tags?
Setting aside the circumventing of company policies, this is still a question about installing software on a server. Surely that's a ServerFault question?
Also, like an earlier link to McGee - this link is dead. Is someone trying to sneak in their Amazon book store or something?
What make of frames were these? How much do you weigh?
Sure, we tell you some good ideas, you make mad money.  Are we suckers?
The bytes download in simulator is different from the bytes downloaded in the device.. Just checked while debugging. Any idea why it is doing so??
Depends, do you want it to actually respond to commands? Or just gauge yelling?
where I live, it gets dark at night.  Do you sleep during the day?
It's not clear what you mean by 'Printing(saving)'.  Where do you want the command saved to?
Define the quality of traffic. What makes traffic "quality"?
Compression is highly dependent on the source data. Since you say your matrices are "small sizes", why not post one?
@conmulligan  thanks for the heads up are there any plans to let people login ? slos I noticed that when i searched a tag and and selected it i got old topics that had new answers first rather than just the newest topics is that intentional ?
Are you using the default expression evaluator? Also have you tried applying the line directive to the ret instead of a nop?
In `gconf-editor` you can use mappings to run custom commands (see `/apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_1` and `/apps/metacity/keybinding_commands/command_1`) If you have compiz, then this is better configured via compiz frontend. Have you used that for Alt+F1 > super.sh mapping ?
It's unclear exactly what you want. Are you trying to rearrange the format string?
What is the purpose of implementing your own framework? Why not use an existing one?
@Noldorin: true. But it could pass as a big-list question perhaps?
@Nikita: I'm only seeing math.SE, SO, and meta.SO for mine, none of my other accounts' rep.  When I paste in a profile URL, is it only using that site, or is it getting all associated accounts?
Is your problem that you don't know how to use your mbed to send signals, or that you don't know what signals to send? Or both? :)
Thanks for the tip. What is the best way to freeze it, though? I mean, aside from what I make with it when I finally decide to eat it, how do I best store it for another day?
what happens if you print before exporting? or is that the order already?
@Steven: I don't know how good WordPress is with future revisions of already published pages. Can you save them without publishing them, even ignoring the permissions issue?
Has the same problem. Have you solved it?
I don't think this should happen at all, unless there is something more to it than the code shows. And just out of curiosity, are you using any kind of accelerator?
Is this the exact question? If not can you please post it exactly, word for word?
You're doing two times the same thing (2xforeach) and the previous variant might just overwrite the option if the not set in $_REQUEST. Probably this is the issue?
Also, what time are you synchronising? And why?
Didn't some (earlier?) versions of Windows label the IE desktop icon as "The Internet"?
You want to transform a string to a byte array but you don't want to specify the encoding. How would you possible decode it back to a string without knowing how it was encoded?
Images are always rectangular, how are you creating anything different?  Are you looking for [image maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_map)?
There is still ambiguity - `1 3 5 4 2` is zig zag according to YOUR description of the problem, but NOT according to the topcoder description. Do you see why?
I'm inclined to agree with Pavel.  Maybe change it to "What tech purchase has best improved your life as a programmer" or something?
It is very interesting to see answers to related question that @Edward Tanguay included in his answer: **"I often have wondered in which parts of the world (England?) and which social echelons using "shall" in statements is actually still practiced by native speakers?"**
PHP is not made for long run. Why do you need it?
I would like to hear how this can be done with python. Can windows be resized and repositioned by command line?
Not a clue what you're talking about. Is PhotoshopImage a private class you've created or what?
Interesting problem.  What have you tried so far, and where are you stuck?
Sorry, but I fail to see any correspondence between the title and the actual question in the body. Could you consider rewriting the title to be more precise?
@Zimbabao Cached MySQL is our front-runner at the moment. Has that worked well for you?

I am having the same problem.  Anyone have any other ideas?
I think the most likely error is that the <form> tag in the master page (or whatever page) doesn't have a runat="server" attribute? Can you post some code to help us pin-point the error?
How was the restriction stipulated, exactly? Did your professor specifically require that you not implement `operator>>(..., const Player&)` or was it a more general case of not allowing stream input of any kind for the Player class?
a name is all a user needs to be created? no other validations?
no; just added it in question too. Should it has to be debug build?
@shakti : that's not an issue . My question is why there is no output ?
What kind of representation are you using? Adjency matrix, adjency list...?
Can you please be more specific?? What do u mean by "but it's not a problem as far as the tutorial goes" ??
I'm also curious how do you heat it up without it becoming softer.  If you want to keep it al dente, is there a way to do this?
@Neil: Please explain. Should we replace all boolean expressions in a program with a complete class hierarchy?
Can you please explain in pseudo code how you would LIKE the query to be executed? What should happen on the server(s) and what should happen locally in your code?
I'm a bit unsure what you're asking here. Would you like Stack Overflow to do a code review of your code for you?
This is mighty ambitious. Can you turn this into a question?
What do you mean by "by default, the week starts at Monday"? I'm not saying that's not true, but how/where do you experience that in your code?
Does `module_x` instantiate the class in its module body? Or later, inside a function or such?
I'm actually a total novice, I had no clue. How are you supposed to put it in, and why is the way I'm doing it bad?
@karianna - I'm using Subversion; hope discussing little tech/programming won't make this closed! :-) Please let me know whether I need to post a question in SO asking how to merge log comment to particular class? :-)
wait! If you're doing the thesis, shouldn't you be the expert?
Seems all too straightforward - I must be missing something.  The only 'interesting' part is the talk of 'the reverse side of the page' which seems like a bit of irrelevant misdirection - or not?
Your first sentence is unclear. When you say, "which might differ just slightly" are you referring to the colors or the random numbers?
"...without considerably more context" - I am sorry for being, perhaps, too annoying, but your last words give me some hope that "speaking tings" is still possible under some very very specific circumstances, some broader context. Can you, please, try to come up with such context?
JNDI lookup is the way. Can you confirm in your startup logs that the datasource actually deploys?
Are the x/y coordinates actually reals or integers? That is, can you determine a neighbor by finding the tile with x=x+1 & y=y?
is there overlap? e.g. could the closest min_x coordinate be less than A's max_x coord?
homework? perchance?
I don't know if I understand correctly: Do you want to add a new image tag to your div tag? Where do you have your list?
It seems that the string that I send is not null-terminated, could be this the problem? The string that I send is build with (string + string).c_str(), but shouldn't the c_str() method alredy add the NULL-terminator?
did you set the classpath in `Publish Settings > Flash > ActionScript 3.0 Settings > Source Path`? are you debugging in a browser?

If you need wide browser compatibility, you'll have to use JavaScript. Would you be interested in a JavaScript solution?
This problem is trivial to solve. Is this homework?
I think the default behavior conforms to your requirement. What completion options have you set?
What version of Oracle?  Frankly, working on the full name for string manipulation is not recommended -- what if someone has a last name with a space between two words?
How is the result of your code different from that shown in the article?  What, exactly, are you asking for help with?
Are you using a plugin? (Is this restful_authentication?)
I think with the availability of more powerful computers, different kinds of methods suddenly become practical and important (would one use e.g. boosted decision trees without fast computers ?)
These 6 layers on a static map is a tough design job.  What is the issue preventing use of an interactive map?
This isn't that hard to do, but it will depend on how you set up the cell. Can you show us the code where you create the cell, labels and buttons?
The title of this post and the actual question are kind of confusing. Do you want to change the overall look of your document, or only one section?
I'm testing it using the simulator. I can't find anywhere in the simulator to disable daylight saving?
Assume each string in Python has 30 bytes of overhead. If you multiply 30 bytes by the number of fields per record and the number of records (30M) and add in 1.5GB, what do you get?
It's not the homework problem of anyone I know, but I suppose it could be. How does one write a challenge problem, to be documented on stackoverflow, that doesn't appear to be a "homework" problem?
Will the characters always be the first n/2 letters of the alphabet and the numbers be in the range [1,n/2]? Also, what happens when n/2>=10, how are we required to handle multi-character numbers like "10","11",..?

Would you please put the content of your file ~/.gtkrc-2.0 ?
Why do you need to store the whole graph in memory? Can't you serialize it to the datastore in a fashion that makes querying it practical?
You can create an empty div and when the larger image is clicked you can replace that div with a SWF (hiding images if necessary). Will that be OK?
This doesn't seem off topic to me. Is there a reason you decided to close your own question?
Since when is `String` a primitive? Since when can you store primitives in a `Collection`?
You need to provide some code, are you actually within a class or trying to create an object just through `$this->list = 'hello'`? Are you getting any error messages?

Yeah i have tried the guides but cant seem to find any way to load multiple .xib files. I'm using an array to load in the number of rows and textLable.text for each row, so can u use that array to load in the different nib names into initWithNibName?
I don't thing there's ready made solution to that. Maybe some machine learning algorithms?
Is location important, or are you just looking for a hierarchy?  I see you are going to be using "categorization by location", but are you planning on using attributes (like a lookup table) or a spatial search (like "what's near me")?

For those of us who aren't specifically familiar with `sendmail`, it might help if you post a more complete set of log lines, and describe exactly what details you're paying attention to when you do this manually.  For example, in the line you've posted, is `p937blksdh3` the message-id?

I think `chunklen` needs to also be able to decrease, or else your queue will have size proportional to its largest-ever size even if it is empty.  So how about `if (q->head->next == q->tail) chunklen/=2`?

I find it strange that you call datetime.now() 3 times, but get different results (look in the query - one of the times is 00:00:00 and the other 2 are not). maybe you should assign the results of datetime.now() to some variable and pass that to the filters?

@Unreason About the rectangular case - think of the situation when points aren't positioned in a rectilinear way (basically, the points inside the rectangle can take any position and, hence, build complex curves). If I have some matrix with these points, what should I do to make my mesh resolution larger (in terms of points per square inch, for example)?
Following your edit, it looks like your rescue is catching a SystemExit exception (raised when you call exit) rather than the TypeError from trying to join nil with a String. What's on multi.rb line 234?

Is your problem to match a **subset** of your input lines to a route from the root in the tree? 
Also, how would the last line in the tree match all the values in your second key, since your input contains 1=45 and the last line contains 1=47 only?
@Marc: Could you, please, make more precise your statement "two paths are different iff they use different child nodes in a branching node". You mean they're different if there is such a branching node where they use different child nodes?

Why don't you use the DEBUG flag directly instead of 'delegating' the function to a class variable? It sounds like that telephone game, 'Chinese Whispers' (?)

For uninitiated person like me, which one of the bikes in your photos is the MTB and which one is the CX?
Ok, I will. What is the StackOverflow policy, editing the start post or should I make a new answer with all code?
Also, you're not really asking a question by just posting some unfinished code - you need to be more specific. Is there something you don't understand about how the code works?
I can't understand you. Can you show an example?
Yet another question: one of the frames from your example gif describes a route that is not really a simple path (this one: http://imgur.com/0vjvr.png). Are that kind of route (or rather spanning tree) allowed as a valid solution for your problem?

I don't know if this will help, but what do you get if you use a different language? Does changing to English and then back to Italian change things?
Is it important to you to strip all the way down to a bare frame? Or is overhauling one system at a time OK?
the answer is `math error`, for `n/0`, the first element. do you mean from 1 to logn?
@fatih You don't happen to have a demo/example project you could share? To see which files need to be added and how to call the functions?
since when was north 0 degrees, east 45 degress etc. Don't you mean 0, 90, 180, 270?
Too vague - explain what you expect the contents of the array to be afterwards - give a concrete example. Possibly also needs a homework tag ?
as I said "sudo -u apache perl_script.pl" works. unless I forgot some flags in order for it be the exact emulation ?
What's wrong with the silly way? What problem does it create?
-1: A bad question.  The real question is "how do I concatenate file names?"
@Mark Trapp: Not constructive? Really?
So they're const global variables. Big deal...?
This sounds a lot like a machine learning algorithm - you're trying to find some function of those five parameters that estimates the "goodness" of the stock.  I'm no machine learning expert, but perhaps someone else here is?
Also, these kinds of questions are expressly frowned upon in the FAQ: "your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”".  Do you have a specific problem with specific requirements that you need a VM for?
I know and that's why I can send emails to phones. Does anyone know of any APIs that don't use sendmail to send their email?
Joe is right. Maybe we could merge the two questions/answers?
Why would you build your own XML parser at all? Is this just to learn javaCC?
Nice, what did you set it to? greater or smaller?
Could you please show your setup.py file? Also why is your setup.py in C:\Python27?
Why do you want to do this in the first place? You're already using managed code, why not use the BCL's [regex class](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regex.aspx)?
What is the submit method ? a regular submit or an ajax submit ?
Your current code would load page.php's content into the `<div id="test"></div>`. Are you saying that, within page.php, there is code to run testit_1, and on page_2.php to run testit_2?
What exactly do you mean by continue with left+right? Say the original text was "abcdefgh", and your two 'words' are "cd" and "bef", would you first split into "ab"-"cd"-"efgh", and then search in "abefgh", and find "bef", and split into "a"-"bef"-"gh" and then continue with "agh", and not find anything?
I don't get it. You have the `query` object already, so why not just do `if (query.id && query.foo && query.bar) { ... }`?
is this running through Apache/mod-php?  And if you don't have SSH access, what are you using to upload to this host?
This sounds bizarre.  Can you explain WHY you have to do it this way?
Please add the replys as comments to the answer, this way the user gets notified of the reply. Just to make sure, both of the videos use only the baseline profile of AVC?
The water.mapcalc file should be rather straightforward. However, probably the white space in the directory name causes troubles?
The letters can vary depending on the company, but usually they are a minor difference between. Have you checked the datasheet?
A hash and a sort both require you to load the entire `A.txt` file into memory. Why do you think sorting is better than using a hash?

Why did everyone list universities? Aren't there any other types of infosec policies?
Very interesting question, I hope this eventually gets some answers! Are you talking only about *disclosure*, or economic factors in improving security in general?
+1 ... even though I know where it comes from - see the mmyers answer - i've always wondered why it's considered so compelling. Can anyone add to the mmyers answer and explain?
the screw supposed to fasten the lever. can you send a couple of pictures?
Which version of Erlang are you running? Can you try your example after running `application:start(sasl).` in your Erlang shell?
With highlighting, you mean selecting it or do you want to wrap it in e.g. a `span` tag?
What have you tried? Examples?
@Billy: Assume you would start as my colleague today and would have to touch this code. How would you know that you cannot use virtual methods in this particular class?

Did you change the Document type, or is it the standard one used by Drupal? Which error does Firebug report?
You mean other than when things like taste, heat tolerance, health, etc are factors? Or is that what you are asking?
I'm pretty sure that the google image search just goes by image name doesn't it? or are you talking about some other google search that I'm unaware of?
What do you want to do with the data?  Use it internally, or redistribute it?
Can you access http://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/index.sucatalog from your browser or using curl? (Just to rule out that you can talk to Apple's servers) and if have you tried deleting com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist in `/Library/Preferences/`?

What is the dynamic range of your camera's sensor (how many bits per pixel)? Can you adjust the pixel format of the raw file?
Then can you suggest me something, how should i do it. Because if i sort the array, i loose track of indexes, and i need to know which index the value came from??
what doesn't work about it? can you provide some example js in your post to demonstrate it not working?
I think `iter.toList.sortBy(_.myAttr).take(n)` is simple and efficient enough when the size of the iterator is close to `n`. Are you thinking that `n` will always be small and dealing with possibly large iterators?
@Nightfirecat  Well, the normal `<hr />` isn't enough contrast from the background to provide me with what I need.  So, creating a 1x3 image and a 100x3 image doesn't really change the speed at all?
That sounds amazing!! Can I have the link? :D
mhchem.sty is 1300 lines long. What exactly are you asking to be reimplemented?
Javascript running in a browser doesn't have access to the underlying file system for security reasons, but this could be accomplished if you're talking about server-side JS (such as node.js). Are you? :)
Why do you have 0,2 after 2,1 and 2,2 (and 3,1 before 0,3)? Why is 1,2 in twice?
What does your data look like? Are the values bound?
I think you're trying to find repeating characters at the beginning of a string, is this correct? Would you mind rephrasing your question?
Hardcore the password?  Would that make it a password to an adult site?
You could always repartition and then restore /home from backup.  You do have backups, don't you?
What about a little more information? What is your question?
Are any of these answers useful enough for you to consider accepting one? If not, what else would you need in an answer?
I don't think there's any "optimal" way to do it other than just scanning the string looking for the delimiters.  Perhaps _you_ could code that yourself?
Are you asking for sum ? or u asking for a specified value where prodSum(L1,L2) < X ?
Uhm, can you clarify? Are you asking how to count how many "a"'s an array has?
Your input data does not seem to have all the fields that the Google format requires. Where are you intending to get the missing data from?

you already release FootballScoreBoardViewController. Can you show your code ?
@MAK: Well, there is a problem **what order to store in**, and then there is a solution that specifies one way to solve the problem with its own advantages and disadvantages. Not `algorithm` -worthy?

@belisarius, Sorry I did not mention; It is the worst case that I am interested in. And anyways, how would one differentiate between these in this scenario?
I'm not quite sure what you are trying to achieve. Do you want the background image to change only when you hover over the corners?
You say you don't want multisite, and then when someone mentions multisite you say it's a good idea? "Different pages with different things on them"... is this a joke question?
The only time that I saw that was when using different monitors, or a remote login (in other words : changing the resolution, and then the layout of the panels).

 Is it your case ?
This depends immensely on size of the organization, complexity and number of systems, usage patterns, level of required/actual security, etc. Can you add some more details?
Scalebars usually measure distance, but a swimming pool might be a volume or an area.  Or do you mean the length of a swimming pool?
That's correct behavior.  What don't you like about it?
Check the exception details - the stack trace should tell you exactly where this happens, so you can debug from there. Can you post the stack trace?
So you want to use 256bits to make sure 1 bit was sent correctly. How will you make sure the hash is correct with a 2**20?
Ok the table has few nvarchar columns,couple float columns ,a ntext column
I observerd that the error is caused when I am filtering for the columns but couldnt find which column or row?
@Kara: Perhaps rephrase the question: Is it OK to listen to music while cycling?  When I first saw the title I thought it might be something like "What types of music do you listen to while cycling?"
But why is it the noscript element on the same level with 'head' and 'body' in the first place?
What is the DOCTYPE of the html?
Sooo, what's the problem? Do you get an error when trying to compile the code?
could you mark fluchtpunkts answer as accepted? so that people can see by one blink that your question is solved?
I added a link to some pretty images to indicate what I want to get.
Steve, I added (probably far too many) details to the question statement -- does that answer your questions?
To what extent do you want: (a) mathematical rigour; (b) applications in particular software (e.g., R, SPSS, SAS, etc.); (c) domain-specific applications?
Regex is not good at manipulating XML. Using XSLT, why performance should be scary?
At least there's nothing ungrammatical about them. Could you elaborate on why you have doubts about their correctness?
this is source code... what is the question? Do you really think that throwing code at us will solve your problem?!
Also what are the screen dimensions? I.e. will the screen always be smaller than 512x512?
Can you expand on this question a little?  What else to you know about the "great prediction"?
Are you using an IDE in your group?  Like Eclipse or Netbeans?
Nobody is actually addressing the question being asked here. Is it that vital to ensure the wheel is centered? Can it really be destroyed by riding slightly off-center?
I'm assuming that you have more than one shower.  Does this problem exist for the other showers?
Could you please comment on the usage of this expression in sentences like *"The function `foo` may or may not return a `bar`."*, where the point is to emphasize that you can't rely on one behavior?
What is the input? And what is line 73?
__In a Linux kernel context, the only lock with a spin implementation has a mutex interface.__ I dint understand this line. Could you please expand on it?
Which language are you using to solve this? Can you show some code?
What do you mean by "deleting through Visual Studio"? You mean "in code"?

Hey ... the cookies are fried ! Why the "baking" tag??? :D
it was a joke. why so serious?
Please specify the platform you are compiling on, and also specify the command line options to the compiler that you're using.  Is `-std=c99` one of the options, for example?
Given all the software tools out there (IDEs, refactoring tools, text search tools etc.) why do you want to write this from scratch yourself?
UIImage *chevronImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"chevron"];
Do you try to add in the image extension in your code?
Why not bake the stew in a traditional container and roast the pumpkin separately, then move the stew to the pumpkin?  Or don't even roast the pumpkin?
...is it making any noises, e.g. 'clunks', as part of that extra noise?
I think I know what is the problem.
How can I add 1 sec (or more) of empty audio between this two files?
Flying is fun! What more do you need?
Thanks Dave.  As long as I reference your project on my site, thats ok right?
The assembly of a try/catch block indeed shows calls to objc_begin_catch and objc_end_catch. Have you tried looking through that to see how they are invoked?
@Haoest: It seems some friendly individual already edited the title to remove the "gay image". Have you tried a different threshold?
I'm afraid it's still unclear what you want to do with roomA and roomB.  Are you trying to list every permuation of the two?
It does have a reference *somewhere*, but I don't know where. Come think of it, isn't this the kind of thing decided by the JVM?
What is your question about? How to address the image, or how to change the image source?
Which UI framework do you use? Swing, AWT, Struts, JSF, ...?
Sounds like homework. Where is your own effort?
Great question. What exactly do you mean by "bug"?
What servletcontainer are you using/targeting? What's the reason that you don't use 3rd party libraries for this?
Does saying `/bin/sh -l` fix it?  If not, what about switching to another shell, like `tcsh -l`?
I cannot understand the exact question, but if you want to define something like Petri nets, why don’t you define your object by describing the difference from Petri nets?  What is the difference between your object and acyclic Petri nets?
jiewmeng, you should change the question to be more specific. I think the ideal name would be "Why do I need to check if wp_nonce_field() exists before using it?"
What are you asking specifically? for algorithms to do some kind of transitions?
Is this question about the algorithm itself (ie. you are positively sure that your implementation is error-free, but you don't understand why the algorithm outputs this particular result), or about your implementation (which you suspect is erratic and therefore gives wrong results)?
@David: okay, if you are taking your definition this strictly then the answer is much simpler: you cannot enforce the condition $\dot{\phi} = 0$. Why would you think you can do that in *these* coordinates in the first place?
When I was with Slackware, I used to type `startx` after logging in, so I think that was me who start the X server (and not root). Is that what you are asking for?
These are individual strings? Not one huge block, correct?
It's likely `m_cAppIdMap` has been over released. Can you check that?
As I don't want t give default values because when ever I change its height and width I also have to change it in code - which one can change? the image view or the images stored?
I've done a PHP wrapper but don't have enough reputation to edit it in. Could someone link to it?
Did you ever get this resolved successfully? Do you still need help with this?
Is your intention to stop and then shoot? Or are you also looking for firing ranges that allow bicycles?
the singular of hierarchies is hierarchy, btw. can you edit that ?
Are you sure to have more than 4 images/node? Also, are you the one behind http://www.drupality.be?
Sure, no problem. Jesteś z Warszawy?
Could it be that you run your code on every operation $op in the hook? Is there a `if($op=='foo')` or a `switch - case` anywhere in the hook?
What operating system do you use? Windows or Mac?
Could you ask a specific question? What have you tried so far?
What kind of bike do you have? Are your rims particularly delicate?
Indeed it should be automatic. Which phone do you have?
Were the name lists lexicographically sorted? Will the corresponding hashes still be sorted?
Is this homework?  Which of these questions are you having problems with?
Thanks for the information.  Is there any reference?
could you give us more information about /Yesterday/Yesterday ? IS this a regular folder or a symlink?
I thought that was the style in all languages. Can you give an example of a language where the explicit numerals are not avoided?
hmm alright, but will this save the data when the user leaves the view?? Becuase if they add a cell after the view loads, then wouldnt it not save the new cells?
`T data;` is fine. You won't want to use `T data = 0;` because you don't know if `T` is an integral type (what if I try to create a `Node<std::string>`?)
You probably missed a setting somewhere - XPS is quite capable of producing sharp output. Can you post the actual exported xps somewhere, and also provide some more information on how you are exporting, as well as what XPS viewer you are using?
Sorry :) I dont want to hack the system!! :) is there another way?
What did they give as the reason they rejected your site? And what did you do to resolve that problem?
IIRC, this is the same problem as with volume buttons on some ThinkPads... the hardware *just does it* and then also sends out a signal saying the button's been pressed.  Possibly you could unset the shortcut in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts for this action?
While the title of this question *does* use "Palatable" correctly, [the word](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palatable) has connotations of "mmm, tasty!" Perhaps edit to say "easier"?
I don't understand your question. Can you clarify?
It's very difficult to understand your problem if you don't provide the related code (HTML and maybe CSS in this case). Can you be more specific?
Have you verified the content of `file` is what you think it is? (Via debugging/Log?)
it **only** affects the object that has been created in the last loop-round? or, it **also** affects the object that has been created in the last loop-round?
+1: "We try to not put the sales men in the same room." Can I work for you please?
Given the screenshot, is it possible you have JavaScript that's interfering with the display of the form element's value? Or, well, CSS that renders the text invisible?
What are you trying to achieve? call ironpython functions from c#?
What defines the end of an entry? Is it guaranteed that the lines within an entry won't start with a digit, but a line defining a new entry will?
One side question: It sounds like your yard slopes towards your house. Assuming you don't already have any water problems, could adding a deck (which could trap some of the moisture) cause a problem?
Where are you executing the query? Do you get any errors?
A gaussian is unbounded. Am I missing something?
_Why_ are you trying to delay it? What do you expect to gain from that?
40 kbps is fast enough to load the full facebook.com in about a minute.  Is that even worth it?
Homework? Can you post what you've tried?
@ZoFreX - If it can be answered in 250 characters or less (i.e. user gets whole answer from meta description) do you think the searcher would have stuck around on the site for more than two seconds? :)
I can't seem to find anything online about a Motorola H20 headset.  Is that definitely the model number?
What is the material of the window sash and frame (ie. Vinyl, wood, metal) and is it painted?
@RoBYCoNTe: I tried to uncheck "ASP.NET" in the "Debuggers" section but it didn't change the behavior. What else should I check?
@dmckee - I wasn't aware that a closed question could be edited. Will an edited closed question generally get reconsideration?
Great question. Perhaps it should have the pronunciation tag?
Maybe it would also be interesting to get hints on how to minimize downtime or content overlap, with the time needed to transfer database contents and DNS migration. Or should we discuss that at [Pro Webmasters](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/search?q=migration)?
While automatically running a rootkit removal/detection tool on a live system might help you discover less sophisticated rootkits, you should also be aware of its limitation. Assuming your system has been infested by a rootkit, how do you know that the rootkit hasn't been tampering with your rootkit removal/detection tool?
Does your file names follow a pattern? Do do they have common string as part of their names?
`my @files = \`find $my_dir -maxdepth 2 -name *.txt\`;`... I don't get the `Wanted` sub. Can't I just give a regex?
Not sure how this setup helps migration. Could you please elaborate?
That doesn't really make any sense. You have an array of dictionary objects or you actually have a dictionary whose values are all of this object type with keys like Title etc?
Hmm... this seems like a chemistry question to me (and therefore quite possibly off-topic for this site). Thoughts from anyone else?
Could someone please explain to me the statement in more detail? Eg. if k=1 and R is x<y, then what will be A?
*"There's this funny gap I tried to write a paper once upon a time when I studied linguistics…"* — I think there's an "on" or "upon" missing. :-) You probably meant "…I tried to write a paper on once upon a time"?
@Orko Is black line a moving target for a missile or car's ideal path on racing track? How do you define a success and failure of drawing a red line?
`i = rand() % length;`. Maybe you mean `k = rand() % length;`?

What is `someclass`?  What line does the error message correspond to?
Do you want to turn off thumbnails on just the desktop, or in folder windows (e.g. Places -> Home Folder) as well?
When you say 'it fails' what happens?  Does it truncate the field or fail to insert, and if it fails what is the relevant error message?
It's not really clear what you're asking. Do you have to implement these two functions, or are they implemented and you need to use them for something?
my iphone 4 ( only one week old, with iOS 4.3 installed 5 days ago), HAD custom labels but now doesnt.  Did it go away between 4.2 and 4.3   ???
I don't think this is possible as written. When N is very large, the expected product of widely separated xi must be very close to zero, and we can find a set of 1/p + 1 that must essentially be mutually exclusive despite all having probability p. Perhaps you meant E[xi xj] - p^2 = ... ?
Can you put here the links to do it? Please? :D
if you mean _window.onload = onload_, then that would work, or something similar.  have you tried your example to see what happens?
What is it you are encrypting with mcrypt?  Is it a serialized session from `$_SESSION`?

My end goal is to get a list of rows with unique data (as determined by a combination of 3 cells in a row); however, I need all the cells of the unique rows. Maybe an array of hashes would be better suited for this task?
Did you read Q&A QA1703? http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1703/_index.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010193  it looks like you took that and decided to iterate through views instead of windows, is there a reason?
Can't you just filter out the value NULL before you process the records?  Or did I miss something?
Where is the CGI script located? Are you using a web server started as a system service or under your user account on the same machine?
Why do you need to do another `ls`? Why don't you just print the results from the first `ls`?
What does scomposition mean? Do you mean "decomposition"?
What platform? Mac, Windows, Linux?
The field API is a Drupal 7 API, but the question is tagged with "drupal-6." Are you asking about CCK, or the field API?
Nice app! Any news about opening the source code?
How about some code? Otherwise, how can we tell what you're doing with the image?!
I think we must sort the group for select algorithm but it is not necessary for sorting the elements in the quick select algorithm !! isn't it?
Can you confirm that your event is firing on each window resize and not just when the window loads? Can we see you code somewhere?
I'd think the issue is that the tabs are starting from different column numbers because of longer and shorter filenames. Could you change it to `puts [OK]\t\tx` so that the OKs line up and the filenames start at the same column?
Did some of your formatting get eaten?  Did you mean to say "I have a &lt;form&gt; with several..." ?
Can you define overlapping?  That is, do you mean a set of intervals with a point in common or do you mean a set of intervals such that there is an overlapping path between any pair?
You'll have to give us a bit more context here.  Can you provide a code snippet that displays this problem?
Im assuming that you need an exact solution. Thats the case, right?
What kind of reporting? What exactly are you trying to do?
"best" according to what Goal?  What are you trying to minimize or maximize?
Just so we're all clear here, what exactly does that function do? What is the input, what is the output?
Have you tried to fully uninstall your application from your development phone and reinstall it from scratch? Maybe your database creation method is wrong?
??? OMG! why? I thought every site must have one robots.txt. Can you please explain for me?
Why are you subclassing UIScrollView? Why don't you just add subviews to it?
Probably findViewById() isn't working. Are you sure you defined a TextView called txt_1?
And ? What is the problem ?
Are you running a dedicated server with your own VMs, or do you have one VM provided by a hosting company? Or are you talking about vhosts in regard of apache being multi-homed?
yep :-) sorry for the confusion.  any other ideas?
Assuming the original pronunciation uses [s], I think there's a more interesting question: why are English speakers using [z] instead? Does English have a tendency to voice between voiced segments?
I have tried outputting to other formats with no avail.  Could you elaborate on what you mean, "the links to the pictures are broken"?
It might depend on your messaging app -- HTC phones with Sense don't have the standard android mesages app, for example.  What phone do you have?
Thank you very much @Luboš Motl ! Would you please sum up your comments and post them as an answer?
While it is possible to weld frames together - witness [this tall-bike frame](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilfein/4653212878/in/set-72157624042376181) - I'm going to guess that the stresses on a tandem would require some rather heavy reinforcement, making for an extremely heavy tandem frame. Can someone confirm or deny this?
What do you mean by 'other types of elements'?  How would you determine the values of the other types?
How about "Hi y'all!" or "Howdy folks!"? ;)
Your algorithm would presumably conclude that `{x,y,y,y,y}` and `{x,x,x,x,y}` are equal. Is that the desired behaviour?
I'm not proficient in Japanese, so correct me if I'm saying something dumb, but last time I checked, か was a *final* interrogative particle, coming at the very end of a sentence and not changing the intonation of the rest of it, like, *at all*. As to your English examples, would you regard the rewordings "Are you running into..." and "Is (it really (so that)) the fastest way..." as sacrificing the content/format/impact?
Why do you think there should be a klass method on the class you are using?  What are you trying to achieve?
what version of PHP are you using? Are you using 5.3+?

I don't understand. If you had your problem solved ... why did you post a question?
What programming environment is it being run in?  Have you turned up the compiler optimization?

That function doesn't compute the slope, which is why you're having the problem you are... Do you specifically need the slope, or is the upness or downness enough? Or do you actually want the ratio, which is what you're getting from your equation?
@rlemon: d'oh!  Let me guess only in IE?
it might depend on the actual definition of BYTE.
Maybe `TRUE` and `FALSE` are already defined, so your `#ifdef`-ed code is actually never executed?
Then you obviously have problem with your fwrite call. Could you provide the code you use?
Your title mentions relativity, but your question body does not. Could you resolve this for us please?

This feels like a duplicate of http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/217/should-i-keep-realbasic-on-my-resume and maybe we could make that question general. (Should I keep X on my resume?)
OK, but `$node->body` is an array yeah?  Can you just print it out like that?

Can you clarify what it is that you're trying to do?  What queries do you want to support?
Ah, well, I forgot that I also did subclass the view object associated with my NSCollectionViewItem subclass while I was working on this today. Perhaps that broke something?

Nice! Looks like a good book. Do you suppose you might be able to list some of the more advanced techniques they describe, or provide an excerpt?
-1 Why put "Urgent" in the title? Is your time more important than others?
@LarsOn: Excuse me? I don't understand a word you are saying?
Assuming for the moment that it's NOT a bug, it does make me think we could 'reverse engineer' the purposes of the different colors by shooting some test shots. What happens if you manually select a focus point, for example?
This has been tagged Civ-4, that seems to be the wrong game. Was a different tag intended?
@H.B.: Any chance the `f` was a unicode character instead of a standard f?

I'm not familiar with Australian laws, but I'd be surprised if there's anything there very different from similar laws elsewhere - answers would apply equally on other locales. Am I wrong about those laws?

What have you tried? What specifically have you looked at and why didn't it help you?
`a` cannot equal 2<sup>779</sup> in standard C or C++ unless you've defined a custom numeric type. If you do have one, why not just **try it**?
What's all the .strip() doing in the parsing rules? Shouln't your lexer take care of removing trailing whitespace?
@Jeff OK, OK. This is how wiki works though huh?
Must the cycles $C_1, \dots, C_n$ be left intact? Are we allowed to break these cycles?
Sorry @klox I don't understand. Could you explain a bit more?
ok your 1 step closer to getting help. Now what exactly is _NOT working_?
I presume you're using PHP as an Apache module? (Not CGI or running under IIS or something?)
Hello, Jacob Rockowitz; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. For which Drupal version are you interested?
Just curious if you're still having this issue. I assume that having your users type https://www.google.com/calendar doesn't fix the problem?
Naive question: why not sequential? What does it buy you?
What do mean by "theme"? a prompt theme?
"I've tried replacing butter with yoghurt in all of these and the results ere OK." - Didn't you just answer your own question?

@code i'm not getting your point here, could you elaborate a little bit? I see badges well wrapped on badge_counts key, why do you think they need to ble flattened?
I don't understand this question. Which dictionary, exactly, doesn't define "ain't"?
OK, I have to ask: *windowed mode!?* why not full-screen?
Hmm. So **We've a long way to go** in the UK, before we reach US linguistic standards? I know Americans favour inserting *got* there, but is that a closely-observed rule?

Thanks for the poking tip!  How long to cook?
I think that this question may be a bit to far off topic - even for me. But, why not try the [Biostar SE](http://biostar.stackexchange.com/)?
No actually the problem is that there is NO such header as iostream.h 1.#include <iostream> 2. instead of main() wwrite int main(). And third, before main after include write using namespace std; Still errors?
was the oil in the pan really hot?  did you add the batter with the pan on the heat or not?
you're right it doesn't install, I was waiting for that. But it sais that I can only login in an account with 200 points reputation, what's that?
Wait, I'm confused. Aren't you already a moderator?
You'll have to be much more specific. How are you escaping the text before entering it into the database?
is this a kind of Homework? and put some code that you have tried ?
I'd also add a question about how secure this erase procedure is... (i.e. is the data still stored on the phone's hard drive or not?)
why is the profile a different model from the user? wouldn't all the profile attributes be for the user?
I'm not quite sure why the size of your sample matters. Can you offer anymore specific reasoning as to why you think it is different for small n than it is for big n?
Is it transitive?  Does same_animal(a, b) && same_animal(b, c) imply same_animal(a, c)?
You should be more specific - do you need to send the value in the fastest way or in a 'fast enough' way?  How often are you reading the ADC?
@Jason Orendorff - Sorry, I meant just the response, the other was just a setup.  I would have suggested that *her* in *I told her* is the IO (with the implicit news of her father's death being the DO) If *her* is a DO in that sentence, what about *I told her the news*?
What do you mean by "more sophisticated"? Functions that take word boundaries into account?
Why must you sell the studded tires? Can't you just throw them in a closet during the summer, then remount them when winter rolls around?
Perhaps you haven't paid your Google bill this month.  I wonder if it's content related...are there any stop words in say one of the ads that displayed when the page was indexed?
Perhaps there's an error in your sitemap, but I can't see, because Stackoverflow blocks sitemap access to non-search-engines.  Could you add the relevant snippet from your sitemap to the question?
inBounds does just what you said, in my real implementation I dont use a visited array instead I use an integer and set bits in O(1) time to track what nodes have been visited, hence I said for the purpose of this assume copyOfAndSet is an O(1) operation as to not complicate the algorithm. Does that make sense?
Have you tried timing it, which part makes most time?
how much is the image size and how much you are cropping?
I don't see anything strange in the log you posted. What do you expect `NSTokenField` to do???
I don't have enough reputation. Can someone fix the spelling in the title?
Does the values for empty column on your sample data are store in the array as zeros? If so, how can you distinct the empty vs a user input zero ?
It's not clear what you're trying to do. Are you getting the input as a string using `raw_input()` or something similar?
@Eric no, this is hobby stuff. Why, does it make a difference?
Do you want a solution to the math problem? or just an O(1) (memory) algorithm to do the job?
@Mr.32: That depends. How does that 64-bit platform implement fseek?
Are you asking if there is some "Automatic" way to do this? Or if its possible at all?
I suspect you're not going to have much luck getting that question answered here.

(On the other hand, who knows what wisdom is lurking amongst the populace?)
what is the expected output? `[12,40,11,8,5,87]` ?
A quick google search shows lots of good free generators. Are you looking for anything in particular?
We do have "don't do" there. Do you?
@user12739 Give us more information please. What problem are you having exactly?
Assuming I don't have a masterlink, I assume I'd need to use a chain tool. (One of my multitools has one, I think.) Does pushing a pin out weaken the chain, or am I worried over nothing?
And NFS and DNS and other stuff too. Can you provide a breakdown by port?
You have 3-4 cups of juices left after a roast? How big was the roast?!
bring what back? how are bluetooth and killing processes related?

You are not talking about the **old** share button right? can you provide us the *other* blogs that have this special like plugin?
list b? I don't get it.. mind to explain more?
No reason what so ever. But what storage backend should I use that fits the bill?
Looks like Illustrator CS4 can be scripted with JavaScript, VBScript and AppleScript. Would be nice if you could get your hands on the script they used to create these ring maps, huh?
Now I realized that the title of the question contains yet another expression “email me,” which is not mentioned in the text of the question.  What is your question after all?
Worth noting that the Terminal app in OS X supports lots of windows and tabs. Does that not do it for you?
`rssFeed` ? Shouldn't it be `rss`?
I have the same issue.. This has worked for me in the past. Did you find a solution yet?
I just tried using your code verbatim and it's working correctly for me (label is correctly centered in view). Perhaps something else is interfering with it?
@Maxpm: This compiles for me in Visual Studios 2008. What compiler are you using?
Looks like you're passing null to an API parameter, particularly a null Overlay somewhere in a mapview probably. How are we supposed to know?
What have you tried? Have you read the documentation?
What is the (approximate) size of these two arrays? Is one much bigger than the other?
Suppose one of my recurring trips from City1 to City2 occurs on a Tuesday--a day when, say, there's currently *no* bus scheduled to run between those two cities. Should I be allowed to specify that kind of recurring trip?
What are you asking? How to modify a stored procedure using SQL, or how to send a SQL command to the server?
Oh I see; I misread it, sorry.  So you want to know number the number of equivalence classes (via their language) of DFA of size n?
Does that mean we're not allowed to ask WordPress questions on SO, even if they're legitimate programming questions?  Why the fragmentation?
could you describe the problems you are having? Are you logging the response codes?
Sorry but that is currently covered by NDA. Would my previous projects be satisfactory?
It didn't crash for me.  What errors are you getting when it crashes?
What is n? The number of edges or vertices?
That's a very appealing recipe by the way. Do you have a cast iron waffle iron? What are you using to cook them?
So do you have an idea about how you want to sense when the door is open or closed, or is that part of the question?
Also, would you say that you are primarily interested in when the door opens and closes, not in a "latch"?
how much current is your power supply rated for? what are you using?
do you mean that we may assume L1=range(1,n) and L2=range(1,m)?  I.e. each is a list of _all_ integers up to some point?
Which part are you having trouble with? Do you need help determining if there are new items, or do you need to know how to start an executable once you've determined that there are new items?
My first impression is that it is indeed with the StackPanel, since it's default is to "shrink" around elements.  Have you tried using a fixed size container and adjusting the width, if needed, as part of the animation?
Try using 'localhost' as your address. Does it work?
What exactly do you think `*k` should be? What would `k` point to?
putting the keyword (with special character) in quotes does not work. is there any other methods?
Is TBL#Sell2 empty before you copy the rows? Are all SellId in TBLSell empty before copy?
What's "Web of Knowledge"?  Where is this "javascript form"?
Well, what do your current results look like?  Is the glow you're talking about from the high brightness images having spillover (ie, pixels that would be black or dim in faster exposures are accumulating more light from nearby light sources in the slower ones, throwing off the HDR processing?)
I believe that almost all jQuery plugins can work with a ListView. Could you show any code where you attempt to use gallery with a ListView?
do you ever build without debug, e.g. a release config?
This feels familiar.  Homework?
I get confused about scope with this horde of niche sites.  Please explain:  A question about apple filesystems belongs on superuser?
@littleadv and what's so strange? if I have this program running over bilion times, what's so strange, do you mind answering?

I see a number of possible apps when I search in the Market for "mp3 tag". Did you try that?
@Greg Hewgill: Did I mention it above? Or I misunderstood your instruction?
@Sklivvz I'd recommend to edit the headline. As it is, and taken wordly, the only answer is: "Of course, what else?"
In addition to reformatting, can you try to provide some more info? Where are you stuck, what's going wrong?
That Roambi looks neat. Do you have links to other similar apps?
absolutely correct!!! UMM  what is in the blue J-box on back side of the wall???  possible junction location for an extension wire???
@Macha I also upgraded to Ubuntu 10, and it still works for me.  What terminal?
Not imageView1.image, imageView1. Did you connect in via an IBOutlet in Interface Builder or create it programmatically?
For a new project, I'd recommend either using Spring MVC, or using JSF2 and not having to deal with pure JSP.  JSP like that is heading towards legacyland...  Nothing *wrong* with using it, but why would you start a new project with it with better options available now?
not sure I am following, what excactly are you looking for? what is 'location' and what is expected output for your example (5,7,2,10,11,8,3) ?
@Gene Why is it that a handcrafted parser will beat a C++ parser generator?  Considering that writing a hand-crafted parser is a lot of code, isn't it possible that the hand-crafted parser could be much slower?
Is it at y=0? Did you setAutoResizingMask to UIViewAutoResizingMaskFlexibleBottomMargin?
*Find a random element* sounds like picking a random element. But I assume you want to find a *specific* element in the array, right?
That's true but I wanted to have a better view before I have to read the entire paper. So is SIFT a replacement for NCC or SAD?
Please enlighten me. How can a developer make doubly sure that his/her fix is correct if he/she can't reproduce the bug?
"without cycles"... "i need to find out the minimum numbers of cycles"? You mean chains, right?
I'm slightly unknowledgeable about CGI, seeing as it is stoneage technology I haven't used for almost 10 years, but.... Isn't that how CGI works? Like, per definition?
What is the pixel size of your JPEG file? Of the generated icon?
Really? What is the evidence that leads you to conclude that `';'` is interpreted as a sentence terminator?
The insertion of data into the hash seems to have nothing to do with your original creation of the hash. Why are you so reluctant to show us your code?
is extending pdo a bad thing? I had an independent mysqli class before but I was told better off extending mysqli so I thought it must be the same as pdo??
It's not clear that this is a programming question. What are you looking for?
Interesting question. Even if you didn't end up with a powder as a result- how can you make a stock or consume so pure that it doesn't taste like meat anymore?
It's really hard to find a good title for this. Maybe something like "Looking for a measurement of the time it takes the gas to attain equilibrium"?
@Georg : Anyway, I inended to answer both questions. Do you think I should edit my answer to make this clearer ?
@user052211 Glad to hear you got it sorted out.  Would you mind posting your solution as an answer so that other developers can reference it if they run into a similar problem?
@Trillian Oh bummer. What does "number tile complexities" mean?
Your question is too vague. What do you want to achieve exactly, and what did you already tried?
Never heard of this before. I guess you've already tried a full repair and it's still happening?
Is it possible that you're caching values that some code paths don't actually use?  Could you be caching things that are only used once?
@S.Lott: No, I'm saying that looking up the function is far from easy if the obvious search terms don't readily yield any insights. Am I missing something?
Can you show what you're written so far? Is there a specific roadblock you're encountering?
Truncated in DB max size 64 KB. How can I increase the max length?
Not sure I understand the question.  Are you looking for the domain from the `Request` object, user input, a constant, something else?
so what is your problem? You don't know how to copy the content?
Great idea on the mixed meat. I'll give a 50/50 a try. BTW, isn't much sausage cured ground beef?
How long can it possibly take to copy a ssh key to some remote system? Even over a dial-up line?
So, did you get it to startup?  What was it trying to do?
I have an application.xml file but not sure how exactly how to use it. Have I missed some settings?
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by the second sentence. Would you try and reword it?
`DateTime` is not a built-in class in Java SE. Where does this type come from?
Niveau? Do you mean level?
Please re-word the part "How can I determine the point of view, using three angles and the radius". What is the radius in this case?
@IVlad: yup, but the current answers fail to explain why. Care to write a better one?
Can you explain what you are trying to do? The *whole point* of the Null Object Refactoring is *not* to use `nil`, so why would you want to inherit from `NilClass` for that?
I'd guess it's an archaic past tense of "to owe", i.e. "Which you owed yesterday"?
I understand the auditing, but I'm a bit puzzled about the purpose of the beanMap and why you extract string valued properties. Can you explain what you want to achieve?
ya it is! am i not supposed to ask hw questions here?
define 'normal stovetop' ... gas or electric ?
@Bruce: I think you're reporting a quick google result, since you omit sharing features of D7.2, why anyone would extend D7, or why anyone owning a D7 license like me would have wanted such an extended version in 2003. Did you also find all the other versions of Delphi usually found on torrent sites?
The body of the question is fine, but the title is a bit confusing.  Perhaps the title could be, "Which states allow bicyclists to legally treat stop signs as yields?"
What exactly do you want to know? Equipment tips, location tips, landscape photography tips?
Post that part (filesystem events) as a separate question. Is the output of `os.listdir()` always what you expect it to be?
A _variable_ has scope; an _object_ has a lifetime. What exactly are you asking about?
Unsuitable? How so?
If you can edit your reply and add the answer to the question please, Is viewState really important? and if I want to hand code it will it be a difficult process?
That is the correct way (AFAIK) for embedding a thumbnail into an RSS feed. What result are you seeing and what result would you expect?
I agree, more info needed.  Is it PHP, .NET, straight HTML, or something else?
What is your measure of distance here? Path length in the tree?
BQP-complete? Can someone cite a BQP-complete problem please?
Is there a specific question you have?  Or were you just looking for a code review?
Nothing. Remember Kevin Mitnick and Bernie S.?
@Andrew Bolster: "listofthings in the actual implementation is coming from the parent".  Why can't you make this `thing` method a part of the parent and simplify this design?
What phone are you on? Sounds like you could be using HTC's Contacts app, as I'm pretty sure the stock Android Contacts app always syncs everything in the phone's store to GMail, and only gives you the option to save to SIM or Phone?
Why do you mean by "release" and "delete" here? Does "delete" mean usage of `delete`, or erasing from the map?
That's a strange description. Do you mean that the graph is a tree?
Could you provide a *minimal* example that reproduces the problem? Do you really need to load all those packages to get the bug to kick in?

Please clarify your question. What does "This results in windows 7 with the following icons" mean?
What language is the Sql Client, what kind of data access? ADO.Net, ODBC, an ORM?
Do we know each number only occurs once? The questions states it wants the exact location of the number, what if there are multiple locations, do we return the first one we find?
Do you need to make the requests from the server? Why not have the client do it?
You better deal with it soon... Some people need more relaxation than others or they will drop dead. *(Chest pains anyone?)*
I don't get it - you say that there are two error messages popping up - that's what a UIAlertView is! Can you post a screenshot of the error message and add the code in your didFailWithError: to your question please?
With as many website/server/API driven apps are out there, you rarely don't want to upgrade. Could I ask why you don't want to upgrade, or why you want to preserve your current version?
I'm doing this all the time and it works out of the box. Could you post a minimal example?
@ime Vidas JSLint is mostly telling me that I am calling functions before they are defined. Are these warnings that I should be concerned with?
Did you try an iisreset? Maybe an old version of your assembly is still in cache?
whats the question? and why isn't this tagged as homework?
it seems you are posting some parameter named `imagename` from your code, and you are trying to find path of that parameter ?? confusing, Or  if you are uploading the file and you want the path to file from client????
How are you going to decide the right answer? Who will earn +50 reputations?
no offense, kid, but you're trying to build a chess game and are struggling to put labels on a board? Don't you think this kind of program is a little bit out of your league?
what do you mean with "WCF hosted" ? can you provide sample or references ?
Please mark homework as such.  Have you tried talking to your professor yet?

"graphical graph"? Or "graphical models"?
I thought compilation warnings shouldn't affect the outcomes of compilation. Aren't there any additional error messages you that you left out?
I don't understand what you mean by 'all pairs'.  Say you have three coordinates (x, y, and z) such that x dominates y and y dominates z.  Is your answer ((x,y), (y,z), (x,z)) ?
You said "Error while trying to...". What was the exact error?
You get a stack overflow exception?  What are the top few calls on the stack at the time?

Should `second highest` be `second_highest`? Is there a loop?
Which operating system? (Sounds like some flavor of Linux?)
Those are not runtime errors, they're from the linker!  As Richard Pennington suggests, there's probably a problem with the way you're building it under Unix -- perhaps linking against the same library twice?
Are you interested in operations such as `Add(x, y) - add an interval to the tree`, `Query() - find the maximum number of overlapping intervals`? Do you also want `Del(x, y) - delete the interval [x, y] from the tree`?
@George, what's the key thing needed to make the widgets? And how do the wf_ functions work?
Get rid of everything except the first die() line. Do you see any output?
The same as you already wrote in your first example. What should the result be?
Is the rectangle parallel to the X and y axises? Or can the rectangle be turned in 2D space?
what do you mean combined? overlapping area?
Is it an ordered list? Ie, will the cells appear in the order of the indicies, or no?
If so, that's a hell of a perf hit to take just to show the user a moving progress indicator. Why not just show a spinning ball or similar while the file is copying?
Why have you cut out the interesting bit from the Apache confs? Where's the `ServerName`/`ServerAlias` stuff?
Do you have a typo in equation (1)? Right now the second part of (1) involves the second derivative of theta with respect to theta...should one of those thetas be a y?

What's the relation between the classes Main and File2 ? (which one does inherit from which one ?)

polynomial in terms of m?  Or the total number of elements across all Z?
karthick, that was a great answer. Could you please add some info on OCRFeeder to mark it as the accepted answer?
Your current solution may work but doesn't make sense to do it that way just so you can skip typing a class name.  What is the problem with using the class name?
Same problem here. Can you still remember how you got rid of it?

I have done a gridView with images that show a spinner and download image.. When download is complete, the image shows? Interested?
Have to agree with @Aubergine here. Why not make us a place to find hints about getting through some of the levels?
Btw, after answering I realized I wasn't clear about something - is this referring to Local Administrator, or e.g. Domain Admins?
Can you give some more information, context, etc? What "default password" are you talking about?
Is there an explicit reason you can not simulate data yourself (i.e. why you can not make your own gold standard and see how changing reference systems impacts this)?
In what way has it "disappeared"? Do you mean it no longer appears as a shortcut icon on the home screen?
Just try the first instruction - `MOVE *R2, R1` - read the comment next to it - it pretty much tells you all you need to know. What do you think the result of this instruction will be ?

How are you launching the debugger? Via the respective properties of your project or via attaching the debugger to the w3p.exe process?
Also, are all of those examples supposed to be sent through the subject line? Furthermore, what happens if I include something in the message body?
Since in essence the nesting in a lmer makes it a repeated measures design is there a way in which your question about the appropriate confidence interval around the effect size is related to the question in repeated-measures ANOVA about which measure of effect size to report?  Specifically, it is unclear whether the error term should include subject variance or not (etc)?
On a HTML document? Are you referring to a screenshot?
So resizing of an image can be only done proportionally, right? I can't resize an 8x10 to 8x8 without cropping?

"I've found these packages being imported by the model:" The model? To what do you refer?
I think the `[special-relativity]` tag could be dropped from this, since although the theory of Dirac fermions requires SR "behind the scenes" in order to be consistent, we're not talking about relativity directly. Did you have a particular reason for including the tag?

@robertc - thanks for the reply. I don't know how to answer your question - what should I look for?
You know, the codes are there to prevent things like, say, your house burning down or your family being electrocuted. Even if you COULD get away with letting code violations ride, why would you want to?
I'd like to know why someone voted to close this as Off-Topic.  Can you please explain your reasoning?
Surely your classes have at least introduced basic entity relationship modelling to you already?  I can't see them giving you this project without some kind of basic coursework...  Are you sure this isn't a case of just skipping read the textbook/lecture notes?
I am not sure, its a Google interview question, I saw it initially at http://www.careercup.com/question?id=7263132 ....  It feels like that the question meant worst-case time bounds. Does it seem impossible?

@Darin Dimotrov: So you're saying that if I sent you to the supermarket to get me some beer, you will tell me you can't buy beer in a supermarket, while you actually *mean* you don't know which brand of beer to buy and whether to buy a single can, a sixpack or a tray. Would't it be better to just ask more specifically what I want, instead of telling me it's impossible?
Can you explain your question a bit more, since if each node keeps track of nodes it is connected to, it looks like you have a graph that has connnected components, and for each node type, find the number of connected components that node type is found in, the one present in most connected components is the type that has the longest unconnected chain. is that what you meant?

looks like problem with xorg or video driver. does it happen outside of the terminal?
I suggest re-titling the question, as this has nothing to do with ebay.  Perhaps a title like "How can I secure my PHP website?".

Where would I find paramount crystals???
When you say concatenate, do you mean overlay them (put them in the same place) or put them next to each other?  If you mean overlay, what do you want to happen when two pixels are at the same spot -- how do you want transparency to be handled?

What error did you get? Also can you provide what code your using to connect?
Just a note, the code snippet actually works so I am thinking that there is something inside my SomeObject (the full code and not the snippet) that is causing it to autorelease. Can an object autorelease itself without have been told to?

@lasseespeholt: I see. If I may ask, what else do you need?
@Koper, in order to program this algorithm, I need to understand what the algorithm does. How is it *not* related to programming?

This begs the question: why? What purpose does the element serve?
How sparse is the matrix?  Does the matrix have any special shape, or relationship between entries?
@g0d1anier: I'm just curious, is there a reason you want to use multithreading for this? It seems to me that your program will be completely I/O bound so you're adding a lot of complexity for little benefit?
Could it be that you're adding same transaction observer more than once (i.e. for each `addPayment:` statement)?
Just curious, who asked a question like that? Did you apply for a math heavy position without knowing what FFT is, or did you apply for a "normal" job and they asked you this?
Why "arrested" in the title? "Given a ticket" makes more sense, I would think?
What exactly have you tested? You tested for the value you expect, I understand?
Why -1?
what wrong with ppl here?
Can you elaborate? An example maybe?
I've also got this problem, rebooting or cleaning does not help.  Did you get to the bottom of this?
@RHPT, that completely changes things, so please edit it into the original question. If this project is a success, is it likely to change Schuyler's opinion of its importance?
"Debug" and "Release" don't have specific meanings; they are just ways of referring to a bundle of options, which could be different in different projects. Do you mean whether something was build with debugging symbols and left unstripped?

Could you be a bit clearer ?  How is your line represented ?
@genneth please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the inverse effective mass given by an expression of the form $m^{-1} = \partial^2 E(k)/\partial k_a \partial k_b $, where $E(k)$ is the dispersion relation, $k_a, k_b$ are directions in momentum space, and for simplicity we assume that $m^{-1}_{ab} := m^{-1}$? So given the energy spectrum of Aluminum one can calculate the effective mass for any excitation of momentum $k$ in its brillouin zone?
What an interesting idea. I'll ponder it more. Have you ever seen this done for real?
ah sorry missed that. anything suspicious in your `.zshrc`?

Have you considered a Dremel tool? Or is it not a fine enough cut?
when it comes to unit testing I want to be able to renew the singleton object before every test. This is one of the arguments against singletons. Does this object really need to be a singleton in the first place?

I am more than happy to be overruled (and can reopen the question), but this discussion should take place on meta, not in this comment feed. Why don't you initiate a discussion there ?

What version of Exchange server is this? <= 2003 or > 2003?
@TheHorse: I posted a DP solution paper which solves it in O(f(n)*8^n). Does that answer your "what if" question? :)
well... where is the problem? what results *are* you getting?
Could you expand the abbreviation so it is concretely understood? What is PES?
I'd prefer it to be more generic, but that it SHOULD include the UK. Surely there must be Mint.com clones that have worldwide coverage?
Thank you for your answer.I'm a beginner in Android so can you please explain what the meaning of root the phone and set it as S-OFF? also, how shall I do it?
I alfred.  What model (on your data) do you use to estimate the mean and SE ?
At least I am quite sure I need to keep my sourcecode available to anyone if I use the GPL library, and according to the discussions here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4577044/complying-with-the-gpl-in-an-iphone-app - we cannot distribute any GPL application on the Apple App Store too. So it seems that the GPL license is really quite troublesome and I hope there are other options?
Nice project. Got any videos or pictures of the output?
My answer would be: What kind of lame ass product searches for palindromes in a string. May I take a closer look at your business plan, please?
So, what does your ActionListener-Method? Does it simply call `updateTable()`, but does nothing with the result?
What is the frequency (i.e. is it weekly,monthly, quarterly, annual data) ?
Bike planes? Do you mean bike lanes?
this question title is a bit misleading, because of the existence of this question: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1295/sat-solver-download . I think you might rephrase as 'Best Upper Bounds on SAT' ?
Why're you referring to Jon Skeet as 'it'? Are you alleging he's not human? :)
It might help to give some details about the problem, other than general "it works in debug but not in release."  What is "it", what is "it"?
Fire rating is usually measured in minutes.  Do you have an idea of how long you want to contain a fire?
Everyone knows that umpiring is deterministic. ...right? :D
I added a contains spoiler tag because I didn't know about any secret mission.  Maybe we could use this tag for questions that contain spoilers on the side?
Why would you copy an egg? Did not introduced yourself to `virtualenv` yet?
I tried that..still no use. Is the code I posted in the end better then others ?
This is basic C++ syntax. Are you learning from a [good introductory book](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list)?
looks like it's a conflict with the Prototype library, which we introduced in the newer version. Any ideas how to stringify a json object containing an array under Prototype?
Sorry, I'm not sure I follow. How can I do that when I can't even boot into Ubuntu?
sorry, no idea what the code should do. Is the selected in the db or what?
Windows, Python 2.6, Cython 0.14, Gcc 4.5.1. Could you post your 2d code?
IsPalindrome is a useful function? For whom? ;-)
I'm sorry, I do not completely understand the question. Is your problem *calculating* the damage or *showing* the damage?
Your code is missing the `find_current_round` subroutine. Could you post it as well?
You may break up to three sets trying to form a street (or the other way around). Is that ok?
I am not sure I fully understand the question, is it like having to make 2 piles of different units that will be the closest in total construction time ? With the only constraint that piles cannot exceed 5 elements?
Can you provide an example of how `$tree` is structured? Also, what version of PHP?
It makes a difference if they are sorted in ascending or descending order.  Which is it?
Thanks. are you suggesting that might be the source of my problem, or is just a general best practice?
Modules are required to return a true value when being loaded. Why not let a faulty plugin return zero when initialization fails?
Any progress I'm having similar problems with the result from a query. Should we add an Idea on ESRIs website that we can vote up?
How connected is the figure?  Is there a path between any two squares (without using diagonals)?
Don't let that link get to the agile evangelists, they will ROTFLOL in the best Weird Al style. You put a ton of work in a feature and only after its almost DONE you get feedback from the primary consumer, guess what happened?
Am I correct in thinking that you only are interested in paths having minimum edge count across all paths?  I.e. if there exists a path with weights (2, 2, 2), you're not interested in the path (5, 6, 7, 8), right?
Which O/S? Are you asking how to write/architect the user-defined code, how to compile it, or how to load it after it's compiled?
You need to define your scope. Do you plan to use this on *many* words?
Can't you just generate the HTML code in a manner that marks the blocks which can be hidden with divs? Why are you bound to that representation?
the use of low level code does not guarantee that there will be no failure in its execution, so the validation tests should always be made. Your implementation does not have any report of failure?
I hope I've translated this okay; please check it. Also I'm guessing your version of Ubuntu is 10.10 (as opposed to 10.04)?
Hi, thanks for the bounty. I wonder, did things turn out OK?
Can you explain why {{1,2},{3,4}} is not "interesting"? What is the relabeling that gives the same section?
What is a ROC curve? Could you please provide a link?
For #2: May there ever be two edges directly connecting node _X_ to node _Y_? For #5: does this mean that properties A and B are numeric/summable?
You really should give us more information. How does the user create an account for example?
Depends upon what you mean by 'point'.  Do you want to just redirect traffic from http://example.com/app to http://example.com:8080/app (and thus exposing port 8080 to external traffic) or do you want to hide the existance of Tomcat behind Apache, by running all requests through Apache to Tomcat, and returning all results back from Tomcat through Apache to the user?
Where is `$valueToUnserialize_or_stringMessage` coming from? What do you want to unserialize?
@Russell - 30 pages is a lot, and I guess it will have some noise in it too. Can't you just post the gist of it here?
This seems rather subjective to me, as well as being possibly too wide-ranging. Wouldn't "How to make a good game", even for just 1 genre, seem to be a book-length topic?
Loading it into a frame also seems to work for me: http://testing.subdmedia.com/loadinggifframe.html. Can you post the full code for the iframe as well as well as the content, or better yet, a link to your test?
What are the constraints? That is is one temp variable too much?
Did you try writing something in an attempt to implement this? If so, what happens when you run it?
Why do you use mysql (2.8.1) ? I think you can't use both for one application, do you have this 2 gems in your GemFile ?
What part of that is supposed to be case insensitive? The comparison with "Alaska"?
Do you mean that you can't scroll all the way to the last `treeview node`? Are you adding items dynamically?
That's a big topic. Is there something specific you're having trouble with, or do you need ideas of where to start?
This question basically tells me nothing about what the actual problem is. Also, what's a "pathway"?
you need to clarify the question.  Are you talking about generating a DC voltage from the PWM?
I don't see why you would prefer academic papers over actual solutions. For example, have you looked at how Doxygen  does this?
Please be a little specific - "best" differs amongst various users. What features specifically are you looking for?
I can't find any API documentation. Can you provide it?
Please clarify what you mean by 'sub-info'.  Are you referring to the $info_results array?
What do you mean by 'documents'? Something that looks like a report or just a spreadsheet full of numbers?
@Matt No it's not, because hashes are not encryption. Better would be "Can I find the preimage for a hash?"
There are actually a lot of different ice-cream maker recipes that will produce very different overruns; can you specify how you're preparing yours?
What can you tell us about the keys (e.g. are they consecutive)?
I don't think I'll ever understand the "subjective and argumentative" thing for community Wikis. If nobody's getting rep, what harm does it do ?
Even if the references to "Get a car" all point to the same object, the references still show up multiple times in the data structure.  Do you have a flag on each Action and/or Task to indicate that it has been completed, and does not need to be executed again?
High level questions are fine, but this one is really broad. It would help if you could narrow your question to something a little more specific or provide more context?
@Lukas I'm faced with a similar problem at the moment. Did you ever find a good solution?
Never needed to coat the inside of a frame, WD40 is useful to get any water out. I suppose car wax could work?
I usually just boil water and then drink but I think it won't help here. Does it?
so, the metrics should be Sigma(#friends_in_group(u)) for each u in USERS ? [only for legal solutions] ?
Umm.. *what* means it is connected to GPRS? Sorry, I lost you — which part of the question are you referring to?
What is a string pointer? Can you give some example about the input and the expected output?
Does the command lines work when ran from python manage.py shell? Does the pb occur when the site is served with python manage.py runserver?
$N$ is not know? Could you please confirm?
using Win32::API is not a goal in itself; you are trying to do *something* with the Win32::API. What is your ultimate goal?
dmckee:  I'm actually using Welford's Method for the standard deviation.  But I don't see anything in that link about mode, median, kurtosis, or skewness...  Am I missing something?
Do you have a specific question ? E.g. which part are you having difficulty with ?
so the string *can* start with "USD" and/or "$" followed by digits; optionally followed by "," or ".", followed by more digits?
I'm somewhat confused by the question. Aren't you transmitting the SSN in plaintext anyway?
are the images stored in the same base folder that the jquery is in? or are they in a different folder?
There's a basis for your hypothesis: see http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/4115/problem-with-fluorescent-lighting-and-shutter-speed for examples and a discussion.  Do you also see color shifts towards yellow or green?
@Mr. C - taped-together printouts? You mean, no endless paper?
What does your source table look like? Does that have forenames and surnames split out?

What do you mean with evenly? Outside evenly brown, or inside evenly done?
i just want to know the logic of how this can be done. or if anybody can show with simple example for this calculation?

Seriously, have you tried Googling for "home automation"?
i can input number, number1. skips to letter2 why?
@Jim: That is the declaration of the function, it is not called. Where is `printme` called?
it is exactly what I want. please how can I do this ?
@rinogo: most programs I've ever written to process XML would throw an exception on malformed XML. Does that count as "failing in a diff/patch scenario"?
You want to move -4 (0xfc) to al? and move 0x01 to ah?
where does the $ID variable coming from? are you sure it's a valid ID?
So, your tests run really fast. How long does compiling and linking the test take?
Why not using `isnan()` from math.h? Any specially reason?
Is assuming op(b,a) > op(c,a) for all b > c also allowed? (Is op(a,b) = op(b,a) like for add&mul?)
Did you ever get this resolved successfully? Do you still need help with this?
How are you grilling them? High heat? Low and Slow? How long does it take to cook them on the grill?
This kinda seems like a recipe request to me.  Is there something other than bad spinach that you're trying to solve?
This has since been part of the site. Is it still useful?
I am not an expert but I found the sentence "controlling for associated subscores when devising cut-off scores on each dimension of a measurement scale" a bit esoteric. Can you give me one more line of explanation (otherwise I found it difficult to understand the question) ?
As far as I'm aware, the only Canon 200mm with Image Stabiliser (IS) is the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM... but that was released in 2008? There's 300mm f/2.8L and f/4L both with IS, or 200mm f/2.8L or f/1.8L without IS which this might be?
@hippietrail: Truncated how? and on what OS?
first thank you all for your answers second i cant understend jim why you think i try to make fun of you? and last how i mark that the problem solved?
Maybe you should give an example of the array too? As I understand, you want to delete entries from an array, using only php no JS?
Please elaborate on what you mean by "calling directly" and "from another class". Which object is making this call in the first case?
Have you considered performing a simple test measuring how long it takes your cold water to boil versus warm water?
Oh, and since this is a story-telling kind of topic, shouldn't this be CW? (Does it need 30 answers first, and can users with rep<100 still answer then?)
before I compose my answers to your questions, could you please explain what you mean by *"Lay a new thin layer of **gyps** (or some other material)"?* Also, would you be opposed to the new "concrete" screed layer being your finished balcony surface?
@cantrem: Yes, that's what I meant, just a direct rebuild after it fails. What happens if you change any other line and try to recompile?
Why are you installing rubygems 1.3.7 and watir 1.6.5. Why don't you install a current version of rubygems and watir gems?
Python says: `NameError: global name 'a' is not defined`. Did you mean `ip_header_sum = ~ip_header_sum & 0xFFFF` ?
Could you please elaborate on the problem ? What is happening when you try to access some https site ?
So you mean you just can't use date functions, yes? Presumably comparison, multiplication and subtraction are okay? :-)
works fine here. are you maybe missing a step of going through a proxy or something?
Doesn't doxygen do exactly this? Or am I mistaken?
Why 5 things? Why not 3 or 7?
If the period register is 0, it probably never matches and so it never triggers the interrupt.  With PR2 line uncommented, can you trigger on a breakpoint set inside the interrupt routine?
I saw that you have a great answer from DisgruntledGoat. Did he not answer your question fully?
To answer the second part of your question, you would have to define what you mean by "cook".  What exactly are you doing to cook them?
That makes me wonder what algorithm inbuilt tablediff utility uses ? Anyone ?
@Mark: Could you clarify something please?  You start by remarking that there is an undecidable problem P that is recognizable, and then observe that if HALT were decidable then we could construct a decider for P.  However, in the texts I have read, things are proved in the other order--the undecidability of HALT is used to demonstrate the existence of such problems P.  Can you show the existence of undecidable yet recognizable problems without using the undecidability of HALT?
Debug adds lots of overhead to a program. Why are you assuming things are wrong?
I installed it using pacman, but it still shows the error. It's written "Please install the build..." so do I also need to build it, or do I just need to reboot?
this has nothing to do with C#.  Why did you add it as a tag?
@Gaim: Better, but you still haven't stated what OS this is for, or what programming environment you're using. And where did the address of _printf come from ?
is the image changed via JavaScript? If so just get the title of the new image once it's set and copy it into your div?
Shouldn't it be then reasonable to expect you to ask how are you DOING? / I'm doing good, instead of how are you?
"Say I want to estimate a large number of parameters" this could be made more precise: What is the framework ? I guess it is linear regression?
Your question, as it stands, is difficult to understand. What do you mean by "referred to" ?
Sorry, I got a bit confused. Actually, how did you build a station with this configuration?
Is this for a one-time transaction, or something you want to be convenient for repeated use?  If you use a password-based scheme, how do you plan to get the password to them?
cool, thanks for the input. Is the ts-2 more efficient because you don't have to flip the wheel?
Hi Serith - sorry, my question was badly worded - I've amended it now. I am looking to delete bookmarks within folders in the bookmarks bar - any ideas?
Are you asking how to use csv?  http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html  What's wrong with the documentation?
If an object is cv::Mat, I can perform any linear algebraic, image processing, ... operations. What can I not do with it? :-)
Ummm...what? Can you please clarify your answer?
Just curious, how much did the leveling job cost?
@belisarius: Without trying to understand it, what is it's complexity? And how does it compare to a solution using merge sort then simple traversal (which would be `O(n log n)`)?
Sorry for maybe stupid question but what do you mean by "commandline command"? You mean that one in psql?
Oops, sorry about that. Delete?
Quick question... when you define a custom command, is there a way for it to receive arguments? For example: `'/dosomething arg1 arg2'` ?
not sure I agree with your premise, most of the open source raster software I'm familiar with stores data in files directly. Are their specific features of Image Server you're interested in?
To answer that we need to know what you want to do with it.  What are your goals?
Can you explain more in detail, what should I sddelat? Allocate a job? How?
Or for example mention what stat package you are using ? (R, SAS, SPSS, etx ?)
@Shane I'm using Rscript. How are you loading your scripts?
What kind of generator have you tried? What do you mean by "didn't get any success"?
Please can you add more information as to what you want "inner protected world" to mean? are we talking about a ring of planets, some sort of mental sanctum, or something interdimensional, or something completely other?
When you say "single page", you mean when you view a blog post page? And when you say "page template", you mean when you view a blog "page", like About Us?
seems like gettimeofday issue on linux. maybe your kernel has some extra configurations for timer?
How does one close Grindstone manually?  Can you emulate this in code?
Sorry what has blender to do with game engines? do you want to use its format?
While I don't want to discourage non-technical questions, I can't see how this one can possibly be answered, other than "it depends", or possibly "when the artist is dead". Maybe it could be rephrased as "What are approaches for defining the scope of a photographic project?"
I agree with viksit- it sounds like a hashtable is what you want. Is there a reason you want to use a B-tree?
I'm not clear about this, if you're asking for a cryptographically secure random number generator - even with certain additional constraints - then that's easy, just tell us which platform/language you're on. If you're asking for something else - then it's not clear, and why would you ask on ITsec?
It should be. What happens when you try it?
These are side-pull caliper brakes. The correct title for this question is something like "How do I make my brakes stop squealing?"
you cannot change an email address. Are you talking about the display name ?
So does jail breaking an iphone consist of changing file system and directory permissions or is it more complex?  If so, does anyone know the low level technical details?
@DVK in O(1)  space? - where does the count for each element fit?
2.5D? Is that what people call projected 3D nowadays?
Hah, yea I know, there isn't a good option.  The aversion is fallout from all those 'Can somebody suggest a good walk around lens?'
RS422/485 do not have a clock, they're asynchronous. So... what?
Can you clarify what "down" means? Have you turned on the display of error messages to see if anything is generated?
Perhaps showing some more of your code would help us help you? Also what the file hierarchy look like for relevant files?
are you talking about debugging the actual stored procedure itself? and is the stored procedure managed code or TSQL?
please provide an example illustrating your problem. Also how do you define power of algorithm?
I'm not sure what your problem is. Aren't you sure about how to automatically data bind it?
Quite unclear. Maybe `my_hash.each{|k, v| puts k}` ?
what is a cup tree?  you want to draw up some kind of tournament bracket in HTML?
sound weird to me, why do you need to unmount? what's wrong with just shutdown?
Ok, so if you can't fond the correct tires for your car, you'll prefer to re-invent the wheel? Won't you change your tire-dealer?
Are there any duplicate values? Do you know the range of values (i.e., 1 < x < 300)?
"pyparsing" appears to be a word specific to Python.  Is there a more general programming term for that type of action?
Is there any specific element you're targeting? Could you put together a sample structure?
@leppie so this is ambigious? Why? Because of the loop?
Sorry but I'm more or less a total kid in Linux-land.  Any way you could provide more detailed instructions or point me to a tutorial or link?  TIA!
mod_perl? Plack?
Would 'volatile' really have that effect in C? Don't you mean 'register'?
Helluva interview question. What kind of position were you applying for to get a question like this?
What is the context that `initialize` is called?  It claims to be the "Starting point for the program" -- is a call made from `__main__` that returns the return code of this function?
`transistors`?  `transistor-level`?
Not a trivial task for homework. Did you not get any advice from the teacher on how to proceed?
I'm sorry, but I don't think we can help you with this request. We ruled recommendation questions to be out of scope of the site; this includes "is there such a thing as X?"
It works without errors. Can you please add a [minimal example](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228/1235) that illustrates your problem?
How do you compare strings? strcmp()?
It sounds like you want to change the code that is generating this JSON. Can you show us the relevant PHP code?
The question is not clear. Why would you need to remove a newline to read the second statement?
@Herbert: Still I think your answer is very confusing. Can you please make it clearer that you're suggesting two completely different solutions, and indicate what is needed to make them work?
Okay, but everything has to do with physics. Is there a survival.SE? :)
Could you please clarify both 'integral' and 'interesting' a bit? They're subjective, which is why this is appropriately CW. The molecular cooking should make the dish a more intense version of the dish, not something gimmicky, is that your point?
well, what are you getting instead? What is the problem?
Is there any real world current sources? How can I implement a current source from a voltage source?
Can you please be more specific instead of saying 'often said'. Can you cite references, and also expand on why the issue is relevant ?
time is a timestamp to make different IDs for each object. 
This code gets executed when a box is created, so the selector is the name of the box which has just been created, what do you mean by every possibile selector?
It may be redundant in source, but is it redundant in binary? Is it a good practice to always check code like this because although all statements depend on the ones before them (in program flow), the program flow may change from any number of sources?
If that's really your code... looks like you're going to end up with a ton of HTML UL elements with the same ID of 'day'.  Does your real code actually output one UL with multiple LI children?
Sorry nevermind I found the option for it :) 

Without having much knowledge of Wordpress, do you know how I'd go about combining image map within the fancybox with some custom jQuery to trigger events based on the area clicks?
wait... what? Since there's only one actual neutral connection coming into the box, that one has to somehow connect to all five lamps, doesn't it?
If the rows are independent, why bother looking at it as a matrix?  Just consider one row at a time... Or am I missing something?
Is it because the result of startActivityForResult(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,
         android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI), 1); can only be processed in a thread?
I don't see "parent" at all. Maybe it exists in your templates?
what is the metrics? if there is no perfect solution, how do you evaluate which solution is better then the other?
Are you 100% sure that the planks in your hardware store never got treated with chemicals?
Sorry Allen...Have you been able to reproduce the users problems ? do you trust the user ?
Seems like this is a cooking method question.  What type of appliance do you use to roast your beef and why?
Are those backticks (`) surrounding the column names and table name?  Did you try the query with regular single-quotes (')?
Perhaps you could explain why you believe that these *should* be related? Do you have any evidence that supports this belief?
Did you build the wheels for your car on your own, or you bought the ready ones from the store? If you didn't reinvent the wheels literally, why are you considering it metaphorically?
I can't replicate this at all. Maybe try flipping the hardware switch or Fn+F5 (or whatever your key is)?
It's great..!! Any plans for an iPad specific version?
I could not figure out how to make this view. Can you elaborate on this please, or refer me to a suitable link?
what do you want to do after adding them? re-concatenate?
Avogadro's number ($6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$) and Boltzmann constant ($1.38 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$) are two totally unrelated constants. You want to estimate both?
any code? or do we have to guess at how you did it?
Hyphenation in English is a pain (and worth a PhD thesis or two) but I remember learning the Castillian hyphenation rules in school as a child, so it would seem to be much simpler (unless I'm missing something, of course).  Is hyphenation in Asturian all that different from Castillian?
Not related to your Question but is Visual Studio 6 supported on Vista? & isn't JIT just for managed code?
It could simply be that the previous owner of your domain had questionable content. Did you dig wayback / cache to check?
What do you mean by your if statements doesnt work? It cant find that specific character in the string?
I dont get it, shouldnt the type-1 area of the first matrix [[0 1 2 2] [0 1 1 2] [0 3 0 0]] be

 [[0 1 2 2] [0 1 1 2] [0 **0** 0 0]] ?
I rephrased a bit to make the intent I read in the original more clear. @wdypdx22 what do you think?
@mike: Could you edit the title of this question to be more descriptive? Maybe something like "Current flow in batteries?"
So the usages are quoted .. and from a 34-year-old *professor* no less!??! What is this world coming to?
Do you know any of your classmates? Maybe ask one of them? :)
What do you mean it is still running?  Is it not at 100%?
If this were lisp, the solution would be to use map: (map + '(100 100) '(2 3)) => (102 103). Maybe Ruby has a similar function?
A regular expression here seems like overkill.  Why not just `explode('#','http://blah.com#removethis',2)[0]`?
What do you mean by incrementally? Do you whant to add all permutations in a List or do you want a function that produce the next permutation from the given string ?
Do you mean braces, brackets or both? Many interpretations- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket Argument list, code body, or both (the entire expression?
Ah the error says a location is not trusted. How do I fix this?
turkistany:  you're asking for a proof that P!= NP? :)  Or do you mean the algorithm in restricted in some sense?
Nice. Could you please link back to the source?
Is it really? Windows aside, I'd like to see some comparison of security of the default OS X install vs default installs of various Linux distros - do you know of something like that?
I find these methods quite unnecessary.  What's the advantage of using these over the very trivial comparisons?
@Niall: That sounds as if you have a current direction and a new (absolute) angle and want to know the new direction vector. So you are just trying to take the absolute compass angle and work out the new direction (with the old direction being irrelevant)?
Why is it an HTML file? Also can you please show the JSON?
Looks like you're off to a good start.  What problem are you having?
There have been disruptions and outages on Twitter over the last few days (more than usually, that is). Are you sure what you are seeing is independant of that?
@Chin: As Peter said, you should clarify the scope of your test. What do you want to achieve with your test (performance, throughput, scalability)?
Why not just generate the autocompletion configuration based on your YAML file? The options won't be changing all the time so why bother trying to make the autocompletion configuration dynamic?
It's a snippet, but mostly of where the action is. Suggestion to fix?
@serhio I'm afraid 'obtain it' is not entirely clear. What problem are you having exactly?
We'll need a little more code to help! The fact that you declared it inside a UIView shouldn't make any difference at all; can you put a breakpoint inside your UIView to prove that the code is actually running?
Can you show the actual event handler and the declaration of the handling object? (that one with "WithEvents")?
Can you describe the problem in more detail?  Maybe upload a screenshot or two?
But make sure you have the right (error) line. What happens when you remove that last Requires?
What kind of files are we talking about? Can you elaborate what you mean by "hardlink" in this case?
Brownout (or, conversely, surges) could be possibilities, but you'd need to take some measurements before an EE can really make any comments.   Do you have a logging DMM?
So you think it's a good idea to dump your homework here without any attempt at solving it from your side and expect us to do your work? Also: which assembler language are we talking about?
@Georg: Yes. Did you read my comments?
Also I do not think that the constraint if you have a choice you always prefer right to forward, and forward to left is well-defined.  What prevents you from turning right 100 times before starting?
Your question currently doesn't make any sense as it is worded. Could you please edit it and clarify what you are asking?
Oh, be nice. Seven months, surely? :P
Are you looking for 3d models? Or 3d looking 2d images?
What kind of riding do you plan on doing?  Other criteria for this bike?
I think I misunderstood.  Is the peak perpendicular to the garage door, or parallel?
Apologies if I am mistaken, but this reads like a homework question. Is it?
Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this in Latex? What about writing a simple script (in Python, Perl, or whatever scripting language you prefer) that reads your report and generates Latex code?
What sort of weight would the tripod need to carry on it? Does the 500g target include the head?
The oracle $B$ is unnecessary here: since, by (3) $M \neq N$, we can take $B$ to be the empty oracle.  Essentially what you're asking is: do we know of any complexity class *separations* (as opposed to collapses) that do not relativize?
BTW you typo'd the declaration of `bytes_read`. And what on earth is "incertitude"?
Can you remember any other specific ingredients that might differentiate it?
@Darin Dimitrov Can you please tell me for how long you have been using 4.0? just after it got released?
And which version of DF are you trying to run?  0.31.12?
What platform? Android? iOS? Mac? PSN?
Another MySQL database, or another database type?  Do you still want access to the regular WordPress database, or are you moving the site from one DB to another?
Ok, this a long-shot, just a crazy idea, and I haven't tried it myself, so I won't submit it as an answer:  How about keeping the UIImageView stationary and moving the UIView around behind it?  You might then be able to use transforms to translate or scale your UIView, and transform the scrollview at the same time?
I like this idea.  Do you have that library posted, or can you please point me to a few of those photos?
Can you also show us parts of your XML file? Maybe what you are looking for are the **children** of <Images>?
What is a metapackage?  Is it a format?
@Qmal: why don't you want it? Any reason?
Not really, no (though maybe with JS). Is `display: block` a problem for some reason?
I don't think that an hour is long enough to actually break down all of the collagen, especially if you don't chop the bones.  Does your stock turn to a jelly-like consistency when it cools?
They're "identical" because they share some given pattern?  That is, `0001112` is identical to `1110002` and `2220001` because they all share the form: `aaabbbc`?
Could you clarify what you mean by #4? Does this mean that the lists of objects on each edge leading away from node _X_ are always a subset of the list of objects on the edge leading towards _X_?
My picture making skills aren't good... a clarification: you have rectangles. you get a point, which rectangle the point is closest to?
To continue Jason's questions, what constitutes a "square of any size?"  Four corners, the outline of a square, a solid tile?
what is MainView a subclass of? Is it a view or a viewController?
The nth letter? Is this the Roman version of the Fibonacci sequence?
what are the results of your efforts?  What is happening instead of what you want to happen?
Perdon, la pregunta no esta claro. Puedes tratar a simplificar la pregunta?
Good question, worded poorly. Might want to try rephrasing it?
@cowgod I'm not sure what the benefit would be because I haven't played any of those. Is it the added realism or something?
I have the Nikon D3100 and was wondering if the autofocus on the Nikon AF-S Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G DX Lens would work with it?
also i am going to buy Sigma Zoom Super Wide Angle 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC OS (Optical Stabilizer) does this particular lens support D3100?
@carson I'm one of your user :). Any news about some new release (wink..wink)?
@zengr Ok.  Why are you requesting that people enter their entire URL, instead of just their ID?
Is there something imperfect about your current grips, that you'd like to improve on? Do you wear gloves?
What happens if `C:\temp` contains both `C:\temp\somepicture.jpg` and `C:\temp\somepicture.tif`? Which file should `C:\temp\somepicture` refer to?
My stock Android keyboard works with text prediction.  What's shown as the name in Settings -> Locale and text?
@GeeGoldz, will you be accepting an answer?  @csl, how about that bounty?
Glad it's fixed. What's a sensai mechanic?
I've always pondered if there were any 3D games classified as "Metroidvania". Do you know of any other than the Prime series (which I've always considered in the spirit of the classification, but never really dwelled on it)?
So the request *does* actually make it to your `update` method (i.e. gets routed via the mappings with the `PUT` method correctly)?
Your code isn't going to work anyway. How can `tags` contain a new instance of the tag object?
Really? Could you please tell us how to compute the maximum of $n$ $n$-bit numbers in AC$^0$?
Can you post your code? Also, have you tried using " Timeout::timeout(5)" to try and handle timeouts?
I'm not sure if this question is really specific to PHP. Do people think the answer to this is dependent on conventions that vary substantially from language to language?
So as you're iterating through an array you want to remove objects from it. How do you expect to keep track of what's in the array if you're changing that same array on every iteration?
@BioBuckyBall: Do you read what I wrote? Do you read every word?
I tried "diskusage" and it should give you the exact distribution of your internal ROM. So you have 122mb for "Applications", 20mb for "System data", then how much "Free space" is reported by "diskusage" ?
should the output rectangle have its sides parallel to the axes? ie. can the output rectangle also be rotated?
Correct, the ranges are intended to be discontinuous. I think if ranges were continuous, then it would really be just one range, without any breaks/gaps, correct?
Which window do you mean? The one that currently has focus on the desktop?
Any particular part? Or do you want us to read the documentation to you?
Thanks, this was easier to understand. Can you please add a few more lines to last three definitions?
Why do you want to show multiple tooltips for a single control? Why not just combine the contents of the two into a single tooltip?
"non-default screen resolutions when using virtual display over screen sharing" — a statement, not a question. Please: do you *prefer*, or wish to *avoid* the non-default resolutions?
Does the array contain negative numbers, or only positive numbers? Does it contain zeros?
@Binary: Enough of you seem to be pretty upset about this - so I made it CW (which I didn't know about before, BTW) - do I need to do anything else?  Or am I kosher now? :)
Need a direction. How do I do it?
If someone has to figure out the coordinates anyway, does it take more work just to use that in Photoshop to do it manually? I mean... someone must sift through all those photos and find those coordinates anyway, right?
Yes it does, but the weird thing it's that all the other user attributes are getting passed (When i take a look at the console, every other value but the client_id hash it's getting passed from the form). Do you think that the fact that I'm also using authlogic for this same model may be something to do with it?
Do you want the complete question solved yourself? What exactly is the question here?
Please can you show the exact code that fails, for example, if this is in a view, paste in the relevant part.  Is it "<%= sanitized_text(truncate(msword_text)) %>" that fails and "<%= sanitized_text(msword_text) %> that is okay?
I'm slightly surpirised that this post just got to 1k views and still there's no voting on the answers. Is that just laziness, are viewers lacking voting rights or is there something wrong with the answer(s)?
Isn't this a way to rephrase: "Fast, Good or Cheap. Pick Two" ?
Are you using Visual Studio?  If so, what version?
How can you not know the length of the array? How will you know that your index is out-of-boundaries?
Hello Erin, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested?
What is an error? NotSuppeortedException in watch window or not sending request?
While tante's answer should cover your question, one meta-comment to it: It would be much easier to answer if you added your rationale to your question. Maybe there is a work around to your problem not consisting of preventing deletion of the file(s)?
If you've got a NASM resource, it should be relatively straight forward to convert it to MASM.  Why not post a link to what you're looking at?
"However, when initializing the struct using new, Valgrind complains", is that what you wanted to say? Or did you want to say "However, when *using* the struct using new, ..."?
Homework? Project Euler?
it just goes to update.php?  nothing after ?
It seems if I change @property (nonatomic, copy) NSMutableArray *blockViews, to retain, the error goes away. but why?
Could you better describe for which elements of jqGrid you what to set the background image? Do you want to set it on the grid title (the capture layer), on the column headers or replace only the sorting images in the column header (see the pictures [here](http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:how_it_works))?
Almost all water heaters have two electric elements.  Are you getting no hot water at all, or are you getting some, but it runs out quicker than it should?
@Ngu: There is some form of 'solution' for the three body problem. However, is there a 'solution' that converge faster than the using simulation for the same time period?
Why do you create a ListViewGroup?  Was the CheckBoxes property of the LV ever turned on?
@Paul W they all just pass through, there's no getting off early. would you think it would be ok to change the initial call to somewhere further down the line to skip a few but use the main interface still ?
Does it also need to work if inside of a _child_ directory of the given directory? For instance, `/tareas/sesion_3/bin` ?
You could try telling us what the errors you are getting are. Or are we supposed to guess?
The D7000 should be able to trigger the SB600.  Could you post the details of how you have the SB600 configured?
Yea - I deleted my line numbers request comment when I read the log again - I was on completely the wrong track with that! However, I still would consider the xib a suspect - it might be NSDecoding properties that don't exist anymore in the class?
So you are having multiple instances of a form structure (same structure) one for every user and you want to save *only* the corresponding user's info when that form's save button is clicked. Is that the correct requirement?
See my update.  have you tried pushing the fitting back in (sort of aggressively)?
Your top picture shows two white plastic tabs with the one on the right looking like it is not engaged and pushed into the frig.  Possibly this needs to be pulled forward to allow the compression fitting to sit properly (or maybe it is an indicator of shipment damage??).
The cottage cheese idea sounds great. What flavors have you tried and like?
Are you trying to return a screenshot of the windows desktop of the server you are running your website on?  It seems the only legit use of imagegrabscreen() - also take a peek at: http://php.oregonstate.edu/manual/en/function.imagegrabscreen.php - there are some notes at the bottom about setting proper permissions to be able to capture the screen - has that been done?
@Tim Why not posting this as an answer? Please?
This REEKS of a question asked in a panic before an assignment is due. Nothing wrong with seeking clarification, but are we really here to answer verbatim questions?
Could you rephrase "This much days It work smoothly"? Do you mean the same stick worked some days ago?
exact duplicate of your 5 minute old question [How to receive and use a json in ajax sended from php?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4317587/how-to-receive-and-use-a-json-in-ajax-sended-from-php). Are you for real?
What kind of diagrams are we talking about here? I think the question may be too broad as it is (it'd be like asking "what software programs are used to create desktop wallpaper?").
Wow, that is a great answer!  Thanks for the answer.  One more question for you though.  How can I tell what the float of the pedal is?
A "sequence point" in C has a precise definition. Does your "(pseudo) C-like" language define sequence points in the same way?
Do you just want to show the permalinks or do you also want the excerpt?  How many posts do you want to show?
In what line of code does the error occur? Is it when you create the FileInfo object or when you start the process?
@astony: *in a single step, you could transfer at least one point from element to its neighbours*.  Do you mean **at most**?
I think you may have made a typo in your question, you show Data #3 at index 4, then later show Data[4] = Data #4.  But essentially you want to have an list with all 9 values, and fill in nulls where a value is not provided?
In my experience you cannot inherit from a class that derives from UserControl. Have you ever done it successfully?
I have some code that attempts to solve this problem (see above). Can you look over it and help me fix it?
Can you please elaborate a bit? Like write few-word intro to those algorithms?
Are you able to access the file using the "?" instead of the escape code or the special char?
If you do it once, you can keep using it again, and again, and again... In any case, "looks great" is really a subjective thing. Can you be more clear on what you actually want?
woow.. sorry but this is ugly, ugly, ugly. Why do this if other packages already do the work for you?
Not at all clear what you want to do. What is the full expected output?
Hi Garey, could you help me understand your question a bit better?GeoNetwork is requiring entry of metadata on a per-layer basis, where you'd like to provide metadata at a higher level? How are you producing the metadata documents?
What type of device will be doing the dropping?  ASA, IPTables, WFP, ect?
@NTDLS connect() might be hanging, I'm not sure how to tell. How would I know if it's a firewall issue?
`x` is some variable in your server side programming language? What do you use?
This sounds rather like homework. Could you please flag it as such if that's the case?
In what language do you want this check to be made in? Ruby ?
Okay, you simply posted your homework verbatim. Do you have a question of your own?
do u have any error? In which part you struck?
The classes are still not indented properly. Can you post the fixed code so people would see what trouble you're having?
This sounds like the questioner is asking how to switch gears smoothly, and is concerned in particular with letting go of the bars? @solomongaby, can you please confirm and edit your question to be clearer?
What exactly is your concern? Is it the fact that you can't reach the shifter with your hands on the bars? Or the fact that it's not indexed? Or something else?
You're going to have to be more specific about what you want to know.  What kind of platform are you using to implement these algorithms?
My touchpad never works when a USB mouse is plugged in. Could that be the case?
You are building a xFA for the _byte_ input? Wouldn't it be a lot easier (and more reliable) to operate on (Utf16) chars?
What's the declaration for v1 and v2? Are they of the correct type for %f?
Christian, could you please provide a reference for the recipes that you have seen / tried? What do you want to use the syrup for? Is this a syrup to sweeten your coffee or a coffee and caramel syrup for desserts?
why they have to in ONE page? why not use CSS sprites?
That's what groups are for.  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/auth/#groups Why aren't you using groups?
I added commentary. Does that explain what happens now?
How do you determine uniqueness? Say the sequences are `ATCCCGACCGATCAGT` and `ATCCCGACGGACCAGT`, what is your expected output?
What type of data is being sent from the application ( as in is it XML or anything like that )? Does it have a consistent structure?
Agreed with Itay. Would you mind updating your code and putting it into code-tags?
This question is almost word-for-word, the same as http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3624056/ . Is this homework?
I realize that.  If Angry Birds doesn't make any provision for backing up and storing state data on the SD, how would a 3rd party app be able to over ride the Angry Birds state without over writing the information that I assume is stored somewhere in the /data/ directory (which you do need root to access)?
good idea.  you have to chop them, right?
Sorry, wrong guess then. :-) I presume your system is fully up-to-date and you've restarted your machine after the last update?
i know this doesn't help your problem but it's another corner case: what if two different cells want to swap with the same one? will one swap and then the other swap with the one it didn't intend to?
ok so, 100 arrays.  If multiple users are loading a page with 100 arrays would that have any major performance problems?
sorry, wasn't really thinking about a definitive question. could we just say that my question is: is my interpretation valid or does it contain some problems?
Career advice questions like this one are too localized for this site. Please see [Are Career Advice questions useful for anyone except the poster](http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/588/are-career-advice-questions-useful-to-anyone-except-the-poster/590#590)?
What kind of input are you looking for, give little more details. [CommonDialog](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.commondialog.aspx) look at the classes inheriting it do any of them look right for you?
@Billy: Like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4031112/regular-expression-matching/4034386#4034386).  Cool, eh?
With the detail you've given that sounds OK to me, though you should note that MAC addresses can be changed/spoofed, so I guess it's a risk based on how tech-savvy/desperate your client is.

If you trust your clients anyway, why not just use an "honesty" approach where they tell you how many times they have it installed and pay the correct fee?
That makes sense! Is it OK if decking runs across that area? Air can flow through the 1 1/5" gap and down to under the deck, right?
Please, show your code. How do you toggle this form?
If this is in production, I usually turn off all the error logging. Will the CI error handling log functions still work if I set the error reporting to none?
Can it be used for any kind of departure? Could you please give more examples in context?
Okay, so you just want to get a feel for what's out there, and know you want CCK-like functionality.  Any other specific features you're looking for, or aspects of Drupal that you'd like to avoid?
Are the 10 websites different each time?  Can you cache the generated images to avoid generation on each request?
Sorry, just to clarify: So I should try changing index.php (which is the splash page now) to index.html with the addition of the head content? Or do you mean change index2.php to index.html?
This seems to be an elementary/homework-level question. @mehas: could you please provide some motivation and explain why you are interested in this question?
What about `coder`? What is difference between a programmer and coder?
What do you mean by "moving"? Moving around in your window or a moving image like a *.gif?
Delimiters corresponding to what?  What are you trying to do?
@user3266: Sorry if this is obvious, but how do one permute the order of the interior vertices and construct another valid Hamiltonian path? Or, only if such property exists then you put it into the equivalence class?
Clues? Any code???
Just to be pedantic... the minimum number of nodes for a tree of height N has N nodes (ie: every node has one child), and isn't balanced. Perhaps you meant "the minimum height for its number of nodes"?
Your problem is coming up with a practically useful definition of "centre".  What's your application?
The Smalltalk one? The CLOS one?
I don't understand this. There is an infinite number of possible strings between "a longer string" and "another long string", so how can you guarantee unique values?
I assume that 'j' is the imaginary unit (physicists...).  What's 'k'?
Are you trying to optimize fuel use (total torque exerted) or speed?  Also, is the ship starting off with zero angular velocity at the beginning of this operation?
Don't see any reason why `input()` doesn't work. Did you try it using a standard Octave console, which works for me (I'm on a Mac, and don't have access to Xoctave)?
No way. Still don't believe I found this question on Stack Overflow ;) So the next time you apply the `Goto` function, will you do `Goto(Io, \epsilon)` where `Io` is that first state?
That site has two versions of each image, [colour](http://www.cineramabios.nl/_covers/_color/400x240/890.jpg) and [grayscale](http://www.cineramabios.nl/_covers/_black/400x240/890.jpg). Are you going to do the same, or do you need the grayscale images to be created dynamically?
@Federico:This part defines a schema in the wsdl. Does it import one or defines it there?
"with just an index" to what? is this homework?
I've made it "more pro" by indenting with four spaces to format it as code. Does that count?
Indeed. Can you compile a simple hello world?
Well, what other information does DIA give you about the functions for which this occurs? To start with, what are the names of these functions?
How hot was your oven? did you glaze the pastry prior to baking?
What happens if you try other alternative keyboard? Do you lose them as well or is it just Swype?
Can you enable it again manually? and if so how?
How long is "Wait for debugger.." on the screen?  What processor is on your computer?
@Gnovice: I thought about that, but wasn't sure.  I remember wondering the same thing a long time ago, so I figured, "why not"?
Hi, I think that the best algorithm depends on the number of the teams. How many should they be?
It's usually not a good idea to try and create images of text. Is it strictly necessary for you to do so?
no but isn't it the correct named route for the index action? Isn't that the url that I want to pass to `.tokenInput()`?
Do you have any example? Could it be a path issue?
The default zoom would show the whole image filling all of the available space in the control.  Are you asking then how to center either the vertical or the horizontal when the image aspect doesn't match the controls aspect?
Ok, so only some images are affected, and only images uploaded since the server change display incorrectly. Do ALL images uploaded since the server change display incorrectly or only some?
Probably not what you're asking either, but `'` produces a superscript “prime”. Maybe `\prime` is just the command that holds the symbol, and it's only intended to use for defining other commands (such as `'`)?
Pathauto is able to handle that. Have you tried it ?
*"Obviously"*. Why not?
This is not really enough to tell what can be the problem. Have you tried debug you code, for example trace something in the conditions (so the function what have to be called is called properly or not)?
Please rephrase your question with an example of the data and the code. Where is the datastructure you're trying to scan?
Have you set up venue and name as properties correctly? i.e. written KVC compliant accessors or used @property and @synthesize?
Yes correct. Any ideas?
thanks for that, but can you please elaborate? What are the three different class types?
Are you working with individual objects? Or object trees/graphs?
What error does it show? Can you post the stack trace?
I don't see anything there that would indicate that you can use dynamic text to label latitude and longitude. Can you please provide some more information or a methodology?
By successively you meant increasing?
If you have [a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n], you want the largest set of the form a_i <= a_{i+r} <= a_{i+2r} <= ... <= a_{i+kr} ?
This looks suspiciously like homework. Could you elaborate a little more ?
I was thinking about this too - pbuilder is quite slow on my machine... unfortunately, I only have 2GB of RAM. Would that work for small projects?
"Chlorophyll", not "chlorofyl". Can someone with rep to edit please correct?
It looks like you're not null terminating your `argv` array.  Or is that just left out of your example?
Bounty passed, I would have doubled it even, but now as you answer your own question and you already have plenty of points and I only can offer one bounty at a time I might consider to put my next bounty on another question. Okay with that?
What about (1,5) and (3,5)? Are you really finding inversions, inverted according to an incomplete order defined by the array A2?
That should work. Why do you think it does not?
The one place where none of these arguments work is in sentences like these: "Everyone got a gift that ___ loved."
Now, fill in the blank (please?)?
And what is the question? What is not working as you want it?
Either way, the whole point of the question was to see a concrete mathematical proof.  Instead of just saying it is so, can you please show how it is so, such that I can learn more?
Look at the Debug output of yor app. Are there binding errors?
It strikes me that in your debug output, you've carefully converted things to strings, but you haven't done the same to XXXXXX.  What happens when you change XXXXXX to XXXXXX.to_s?
What do you mean Justin? I am unsure what you mean by Autobot and Decepticon?
are they in the same namespace ? Usually, different assemblies use different namespaces?
Stick it in dynamically from where? You just need it to be a global js var?
What happens if you try access the magic method of __tostring? .. `echo $matches->item(0)` ?
@Rajendra: I have read it carefully, and both the original problem and the converted problem can be interpreted in multiple ways. Is it that hard to give a yes or no answer?
restart using the same JVM or completly shut-down the JVM and restart using a new one? BTW: Which operating system?
Thanks for the reply. Could you please elloborate on "long as you keep the dependencies clean (no cycles) and you already know where to cut to divide " prob with an example?
The output you give doesn't tie in at all clearly with the inputs in the second case.  What are you really after?
@Kory, please elaborate, on what grounds do you suggest that? What do you suggest the problem is?
@mattdm: the most interesting that the writer says that he broke his kit down to items that didn't do the job as well, but were more inconspicuous. So, uh, I wonder if Minox is still in business?
@bobince I've found several SVN software which one should I use? Can you point a link?
What would you want to happen in those cases? No resizing at all?
How are you hiding the image? Are you using a javascript framework like jQuery, Mootools or Prototype?
I use 11.04 and I still get the popup. Could you include a screenshot, please?
Do you have a web server such as apache httpd in front of tomcat on your production server? If so are there any url rewrite or forwarding rules configured?
Can you let us know what error you got or in what way its failing to load. Also can you copy&paste a NSLog output of the full URL String for both the | and the %7C version of the string?
It is incredibly unclear what the actual question here is. Is it just "what do you recommend for clustering/replication/failover options?"
usersmarvin, certainly there is a strategy that always works: "enumerate all possible selections of vertices, choose the smallest one that satisfies the condition." Did you mean there is no *polynomial-time* general solution?
Are your buildings all rectangular? Or do they have more complex shapes?
It's still under-determined.  Is, for example, 2*10 before, or after, 4*5, or should it be that once a value of 20 is used, it's never used again?
In my particular case, I'm sure that there will be only one instance running. In general I don't know, maybe it might show a dialogue in case of ambiguity?
sorry folks, i didn't know how to use the community wiki box.  can this be reopened as i've moved it over?
What specifically are you getting? You run that command and literally nothing happens?
Bluetooth enable in widows?(you have alternate operating system (Windows) ?
Arora and Barak's textbook on computational complexity covers derandomization fairly well. Did you have something else in mind?
@Jader, the title of the question and the actual question seem somewhat different. It seems to me that the title of the question should be something more like "What are the benefits of googles over glasses for cycling?"
So, your app creates a new html for each login? Or for each user?
Yes, this is infuriating...  Prevents me making a single command for Big-Oh notation that can handle both simple and tall formulae.  How on earth was this overlooked???
Is there a reason you dont just let IIS do this for you?  Or use the `<authorization>` features in your web.config?
Yeah, why do you have multiple HTML files in one file in the first place? Wouldn't it be easier to remedy that?
if you set the OptimizedDoubleBuffer flag you must also set the UserDraw flag. Have you tried that?
As it is currently worded, this question is pretty broad. Could you provide more specific information about what kind of portrait shots you are hoping to take?
That is very odd indeed.  A fire needs an ignition source, and the only thing I know of that can actually ignite from microwaves is metal.  Was there a metal twist tie or something?
The GPS satellites are recalibrated (ephemeris data update) from ground-based stations every couple hours. If the whole earth shifted uniformly, would GPS automatically get updated to the new position within a few hours?
Yes I think you can. Did you try creating a new gmail account and apply for a new adsense account?!
According to the docs, it's not "one big polygon," but has already been "divided into 100km x 100km squares."  Do you need to *clip* out smaller portions of those square features or would it suffice to *select* those squares covering your study region?
@peterjwest if that is a room and you use rectangles for collision detection you'll get a lot of false positives. Or am I missing something?
@H_S: After quick skimming non of those on-line references don't indicate that `p=(exp(r.*del_T)-d)./(u-d)`. Where did you get this?

Yes, I do. Am I referencing a keyword by mistake?
It seems to me that the constraints may be arbitrary and affect an arbitrary number of other options in an arbitrary number of groups. So it's the arbitrary constraints that give you difficulty here?

What platform? PC or XBox?
I'm not sure this is much of a layout challenge in any real sense (get the font right, adjust a few parameters). Perhaps some more focused questions on aspects of the adjustments might be better?

I don't really see a good question here. Can you focus it a bit?
Perhaps I'm the only one seeing this, but it seems sort of vague-ish as to whether you're trying to address this from a client-side or server-side position.  I *think* you want it addressed in the website itself (server-side) - am I correct?

Never did it, but I'm curious! Isn't it too "starchy"?
The general dominating set problem is equivalent (even in the approximate version) to set-cover, for which the greedy algorithm is optimal. I wonder - if you forbid induced subgraphs of the kinds that interest you, does it correspond to something natural for set-cover?

You also don't define up in your view matrix (or any other matrix from what I can see). That could be a problem?
Depends on your OS. Are you on Linux, Mac, Windows?
An interesting observation: when doing a TimeMachine backup to a network drive TimeMachine will automatically mount, backup and then unmount the remote TimeMachine share on the network drive. I wonder if you could exploit that to achieve what you want?
The quality of your solution really depends on what you're doing in that foreach loop. Yes, there are lots of ways to do it, but why do you feel your current solution is lacking?
Have you checked for release ? Are you releasing the providerData anywhere ?
Why? 99% of the time you can convert well written C code to C++ code by just changing the compiler setting. Why not start using C++ code?

That's what figured. Thanks for the clarification. So how do you adapt for the missing arc in the measurement?
It would be cool if we had 3 answers and "permit" edits to add or expand each as time goes.  Does that violate the GSE policy?

What operating system?  Are you writing a debugger or trying to use a debugger?
What does "visible to cities" mean? What range?
qsort does sort lines in increasing order, but your definition of "increasing" isn't the same as everybody else's.  Why do you think it's more logical to sort strings by length rather than by alphabetical order?
What about simply running Clang (or, if you want to punish the user with bad error messages, CC) from a Ruby script? What have you tried?

Is there any relation to a `questions` table? Or is `questions_tags` the only table you have?
How do you know it's not returning a 64-bit pointer? Have you done `sizeof(void *)` to check?
The question isn't clear enough. What are you trying to achieve?

It looks like 80x86 assembly.  Who else would name the registers as Intel did?
So, you essentially want to fetch most frequent words from the text. Is that correct?
No worries dude, we're all here to learn :) Yeah you'll most likely need to set your normals. Have you just tried darkening the colour from white to a grey and see if that shows it slightly better?
I like the first shot. Are those doghouses?
What have you tried and where are you stuck? Or are you just asking *us* to do *your* work for you?
`data.find` ? no error?
Just to clarify, is this a 20ft span with two 10ft beams, and a post in the middle that will support the ends of the two 10ft beams?  If so, why not just make a 20ft beam?
@Thomas: It does seem to have a certain similarity, but that doesn't really explain the reason to close.  What about that sequence is unworthy of being in a question?

Preferably, we don't do peoples homework here at SO. But BTW - What's the </FORM>-tag doing in front of the javascript function?

What's :data(data) supposed to do? Did you mean :data(rhs.data)?
I'm surprised that cauliflower is 4 minutes while broccoli is only 1. Is it because cauliflower is much denser and more tightly packed?
Also: Do you realize that variables created in class scope (in your code, every assignment above `#-----...`) are *class variables*, i.e. shared among instances, and not instance variables (`self....`)?
Strange. Do gems without native extensions load ok?
When were closures for JDK 7 cancelled? You have a link confirm this?
Yeah, sorry, that's how I wrote it in the code but it was a mistake in my comment. Any idea why could this be caused?!

And are resetLevel and resetTheGame methods clean?

Sorry, I meant `/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg`, not `/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg`. Is `Map uop.map` present in the former file?
Sorry, this is just horrible advice (see @GrandmasterB’s comment). Why has it got so may upvotes?
Please clarify your question a bit. Are you just asking how to invoke an instance's methods?
What exactly are you asking?  Are you asking for good examples for books to use, good things to try while learning, or just our opinion about the difficulty of examples?
it sounds like HTML Agility pack will probably work for me.
Are there any other options????

Why wouldn't you want to go to the source code? What's the purpose of debugging if not for checking the code?
Not exactly - I did some messing around and implemented a solution using NSMatrix, as per Apple's (very old) Core Recipes code sample. Edit: I note that your comment is rather old - did you resolve the issue?

**0% acceptance rate?** Really?

@user5402 could you please elaborate? What does opening the pipe do?

Can you pivote them or should they conserve both proportion and orientation ?
@Vas - Should the index really start at 0? How do you indicate zero Event["Certificationes"]?
@martin.malek — I've edited the title. Does that accurately reflect what you're looking for?
I don't get it. Are you asking us to try and predict the future?
I've never even questioned this before, but now you mention it why is it OK for boards but not for knives?
Which way are you trying to identify it?  From within code?
While I provided an answer - I'm with @freiheit.  Is there a more objective way to ask a similar question so that you get a set of useful answers?

Innovative?  You mean, something that uses genetic algorithms that cloud compute on quantum computers?
Sorry to be a pain, but where did you go to get that screenshot? Views | Select the View | Displays | Filter Criteria | and then?
Not completely so, because my question is more specific in terms of hash size and ignores performance. Also I am not just looking for _a_ hash function, I am looking for a meaningful choice -- I know there are CRC32 and FNV32, but which is better for my domain?
Are you after an optimal solution or is a near optimal solution good enogh? And is hyphenation allowed?
In what way does it fail? i.e. what happens differently in your program between the first method and the second one?

For source control reasons? Can you please explain?
In a webpage generated by Java (in what framework?) or in a Java GUI (using what Framework?)?
Since you mentioned Evil Maid by Joanna, you already know the answer to your question. Am I missing something here?
The same way anyone with a desk job stays healthy! This isn't really programmer-related?
Well, why would you expect OSX programs to be runnable on Linux?  What about these two specific OS's makes you mention them in the question, but not any other OS that also can't run OSX programs?
How full is the blender? Could you give the full capacity of the blender & also the amount you typically blend at a time?
Just to clarify, you want to do non-bidirectional data transfer because the server will not ack.  But you also want the server to push out data to these clients?
This sounds familiar.  Was this discussed on SO within the past two months or was it on programmers.SE?
@SamL: What is your current level of education? Do you enjoy maths even abstracting from physics?
I wonder what difference it will make to your prompt? A few milliseconds cannot cause problems, can they?
Is this a practical or a theoretical question? Do you have an actual 8086 that you're using for this?
mm sounds good.  When you say little, do you mean like half a cup or less?  Also, wouldn't I need to put some additional liquid for the chicken, or will it just cook in its own juices?
Welcome Heather! Can you post a detailed step-by-step list of what you did, what behavior you expected, and what the actual behavior is?
Don't want to be picky, I assume that 'less than 3 hours from the finish' should be more less than 250km from the end of a 600km, but am interested in how much less?

What have you tried? What are the difficulties you encounter?
What if there's 7 pages, and you're on page 4? `[1]...[2][3][x][5][6]...[7]`?
@Firebrandt: Could you, please, add the clarification what you meant by better in your question. What do you mean by outlining the solution - how to fill table entries in the table from Garey and Johnson book?
Firebrandt, could you please explain the motivation behind this question, i.e. why are you interested in this question?
What kind of data do you have in your file? Just numbers?
**I want to have something that starts with `$(this)` and ends with `.each()`**.  Is there a particular reason for this constraint (seems kind of arbitrary)?
Also, I don't understand the question. What are you trying to do with that array?
Updated!!!!!!!!! any one???
@gooshgoosh: Youve left out the most important detail: what are you using (programming language, software, etc.) to do the translation?
Can you clarify a bit?  You mean a type that implements `IEnumerable(<T>)`, or like an `enum` with a set number of values?

sorry, there aren't enough details for me to even begin answering.  Could you include some more information?
Do you want them one at a time, maybe alternating chars and ints, or do you want a parameter that tells how many to generate? What do you want to use the randomly generated values for?
Well i would do that but i don't know how to. Maybe you can show me on thizs example please?
Your requirements needs clarification: do you need this to be cryptographically secure and unique or simply unique?  In other words, would a potential attacker crafting a "unique" ID be a threat or not?

@alexanderpas apparently FRAPS did work. Should we merge?
You may be experiencing [bug #732677](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/732677). Can you please edit your question to include the output of `sudo lshw -class network` and `lsmod | grep -E 'b43|ssb|wl'`?
"Does anyone here know of an SEO company or individual that has had good results ..." - This question is inviting highly subjective responses (and spam). Suggested rephrasing: "How can I find a professional SEO provider with experience getting first-page results?"
It will be helpful if you can include the command that you used and the error message that you got when trying to install. For example, have you tried `grub-install /dev/sda`?

Could you please elaborate that? Does it work as I think: you append the databases, then use scan>check duplicates ?
I just tried an empty field in Lightroom 3, and it seems to be working as you & I would expect: all photos without a setting on that field are being included. Is there a chance some other setting on your collection is tripping it up?

I like your question.  Can you tell us where you plan to post the results?
'Scope probes often come with a small plastic screwdriver. Do yours fit?
Will there be any conflicts, i.e. could there be points `G` and `H` that are within `delta` of `A` and `F`?
How did you deploy it? Maybe you are missing essential .NET framework?
I'm not sure I would say either of those phrases as it's unclear to me what they would mean, exactly.  Could you give a bit more context?
Can you please tell me how to use this PHP code and what it does?
Also make sure that your test input is exactly in the format that you are given by the bot. Does your program cope well with an input ending with a newline?

60 oz beer sounds like a fine bounty to me :) Just to make it clear (sorry if I am blind): is your situation stationary (i.e. with constant flows) or not (due to finite amount of water in those tanks)?
I think you've got a typo here, I doubt that command returned "How do I find out which process is eating up my bandwidth?"... ;) any chance you could edit the question please?
And an "intelligent crop" is a 3rd.

Note though that the aspect ratios are different in the example (0.96 vs 1.1) so perhaps Andre means resizing first, then cropping to match aspect ratio?
*lol* the war against crackers is stopping our white-hats to learn the trade. Maybe the criminals will go away when we don't know how they do it? ;)
One clarification: are you looking for races to watch, or races to participate in?
I'm sure there is a way to tackle this problem, but we'll need more information. Can you try explaining the issue a bit more thoroughly?
There's a lot of different software. Worth making this community wiki?
This is the sort of question where there is no single answer. Wondering it this qualifies for a wiki?
I think one reason people think it's a lame question is that the OP didn't posit even one reason developing such a game would seem to be easy.    Kind of like asking "Why is it so hard to fly like superman?"
I wonder where your family member got such an outlandish idea. Not a native English speaker, I guess?
"Now we know how powerful it is to convey our thoughts."  You don't mean to say that English is more capable than other languages to express a given idea, do you?
The answers below indicate that this is UB, but I'm curious about what *actually happens*. Does it crash or continue harmlessly?
Youssef, have you had a chance to try one of the suggested approaches/tools for text categorization? If so, how did it work out for you?

"useless IDE fluff"?  Is that an accurate term from a non-MS perspective?
I'm sorry, as this question is written I have no idea what you are actually asking. Can you revise and expand on what you'd like to know?
@zebonaut I'm attaching here the pic of the backside of the circuit http://i.stack.imgur.com/BDBRS.jpg.Please take a look at the 555 pins, the output which is no.3 is not connected to any part of the board? Could it be they just placed the pin to confuse?
You appear to ask two different questions: are you building a language parser and wish to base your parser on a pile of regex? Or are you trying to implement a competitor to [pcre](http://www.pcre.org/) or [Oniguruma](http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/doc/RE.txt) regular expression parsers?
Are the edges are equally weighted? If not, how should differing weights be handled?
We already have a related (not a duplicate) question: [http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/1055/8](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1055/which-states-or-countries-have-stop-sign-as-yield-laws-for-bicyclists-idaho-stop), but we never got a good summary of locations where the Idaho Stop was implemented--unless it's really only Idaho that has this law. Maybe make this a question asking how the law has worked out in these locations?
So you're just looking to map the characters into another character?  Sort of like a Ceaser Cipher?

Why doesn't it compile?  What errors are you getting?
*"python on windows does not work"* ... and I guess you are the first one to discover that issue? How about "Why am I getting a syntax error when I try to run this Python script?"
@antti.huima Why? Because you can't solve it?
So putting them in separate declarations is fine? I mean can we actually use auto in anyway inside a struct like I showed in the example?
I am curious why this is an interesting question.  Why would you care, as long as it's not leaky?
Great question, but I'm not sure stackoverflow is the right place to ask it. Maybe this would be better-suited for programmers.SE.com?
Sorry but I never saw any application breaking after deleting/moving .folders... usualy they just reconfigure and restore to defaults. What exactly did break for you?
I don't understand this answer.  What's the 2' piece for?  Are you assuming the beams are made from a single thickness of 2-by lumber?
I haven't seen the LBE code, does it give any more information about why it won't initialize?  Also, is the hardware list up there complete, or are there any other sensors/whatnot connected?
But… isn’t $(\mathbf{NP}^{\mathbf{NP}})^{\mathbf{NP}}$ the same as $\mathbf{NP}^{\mathbf{NP}}$? Or am I missing something here?
Do you want to see the MainMenuState behind the OptionsMenuState? Or just the game screen behind the OptionsMenuState?

I've merged the two questions. Could you please accept the answer here?
That code looks like it's what I've been waiting for (the second one with the l())! Sorry but in which template file do I type it in and where inside it? :-)
so the airport is in one feature class, and the destination in another feature class? You wish to join all airports to all destinations?

does you function return the first n elements? is that a requirement?
showing some code would greatly help e.g. how did you declare 'path'?

Please add more details: What happens when you try to play something? What sound card do you have?
Where are you envisioning this sample content would be located to be automatically imported? I assume you are doing something more complex than just a "Settings > Import?"
As a side-question, how do you prevent the kefir from developing little tiny, useless curds, and instead evenly thickening into something like yogurt?
If it's just a matter of a few specialised custom macros, then a bit of find-and-replace would suffice, no? Or is the problem that they won't accept certain packages' macros?
What's your question? Do you want to parse the entire record, understand the format of RRULE lines, something else?
Slightly underspecified: by 'arrange', you do mean place them in order at the start of the array? Any restrictions on what happens to the rest of the integers?
I don't know anything about relational algebra, but "having" is just the same as "where" except it can apply to an aggregate of a set.  Is there any reason the relational algebra would differ?
Is this a homework problem?  Whats the dataset from?
Not sure what you are referring to when you say you need an SQL query builder for "Python". Do you mean to say you need an ORM like SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to connect with databases without having to write SQL statements yourself?
Strongly depends on what you do.  What do you do?
Thanks, really useful. But is the foam strictly necessary? What are the disadvantages of not using this?
@Yiannis: Can you please expand on the spacing after punctuation? What could go wrong without the `\xspace`?
Who gives you such error? Did you compile your source using `proc` ?
Can you give a more precise question to adapt my answer? What you want to do exactly with your text ?
Sorry @atdre still somewhat confused. Using SSL would only help with applications that used SSL on the end, not with determining OS version or type or portscanning or anything like that, right?
What are you trying to get exactly?  If the list is just 2 tickets with priorities 3 and 5, what do you want to find?
@Brian R Bondy: Isn't that a fault of the answers, and not of the question ? Or should the question be made more precisely?
@pickypg thanks. Can I extend JApplet and use it to the web application?
What are your OS and terminal program? Also, if using an unix OS do you have a `.inputrc` in your home dir?

define 'confused'.   What are you getting for Total.text?
You mean battery power? Also, what version of Windows?
I use UIImageJPGRepresentation (I know its PNG that you're using) in a separate thread quite intensively without any problem.  Are you sure that the problem doesn't come from the imageReg that could be written in another thread ?
What did you try so far? Where are you stuck?
You mean access it programatically?  Can you post some more details about your problem?
Sorry, I know nothing about Python. Is that Pygame and Django just like .Net Base class library?
I've removed the reference, but if you are attached, you can put it back. Can we remove these comments?
What documentation?  Can you provide the link or an example?
is this the case only for this particular project? can you try this out on a brand new test project?
I don't know much about checksum algorithms but `&H100` looks weird. You sure you don't want `&HFF`?
A few more details are required. What's your latitude, longitude, date and timezone...?
Maybe it's just your CPU fan getting old.  Do you have any hardware sensors for your fan enabled?
Ok, so [1,2,...,N] is not allowed because it is a run itself. Then how about [N,...,2,1]?
@Kyle Cronin - can you please tell me, than the font is shown in the "Fixed width" fonts? (in the Font panel, like Monaco or Courier?)
I'm sorry but how do I delete old keys? All the keys or just those two?
The logic that determines the Fields from the HTML is not obvious. Could you add some information here?
You should probably clarify what kind of framework you're talking about? 3D Graphics Framework?
Any particular reason you're thinking of `O(n*log(log(n))`? Or is that just something that spontaneously came into your head?
I wonder if there is a correlation between higher voted languages being considered 'toy' languages (ie. I'd love to learn xyz... but I do my real work in [current language])?
it seems x is the internal transaction ID, y is an ID for the object we operate with and z is the device/operator ID that performs this operation.
Krishna, does it have anything to do with cars (or maps?)
@Thomas Matthews, what are generic limitations of max bit field size? Does standard define some upper limit?
Does it REALLY have to be IrfanView? Why not a free library like FreeImage or ImageMagick?
what? ......... Also why you need to this via Array and not via DB?
and the sign_in works with safari ? after a logout ?
One of them writes to /dev/tty, one of them writes to STDOUT.  Was that what you wanted to know?
It seems to me that baseArr1 is closer to `{1, 0, 0}` than `{1, 1, 1}`. Are you sure about the values?
@Bobby: A 3-meg file takes time to load and resize - 1 second doesn't seem too bad. Is there any way you can save the thumbs once they've been generated, so you won't have to generate all of them again the next time the folder is visited?
I think he is talking about the variable length arrays that were added to C in the C99 revision of the language. Is that correct aaa?
Are you running the latest version of PhoneGap - i.e. clone from the github repository?
What library are you using for XPath? Are you setting the namespace mappings in there?
Nice problem, although proposing a solution is difficult because the criteria for a "good" solution can be defined in many different ways (and since a perfect solution might not exist, you need to define a measure of quality). For example, if I come up with n-1 buckets that are all equal but the last bucket is WAY off, is that better than n/2 buckets that are all different, but within a fixed known bound of each other?
What is an activity node graph? What is an event node graph?
@mfg - I'm not sure what the best way is to do this. You're planning to do a separate CW question or a post over at BF?
Do you have perfect knowledge of the meetings before hand, ie who will be there and in what order the meetings occur? Or, do you have to process meetings as you get them?
I don't think you can.  What is it you need to do?
@Ding, List A is in the database, and it can have > 100K rows? What is the typical (and maximum) size of list B?
I remember the original question asking about a solution in Python.  Am I going insane?
I would suggest you reconsider if using the `*` selector is a good idea. Maybe what you want to do is possible without iterating over the zillion elements that make up a production web page?
@Potatocorn: Really? Good heavens, on which platform?
What is exactly your problem? What does not work?
Ok, so this is the answer I have come up with after reading all the posts on here: "This statement will return true because $var is being assigned a value of donut, and assignment occurs before the statement is evaluated and therefore would be boolean true because it has a value."  Is this correct?
I suppose you managed to connect your RMI registry and look up your remote object, right? Can you provide stacktrace (on client / server)?
I'd like to see this tidied up, but I'm not quite sure how. Perhaps close it and ask a new question more along the lines of "how can I safely ride faster" or "what techniques will help me stay on the bike at high speed"?
How do you sort two dimensional data with quicksort? And how does this help finding the two closest points?
What "did not work"? closing of the connection or removing the persistence?
The language here is a little ambiguous. When you say Web Application Project do you mean loading the project in Visual Studio, or are you referring to the startup time of the application in IIS on the initial hit?
Do the resulting sub-lists need to have distributed lengths?  I mean, using your example input, is `3,3,3,2,2,2,2` acceptable, or is `2,3,2,3,2,3,2` preferable, or is `3,2,3,2,2,3,2` the ideal case?
I don't get it. How can you want to find the "highest value" while at the same time not caring how a comparison is done?
You talk about "seconds since", but I don't see that in your formula anywhere. Is it seconds since the similar add was added or seconds since the original article was linked?
Can you please clarify your goals?  Is pure-Perl what's important to you, or is zero-installation important?
But the Bayes formula says something like the sum / something, is it enough to know those probabilities? Could you please post an example?
Excuse me if this is an ignorant question but which are "summer savory" herbs?
Maybe show some code and/or image examples. If compatibility is important, have you considered using an animated GIF?
What are you looking to aggregate?  Total sales value, number of orders by customer, total deposit, total number of items sold?
There cant be a general solution. What do you do when the stack has 10 entries and you need to output a number, but the last number hasnt arrived yet?
or anything else? So mutable linked list is allowed?
Just to be a bit of a stinker: your title isn't really a question, nor is it a good indicator of what you're actually asking. Consider revising?
I am not sure about better tag (I think this one is fine), but someone should edit the question to "What does a Field Theory mean?" or "What is meant by Field Theory?".
Suppose you have a 2 x 2 grid, and your array contains [0, 0] and [1, 1]. What would the correct table output be?
Is it always the same for every file, or does it vary between files? Also, is it always the same number of question marks?
@anony: Nice question! Can you share the site where you found the question?
As Marcelo says in his answer, what you're doing doesn't (yet) make sense.  Can you give an example of how you would like to use this?
I don't think you can find the max weight cycle without enumerating all cycles. How would you decide which one to not enumerate?
but how does the program know to make that connection ?  why doesn't program make the connection between cholesterol and flu, for example?
Hmmm, I've [seen this question before](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5180159/big-o-notation-homework). What was wrong with it over there?
Are you also interested in common real-world uses of other Public/Private key protocols besides RSA (e.g. DSA etc?)
It's not clear to me what you're trying to ask, or what problem you're trying to solve. Are you trying to figure out what algorithms google, twitter and facebook are using, or are you trying to understand some algorithms better?
You need to further explain this question to get a good answer.

Given an integer as input, what is the output that you want?
what have you tried? There are over 2000 questions here on SO about random numbers, have you had a look on some of them?
I dont know how to apply the read only concept to a for-loop. Or do you mean why they say it is read-only?
Ozan asks a good question below.  Out of curiosity, is this just a logic puzzle, or is there a reason someone would need to avoid basic language constructs?
Understood.  When using this sort of method, you are not in fact launching a separate thread each time the callback is called, correct?
can you provide a bit more context, please? Is the object updated only after increments of 12 minutes, so either 24, 36 or 48 minutes?
I changed statistical-bias to unbiased-estimator. Does that work?
What do you mean by "take off" in relation to brightness here ? Do you mean "reduce", or perhaps "measure" ?
Why would your application need such a structure? What are you doing?
No, it is not needed. You know a penalty box was made for the kind of behavior you're exhibiting right now?
Does it need to follow a specific pattern? Or is it fine if the characters from the input set appear potentially at any place?
[Google Image Search](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/searchbyimage.html) does this to an extent. However, there seems to be no API for this (yet?).
What ordering are you assuming for @array2. In other words, why does the count for 'one' come before the count for 'two'?
@nikic, its a WordPress site on HostGator. How can I tell?

How did you install ubuntu? wubi?
maybe it's just me, but this seems too open ended, subjective, and probably depends on your particular research area. what kind of advice are you expecting?
How static are we talking? No database?
Website or WebApp project?  Debugging in Cassini or IIS?
Will expressions always be unambiguously parenthesized like that, so you don't have to deal with precedence? Or is `X OR Y AND Z` allowed?
are you using the WPF Toolkit? what version are you using?
Also, you state that 2^|rules| is too many computational steps.  What about |options in group 1| * |options in group 2| ... *  |options in group k|?
Ya, seriously.  17 questions and no selected answers?
@andrej can you accept [g .'s answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/8491/mail-app-and-multiple-copies-of-emails/8580#8580)?
Why are you debugging AutoCAD? Isn't that AutoDesk's job?
@zildjohn01, What's the best way to do this (which PHP functions?). Could you leave a detailed answer with your approach?
Are you referring to an update from a 6-7 theme? or are you just referring to any random template (wordpress, joomla, static html/css etc) to a drupal theme?
Not what's commonly observed -- on the contrary an often heard complaint is that `print` statements from various threads get all mixed up.  What platform, OS and version, Python version, etc?
What type of error?  Validation server side or an exception thrown?
COBOL homework? Where do they even do that?!
It's not hard to, say, brute force this in Prolog, but the performance will be horrible.  Does anyone think this has a PTIME solution?
@IVIAD: "Is Not My Vehicle Maybe his Yellow Mazda and Listen, Sir... Aardvarks instill OBESITY!" Am I right?
You seem to have an algorithm that works. What's the problem?
Can you describe the problems?  Are you trying to prevent or cause hitting a limit?
Is this loop intended to run until it returns true or false inside?  Or is there a return statement farther down?
Hmmm... it works!! Any reasonable explanation to why??
I can't parse the For example part.  Can you provide a clearer example?
Example: assuming "A" means typeset text from recipe (a) of height 1/6th available height, AAAA BBBBCC DD looks like it fits your constraint. Is it acceptable?
Do you mean something like "Intrateam 30-minute meeting"? Or does it have to be one word?
Ah, I agree that "comes with" is misleading. But the remote administration client binary (to which I assumed he was referring) isn't called Remote Desktop?
Why not use a numerical counter, then convert it to text when you need to display it? What's in `element`?
Golf? Obfuscation?
You have already mentioned multiple imputation, the answer I'm thinking about. Why don't you use draws from truncated distributions?
Could you be more specific about where the air is coming from? Around frame of jambs? windows loose in jambs? Outside of pre-hung frame?
How are the files encrypted? Some intrinsic mechanism to excel, or some external tool?
Nope. I can debug in my local IIS but I don't see the files anywhere?
You know it to be O(log n)? Or your hope? :P
hmmm.. nothing???
Not sure I'm reading the question correctly.  So each user books a cottage(s) 60 times a year?
This seems really specific to this particular program. Does it come with a manual?
Um. What do you want to replace them with? And, maybe a little context would help, no?
i think you should just use what you usually do, avoid getting into stuff that you can't get to work. better to just keep it simple, ya know?
@torbengb: Good point. Looking at this site's [Area 51 entry](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/151?phase=commitment), something very similar is listed as definitely off-topic ("What's Apple going to release in the next generation iPad?").
Can you post the start_game code? Also why would a game belong to a card?
While I answered your question to the best of my ability, I fear that you are going down the wrong path. Are you explicitly closing your SqlConnections in the same function that opens them?
Why would you need to parse the HTML that you are generating? Are you going to need to be able to insert inline HTML that could invalidate?

If you have bought an expensive SSL certificate you have helped Shuttleworth go into space. How can that possibly be a scam?
You don't - you run a callback function (like @Alex's answer) or something fancier like `jQuery.Deferred` (my answer). But your question is unclear - could you show us some more code?
@Stefan: Not sure what you mean by the comment above, sorry. Want to take it to chat?
but what happen if a process try to read but another process is still reading before ?
 is the pipe closed for reading when a process read from there ?
OK, now I'm curious. Why isn't this a syntax error?
Probably it is still integrated with your browser. What browser are you using?
@edelwater: well actually this should always work on a vanilla wp install and cookies enabled in the browser. Just out of curiosity, what did you notice in wp-admin redirects?
What if you added a button to the results page to go back to the form?  Or wouldn't that overcome the users' urge to use the 'back' button?
Yes, I had to wait about 18 minutes or whatever it was, in that time I forgot to come back and accept it.

Do I always have to wait for these flood checks?
I kind of agree with Lev Bishop, but I like the idea of offering a bounty for some specific improvement to some LaTeX documentation should be encouraged. Time for a new sister site for these kinds of offers?
And how are you planning on handling this on the client? Phones today dont have encrypted SMS builtin, which means you'd build a custom app... and if you're doing that, why bother with SMS?
Are you trying to find out if it has the same general geometry as a bmx bike? Do they even publish any kind of detailed specs for these things?
What's the error? In what function, in what library?
Hello, cmos; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. By embedded view do you mean a view created with Views?

Are you absolutely sure what kind of chip it is? Are there sites that let you search by pin numbers?
And what about loops? Or do we have to loop with recursion?
Please add more information, what exactly is your problem? What have you tried?
Can you give a little more context?  What library contains this line of code?
Why do you have to use goto for this? And if you want to ensure that both are initialised, isn't it easy enough to move both declarations to the top of the function?
@Ofeargall - Welcome to the community. Could you please elaborate on what you mean "want to know" vs "need to know"?
I think those are actually two questions, none of which I understand properly. Could you please expand your questions, so that we get of better understanding of what you're looking for?

Just OOC, how often does this happen?  Is it really often, or just once every few weeks?
How turn-key do you need it? Can you add your own features to a base plugin or do you need all the features written for you?
@Kerrek SB:  Each string in the input is printed out exactly once in the output, with at most an additional comma to separate them.  I don't see how that would come out to "pages", unless you are being sarcastic and there is something I am missing?
@ Joe.  Since this is community Wiki, mind if I clean up the intro to get to the details a bit more succinctly?
I got the representation part. But what I want is how to convert this huge monster output to the neat output like this [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,4)] ????
IB can be a pain with UITableView sizing. Have you considered doing this programmatically, initializing the tableView with a style and then setting the frame to a specified frame with CGRectMake(x,y,w,h)?
Should be a community wiki question then?  There isn't a right answer, I believe?
"glug glug glug" sounds like no air behind water. Have you checked the vents on the roof?
I'm strongly considering closing this as a duplicate of [Taking it to the next level](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/10317/41) which was itself a duplicate of [Books that explain the science of cooking?](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/9657/41).  Anyone have any comments on what distinguishes this one from the others?
Try installing a JRE (e.g., `apt-get install openjdk-6-jre`), possibly the one from the 10.04 repo, _before_ trying the full upgrade. Does it work?

You have Firebug? Is it reporting any JS errors when you load the page?
@sky - Awesome!  Where did you get that nice grid from?

"Using an SSD as an SD Card" does not make sense to me.  Can you please explain?
@Sky Sanders - is support for fromdate/todate on the TODO list ? If so, any idea when it will be implemented?

There is no line that begins with "X-From_:" in the "show original" message. Any other suggestions?

What method is giving you the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds?  Can you print a stack trace?
Please, be more specific. Where do you want to display pictures, what kind of pictures?
Done. Do you specifically want small numbers inside the big number, or just shading?
whats the output of your logfiles? ./configure for example?
One of the things we like about them is that they are sort of crispy and it seems like that would be lost if I added water after they fried. Is my assumption wrong?
I was thinking based on an assumption which is "there should always be something in common in each pc" and if this comon thing is made up by bunch of transistors and if this common thing is able to process an operation, its processing performance can be in relation to 'transistors count' Stupid approach? (So I was asking, what is this common possible process AND how can I measure its performance ? )
Does the query still fail if you just iterate over it fetching the results, i.e. without the data binding?
I would love to see the results of any study demonstrating degradation in signal quality over time through speaker cable. Over very long periods of time I could see this being possible, but really?
It's not clear what you're trying to do here.  Do you want the view to render the string "1 image more than 1 image ... "?
I gotta ask...why would you replace your speaker wire once a year?
i keep coming back to look at this and see if you updated... there's a bounty sitting on this... and i realize... this is not a question. maybe if it were someone could claim the bounty?
@Yiannis: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. Would you provide me an example?
Just to be sure, are you talking about ST as found in clinical trials, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis?
You might have a difficult time with any arbitrary quadrilateral if you allow convex quads and those whose segments overlap. Do you mean any arbitrary *convex* quadrilateral?
I am wondering about one thing. Is there a risk of flat tire on rough terrains or even breakage or tears on such tires?
This sounds like a job for the listings package, really. Could you post an example of your code?
When you say line do you mean character? For the given input what is your desired output?
@neilfein: first e-bike? what about http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/q/1590/605?

just a question, why do you keep a list of the digits as booleans ? -have you thought of int_of_string with the right prefix ?- i mean do you need this intermediate data type ?
Why are you trying to exchange data between component in the same system via a file?  Why not use a temporary file to create a mock file?
Are you going to implement your own syntax on top of the scripts (i.e. SQL, Excel etc) that the users are coding?
SAX parsing is known to be difficult. Would any other parsing style be an option?
Perhaps you need to define 'best'. Also did you mean 3D k-sided polyhedron instead of polygon?
What platforms are you talking about?  Does it have to work across platforms?
For what country? Could the data from openstreetmap be complete enough for your locality?
Depends on your PHP experience. What is yours?
Sorry, but i won't use a module for that task. So you have no idea about this?

Welcome to the community. What exactly is your question?
I still can't understand what do you mean. Could you rephrase question or add some information?
@David: By the way, I hate to state the obvious, but just looking at the regions you selected in your graph, it looks like you chose the area in the lowest quartile.  Is that a sufficient criteria?
What exactly do you mean by a "build"?   How does the "legacy" part change your question?
Why are you using that in the first place? Why not `boost::posix_time::microsec_clock::local_time()`?
What do you mean by this, "I'm actually testing the solution to check, if it is not adapted to single specific format of token only."  What is single specific format?
hot flues and toxic electrical insulation are likely not compatible bed mates. Have you considered WiFi?
What is the question?  What is the tag facebook-hacker-up?

I'm looking in the `xmmintrin.h`, but it does not contain `__FPU_SETCW` or any mention of `FPU` at all. Are you saying I have to add some lines?
And in what form do you have that number? string?
This looks like a bug to me. Have you asked for help on [Google's forum](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Calendar?hl=en&utm_source=HC&utm_medium=leftnav&utm_campaign=calendar)?
Will do that. As an aside (and please, I'm sorry if I should not ask this here), is it possible to add code blocks in a comment?
"Which other interesting things are there to count.." isn't that the actual question? Maybe adjust the title?
Is this happening in development only? Is it possible that class reloading is the issue as classes are not cached in development if you are adding methods during execution the class could be reloaded without your newly defined methods?
"...nginx rather than wordpress." Perhaps you mean "nginx rather than Apache"?
for what purpose? why not just generate an API key and use that?
Not familiar with this game. Should this be tagged as a cheat?
Isn't some kind of curve inherent in using non-Euclidean triangles? I suppose intuitively, I'd expect each edge of a triangle to be part of a great circle - are these "bulges" relative to that?
In the sample, there's a space after `another_question? \ `. Does the space exist in the original code?
Are you unable to change it back? Or are you just curious as to how it got changed?
It might be helpful, if someone can, to do a short analysis on this circuit.  I'm assuming the diodes form a sort of regulator?
If you wrote the CGI script, then you know how that script determines where to put the files and how to name them. What is stopping you from adding that information to a database?
What n is? Length of List 1 or List 2 or list1+list2?

Also do you have access to the underlying data? How are the curves drawn?
Why do you want to disable either Javascript or cookies, or both?  What benefits will that provide?
Can you please provide some additional information: Are the lines you quote the only messages relating to granola? Which kernel version are you running?
I find it hard to figure what "rule" you have in mind to generate the sequence. For instance, why should (1,0) come before (0,1), or (2,2) before (0,2)?
It's weird that this doesn't work on Python 3.1, could you share more about your directory structure and module organization? In which directory is `weatherScript.py` located, what is your `sys.path` (or at least the part of it that corresponds to `weatherData/socket.py`)?
@user2924 - I must be missing something but I'm unclear still what you mean by *"like this"?*  Can you also please specify your basic requirements?
I've never done COBOL before, but this strikes me as strange: `IF POLI-DATE-REQUESTED-S-2 IS NOT = 11 OR 12` Most languages I'm familiar with would parse `foo != 11 or 12` as `(foo != 11) or (12)`. Does COBOL really parse the expression as `foo != (11 or 12)`?
Please further specify .odt, and .org files. For which application(s)?
Does Qt give you any kind of warning, can you post the real path too and the output of `ls -la images/Load.png`? Perhaps you have configured the toolbars to display only text?
Menu->options->keybindings?  Is that not working for some reason?
@Laurence Gonsalves:  Oh?  What, then, is the ubiquitous _C string_ if it is not a string?
@Beta: If by "perturb", you mean an infinitesimal nudge, then the only triangles with 2 stable positions would be those with a side of zero length and two sides of non-zero length.  Right?
This sounds like it belongs on another stack exchange, I'm just not sure which one.  Something to do with computer-architecture and hardware...maybe [Electrical Engineering](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/faq)?
Are you wanting to take all pairs of elements to be compared or is it that all the elements of the array are compared against a known value,e.g. if the array was of ints and you wanted to know if half were single digits?
The title of your question references IE (Internet Explorer), but the body of your question references FireFox.  Is your question about FF?
I see you haven't even tried posing your issue as an actual question on this site.  Care to give it a try?
@Kosmonaut, I have to admit I'd side with @Tony on this one, at least in the UK, *voilà* would be used as a 'consciously' French word, whereas Envelope, brilliant wouldn't. [Almost worth another question?)
Yeah right, I use android AsyncTask. Does it make different?
@mpiktas: what do you mean with "additional data"? Could you please give an example of this in the car context?
@StrixVaria *A complete list of all German words and their meaning would be helpful.* we give him the phrases, but he wants the translation, then what? :)
I guess this could lead to another set of advertising answers. There are a good range of vendors providing high quality services in this industry, but you might want to update your question with region, country etc?
That's a lot of complicated code for something which could probably be shown a lot more simply. Care to provide a much simpler example... and an actual *question* to go with it?
Dumb question.  The helper method isn't using LINQ is it?
It's worth noting that in some companies, the line between "design" and "marketing" is imaginary. What becomes of your question when the person who does design is also involved in marketing?
Yeah, I didn't cover the why, but it's a good question. Maybe they need to add some kind of searching "engine" or something... but where are they going to get one of those?
Nice, but it overlaps notifications. Could you move them under the sticky bar?
I believe that would be different on different hardware. What architecture?
That sounds like an old domain parking page. Does "Fetch as Googlebot" give you any response to the /robots.txt ?
I'm not sure how you're having this problem - Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right cursor jumps text and highlights. What programs are you experiencing this issue in?
It looks pretty good to me. Can you give some idea of why you think it's incorrect?
I'm wondering why extractObject()'s return type is `const bool` and why it says `const int&` as one of it's parameter. What is the advantage?

hi - i added the JS i have. but its not server side so all three images load ?
@robintw: I just noticed that you hadn't mentioned that your 3 numbers should be integers (although I, along with every one else, assumed that they were). Do they have to be integers?
Is there a correct term for them? (Variations / Sub-Lists ?)
Also, one can probably implement it using the language-level recursion, meaning that the second stack will be present *implicitly* as the "stack" of local contexts of nested function calls. Is this allowed?
@Stephen Oh, sorry... I misunderstood. (but u do see why u need to learn c /c++ right?)
What do you mean external? Outside the emulator?

Yes, Pavel. That is correct (frame problem, much?) :(
I'm not reaching the point of your question. Aren't you being able to deserialize the data?
Could you post the code?  Have you tried other Rubies (using RVM)?
the title is a bit awkward, I had no idea what the Q was about before reading it. Perhaps "great GIS, maps & cartography quotes"?

How are you testing what's actually stored? Are you using HeidiSQL or another GUI client?
Why not? How many colors do you want?
I think your question is too vague. What are the properties of Irony that you want?
Well, the Synopsis section of the module shows you what to do. What happened when you tried those examples?
By "implementing square", do you mean implementing a function such that `f(x) = x^2`, or `f(x) = x`? Also, what is the precise list of operators you are not allowed to use?
Looks like you've installed vmware. Did you try to disable/uninstall vmware?
You may want to look at the changelog for ActiveRecord (http://ar.rubyonrails.org/files/CHANGELOG.html) and see if anything listed there might apply to your situation.  Also, what Ruby version are you running?
are you on a linux/unix machine, maybe using cygwin? then have you tried the "file" command on a file?
Is there a reason why all of you on here seem to be anti-car? I would find this amusing, but highly inappropriate behavior from our mayor in Seattle. Why is it something to laud here?
If an edge connecting the graph to a leaf node is to be deleted, is it assumed to delete the leaf node as well? Alternatively, does deleting a leaf node also delete the edge connecting it to the rest of the graph?
I searched through Graphserver source but couldn't find where it outputs geoJson. Could you please point me to that particular function?
I feel a bit daft asking, but how is a tomato a citrus food? Is there some terminology I'm not aware of?

Can you add some more code? For instance, how is `BTree` defined?
Would you please elaborate for a C++ noob? What actual problems have you run into?
Sorry I should have asked it in more accurate words...yes I meant that it should be measured with respect to the aircraft's instantaneous position and not velocity... Would the cross-track wind measurement/direction change if it was measured with respect to the aircraft's 'airspeed' velocity than 'groundspeed' velocity? -- as the cross-track direction is effectively perpendicular to the instantanous velocity of the aircraft -- whether measured wrt to ground or air -- so its measurement/direction would not be infulenced by the aircraft's velocity... no?
Rob - please add to your question the video card you have and if you have activated any additional hardware drivers.  Also, please clarify what you mean "system doesnt seem to be able to run Natty" when using classic?
@Neil All data is input onto a screen before so there is no actual input data. Would it help if put the whole program here?
I'm not really sure what you're looking for that pinvoke.net doesn't provide.  Can you cite an example where it didn't give you what you needed?
It's better to follow Rails conventions by placing your images in the public/images directory rather than some other location. Could you please explain why you're breaking convention?
I would take a look at the question what-security-risks-does-ip-spoofing-bring . I feel these questions are very similar, if not duplicate?

Complexity of what? Time complexity of some operation?
How do you know its a proprietary format? There are several 'standard' file formats - perhaps you could provide a link to an exported (public or self-signed) certificate, then perhaps people would be able to see for themselves?
@Dino beytar, if you provided some more details about the purpose of this data, you might be able to get some suggestions on how to best handle it. I assume you are aggregating this data on your origin server?
@Metalshark, this question has not received any unique answers, and I believe is probably close enough to a duplicate to close.  Any objections?
Are we talking about some specific language (C, asm)? Does the machine have FPU or does it only operate on integer registers?
I am not super familiar with android development. Can't you use java util Preferences http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html ?
What do you mean by "view"? Do you mean how can you tell if the mouse is over the table view or if it's over a row/column/cell in the table view?
Do you have POI's in your system ? or are you hoping to use maps to do that as well?
It could just be me, but that question doesn't make sense to me completely.  Maybe rephrase?
Homework... Have you tried yourself? If so, what have you tried?
I think it would be excellent if you could give more detail (see suncoolsu's answer). Furthermore, with design, do you mean how to analyze the data?
This seems like a recipe request to me: "step by step comprehensive guide". What exactly are you having trouble with?
What is the declaration for `GlobalCWND` then? Does it have a `Ptr<ProtocolContext>` member?
it is proven that there is no close formula for n>=5. do you mean you are looking for a numerical approximation?

Are you using C++/CLI? Why is there a mention of a "managed" object?
OK... ctrl+v behaves differently. What possible use is the local file location to a webapp though?
What if there is no idle worker, how do you intend to deal with that? Just queue them up?
Also, are all the workers equally suited for all the tasks? In other words, could it be that Worker A is better suited for T1 type tasks than the other workers?
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path. Negating the weights would cause it to find the longest path, but that won't work if the graph contains cycles, right?
This is a very confusing question!  How are you compiling your C programs?
What do you think? How did you arrive at your answer?
I see. Was it talking about that one specifically? :)
What is the actual question? And have you considered using punctuation?
As opposed to? What should it be instead?
How would you store those cached images? in your own NSArray?
Could you please describe in more detail what do you mean? Perhaps include a drawing?
Could you tell us more about the "protective plates"?
Please, add the first part to your post. You mean both players should have the same number of parts of the stick?
Confirmed. Maybe there's nothing on that site yet?
Title could be a bit better. Just to be clear are you asking "What is the difference between C++ and Java on the Android Phone?"
@Sklivvz If you like riddles, here you are -- one puts an ice cube in a glass and fills it up with water. How much water will flow out when the ice cube melts?
Is it native delphi or .NET? What do you mean by unix window?

Your wiki or someone else's?  What wiki software?
It sounds like you're trying to dump LiveCD images for various distributions onto a USB drive and then be able to boot them.  Is this correct?
Do you have any code we can look at? What have you tried so far that isn't working?
Should the query also be adapted for `sold`, i.e. should it be `sold__year=year`?
I can't see how there can be a faster one. How can you detect an intersection without looking at every line, and so O(N)?
'prefab' really isn't a particular architectural style...it's a manufacturing process. Can you post a picture?
Unfortunately, i do not know how to start. Ok, I use fft, but what and how should I do next?
I am pretty sure SendGrid has this type of import and throttling build into their service. Why are you *doing it yourself*?
yep because you have a syntax error there. just read the answer someone posted below .. or could you just explain what `<?php $image=troll/GrannyTroll.jpg?>` should do?
Well, that didn't take long. The Mac App Store was released, what, less than two hours ago?
By scaling, you mean generally non-uniform scaling here? E.g., a square cam become any rectangle?
So what is the final verdict?  What would be the best technology to use in my case?
Can you please explain this a little more? You can to create a view that shows a in each row a different node?

Can someone explain to me why this is not a real question. How is it off-topic to being a programmer? :|
-why- not use sorting? homework?
I don't quite understand the problem. If your code works, won't it fire both when the browser is resized the first time, *and* when the browser is size back to its original size?
Your title talks about arrays, but in your code sample you're applying `gsub` to a single string (you're applying it to the whole string btw) and then taking the first line of that string. Could you please clarify?
You need to look SciPy for Ironpython - See http://pytools.codeplex.com/  for more information.  And why is res not a Zero matrix to begin like new_matrix is in mult?
"Notify when open WiFi access point is found" is available in stock Android. Is this not what you're talking about?
Is there any further information you'll need for a proper answer to this?
For me, there's a fairly large gap between 'a web map' and a 'web-based GIS': a simple map with layer control and panning is great for many applications, but doing analysis through the web is a different scope which many web maps don't attempt to solve. Are you interested in doing analysis or primarily display?
I'm sorry, what distinction are you making between the large sample formula and the small sample formula?  Are you calculating the variances using a population formula in large samples rather than using a sample estimate of the population variance?
This is an effective duplicate of http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/222/best-place-for-learning-how-to-write-games-in-unity3d

They usually gather in the meeting hall.  What do you want them to do?
I'm not really sure what your asking here. Could you clarify what you're having trouble with?
Updated with more code. I have not implemented INotifyChanged, perhaps thats what I need to do?
Do you require the actual return code from file.sh? Can you change the script so that it writes to a file when complete?
Heh, sorry mate ;)  Anyway, I do sometimes want to drive an LED from a 74LS device, so now I know to buffer it first.  Btw - I could use a transistor to buffer it, yes?

+1 for Python. Maybe consider doing this for some other SE sites?
I added two. Happy? ;-)

I know it is only after V3, but will there be at least the ability to retrieve the mod flag messages, or a count of the number of moderator flags at some point? Also will you at one point be willing to review the moderator ability features?
mstksg, I'm interested in a solution to this specific puzzle. Can you tell me what information would help you understand the game play?
It's going to depend (to a large degree I would have thought) on the climate. Where are you?
**Hey!** I just had the greatest idea - when a user clicks on a question in the widget, why not redirect them to the appropriate page on http://StackMobile.com ?
I have the same problem. How did you resolved it?
Taken alone, this code won't compile. What are definitions for `dimensions` and its cousin `dimention` (in desperate need of a better variable name)?
I have made some edits to your question. Please, could you check that I didn't alter its original meaning?
I don't understand. Do you want to make a screen shot of the rendered DIV and save that to an image?
feel free to share the specifics of the space, it's quite relevant to the question. Is the space's shape odd, or is it hard to get to, or what?
Windows Phone 7 doesn't give you access to HTTP headers? Whose dumb design idea was that?

Which shell? How have you tried to do this so far?
AFAIK you'll need to loosen your spokes to get one in there. So maybe it shows you have a spoke wrench?
`+1` from me just for posting a SO problem on SO. `:)` (Not that I could help with the problem, but seeing this I was asking myself what happens to the GC when a dispose function throws?)
I was actually hoping for a method where I just place the fish on top of the rice directly.  Would this not work?

Got code to share?  If you restart the applications after you establish the remote desktop session, does it work?
What are the specific queries you want to answer? Do you _really_ need to just list all user sessions, as your question implies, or are you after something else that could maybe be determined without exhaustively finding all sessions?
Your question is great, unfortunately it's very similar to a previous (very highly rated) [question](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/3). Perhaps you could change your question to just ask about websites?
@treeface: The multiple conditions may not all be testing the same value, in which case `switch` would not work. How would you convert `if (age > 17) { LetInMovie } else if (parent == me) { LookTheOtherWay } else { SendTheKidHome }` into a `switch`?
Could you please tell us what toppings are on them?
Also, the aim "using the minimum number of examiners for the minimum amount of time" is not too clear. How many examiners are you willing to add to subtract a unit of time?
Found some more information which likely explains it: http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1497&user=guest&pass=guest -- still not sure how I can work around it. Maybe `keytool` can be used instead?
After playing a bit more with the code, I found that the image from the stream gets resized when I use g.DrawImage(overlay, 0, 0). Why would this happen?
I think my EF 20/2.8 prime would qualify as wide angle, if I only used it on a FF body rather than APS-C, where it becomes a long wide angle or short normal lens (32 mm FF equivalent). Perhaps you really meant wide-angle *zoom* lenses vs tele and prime?
Is the taper even along the board, or is it all in the last foot or so?  Is it on all the boards?
The second one looks right to me. What goes wrong with it?
If you want it CW, you have to flag it for moederator attention. Anyway, even as a CW question I don't really this is a real question... What's the point listing results in various fields of physics that one consider "counter-intuitive" ?
bit or digit? the title of your question says digit, your question says bit, so what is it?
@Eric - Sure, it mitigates it to an extent, but why start with something insecure when it's just as easy to use something more secure (i.e. same code, just swap out algorithm name)?
Matt H's comment covers the "how".  As for "Is it legal?"...

why such a large file? Is this a one time thing or is this a on going problem?
I'm really bad at problems like that, but if the int-stream is randomized data and you know the min and max (MAX_INT?) creating a simple tree is automatically balanced if the root is MAX_INT/2?
I don't understand how you're getting 2 3 4 6 from that array. There are five elements from the array, shouldn't it be 3 3 2 4 6?
All of the answers to that othe question are correct. Do you really need help updating a datbase or do you need help working with the Perl standard-data-structures?
Does it have to be `awk`?  Or would any suitable scripting language work?
Please clarify your definition of bacon. Perhaps with a picture?
could we get some column names, and what do the id's reference? there is no ID you have given us on any other column... and what do you mean by "somehow combine them"?
Do you need the id column? Why not just tell the query to fetch only the name column?

what language? You mentioned pointers... does that mean you're using C++?
Good question. Does the term artist imply some level of talent or simply someone who creates artistic works?

I don't know these tools, but re: *Ability to restrict password cracking* - I doubt that's what you mean - you really can't prevent someone from trying to crack a password hash, since it can be done on other machines.  Do you mean restricted access to the password hashes?
Moritz - although the yes/no answer to this question is covered by Rice's Theorem, see my answer below for more interesting results.  Maybe, txwikinger, you should change the question to "What is the complexity of the set {i : L(M_i) is in NP}?"?

almost a question for superuser. what "kind" of ubuntu are you running (or, to be more specifi, which desktop do you run?)
Most of those differences would be identified by a grammar book as differences between British and American varieties of English. How about past participles like "proved" versus "proven" or "got" versus "gotten"?

Sorry did not understand are you saying that Shotwell only works for Photo print sizes? If yes does this include the Custom option in the bottom of the list?
Have you considered using bitwise operators instead of floating-point math routines? You do realize that floating-point is subject to rounding errors, which might explain why you're getting 99 instead of 100?
Is there a reason why you aren't using an object, and having fields in the object, instead of doing everything with a local variable?  Is this state machine running for a long time in your main thread?

We need more information. What are you trying to do?
Is this homework? Have you tried to work out how much storage each approach would require?

anyone? help please?
can you be a little more specific and perhaps give some examples of the current vs. desired interface?

So what do you need help with ? Where are you stuck ?
Short answer is yes. Did you want to know something more specific?
Thanks for the advice. Quick question, is the efficiency gain in both the where and sum methods?

And where do you host the script? In a VPS?
is this something you actually need to do in real life (i.e. some embedded system), or an academic/interview type question?

The character set in Oracle is 'WE8ISO8859P1' ... the eacute in my example is correctly stored in the database if I stay within Oracle ... but when I bring it into PHP via oci8, thats where the problem arises. Is there anything better than the charset_decode_utf_8 function ?

Can we assume anything about the alphabet? a-z, alphanumeric?
The array is always sorted ? `1 2 2 2 3 4`(three 2) will return `1 3 4` or `1 2 3 4` ?
This depends almost entirely on what language, framework and application you're talking about.  What are you using?
Yes, but the project targets .NET Framework 3.5 Client Profile. Shouldn't the compiler throw an error if the client profile doesn't contain that method?

Did you find an answer to 2. of your list? The changing size of the label?
@Tal Sorry, but it's not really clear to me what you actually mean by "predict the lower and upper predictions of y". Does it have something to do with prediction or tolerance bands?
Good question. I wonder if it should be migrated to CS Theory (http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) or Programmers (http://programmers.stackexchange.com/) ?
Are you packing boxes into box-shaped bins? Can you rotate boxes to make them fit?
The edit might make the question more relevant to more people. Maybe or maybe not?
I find it odd you have to define both the height and the width for an image, when your are displaying the image are you defining the width and height already? eg. `<img src="" height="y" width="x">` and have you tried using `display: none` instead of the visibility property?
@Rob Fox, thanks! BTW, why won't you post it as an answer? ;)
is it NSLog(@"%@",self.data); i thought you said self.data was an array? maybe try fast enumeration?
Sorry, the question was not 'Is this correct, or what is correct?' it was 'Why does this work?'
@BoltClock: I'm pretty sure that algorithms are part of the "programming" subject. Strictly speaking an algorithm is not a program, of course, but are we really going to throw out all the questions on searching and sorting methods, on the grounds that "quicksort is an algorithm, it has absolutely nothing to do with programming"?
Define fairest. Does that mean that the average of what each player gets is the minimal possible distance from the max a player got and min a player got?
I would be concerned more with the layout of your data and how you're accessing them. Could you paste a sample of 10 rows, and the most common queries you're using?
Your file logic looks fine. What's happening in the `<snip>` between opening and closing?

I guess Velvetta isn't designed to be microwaved?
No answer yet... If you can post a pic I might be able to understand better the relationship of the plastic board to the drain and the concrete. Perhaps you can get an answer that way?

Your question is unclear - do you need help getting the urls into the database? are these in a file?

After rereading the second code fragment, I changed my assumption to O(N) * O(N-1) instead of O(N) * O(N+1) because the nested loop gets iterated one less time than the first loop, is this correct? So it would be O(N(N-1)) == O(N^2-N) == O(N^2)?

what error do you receive? and when?
Is this a CCK Image field? Is the error happening when you try to open the node edit form or after you submit the edit form?
Are example.com, c.example.com and i.example.com on the same webserver so that these rules also apply to the latter ones? And have you tried a 301 redirect instead an implicit 302 redirect?
Alright Mike - its been already posted on light house. Would you guys need any other things from me to recreate the error?

Are there any other limitations on a_i? for example a_i >=0?
Hi JP. Can you tell me what a CPC value is please?
Not sure I understand the question: (1) wireshark will look at packets as they come from the wire, so iptables rules for incoming packets do not apply; (2) your iptables rules apply to UDP, but you state that you open a raw socket.  Could you please clarify what you are trying to achieve and what does not work as expected?
Ouch - sorry! But once I arrived at music, Genesis wasn't that far from genius - does that count?
@JavadocMD you are correct, I must have missed that.  This brings up a larger issue: if your question is part of another question, but was not answered as part of that question, should you cut a new question?
`sudo` was updated to version 1.7.4p5-1.fc14 on January the 17. Can you check with `rpm -qi sudo` which version (including release) you have and also include the output of `yum -v repolist`?
Advantages in comparison with what? Unbalanced trees, AVL trees, hash tables, ...?
Show some code. And are you sure that the file actually contains linebreaks and it's not your terminal or whatever you use to view it?
I believe your question could have some validity, can you please elaborate on the scope of your question.  Are you speaking in reference to the exchange of electrons or are you speaking in more of a supernatural aspect?
Mo being megabytes (MB)? Or is this some new memory size unit?
How lay are we talking about here?  Do you have some knowledge of Galilean dynamics and Newtonian mechanics?
For what purpose? To make the game or to pitch it to an investor?
IP addresses are just numbers, and can't contain keywords. Do you mean that the keywords are in reverse DNS lookups of the IP addresses, in the User Agent strings, or somewhere else?
Do you want it to automatically be called with a delay of 5 seconds between invocations, or will this be called in response to a user action and you want to ensure that it waits at least 5 seconds after the last invocation before going again? If the latter, should the user be able to queue up events, or should the input be ignored if 5 seconds have not elapsed?
In .Net? C# or VB?

are you looking at the site from the exact same browser? no compatibility mode etc?
What happens when you just use a different algorithm to determine file names? Does OpenOffice.org care?
Isn't it? Homework is work too, or are you only allowed to get answers for free if you are actually payed to find them yourself?
Do you really need to do it using web application?
Do you think your question has not been answered adequately yet? If so, how can the answers be improved upon?
So to clarify you want to paginate the ul's without loading a new page correct? In other words, if you grab 30 items you would want to show 3 at a time in a ul and have some sort of next/previous navigation that hides one ul and opens the next ul?
my expertise is in Java and web dev, not Perl and especially not build automation.  Should I get someone much more experienced to help me?

another great example for how google makes you stupid. does nobody ever read the documentation anymore?
There are actually a lot of ways to handle this depending on the kind of file, the kind of change, how often it needs to be checked, if there are any requirements for monitoring previous actions, etc. Could you please describe your problem more fully?
I'm not familiar with 'refresh' used this way.  Are you rinsing them?  Changing the water?
Not sure what you mean by _"preserve"_ the sort parameter. Do you mean *"How do I parse a URL such that it generates a list of posts on a category page using the desired sort order?"*
When I look at your grammar at line 264, you define the syntax for an object... but you don't appear to create a tree for object subexpression. What do expect the primary_expression rule to do when it encounters an object and tries to set $$ to what I am guess ing is <junk>?
@NV, if it's a job interview, are you allowed to get outside help? I mean, you're the one who's applying for the job, right?
@AviD: Cool, thanks! The original question asker gets to decide who answers the question, though, and can then just select his or her own answer, right?
Is that one hour before the current hour, minute and second? Or are you just interested in all entries logged in the 6 am hour if the current hour is 7 am?
@Rakkhi - Thank you for acknowledging the question of SE OpenID usage on other sites.  Can you please also address the other point I've raised, of the specific case where SEI is both the OpenID provider *and* the provider of an online service with higher information sensitivity such as careers.SO?
Shouldn't this be a community wiki? It doesn't have a clearly correct answer?
I find it interesting claim that when using film, size gives any other advantage than resolution. If the emulsion is the same, how can it have more dynamic range?
you should probably explain the acronyms. Is RMQ range-minimum and RSQ range-sum ?
The problem using mapreduce here, is that you need a common key to feed your reducer. How is the compareTo() going?
What if it doesn't solve my problem? Do people take it personally?
What exactly fails? What error are you getting?
Ordinarily, you'd want to do that in the view controller that's presenting the array, typically by allowing the user to edit a table view. Is there a reason you need that responsibility to be shared across two view controller instances?
Do you have any experience in Visual Basic? Have you tried reading a tutorial or a book?
Maybe the "junk" servers a purpose to the application? What if you SETTEXT without the junk?

What version of SQL server are you using?
Could you post your database.yml?
I don't and as far as I remember, the gdb instructions/NDK has existed prior to 2.2.  Can anyone confirm this?
can you rephrase the question?  Don't know why division is needed... is it to find the cumulative product?
That code works fine for me.  What does your **actual** code look like?
The most complete resource is the internet at large, but that is a bit broad. Is there anything specific you are looking for?

I love "official journalistic decision". Do journalists make the rules?
Please don't downvote without stating your reason. Should this perhaps be turned into a wiki question?
Are you talking about downloads in the Market, or files downloaded from the internet (ie. in the browser)?
Ah, sorry, my mistake. However, at least on Snow Leopard, it's RunAtLoad, not RunAtLaunch -- or am I making the next mistake here? :-)
please edit your question with the link to this "deb".  Also, what happens when you launch the software from a terminal session - any errors displayed?
Please make your question more understandable. And provide an example... What sentence is not clear for you?
Is this format safe? Does it remove also hidden partitions, if any?
commented out the for loop and it compiles fine so it should be the problem. just read somewhere that maybe i should be using a constant iterator?
Your question is unclear.  Do you want the output to be a single stream like [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,2,3,4,5,6]?
Why do you want to use those? What are you trying to do?
Needs some updating. Do you still work on it?
Excellent question. Can we get som esources as to where the different styles originated?
@BCS - A computer-controlled analog EQ sounds oxymoronic to me. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but won't any digitally controlled pot be, well, digital, and the microcontroller and/or pot introduce switching noise when you change the pot's value?
3.1 is in beta, it's less likely for documentation to exist for functionality that is subject to change. Don't get me wrong though, i'd be curious to see some examples myself in anticipation of 3.1... (i tend to use the stable branch as i spend more time supporting whatever the majority of users are on).... (or is this in 3.0.2?)
can you say more about undeleteable? Why would you want to do such?
It looks like its not processing the imports in the WSDL. Have you confirmed suds works with external imports?
If you have never got it working, why should you do it everyday? Did I miss something?
i get this as well, is it only happening since you moved to a later version of xCode? is your configuration in Debug?
the question lacks clarity. is this a mathematical question?
Thank you, after some experimenting, this seems to be the way to go. Any thoughts on how to move the reparented component back to its original place in DOM (and ExtJS component hierarchy) once the window is closed?
i have found many pics with around more than 50 tags !!
how did they do that?
Your scanned images provide northing and depth (and, somewhat mysteriously, easting), so you have all the coordinates you need.  What exactly is the obstacle then?
@InvertedAcceleration, no worries. Question for you, how are you going to deal with the increased floor height in the garage ie Door threshold areas?
Sorry, I'm an OS X newbie. Could you please elaborate as to how I would create and save this file?
Probably a stupid question, but have you ensured that your machine resolves localhost correctly outside of java?  At the CLI?
Why not using Fibonacci heap?  Is this homework?
You could always configure the formatter manually, to precisely your requirements. Do you always want values to be displayed in cents?
What would stop the algorithm from just producing a regular expression that is the "or" of all the possible substrings?  Or would you be comfortable with this regular expression from being produced?
This is a pretty fundamental difference. Are you sure you know what `this` is and what local variables are?
exactly! Any ideas?
Reading the Docs, I see that the AppDelegate is called after the user presses a button in the alert window (the docs don't explicitly say if it's the `close` button, or the `alertAction` button). Could I lodge a custom method in here to mimic a snooze-like effect?
Actually, as a bike shop manager, that is exactly my job. What exactly, do you do?
That's great.  Did you have a question too?
@Bob Murphy: Yeap, you see, *I'm sorry* is used waaay too often, and usually it doesn't mean that someone is sorry - it's just a protocol keyphrase. Do we need protocol keyphrases where real action and attitude is what's actualy needed?
Do you want your `visiblePhotos` to scroll off the edge or wrap around or what? Where is the `visiblePhotos` array created?
Yes, it's possible. Have you tried anything?
What have you tried? Where are you finding a problem?
What is the representation of the graph you have? Is the graph oriented?
Are you studying computer science? Whats your background in programming and computer science?
Do you have any module that changes the menu? May you provide a list of installed modules?
Do the strings have the same lenght? Would padding all to the length of the longest one be a problem?
Hm... I can think of some... though unfortunately not by name. But do you remember what happens if you were to actually hit other cars?
After your subtraction, isn't the sign bit of the result exactly what you want? You should be able to shift that into your bitpack, right?
@kelton52, then the problem is at compile time rather than run time. There should still be behaviour, error messages from the compiler perhaps?
What platform will you be running this client on? iPhone/iOS or Mac OS X?
Have you tried to uncomment the line `#TRIED THIS ...` ? If so what did you obtain ?
Have you posted the entire code?  Have you set an `ItemCommandListener` on the `ImageItem`?
@user5563 the `gam::gam` function does not support cubic spline, and I am not able to get `mgcv::gam` to do so. Could you please provide an example?

Are you sure it's not a worn chain, or chain ring (or both)?
It looks like you are planning to build a bike as opposed to buying a complete bike. Is that correct?
You made me work at that a little too hard.  Next time, could you provide a link to the algorithm that you're using, or at least give us the name of the algorithm?
Since there's different tricks and none is the one right answer, shouldn't this be a community wiki?
How about some screenshots? (Hmm, does stackoverflow have facilities for that?)
Maybe it's not the best idea, if that actions gonna generate html for user. Describe more what this actions do, maybe you can replace them with observer class or delayed_job?
-1: Huh?? Can you please explain?
What part of that are you confused about? [this](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html)?
It looks like you're looking for free as in 'free beer', not free as in 'free speech'.  Is this correct?
Be more specific, what actually happens? Can you give a link?
@Noldorin: this [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz) will disagree with you. Indeed when reading mathematical and physical literature (both books and papers) I encounter this word far more often than I would like :-) What's the proper English term, by the way?
I think your question is a bit unclear. When you write add/attach do you mean you want to insert it into the post?
Usually you'd specify language in the tags (for example, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.)  What language are you using?
What version? 6 or 7?
the problem I have is with founding out what the base case and the inductive step are.
the base case is n = 3, with the array being: operand operand operator, how do I prove that the program above evaluates it correctly?
What is the perl code in question? What does your error_log say?
I can't reproduce this. You have selected `Taxonomy: Term` and not `Taxonomy: Term ID` in the Sort Criteria box?
I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. Maybe you could post a sample of the code that works properly, and the code that doesn't?
@Jon Skeet @Brain Rasmussen I apologise, they did not appear on the 'related questions' nor on my searching. @digEmAll I'm somewhat new to C#, couldn't I use the second one if I used a nullable Bar?
How does an object type change dynamically?  Do you have a vehicle base blass and two derived classes: car and bike?
Do you know how to iterate over an array? Do you know nested loops?
I don't understand what you mean. When you use an array where exactly to compare what?
You need to add more code then. Can you post your main loop where you do the drawing?
There are many general purpose languages. What's your problem with that?
Touched upon in [Do All Adverbs End in "-Ly"?](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/do-all-adverbs-end-in-ly.aspx), section "What Are Flat Adverbs?".
Yes, it certainly could be. But why thre read() does not realize immediately there's nothong to read, but waits for 1/2 seconds?
If plugs are falling out, it generally means the metal contacts inside the receptacles are worn out.  (I'm guessing this is an older house?)
I'm not 100% clear on what you're asking, but I suspect there's one crucial idea that when you get, everything will fall into place. Are you aware that even "empty space" posses a vacuum energy due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and particle-antiparticle pairs can in fact be generated "out of nothing" for very short time periods?
I cannot figure out what image you're trying to construct. But is this even a question about English language?
Can you show where is it that you get stuck? What code have you written for it?
What is `PATH` set to in `/home/hudson/.profile`? What does `type -a rvm` (Bash) or `which rvm` tell you?
a) Kernel mode dump or user mode dump? b) Are you trying to use symbols for binaries you built yourself, or symbols for OS binaries?
The minimum sum would be found by taking the smallest number, then subtracting all other numbers from it. Do you mean "closest to zero"?
OK, just found it: simply press "Enter" to jump to the next occurrence. Why is it not the standard F3?
Is your desired result just the SQL statement with all the parameter placeholders substituted with their values? Or did you still want the `DECLARE` statements included, similar to the LINQPad output in my response?
I don't understand exactly what the rules are. Are you only allowed to pick one number out of each row and only allowed to pick one number out of each column, and you have to pick 4 numbers, and you want the sum of these 4 numbers to be minimized?
Hi Ivo. I think this is a good topic, but it's not clear what your code is doing - for example where does serverCurrentPosition, serverNextPosition, timeBetweenTicks come from?
Wordpress is just an application framework, it's not a domain framework so its architecture must be rather rudimentary. What would prevent to integrate the wp skeletton inside a domain mvc framework for example ?
How about through basement/crawl space, attic, behind baseboards? Or are all of these out of the question?
Couldn't this have been appended to that discussion? Or googled?
Please define the problem you are trying to solve. For example what is a "restricted read twice BDD"?
How are you trying to tether? Are you using PDAnet?
It ought to show up in the Delphi Window _and_ in DebugView. Can you confirm that's happening?
Thanks, I will try this. How much can the temperature fluctuate? How close to 20C does it need to be?
Indeed. Why were the comments removed?
I hope it is `NSTimer * eventtimer`. And how have you declared the method?
I am not a statistics expert. Could you please explain more about the plotting idea?
I can't reproduce this. can you post a link to the image with this behavior?
What do you mean by "like this"? And for what exactly are you asking a rationale?
Does your application use garbage collection? If so, are you keeping strong references to the view controllers?
Cannot implicitly convert type 'object' to 'System.Web.UI.DataVisualization.Charting.SeriesChartType'. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)
I don't see the DOMWindow type in my Chrome. Are you sure that it's a type?
With 6 rows you will end up with ids 1-5 having value 166 and id 6 with value 170. Sure you want that?
Backreference should be in the format (?<link>.*) and not (?<link>.*?)
2147483647. This mean I can only use 32 bit?
It looks like you will have the device powered for most of the time that you have valid data. Isn't a battery backup-ed SRAM more appropriate than an EEPROM (or better, Flash) then?
I agree, The question is almost claiming that you can't debug with a debugger in an IDE this is not the case. You can run a debugger with or without an IDE, I'm sure he knows that though :) Maybe he is asking about visual debuggers specificly?
@Andrew I beg to differ, the examples aren't good enough to explain what he wants. It's like saying "I need *something*, for instance a car, so can you help?".
This question seems nonsensical as focused beyond hyperfocal seems self-contradictory. Can you elaborate?
You suggest that the process occurs with replacement.  Does this mean that you allow multidigraphs (with possibly multiple arcs from s to t)?
Are you sure the timers are responsible for the memory usage? Have you run your app using Instruments to see what objects are consuming the most memory?
I have no idea how your matrix looks like or what you are really trying to do. Could you re-phrase the question?
@chris I'm missing something obvious.. Why is that annoying? Cause the page never stops loading?
You didn't answer the question though - why single speed rather than fixed? What prompted the choice (after 8 years, didn't you ever consider the option?)
Any update? Have you found out why they're requesting these details?
@ROM1 - Yes I can implement HTTTP. Is there any solution for HTTP?
wow, that looks amazalatin'. I want one.  What's the green?
When you're previewing the widget, which style are you using?  What operating system are you running designer on?
GDB is not natively able to jump over frames w/o debug info? I'm quite surprised, it shouldn't be a problem... what's the ouput of `bt` ?
Paws__List is intended to be a _copy_ of List? not a reference or some sort of alias?
The funny thing is that I thought of commenting something like "nice idea, too bad no one uses Wave" but then thought I shouldn't be a jackass, maybe other people do. Turns out I was right the first time, eh?
Actually I didn't even realise you could write `[](u) { ... }` and have the compiler figure out the type of `u` for you, so that may be where I'm getting lost. In any case, the workaround is to put `[](T u) { ... }` so is that really a big deal?
Please elaborate on "doesn't seem to be accurately answered". What did you try and what happened when you did?
First 30 days or last 30 days?  Nothing seems to start at 0, is that just a side-effect of the first day traffic/questions spike?
I didn't quite understand, what are you trying to achieve? What questions do you have and what is the desired output?
Do you have symbols present, and are you sure the source is the same as the assembly you are debugging?  Did you rebuild?
This does not sound like you have observations (or "cases") on which you observe both an X and a Y realization. How do you find out which X is associated to which Y?
Is your work email a Gmail account, or Exchange, etc? Which email app are you using?
Which accounts must read/write the data? Does the daemon just read what a user has written, vice versa, or is it two way?
Is your app doing anything interesting at the time?  Maybe loading another assembly?
Could you clarify this one `Create Menus for Custom Pages` ? Do you mean individual menu areas on some pages or what?
How many recipients is "mass"? Also does it need to be a 3rd-party service?
@Charles: Can you elaborate on the idea with the tagged PDFs? Could it be possible to export the annotations from a tagged PDF and then use this to make changes to my original LaTeX sources?
Ah, I didn't have the XNA framework on that machine (because of the lack of VS I'm guessing). Can you check for that on load?
SO answers homework questions too? Really?
thanx 4 answering my question....                                i already tried ice, but after 9 degree C, LCD went off.so i didn't go 4 boil water but used soldering iron 2 show dat ckt is working. can u please tell me hw can i check temp of liquids like water with this ic?
In my opinion, if the variable is significant (p<.0001) without imputation, and you have enough data, that is reason enough to leave it alone.  What are the confidence intervals telling you?
The short answer is no, there's no such thing as `static` in Ruby. Why not let the database handle your auto-incrementing key?
Thank you. Could you please describe it more in detail or send some link dealing with logos in this software?
But the line with `"ClipID"` works? (Also, can you try `var title = element.getElementsByTagName("Title")[0];` instead?)
It is possible (though not likely IMO) that some strange quantum entanglement effect could lead to a computer that outputs its results before the input is received. Would that qualify as negative complexity??
A good way to see if a question is off topic. If you remove "Game Development" from the question does it still seem like it would be on-topic?
"$(xml).find"
Is that supposed to be xml_url?
There have been several frustum/aabb culling code questions recently; would some expert make a definitive how (not why) guide that shows the steps e.g. how/  *when* to make the frustum, what transform to use on the things to test etc?
Why do the width and height in the HTML differ from those in the CSS? Are you sure the shadow isn't just off-screen or something?
What comes up to me,do the images come from exactly the *same* domain as the the application? Or a different domain?
What....?  How are these related?
Please provide a citation for where Java is *faster* than C or C++. Did you mean faster to write?
Sorry, I should've made it clearer there are other text, figures and tables contained within leftbar as well - I omitted them because this was a minimal example.  So that doesn't appear to be an option for me...  Any other ideas Stef, or others?
It sounds like you're 90% of the way there already with the realisation that you should just normalise everything to consistent units.  What specific issue are you still facing?
This looks right, and works for me. What do you see?
So it's not really about the list, it's about those instructions? What exactly is the question then?
Yes but making it cross browser will be headache. I have old code somewhere, untested for long time - want me to post it anyway?
Wait  you're writing a thesis and you've got *no clue how to use it*? Wow. Usually, it should be the other way round, shouldn't it?
How does the data look? List A = {(3, 5), (5, 6), (1, 2)} and B would be all the points?
I agree, how did you come up with the problem in the first place? I would have thought the idea for a thesis would have come from a real world problem that needs solving?
@belisarius done. clear now?
Wait... "on this specific name / IP address it does not show my acceptance rate properly"? You don't actually know what those things mean, do you?
two programs (processes) and two threads are completely different sets of beasts. which do you mean?
@Zelimir: As answer provided by you, MODE.CLEAR not working with xfermode. Can you please let me know why is it so?

What are you trying to do? I don't know how to embed an image like this in another way but I know lots of ways to get data into a webpage so maybe we can figure something else out?
What if Aa[Ca] == Ab[Cb] > Ac[Cc] and neither Ca nor Cb point to the end of their respective arrays? Do you increment Ca or Cb?
im curious, why did you choose to use malloc()/free() inside the class instead of new/delete? also, what is your compiler?
What is that paper doing on PubMed anyway? Are there any health issues associated with building possessives?
**manage** your cv ? why on earth would you want to put it in a source control system, what the hell are you doing with it ?
I'm currently browsing `[interview-questions]` tag looking for it. Do you have a link if you've found it?
What is the "number of missionaries or cannibals"?  Is it the overall number of people `(+ missionaries cannibals)`, the maximum `(max missionaries cannibals)`, or what?
That looks OK to me (just learning Haskell myself, though).  Is there anything specifically wrong?
*What* doesn't work? How so, and what do you actually want to do?
Can you provide a simple test file (with valid referenced SVG) showing this problem? Have you considered fetching the SVG source and [appending that document to the page](http://groups.google.com/group/svg-web/browse_thread/thread/363d599b7eb5a517) instead of as a referenced element?
I second George. Can you elaborate your problem a bit?
If your map is being loaded from a nib, did you remember to wire it up? Did you remember to set the delegate?
I'm still seeing the "clear" link on my profile page. Is this a change that they're still rolling out?
@Mark C : What title do you suggest ? "Best book for mathematical background for modern physics" ?
I tend to prefer amsmath `\begin{equation*}` over `\[`, because it feels more semantic and makes the source more human-readable. But I really don't know, is there any difference between these two?
What kind of database are you talking about? Is is some specific database or do you just mean something like one array?
Also, when you look at the logs, are the calls to the server become less frequent?  Is it possible you have a loop or call that gets slower over time?
What E-Mail library are you using? Can you show the full code?
Can you please edit your question so that the title fits to the text? "Suddenly" does not seem to involve moving VBox to a different location, does it ;)?
Maybe you can add the way you (or your (grand)mother) prepare it?
What is it that you're trying to do?  Are you more concerned with whether or not the file exists or whether the file is empty?
@justkt - I haven't used powdered buttermilk. Is it acidic or just the flavor?
What are the project settings for the version you are debugging?  For example, is the Debugging element defined so that there is a corresponding pdb file?
I don't understand.  Isn't bounding box just a box containing all of your rectangles?
What shell? bash?
The question is quite unclear. Can you provide a test-case?
What constraints are there, if any, on the course of a ship ?  Is it constrained to move N,S,E or W, or can it move in any direction ?
@kaiser: Sorry, not meaning to be harsh. I just don't understand for what real world reason you would advocate just sticking to those terms?
I''ll send you some User-Agent headers and server logs. What would you like them to say?
Is the table structure fixed? For example, will there be different spans?
What language are you looking for? C/C++?
Could you cite a reference please? Is the rule based on the noun closest to the verb?
You mean the OS-specific printing interface?  How can the OS-specific printing API be magically OS independent?
Sure. Can you describe such a enumeration? :)
can you add some details about your platform and which programming language? you mention CGImageCreate, can you include a url?
What is `swappable` for?  Why are there no comments in your code?
Have you found the answer for your question? If yes would you please share it?
Well, the problem you linked to is entirely different than what you're describing. Can you please decide on which one you need help with?
That is a weird site. For one they count forum software as "Content Management" but then neglect Wordpress?
The first step is where the magic lies, I guess. Care to elaborate please ?
@Aleksandr I've made a minor correction to your rsync command, but I don't understand why you suggest `1 1` in fstab. Can you please explain this?
I am having a hard time figuring out what each symbol means.  Could you explicitly identify them, please?
@Colin Fine: I think it's a good example, especially for the use case described. Could you please add your comment as an answer?
You're not developing on top of SQLite but deploying on top of PostgreSQL (i.e. Heroku), are you?
This happens to me as well, it's very obnoxious.  However, are you asking a question? :P
@chi Sorry for the confusion, I meant a proportion for forest cover, and a binary indicator for presence or absence at each country. I think I get what you are saying here, would the assumption of not having an evolving generating model essentially be an assumption of 'stationarity'?
Is this a fresh install? Have you tried running a fresh install?
@MitMaro Thanks. Could you please do the math of whether it's useful or not? :)
This question is vague. Can you give a more detailed explanation as to the problem and provide some code?
It could well be. Can you tell me how your were turning off CSS styles in IE7 please?
Maybe, but it won't be any more readable. Why do you want to?
Why are you doing `{% ifequal gallery.draft True %}`?   Why not do `{% if gallery.draft %}`?
@Anon.: Whats wrong with using the help of regular expressions to generate an XML?
A platform for new developers to show off their stuff? Having your app hosted on a solid cloud service?
@Nobody: How much slower is that, these days? Do you have any data?
"the client encrypts the password with this algorithm" - how do you do the check on the server later? are you storing plain passwords?
How would you differentiate a series of letters and an actual word? Do you have a database to compare it to?
@davebug: "So, professor, you're saying the etymology is..." "yes, people thought it would be funny to misspell everything. ne1 haz more questions?"
What do you mean by usernames of a process?  Do you want to know the user that created each process?

@stevenvh 1pm could be the difference between a space craft landing on mars and missing.  Oh, sorry - is that one picometer or one picoyard?
Well it seems this is not a trivial question, but without too much thinking, why don't you create a linear vector of hue and saturation of 16 components? I mean 1 x 16 and show them a s cuadricule?
Did you run any individual tests? If so, how?
What do you mean? How a compiler would implement them, or how to use them?
@arthur: Added a more concrete example in Java. How would you accomplish the same thing in Clojure?
I find the documentation for Net::HTTP pretty hard to navigate and understand compared to curl's manpage. Is there something wrong with trying to delegate work from a Ruby program to another unix program?
I don't know what I should be adding to the fstab, so I cannot implement this properly. Could you please help me?
That's not how Shoulda worked when I tried it out. Care to show us some code?
@Ranieri, what would you suggest? JSON?
More likely than not it has to do with the way visual studio optimizes the loops. Can you post the generated assembly?
You haven't told us anything about the value of n2?   Is it constant from (i) to (ii)?
+1 - very welcome update for an inspiring simple yet really entertaining game; given your new employment I've long expected this transition, free-time project or not ;) One question though: why do you have to 'add/enable' new sites? Having a threshold in place should allow for this to happen automatically in principle, no?
Sorry, I wasn't sure as you said you'd upgraded from 10.10, so I didn't know how 'fresh' your install was. Are you using nouveau or the proprietary drivers?
Ok, but can django and html5 coexist? isn't django serving html4?
A very good explanation. Thanks. Which 'degrees' are those? Fahrenheit or Celcius?
That's an interesting question. How do they do it for the flavored beans that you can buy?
Any particular language in mind? Are you inserting this into an existing document, or creating a new one consisting of just the image?
Please be more specific. What exactly do you mean by "hangs"?
What would you get if you just read the file and printed the name straight from Ruby?  That is, is it Ruby that's choking on the encoding, or does it only get truncated once it's been through the DB?
Maybe better suited for SO, perhaps? At any rate what have you tried so far?
which shell are you using ? are you sure the shell executable didn't change in April (from /usr/bin/bash to /usr/bin/zsh, a new default shell ) ?
I would go and say, "I can't find any problem. Are you sure it's not the user?"
Not sure a honeypot that isn't in a production environment will teach you anything - you need attackers to connect to it in order to learn. Unless you are trying to do something different?
What's called jelly in the US is jam in the UK.  Also should it be castor or caster sugar?
Whose delegate? The view controller's?
You have mentioned different (multicast )client address. Are you saying that client 1 will have one address and client 2 will have another one?
Are you saying programmers get more angry than non-programmers?  What are you saying?
Sorry to ask, but do you want to test trails and patients are independent? If no, can you please specify what does the Chi-sq test intend to do?
Does anyone know how to estimate a difference in difference regression in gretl? Do I have to work with OLS or panel data?
Eight Days of Malaise,

"I've *never* heard of Clamshell Lighting. What is it, and when should it be used?" :)
I'm not sure what your problem is here. Is it that GMail let the e-mail into your inbox despite it being flagged as spam or from an address on your blacklist?
This still shows old and read messages. How do you fix that?
I am not sure why (1) is not a way to do (2).
Anyway could you please provide more detail on how to go about doing (1)?
Thanks.  The wall is 10 1/2 feet wide.  Also, how much excess carpet should I leave in order to have enough to tuck it between the tack strip and baseboard?
Google searches really should help you get most of what you need.  What are you learning if you're just asking people for code?
Voting to close on the grounds this is not a constructive question. A sentence could be, for example, an answer to someone asking **"What's the first [or n'th] letter of the alphabet?"**
What is wrong?  Incorrect result, crash, infinite loop...?
"During this update, I have the chance to turn the AI-controlled entity or make it accelerate."  Did you really mean OR, or did you mean and/or?
but that won't work. - please be specific, why people should guess?
I agree with J_A_X on this one.  Just a suggestion though, have you thought of using Flex rotate effects to do this?
anyone! Any ideas?
convert a string to a string? do you mean to an int?
Since the Dictionary of String and Dictionary is named MasterDB, does that mean it is an in-memory database? If so, why do you have to load the entire DB into memory?
Just a bit of feedback: assuming that this is the same question as your recent directed-acyclic-network before, it seems much clearer now. --- How's your linear algebra?
Specify what you mean by black-box. Does the adversary have access to the allocated addresses?
So you're trying to access the @current_account variable in a model?  The @current_account variable is being set in a controller?
@Tal Galili: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_means_never_having_to_say_you%27re_sorry. (My favorite is the line from *What's Up, Doc?*)
This doesn't fix your problem, but why are you mixing C++ and C-style strings?  For a start, you've engineered yourself a memory leak (where does the memory pointed to `buf` go?).
What are you trying to optimize? Do you want to minimize the number of sets?
That example sentence doesn't really feel right. You sure you don't mean to use the past perfect?
What exactly do you  mean by "scaling problems"?  Is this a problem no matter how high the resolution of the images?
What do you mean by "URL", exactly? This is a rather artificial concept with classpath resources - what would you do with that URL?
Usually compilers should generate a good code for such algorithms. Did you check what assembly a C compiler is generating?
could you please tell what is your cpu and amount of your ram? and how many apps you install?
Hello, picxelplay; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. Did you try changing the theme used by the website?
It might help to know what language(s) you are using.  Also,it's a bit obvious but: you _have_ checked that the DLL in question is being built with debug information and that your deploy/publish process uses the debug version of that DLL?
Can you estimate what the warmest in-rain air temperature is in which you could or would wear it for an hour?
I've wondered about this, too.  Can you make a display of an array of LEDs and then detect touch by using the same LEDs to sense reflected light from a finger?
Hello, Vladimir Alexiev; welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which Drupal version are you interested?
I'm not sure this is practical. So much game logic uses vector math, you'd have to either do everything in 3D before converting down to 2D or whatever for rendering, or you'd have to completely abstract away your vector library - which would surely be impractical?
Why is your code stored in a `.cpp` (C++) file, while the question is about C? So, what is it C++ or C?
Because different different languages have different strengths and libraries already written for them. If I wanted to write lots of set up code for this problem, why would I pick a dynamic language, why not give myself more work and code in Java or C?
What R package did you use for HC3 estimation? `sandwich`, `contrast`?
I can't tell if you're asking how a programmer can "break in" to the industry (convincing game companies they've got what it takes even if their experience is in financial software or something), or how a game programmer can get a non-game programming job (convincing other people that game programmers don't just play games all day but they actually have real programming skills). Which is it?
That's very odd, since the pedal is just 2 months old. Hopefully Wiggle will send you a bolt, but then I suppose you'll have to explain and prove the bike didn't fall on that side?
They are completely different. Have you even glanced at the documentation?
Sure it's possible. Do you have any prior experience in Python?
GBA = Game Boy Advanced. What is "/Ds"?
What is this parser for? Can you elaborate on the complexity of the text/code you're parsing?
"Huawei Device" - is this a phone, a tablet, or what? Do you have a model number to throw at us?
Are your images stored as binary or strings that are path's to the files on disk? Why don't you want to use a load of `<img />` tags wrapped in `<a/>` tags?
Your regexp is probably dropping the newline character that is present on each of your input strings.  Can you post the regexp that you are using?
Are the integers regular machine words (e.g. 32 bits) or are they of arbitrary precision?
I don't want to risk the drive using truecrypt, It has too much important data. Any other solution please?
...have you considered implementing it yourself? You *are* a programmer, aren't you?
What happens if you put water into the drain pipe without the dishwasher installed. Does it drain?
"Deceleration" is negative acceleration. Have you taken calculus?
What do you know about the type already? Could you provide a sample context?
Well, works for me anyway - http://paste.ubuntu.com/509394/. Did apt give you any errors while installing the package postgresql-8.4?
Can you please explain that arg() system in drupal, how it does work? Or where i can read about it?
@Nate - Yeah, this is pretty close to that question. I'm not up on disc brakes; anyone know if these can be merged, or is there enough difference between the two models to maintain the two Q&A threads separately?
You tags are misleading - Algorithm, data structures and in your question you are asking for an answer to the puzzle. what do you want?
It depends on how you wanted to modify that query. What exactly were you trying to accomplish?
Not reproducible. What is `EnvironTypes`?
please, explain better what do you mean with "Steam games". Any game distributed through Steam or some specific games only?
What method *serialized* a `Boolean` to "true" and "false"? Or are you simply talking about producing a `String` from a `Boolean`?
@genneth I'm not convinced... I feel there can be some initial distribution of these particles resulting into some binary system or something revolving each other but not collapsing. Dare to prove this wrong?
Sounds a bit like homework? ... Can you define what you need to know in order to solve your problems?
I haven't seen the spec, but if your example is correct it appears they've defined "25% tint" as a strict multiplication of the values. In fact that makes a certain amount of sense - how else would you define it?
you have not provider the 11,21,31 code for that line. Can you provide dxf file so I can get a better look at it?
Could you please elaborate for me? (RDB are not my strongest suit so forgive my ignorance) How can I normalize when there is only one table and no relationships?
Why would you use a genetic algorithm for this?  What's wrong with an ordinary one?
What kind of text? English prose?
but how you represent that in the datastore, i know that you can have a list of keys like parameter in your class, but in the datastore? you made a third entity to strore the keys of the entities in the relationship?
Yup, as Josh said. There may be too many entries to work with just get (limited to 256 characters?).
I suppose you don't have the chance to just set the right time zone on your server, e.g. with `dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` on a Debian machine?
The code above is in application.js and it does manage to create a unique `new_id` each time it runs. But, how can I then access this unique number from inside the view?
This question could be compressed to "How do I define a custom key binding in eclipse?". Was the eclipse bashing really necessary?
You say "My solution involves a tree", but surely that doesn't fall under the "using only bit manipulation" criteria, does it? As such, it's not really a solution is it?
Annotations aren't executable code, so this is unlikely. What are you really trying to do - in what conditions would you want a test to be run or not run?
Can you please paste the code where you read the integers? Also, what compiler are you using, and on which platform?
well, which order do you want to have? and what is the connection between keys and values, then?
Can you add a reference to the LP bug, i.e. link it from your question?
Welcome to the site! Are the rims the same size on both bikes?
@Eric after changes you've suggested I'm getting only one error: 
Error 5 error C2440: 'return' : cannot convert from 'double' to 'double &'  Any idea why?
I'm curious. Why $65cm²$ ?
`ps -ef` shows all foreground processes for me. Which OS are you running on?
Since the _\citation{}_ and _\bibcite{}_ commands are in the .aux files, it should be quite easy to extract the relevant entries from a BibTeX database.  Has no-one written such a tool?
Where is the call to the child's function? (Did you mean to put a function1() somewhere?)
I'm a little afraid to ask, but... what *is* a meat salad?
google? wikipedia?
Can you post some code? You can have a map of maps like `std::map<Key1, std::map<Key2, Val>>`, can you use that to describe your situation?
Thanks both for your answers. Could you please direct me to a book/reference where I could find a proof of the fact that for large samples the paired t-test works?
What language? Or do you want to do this with an application such as Photoshop?
Please provide more details: will you host more websites on a server? How are you uploading files?
@badp I've noticed you often use acronyms that I either need to look up or someone has to have you define for them.  Maybe you could consider typing things out instead?
Take a larger number of samples? Display "calculating" until you get enough samples?
What does a `getenv("PATH")` say? Maybe there is no path set for the PHP/Apache user on Mac OS?
As @Woot4Moo points out, you have already asked this question AND received decent starting points in the replies. So what have YOU done?
@dmckee: Thank you for replying. Can you please let me know the approach that should be adopted when building a software?
Sorry for the edit. Out of curiosity, why did you change it back?
Just parents/children, or all ancestors/descendants? Also, which flavour of SQL are you using?
I am running Windows 7. What built-in tools should I look for?
I don't see you saying that you have measured the performance and found it lacking. Out of curiosity: how much slower is the extra method call, and what are you doing that is sensitive to this small slow down?
css text-indent can be used to move text off the screen. Will that work?
@jacklikesnike: one more question. The encryption key is also the decryption key?
Very good! Thanks. So in UK terms rumb and eye of round have the same characteristics and both can be used as an example of a (well known) tough piece of meat requiring more work?
Perhaps if you are making a presentation about different possible equations, and wanted to use the bullets to indicate that they aren't equations meant to be satisfied simultaneously? (That is, using the itemize environment as formatting to communicate something like logical disjunction?)
Do you need the configurations to match? (x, y, heading), or just the positions (x,y)?
Can the prisms be rotated? Or can we assume all sides are orthogonal/parallel to the axes?
I don't think it matters for the algorithm, but for the record: do you want floating-point accuracy, or are integer coordinates sufficient? If so, how should they be rounded?
So a fixed gear with no brakes would count?  I mean, using the pedals to stop the rear wheel does qualify, no?
it depends. Are these featured links derived from the DB or are they just arbitrary links?
This is hard to answer without more context - what is your threat model, your application, etc?  A general answer is at http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/1476/what-is-the-difference-in-security-between-a-vpn-and-a-ssl-connection so can you look at the answers there and either get clarity on those answers there, or ask more specific questions here?
Do you need to do this more than once in your program?  And do you need more levels of indirection, such as `foo.baz.qux.name == foo.name`?
What version of bash?  did you try using `#!/bin/bash` ?
can you explain more please ?
I am curious why you want to do it in *TeX. What is missing in the various other solutions that use an external language?
Do you have a Flickr Pro account? Could it be that you've got close to your monthly usage allowance this month?
A module that is causing a fatal error because it's invoking a method of a non-object is clearly a bug in a module; it's difficult to say which module is causing the error, as the error is appending in a Views file, but it could depend from a parameter passed to a Views function from another module. (Is it Panels or APK?)
can you explain how/why rocking your bike reduces your gear ratio?
Shell scripting also has language syntax and dialects. Are you using bash perhaps?
At $400, it's too pricey to recommend. Have you considered a strobist based kit in conjunction with ebay triggers?
I'm sorry I'm not sure do I understand you. Are you looking for something like [OSSTMM](http://www.isecom.org/osstmm/) or the software which would support logistics / management side of the pentesting project?
What level of programmer is this for - i.e. beginner/intermediate/expert ?
@FumbleFingers: Can you please make some explaining comments on your diagram? Where does the data come from?
No matter how efficient you are it is going to take a looong time to enumerate through 2^100 subsets of vertices, and that is before you get into the fact that edges can be there or not.  Can you switch to a problem that is likely to finish before the Sun explodes?
Maybe mine is a stupid question, but... Are you running the program normally? or using the debug button?
If you take a line graph on n vertices you have to select n/2 vertices, so in worst case you have O(n) selections for a random graph. Do you have any prior knowledge of the graph?
no.. there is no viewForSection method. What images are you referring to?
What does the code look like where you do pushViewController:? What does it look like where you do popViewController: (or whatever variant thereof)?
Your error message tells us nothing. Do you have a detailed log --perhaps you can run it from the command line (as Ravi replied below) and paste the error messages?
Wow that is a vaguely described problem. Could you please ... give us some of the code you're having issue with?

Without the test cases is hard to prove a solution right or wrong. Can you provide them?
It looks like the string is double encoded: first Html Encoded and then URL encoded. Why is that so?
What permissions are you using (i.e. 755)?
I notice that many questions you have asked are simply available through a Google search. You do know about Google ?
What's the question? Do you want to know what the minimum X for a given N can be, and what the associated algorithm is?
If your lists have more than 12 items, then collisions are inevitable, because there are more then 2**32 permutations of them. Or do your permutations have any particular properties which mean that there are fewer?
Packets are being received by a program ("streamed" perhaps is a good word) that have a type of ACK, SYN, FIN, or any combination thereof. Essentially the question is, how can one detect when five different combinations have occurred?
@Gajet: Can you explain further? What do you mean by only a loop in which all the cities have distance 1 when you previously mentioned all have distance 20 from each other?
There's something missing here. `CDLinkedList` doesn't appear to have a `display` member function, and where's `operator()` being called from?
that is 'some data'? any hint?

The built-in findalls are findall/3 and findall/4. Which one are you trying to implement?
What would you like in the case of, e.g., `http://example.com/test.php?key=val` ? Or `http://example.com/test.htm#section1` ?
I think you have to specify your question more. Is the problem splitting the image, or doing the sobel kernel convolution?
How are you calling those modules? Can you provide some code or some example?
By `50.0000` did you mean 50000? 500000?
Moving the cable around and such I have not been able to spontaneously reproduce the issue, however it is happening a bit less frequently now... still annoying though! If this question is better placed in SuperUser, could someone move it please?
You mean _orthogonal_ forms? right?
I don't quite understand the question. You want a plugin that inserts custom templates defined in plugin?
I presume you have no access to the ESRI REST server / cannot make changes. Do you have rights to download and modify the data?
Perhaps also a bit of information about the parameters to `Field()` would help.  Also, are you trying to use a 1D or a 2D array to store the fields?
Is your column `OLE Object` type? Do you use `Bound Object Frame` control to display the images?
I'm skeptical that this is possible.  In the final version, both operators take the same precedence and are left-associative?
Homework?  What have you tried so far?
An algorithm...for what?  Mine placement?
@Unsure The quote from your notes doesn't say "array" anywhere. Are you sure you're not dealing with linked lists, where the advantage is clear?
I am not sure if I understand, it seems to me that your short answer contradicts your second answer. And, could you please provide an example of how can I use hyperref to do this?
If you know the line it crashes on, could you post that line of code? Do you have threads in your program?
is `"puzzle game using","group of words"` a legal solution? or does it have to be 1 or 2 words per partition?
What do you mean by user agent? The browser?
What kind of games? Any in particular?
Is the code you pasted inside a servlet's method? If not, exactly how are you calling the code from the JSP?
How is myIntersections used? Do the elements point to doubles in another vector?
That example is not scaling. Can you post your code?
not sure how the table is storing the tuples or if i'm understanding correctly, but, don't you already have that information? if there is a table with the tuples, say, tuple_table with tuples (kn, gm), and you want which k element (coming from set A) maps to which g element (coming from set B) wouldn't a simple select on the tuple_table do it?
I confess, no. What's exactly to be read in the docs you are referring to?
Why not keep the numbers in memory? Should be what, 100 MBytes?
Aren't answers from Kev and papin totally opposite? So what's the truth?
What's "shortening"? Is that another name for margarines?
Wow, today I learned something completely awesome. For completeness, can you please include a link to a dictionary or at least its pronunciation?
ahhhh please this is so common its not even funny. Why do managers think that testing can be optional just cause their getting fire from above?
I think if you were to consider the DAL as a seperate entity and imagine that it was your sole responsibility whilst all consumers was work done by a third party, you would probably raise an exception for Access Denied - most of the framework would.  If however, you want to avoid _exception logic_ it would be helpful to provide functions to help the consumers determine if they have sufficient access to data - though that sounds like more of a business logic issue, which is it that controls the access?
@Mike: I don't know Java yet.  Could you explain what makes this work in Java but not in C++?
smalltalk is something I am looking into. Does Smalltalk/X work as in interpreter until you compile?
You don't alter the code of Views to add a new sort criteria: you create a module that implements the new criteria. Are you sure there isn't already a similar sort criteria?
*@itrekkie*: Try as I might I don't understand the question. Could you clarify?
I've never worked with beamer `\note`. Could you please add a minimal example for your problem which compiles?
please clarify. Are you looking for packages that fit so-called *free-knot spline* models, i.e., regression splines where the number and location of knots must also be determined using the observed data?
This is a vague question. Do you even consider the payment and billing cycle dates?
The plane of the X will always be parallel to the plane of the image I assume? So no perspective distortion of the X?
***deletes even so cynical comment***. Can you tell a bit more about the nature of your data and how you want to display it?
Why the vote to close? Is this offensive to you?
Could you please provide a link to plugin you use? Is it released by flattr themselves or some third party?
You say it's not compiling. Do you understand the error message?
What is the column name in the Role model?  What does the line of code that outputs this message look like?
So the input is this "giant list of giant sets `G`". What's the output you're trying to compute?
Are the cross-sections always convex polygons? Or can they be concave?
So... you want to implement an exclusive decision tree without using if/elif? Why???
@Sukumar What do you mean by "size of my page"? Could you please give me an example of "passing the values directly to javacsript"?
cuz then it wouldn't be a BINARY search.  Any more obvious questions I can answer for ya?  :)
Dry mustard? Or prepared?
Isn't the second solution not optimal? Shouldn't it be 128 by 224?
@hade @Dogbert I have updated the original post. Is this helpful information?
Is the `.linkQuantite` element a child of the `<tr>` element? Does it work when you do `$(this).parent('tr').attr('class'));`?
@Thanatos: Interesting, however that statement implies that there are no multibyte string encodings that have embedded null bytes? Is that correct?
Yeah, tough crowd today.  Maybe it's right after a long weekend? :)
schoolwork? it's a strange query, don't you have more information for us?
Could you try re-stating the question a little more clearly?  I'm not clear on how the comma-grouped lists of connections in your "path" relates to the input graph G.  For example, D=>A appears twice... does that mean there are two paths from D to A in the graph?
Note: with valid image file I didn't refer to the file type but the content. That is: could the image data be damaged?
yes it is python 3.x.  what happened to raw_input in python 3?
Is it acceptable to call it like `f2(func, *args, **kwargs)`, which in your case would be `f2(f1, 2, 2)`? Is this some kind of testing framework?
I've just started seeing this same problem after the latest Froyo OTA upgrade. Maybe that's related?
I agree, this is pretty much a subset of the earlier question. What's in this question that's not just a more focused subset of the earlier question?
http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/perl-5.10.0-RC2/pod/perlcall.pod#G_KEEPERR explains the `'(in cleanup)'` mechanism, http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.2/ext/XS-APItest/t/call.t shows using it.  this is all XS related, but maybe it will help point you or someone else to a pure perl answer?
Who would be helped by this?  Is all that work really going to help someone?
@zr: **How is 0x5f7fffff "even" but 0x5f800000 is not?** What exactly do you mean by *nearest even*?
In this code sample, you are opening a filehandle in read (`<`) mode and then `print`'ing to it. Is that what you meant to say?
I recommend the [$0.5M 1THz Agilent VNA](http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5989-7620EN.pdf). £1~$1070, right? :D
It's unclear to me what you mean with "rule engine" in your question. Could you elaborate?
Which water temperature? The tank, or the outlet water temperature?
I didn't think the people at Microsoft would be so inconsiderate to say "Hey, your database WILL get corrupt, you have to use a menu command in Access to fix it!"
Would they say the same thing to people using SQL Server?!
How did you fix this. It doesn't seem that simply moving your views into separate modules would work?
Sorry for the delay :/ When you say "overridden using filters," what do you mean exactly? There's an alternative to hacking on the source?
On a related note: Some providers offer (for an extra free) "privacy protected domain registration". What does that mean?
It should prepopulate from that json url. Are you sure you followed the guide?
I have just tested this in a Google Presentation Document by copying the symbol in your question. It displays fine in design and when I click Start Presentation ?
the heavier coin + the lighter coin is the same as a normal coin -> cannot be true, if heavier > normal > lighter

have you meant heavier+lighter=2*normal?
Is it necessary that you use a neural network to perform this classification?  Or would other classes of algorithms be acceptable?
@azheglov Yes, sorry, not sure how that happened.  I don't seem to be able to edit the comment either (insufficient rep?)
We will need more information. Would you please open a terminal and post the result of "sudo fdisk -l"?
Who is the author, where do you cite it from? Maybe he is known?
What have you tried so far? Do you have an attempt at making it work which fails?
What happens if you replace the `` in `Vicen` with a `c`? Still have this problem?
We still need more details: do you have your own SMTP server? Or are you using a gmail acccount for instance to send your mail through?
Sorry, I thought I had. It's a simple game, "Guess My Number - The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100> The player tries to guess it and the computer lets the player know if the guess is too high, too low or right on the money" Forgive me, I'm new here, should I have explained further?
I see your comment "ask user to save his work". Is there a modal window which appears which prevents the shutdown?
Ah... Hmm. Would it be possible to wrap it in Jython somehow to make it a Java applet using the code I wrote?
If everything is one page behind, why can't you just take this into account while in button_click event? Something like ActualTab + 1?
Is there something more to your question that you would like answered?  More details?
Storing an entire HTML page as CSV doesn't really make much sense. You mean convert an HTML table to CSV?
Which part of the task are you having trouble with? What hints have your lecture notes or textbook given you about this problem?
Which VB do you want an answer for? VB.Net, VB6, VBA, or VBScript?
It's hard for me to imagine a content type with >100 fields and it's even harder to imagine if that it would be the best and most usable solution for any problem. Can you explain which problem you're trying to solve?
if your series is non stationnary, the ACF will decline very slowly, to the point of being useless (it essentially a constant). What do you mean by 'have any meaning' ?
In what way are they better? I'm asking because I have the LPCXpresso board and the tools seem to work well so I'm wondering how the other tools are better?
are you sure it is not an 0606 component(ie. Measurements of the device)?
@Paul: The list of operands you can use inside a predicate does not include "and", but you're using the comma as if it were an "and".  Should we consider "and" to be allowable in the definition of a predicate?
@Guffa What exactly should I do to make it absolutely clear that I don't care what for my vote is used aside from the fact that it lets the OP know that his / hers way is the best in my opinion? Would you stop making remarks if I upvote your post?
Sorry, I'm not understanding what you mean. They don't have what data?
What do you plan to do if every number has been generated? Or is there a fixed number of numbers that you generate?
Thanks, Dimitry.  I responded on the other board as well, but do you have any samples of a wrapper-based timer that I can use?
Do you have 18GiB of memory to store the solution? Do you really need all of them?
But what are the actual values? Can you print them?
Do you need to send any params in another controller(ex. :id, :page)?
@Sorin: If it's just a simple script, then why do you need "syntactic sugar" at all? Is it pure vanity (*"...but I want it to work this way because it looks much nicer"*) or is there any technical reason that you cannot simply use the methods that are already there?
Polls are discouraged. We are after questions that can be answered, like "How do I reach the last star on Super Mario 23?"
The title references `apt-get` but the question is about `wget`.  Which one of the two are you interested in?
@Gulshan Sorry, obvious question - is there a reason this can't be a web application and/or done w/ something like Adobe Air?
Error 500 means, that connect to Apache is working, but something behind it does not.

What can you see in /var/log/apache2/error.log after trying to see the page?
It seems like this question gets asked every week, but I can't find the original or any duplicates (they're probably being deleted).  Perhaps it should be added to the [FAQ](http://stackapps.com/faq) or even the Getting Started sidebar?
Please tell me when it turned out that Mach principle is wrong? And how this "wrongness" is manifested?
Does each '?' have to be substituted with the same letter, or can they be different?
Please name one of those places.  This doesn't make much sense; how would friction destroy a chemical?
It should automatically pick them up. Is it not?
Thanks you! Please, Could you explain what are these options mean?
This looks like a bug. Do you see high numbers when the program is NOT marked "`Not Responding`"?
I want a pony.  Now we're done sharing what we want, did you have a question?
Some database action is linked to `stateChanged` so yes. I could use a counter so only the last event calls the mentioned DB method but maybe there's a clearer way?
Are you asking how to persist the data (Access, Excel, Flat file) or how to query the data efficiently? Are you going to build this DataTable every time your application runs or do you need to persist it somewhere?
What's the context?  Is this homework?
@Alexander this is a little bit of an argumentative question.  Do you think you could phrase it better?
I don't think anyone's going to be able to help you based on that information alone (considering we don't know what `0x306aeaa5` is). Can you post your code and tell us what the exact problem is?
Does that mean I am allowed to create my own version of the algorithms? or should I need to follow a pseudo code from a standard governing body like NSIT?
Good point. 

What about in non-sushi applications? Should I always rinse rice? or, is it OK not to rinse when I'm not making sushi?
@Sklivvz or MBQ, can you please edit the question title to put it proper English? "Why does the sky change color?"
Do you have a specific geodatabase in mind or are you looking for general material. Same for Python: Are you looking for ESRI specific material or more general?
You might want to add more context to the question (although it's been fairly well answered below :-) I.e. why do you want to do this?
Interesting question!. Why not tagging "debugging"?
Well, it would depend on what the text file contains! Basically, the compression will be removal of extra spaces and line breaks, which can decrease the file size substantially, but how will you re-construct it again on the client side?
Its not a homework people, my colleaugue asked me to help him with some algorithm, this is only a part of that, I simplified it in terms of normal array objects, anyways the data consist of approximately 1000 elements, so if you could help us with atleast a better( efficient algorithm).
and who tagged this is as homework??
Right. Any idea where I plug in the OAuth2 stuff?
"*i need to include that function*" What function? "*i need to know an easy way to get it included and get started with it*" What is 'it'?
That's...pretty cool, actually. Would love to see this with a harder tire, though. Do you have manufacturer's ordering information?
I always try to use correct grammar.  Why dumb down your correspondence?
"If you have played GTA 4, then you have probably been drunk at some stage." Because you must have been drunk to play a GTA game, eh? ;)
"promised to the client without my knowledge" ... I feel your pain.  Would an arcobjects solution be acceptable?
By average time difference, do you mean the mean of the difference for every record? That is, `Sum(table1.timestamp - table2.timestamp) / n`, where table1.id = table2.id and `n` is the number of rows common two both tables (eg n=count(table1.id = table2.id))?
On the "better performance" part of your question,
what are you actually doing -- what numpy functions, what vec / array sizes, what cache size ?
"I'm fairly new to java programming (or programming in general)" So, have you used another programming language before? Which one?
Sorry, but I don't buy it. Why should we be sheep because exceptions didn't exist in PHP over a decade ago when classes were first implemented in PHP `4.something`?
All I did was add a newline and 3 spaces to change the formatting. Perhaps someone else tried to edit at the same time as me?
If you are insecure about your pet IDE being criticized, then by all means, step up and defend it.  How do I define a custom key binding in eclipse?
Out of interest, why?  What do you use this for?
it might not be Windows that is doing this, but your display driver. Is it nVidia?
[[link](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/2968/google-account-on-htc-desire-galaxy-tab)] this guy seems to be forced to fill a captcha forever and could not login using his account on a second phone. Does anyone have the same problem?
Can you describe how it crashes? Do you get any kind of error message or exception?
I'm pretty sure there are lots of this kind of plugins out there that do the same thing. Why do you want to make yours?
Not sure I understand what your bounty is looking for.  This is a wiki, so there's no "one right answer" ... what's the criteria to win the bounty?
The opposite of a location at (lambda, phi) is at (180+lambda, -phi) (where lambda is longitude and phi is latitude in degrees).  What additional help in "location" would you like from the GIS?
I really doubt many people are going to **download** the code. Use code tags and place it in your question, or use codepad/pastebin on the forever-stay-up-there setting?
Is the ceiling smooth or textured?  Is it drywall or plaster?
If you only want a finite number N of oracles, you could define an N-in-1 compound oracle by using the first log(N) bits of the compound oracle to indicate which suboracle you wish to query. Am I missing something?
This happens for me, too, but only on my dev machine.  Did you ever find an explanation?
Just out of interest, is it now considered acceptable to utilize "utilize" instead of using "use" as in the question above? Or should I stop worrying about this?
sorry, yeah, that's what my file looks like. Well, the '& ~' isn't indented, but that doesnt matter right?
Nice solution. What's a measuring jug?
@Dallaylaen   _$ =~ s/::/<br />/g;   Like that???
What are we trying to minimize here? Number of students subject to total cost <= C ?
yes that should be possible. I'd have to build some UI based on some javascript library and then some custom php integration to save the preferences in drupal database then?
Are you asking why these particular sigils have been chosen (as opposed to three different ones)? Or why there are sigils at all?
Clarification please. Do you mean "i is from 0 to 2" or rtmp1[3 * 4 * NMAX]?
The what? Can you include a link?
Do you mean, when you break into the debugger and step through the code the image disappears?  Or when running the form in DEBUG mode?
What have you tried? What didn't work?
3) and 4) look broken to me. Did you mix up `and` and `or`?
@delnan: thank you. Do these work under `Ubuntu`?
I'm sorry, but I can't understand `find the missing element in O(N) or better` What does mean *"or better"* in this context? It seems the kind of thing that would be solved with a simple while loop, but anyway I don't understand - it's either *solved* or *not solved*, right?
I've not used glut before, but it seems odd that a window would be receiving input messages if it *didn't* have focus.  Are you sure this is something you need to do manually?
Just to be sure: He does not have a cached version if an image? Is it the PNG on the website or already in the PSD?
@Tim Post:  It also looks like Dan has two unique SO accounts.  Perhaps they should be merged?
Why aren't you just doing this.startActivity(intent)? Can you post the logcat?
My daughter's earbuds magnetize TOGETHER, not opposing and they shocked her once. Anyone know why?
Yes. It references the static in A just fine, just not in B. I see why this is a problem since A may have no visibility to B's statics. I'm asking if there is another way to do this?
What good is that number of partitions to you? Do you need a number or actual list of transitions?
are you sure, that textView isn't null already? Could you provide an error message?
@hhh - Fascinating topic, but "which energy sources would you use" isn't answerable in its current form. Can you please ask a specific question?
What virtual machine software are you using, e.g. QEMU, or VMware?
No idea what feature you refer to (don't think it is something native), please elaborate? Also self-hosted WordPress or wordpress.com blog?
I'm excited! My latest Kies download is under progress now.... Please tell me, is 2.2 official upgrade released?
Is this homework? What have you so far?
Ok, I see my question is about a web service and thus a purist will flag to close it; however, I'm seeking an answer regardless.  Since superuser is for hardware and software related questions and not website software, err service, related questions; is there a stackexchange site for webservice related questions?
I may be having trouble visualizing but in the first option it sounds like you're describing adjusting the size of a door rather than making/installing a jamb for a thin wall. Can you please clarify?
Any hints, ideas, clues. Why am I not able to install again to the real device ?
Are the Ajax or other porlet technologies good enough?  Are there any other Java portlet technologies that I should study?
Presumably because the compiler decides to pass arguments in registers, or because the stack still contains the required first argument. Does it _not_ work?
Well if that is.. I don't think the DI Extension is being loaded. How can I check this ?
You would be changing the semantics of the underlying language if you could do that - not usually a good idea. Maybe you'd be happier with a completely different programming language that has semantics for int/float expressions which are more to your taste ?
If you prepare slightly smaller images, I'll insert them in your question. Also, what's that thing with truncated titles in your screenshots?
The first thing to look at is `ls -l /home/guest/nis1`. Are you sure that the NFS server, the NIS server and the client all have the same user ID for `nis1`?
Since you're also allowing nodes to be visited more than once, then there are an infinite amount of paths: `4-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-5`, (you can keep repeating `2-1-2-1-...`). Perhaps I'm misinterpreting your question?
Why would you want to round in such a strange way? How would this be useful for money rounding?
Your question seems quite strange, given that if you want to find all the paths and their costs, you can just enumerate them and sum the edges costs to get the total cost. Maybe you want the shortest path?
One has `const`, and the other does not. Is this intended?
Don't forget to test this case: `test.sh -a -b 'c d' -c`. You don't want the "c d" to come out "d c" (but do you want "-c -b 'c d' -a" or "-c 'c d' -b -a"?).
You are correct Yi Jiang, we are only using HTML for his web developer.  What do you mean when you refer to "If so, then why add all the weight of a rendering engine when you can do the same natively?"
For all downvoters, it may be that english it's not his native language. @varsha: You want to create such an application or you already have one and want to configure it?
What's wrong with Wireshark? In general, what "seems not to fit"?
Please make your question more clear, preferably with examples. Is this a question about philosophy or about language?
hey @yoda .thnks fr helping me out!..can u please post the above comment in my question as edit ..? it says i cant as am not allowed 2 post imagess ????

I've never heard of this; it sounds really interesting though, and I'd like to try it next time I make meatballs. About how long does it take to cook them this way?
How would you handle sarcasm, or other complicated figures of speech in such algorithms? Is it even possible?
Welcome, Hunter! Typically we want questions here to be specifically related to photography, not just image editing; if your question is photography-related, perhaps you could edit it a bit to clarify that relevance?
@Nick i have already tried calling `[self parseXMLFileAtURL:path]; `instead of viewWillAppear, the result is the same.  
I'm not sure i understand your last comment, could you please explain it a bit more?
Hi @philippe. Since it seems like you found the solution, could you please post how you fixed your problem for future readers of this question?
How about just placing an `<img>` with width and height set to 100%? Do you really want to do it with CSS?
@Kosmonaut: Yes please, I agree with Martha. What is the deal with W ?

how far off of their true locations are the points? meters, or not even in the right general area?
It would help if you could create a scenario so I can see what you are talking about. I think this is an optimization problem, but what if you have a non-optimal solution that meets the requirements, would that be sufficient?
You probably forgot there could be `Nop` between `Push` and `Pop`. `Push() ~ Nop() ~ Pop() ~> Nop()`?
Are you looking to round to those specific 12 colors in Google image search, or was that just an example of color rounding? If the latter, how many colors would you ideally like to end up with?
It looks like a bg image behind an actual image.  Are you sure the img isn't a broken link?
Your question title doesn't match what your sample shows. Do you mean "How do I find the indexes of nil elements?"
Let me rephrase your question. Whats the difference between fixed function rendering and Shaders?
@Isaac More basic ops doesn't mean less programming effort. Which is simpler: n additions, or one multiplication?
you need to clarify what variables the `summation` applies to in your equation? is it summing over all `i` and `j` for each slice (color in the third dimension) or do you want the sum over all values?
I'm sorry, that doesn't really make sense.  What is your question?
@fmark: Good for you. Why is this comment (from a thread that's now 3 months old, no less) directed at me?
3d is often hard to explain in text. Can you give us a sketch?
Could you define 'lighten' ?  Do you mean lower calorie, paler color, a more tender crumb, a more delicate texture, or less weight per given volume?
*Electrolysis* (in title) is often used to split water into H2 and O2--distinct from *generating electricity* (in text).  Which is your aim?
Would you please edit the title and text to specify that this is a question about MSN camera support in Empathy?  Also: what do you mean by "I have problem to change files with it too"?
I find that "GIS for the masses" is an oxymoron, I end up calling it computer mapping or web mapping.  Does your question include browser based mapping apps?
Sorry to ask a stupid question, but... What exactly is this thing?
Why not just use the onmousedown event as a trigger for whatever you're attempting to do instead? (What are you trying to achieve?)
I was going to answer with http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/ , as far as I know it's the best solution for doing this. What does it lack that you need?
Is your interest of theoretical or practical nature? If practical, are existing tools like http://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/ inadequate for you problem?
I'd be curious to know how your activity timestamps could come in out-of-order for a given user session. Would it realistically report 13:00, 14:00, 13:30 for a given user?
Please tell me you're joking. No, seriously, that's not actually what happens is it?
great points.  Just out of curiosity is there a reason that you would prefer steel over aluminum or are you just commenting that it would probably hold up well?
Depending on how you do it you won't lose any data. Which build do you have now?
Stating which model of MBP you have will help, as the architecture changes over time. Assuming Unibody, at least?
Do you want to connect your wiki with other systems? Bug tracking, customer support, planning?
On Linux, you pass the --disabled-password flag to adduser. Maybe OS X has something similar in its command line repertoire?
If you need the image to fill either height or width to the corresponding dimensions of the div, I can only think of using javascript. Is that something you are keen to explore?
This question really doesn't satisfy the guidelines of the site.  Can you please read the FAQ and then edit this question?
How do you get a runtime error, if you got a compile time error? What did you change to get it to compile?
What do you mean by "tracing letters"?  Could you give an example, please?
What type of application is this? WebApp, Console, WPF, etc?
You parsed XML using JSON parsing? Why???
The very easiest way to tag an image is to use the Alt Text in picture's properties, but I have a feeling this isn't what you want based on your example. Can you describe more about not only what you want but how you plan to achieve it?

Sorry my browser can't load the page to the book. Can you mention the name?
How are you using the FtWebRequest class? Do you have to problem with all FTP servers or just the one?
Is there any point though? If the image is already the correct size?
@Michael No it doesn't have to be jpeg based, but it needs a significant compression ratio as the reason we want to do compression is to significantly reduce the amount of data transferred. From what I know about LZ compression I wouldn't expect that on raw image data, but am I mistaken?
Have you actually installed one of these things on your website, and what experiences did you have with it?
Wow, is it my writing or what? This is my first ever question in StackOverflow and all I get is misunderstanding??
Is it a particular C++ implementation of the Towers of Hanoi? I'm trying to see why you have tagged C++?
Why not share your library over Bonjour so she can access your music? Or is there something else you want her to do?
So how exactly do you figure out, at runtime, how to call the function that you've stored in this function pointer? In particular, how are you supposed to know how many arguments to pass it?
Thanks, I forgot to add this . Where shall I add it in the list ?
Did you have a question about "Question 1"?  Do you understand why the answer is 6?
Can you specify how the automated build tool invokes the click event?  Is it some sort of UI testing tool that may have a bug?

Do you mean debugging YOUR jquery code? or debugging the actual jquery library?
operating system?  How is Bonjour installed?
So the dimensions of the rectangle you're allowed to use is fixed and it's axis-aligned? And I suppose you want to minimize the number of points which are left out .. correct?
Can you paste in your code? Or maybe try to find a small reproducible test case that you can paste here?

What is it that you are trying to achieve with this regex though? What would you like to do with it?
@Norman: I need to wrap lots of legacy API so that I can call it from lua, so a automaic way is a MUST. Do you have any other recommendation?
Or am i going against the grain here - should i really be using sessions instead? Are sessions the more 'blessed' way of doing things in struts2?
It may depend on the image file.  If you Select All in the pdf, do you see the outline of the image?
This makes no sense. Did you mean "space complexity of O(n2)"?
Do you want a `list` where all of the values have a key in the `dict` greater-than-or-equal-to 6? Or do you want a `dict` where the there are no keys lower than 6?
Can you define what you mean by best? Best as in the most secure regardless of cost or something that has the best of everything, small, lightweight and good value for money?
If possible, try using the VGA cable to hook the iPad up to a regular monitor. Does that give you the same result?
Knives! where are you?
Are the holes only orthogonal connected?  Or is diagnonal also allowed?
I don't think it should be tagged as a multiplayer game since that isn't given by the OP-it could be human vs AI. And by 'type dependency', are we talking the classic rock->scissors->paper->rock type thing?
How are you accessing the image?  Loaded via Request?
perhaps a stupid question, but you don't have some bogus character in your .py file after "unittest"? Does it work from idle or when just starting pyton and typing "import unittest"?
Are you saying you want three developers to be accessing *the same* device? I don't think that's possible, but you could easily set up a central repository and have all three with their own devices (please clarify if that's what you're asking for?)
What are you trying to do?  Why can't you just store the "Range"?
Why bother with the `.php` in the rewritten URLs? Why not just `/course_view`?
Do you have a constructor defined for your class? Also, is the default JVM the official one from SUN?
Can you explain what you mean by 'marking up reusable elements' a
nd 'standardized markup'?

I have the iPhone 4 but do not see API Keys at the bottom of the screen. Has this capability been removed ?
Why can't you use standard algorithmic analysis to arrive at the run-time? Or are you asking for the run-times of well-known algorithms to answer these problems?
Is this really a common problem? Do you have this with more games?
Those coordinates look correct: longitudes should precede latitudes (to retain the positive orientation of the coordinate system: horizontal displacements must precede vertical displacements) and values in the SE US should have longitudes around -86 and latitudes around +30.  In what sense, then, is anything "reversed"?
Speaking to it from a programming perspective, what on earth is "too long" about a simple 50-character sentence?  The original is straightforward and understandable to your target audience; why do you need to shorten it further?
Do you really mean that is the entire tag?  The script tag is an external ref that simple has an empty comment inside?
Actually using (overridable) setters is more risky than accessing a private field. What if someone subclasses your class and redefines the setter?
"a method that exposes all info of a team" ... exposes how? `return this;`?
What is your goal? Should it be initialized with the empty string again?
Those sound more like rhetorical questions than actual questions. What are you looking for?
Did you install threads correctly (for. with CPAN shell)?
When you say "good", do you mean an efficient one? Why do you require it to be non-greedy?
Wow, I'm really surprised that the non-dimmable one works on the dimmer at all.  Does it buzz or flicker when you try to dim it?
Since each polygon would overlay a polygon of the exact same shape, you really won't glean any benefit (that I can think of) from having multiple shapes. Are you doing this for something other than symbolizing features on a map?
Clearing caches will not really clear up space, it will just slow your page loading down until the cache is regenerated and fill up your memory again; and if there is not enough space to regenerate the cache, you will just experience the slow down. Anyway, the Desire has a half gigabyte of internal memory, it is roomy enough for almost anything you need after you moved applications to SD and your data should all be in SD as well, are you really sure you actually need more internal memory?
There used to be a Flash version made by Sega themselves. Where did that go?
Interesting. Can you provide a link or two, so we can at least guess what those people's native language is?
@tomkaith, are you getting an error-code number from the call? Or just the numberless error msg?
If all you want is just to make money, you'd better stay off from programming.  How about becoming a popular actress?
You could specify whether you need an introduction on applied statistics, or one on (theoretical) statistical inference. I.e., do you want the framework of testing, regression and ANOVA explained or do you want to know what the central limit theorem and the inequality of Chebiyshev have to do with the weak law of large numbers?
Are you expecting that you don't know what huffman symbol is the 'EOF' symbol? Why not just add an extra one to the code to represent EOF, and fill preallocated blocks with that symbol?
how is google formed? how internet get serched?
@Mgccl: Great that you found a better solution for your specific case. May I ask what you are doing this for?
$G'$ does not seem to add anything to your setup, as it is simply a forest of cliques.  You seem to be asking about the average connectivity of $G$, but what is the distribution of functions?
Out of curiosity what are you actually trying to accomplish? To put it another way, _why_ do you want to do this?
@Shinto Sherlock: You just *answered the question*. Why would you not post it as an answer?
Your question is not clear. Could you please edit the text and add a bit more context?
Thanks, Anu. Sorry to be a php nitwit, but I tried this and got nothing: '<?php wp_get_post_terms('20', 'toolkit', 'description') ?>'  should I have left it as '<?php wp_get_post_terms($post->ID, 'toolkit', 'description') ?>' ?
What are you interested in achieving? Which other features would you like to see in the module?
Are you still interested in this one? Could you answer the questions and comment on the answers to refine the approach?
What kind of error message do you get?
Did you try GDB ?
Since there is a loop there is an infinite number of paths. How do you wan to deal with it?
Besides altering the value in web.xml?  Are you asking to pro grammatically update the web application's WEB-INF/web.xml file's init parameter(s) for a given servlet based on some condition you detect at runtime?
@Nikolay O. : Thanks for your input. What exactly unbrekable space character means?
Thanks, will check that out. Is there a advantage/disadvantage using setjmp/longjmp over signals as proposed below?
Why do you need to create static images for the pages at all?  Why not re-render the PDF page as needed at the higher zoom scale?
my following solutions are working for me without refactoring. Aren't they working in your environment?
@diEcho & @MaKo. Oh wait, are you looking at searching on the server or with Javascript?
Are you running in user mode or kernel mode?  Direct manipulation of the IDT is definitely not supported under Windows - what are you trying to do?
Could you please take a look at the pictures I added to my question? Am I on the right track?
There are lots and lots of rational fraction libraries.  What language would you like to know about?
@charles fox: should it be lossless? Are the images line art or photographs?
Yes, I received the warning about asking a subjective Q but I got no responses on other Q&A sites like Yahoo so I thought I'd give it a shot. What's a CW?
Did you restart the server? Why do you need to change it anyway - you can serve content in any locale?
Sorry, I just don't see the long TeXed formula in TeX even though it looks OK in the preview - a strange bug that I am unable to fix. Can someone help?
You want to generate an image like that given the original Van Gogh as input? Can you clarify?
Your Frequently Asked Question is answered in the very first sentence: "perldoc -q match" --> "I'm having trouble matching over more than one line.  What's wrong?"
What have you tried?  Do you have any code snippets to post?
You need to specify a jurisdiction (at least a country, ideally a state and town) when asking if something is illegal. Otherwise how can we give the correct answer?
Is it something I can fix myself easily then? Or does it require some esoteric knowledge which Local Bike shop owners gain through years of study?
Please see my comment on Egil's answer, this does not work for java swing windows. Any other way to do this?
Err... sorry for my ignorance, but.. what would be the point of this? You want to literally hear the bits and bytes of your kernel binary code in your speakers?
@Steve McFarlin, thanks, you have any tips on reading except the qt-documentation to grasp the whole structure of the mov-file because i'm really having trouble gripping all of it, is it correct that the atom don't even need to be in a specific order? which one did you think was easiest to work with mov or mp4?
Do you happen to know `foreach` statement? And what about $_POST array?
This shouldn't be happening. Could you please [file a bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tomboy/+filebug?field.title=Another+Tomboy+error+while+tring+to+sync+with+Ubuntu+one)?
Where are you sorting `dateArray`? Or you aren't doing it right now?
i would recommend to have a look at some data structure book. How about Tannenbaum ?
@Dave Long: Thanks, great!  Would you know what the name of that command is, in Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Keyboard?
yes you are right I guess the problem is really whats happening around release, (I just wanted to ask if this is fine to do). Actually it's related to cocos2d before release I am making a CCAction and I have a CCSprite *sp, I am simply doing [sp runAction:anim]; while the animation is running I am releasing it, though nothing happens to the animation visually but is it right?
I have a question about this topic. Consider the general component diagram, not the instances one: should we draw two sockets (connection) from the philosopher to the dining room / fork interface or is one enough?
Of course I am not comparing to anything else. Otherwise, I won't be here, right?
I deliberately didn't mention memory constraints because I wanted to hear several ideas and then make a judgement about speed/memory tradeoff. Can you be more specific about lookup tables in this scenario?
JIT? You mean android Jit? you using jruby in android?
How are you calculating your total number of nodes?  Also, your diagram shows an unbalanced tree, may I assume this is what you intended?
Right, the workstation is a VM running 64 bit with VS installed and I'm attmepting to debug to the local dev. So there's no way to work this?
@Tony: I guessed as much (do you write some of the MSdN content?), but how does it relate to the fileStream and/or responseStream and the overall solution?
I don't understand your question. Can you please elaborate and clarify a little more?
Yea, that one crossed my mind. It didn't seem like the best rails-y way, ya know?
This is an awesome question. I think the question should be, "How do I import the [Geonames list for India (ID.zip)](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/) as taxonomy terms so it works with Hierarchical Select?"
what a hypocrite! Doesn't his solution (steps 3-5) also apply for both of his statements?
Seeing this problem with a bit of perspective, an idea would be to embed bibliographic metadata in PDF files. Maybe biblatex can do that or can be made to?
You again? Why don't you go do your homework?
Do we have to assume that you are considering a fixed set of predictors, i.e. you are interested in getting a reliable prediction given $k$ predictors, or are you also interested in some kind of penalization on the $X_j\quad (j=1\dots k)$?
Google indicates that the ReadyNAS NV+ is a RAID controller.  Can you link to the product you're using?
you dont want to save them for future usage? You prefer to keep them in cache?
@Mark Trapp, a similar question has already been closed on StackOverflow. This was understandable, but if we can't have this kind of discussion on Programmers, then where can we?
Ugh, possibly the ugliest Python code I've ever seen. What are you doing?
what context would the serial number be used in?  Is it just an identifier or is it meant to be a secure type thing (like the Windows registration key)?
A few questions:
Do you know the number of elements in the sll?
If input is {{a: 1, b: 1}, {c: 1}, {b: 1, c: 1}}, do you just want {{a: 1, b: 1} , {c: 1}}, or all 3? If it's the former, what exactly do you need this for?
This looks unnecessarily complicated. What are `prodsofar` and `listsofar` supposed to represent?
Did you install a FULL version of Visual Studio Professional?
What happens if you force open the dmp file?
I have modified my job, so it doesn't use such a large heap, but also at this time I have changed `HADOOP_HEAPSIZE`. And I don't see real outcome of this chagne, I mean: Why set heap smaller than: amount_of_my_RAM / number_of_mappers_or_reducers?
I have no idea what to tag this. Ideas?
Is this homework?  If so, could you please tag it as such?
Do the scales overlap to some extent (i.e. shared constructs across the questionnaires)?
+1 Very nice. Can you do a stable sort so we can do sub-sorts?
How big are the sets? Can you read all of them once from the disk and then keep them in memory?
@bigubosu: Any chance that you're overwriting it later on? What is the output of `NSLog(@"testTwo %@", scoreList);`?
How is your DAL structured? Is there only one Assembly?
don't you only need the for loop to go up to half of the number you are tying to find the primality of?  e.g if your number was 100, then 50 is the biggest number that could possibly be a factor of it, no?
Please provide more detail of what you have "Kabob" (kebab) is not a technical term, and means many different things depending where you live. Are the Kebabs raw or cooked? Why do you think it will not be tender?
Clearly, Boost smart pointers are useful, but they're not revolutionary for design ! Are you considering Boost libraries as a whole in your question, or just smart pointers ?
This seems to be awfully implementation-dependent...  How confident are you that none of this will change in future versions of Perl?  Would it not be simpler and more robust to use objects instead of raw functions, having each object store a function and also remember the appropriate package?
You do `SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE id_products=13 AND name="audio" AND value="2.1" AND name="hdd" AND value="200 gb"` but that won't return anything because there is no row that has all these values. Are you looking for OR instead of AND?
Sorry Olin, I'm very much a noob who's running before I can walk. What do you mean by latch up and why should there be continuity?
Is there any reason cache the popularity of the object inside the object, while you have to calculate it anyway? Wouldn't the order in the array be sufficient?
How did they get there to begin with?  Via the official Facebook app or something else?
Since you are using a process supervisor, you should not need pid files. Can you configure apache2 and postgres not to create them?
Can you explain why you need a text file dump of a bunch of synonyms? Why not just use [synonym.com](http://www.synonym.com/synonyms/) ?
That's odd, it only does that on my browser. Any idea why?
Are you using fresh herbs or dry? What is the dish?
I think the question could bring some good answers. But maybe it's more fitting to make it a CW?
Your symlink might have been removed by `ldconfig`. Your description is confusing, could you edit it with the exact file names involved at each step?
It's my understanding that it is not possible to change a file's ctime without royally screwing everything else up. Why do you need this behavior?
Anyone please? A response?
Are there any constraints on the variables? E.g. integer type, implicit int->bool conversion, etc?
What types are those variables? int? float?
Do you simply want to turn single characters into a list, or do you want to tokenize the input, i.e. turn `57+23` into `["57", "+", "23"]`?
I see unbalanced brackets. Is line 21 in C:?
What do you mean by _if i don't use a custom menu_ ? Could you please describe more clearly under which conditions you get desired result and when not?
just curious, why do you change filters so often?
what about the link on the sidebar that points to this help? Is it disappeared?
Did you hit Ctrl+F7 and typed 'someStringList.DoSth'
 in Evaluate/Modify window?
Dude, awesome planning.  Also, since there's at least two ways to do pretty much anything, how would you know if they are right or not?
Usually you don't get answers, if you don't show effort of solving things by yourself first. So, what are your thoughts, what is your proposed solution, what is clear and what is unclear to you?
What prevents you from taking photos like in the magazines?  Perhaps post a link to a photo you took, and one you'd like to take?
If it's TRUE white noise (static) it's at all frequencies equally and unfilteranle. What kind of noise is it really?
I have a basic question. What Wordpress php file is this in?
That first parameter *will* be your page title ... Have you tested this code?  What exactly are you trying to accomplish and what are you seeing that's not the behavior you want?
Could you clarify what you mean by "zoom?" Are you referring to the effects of `Ctrl +` and `Ctrl -`?
One idea: don't. Why do you think you need to do this?
If the set is {1,2,3} will the list be {1,2,3,3,4,5,6}? In other words, can there be duplicates in the input list?
not sure. I'm new to http, afaik, coz server is designed to serve requests from different mobile platforms, this is to get some consistency?
Are you on development webserver? Check if the same problem present with your app working under IIS and then with new empty mvcapp?
I can't figure this one out - adding the values of int pointers makes sense, but adding two char pointers together doesn't make sense for values or addresses.  What is the outcome you're expecting?
Although I didn't know that there is such a function in sql. Are there any others like this?
And what's your problem, exactly? What have you tried so far?
An error I can see is that you have defined a field called author and set a field called user. 
Is the posted code what you actually ran?
Yeah... that's a good idea, but I thought that perhaps an online repo existed. Don't you know one?
shouldn't it be simply n! (if n is the lenght of your string)?
What Models do you have in your app? are these items stored under a different model?
However could you please comment the difference? And the problem with the former?
@joelt -- good point, which I think is the ultimate debate going on now by the answerers below, but I would like to know (@everyone) how much of a difference is it at the beginning until they converge?  How significant is it to affect the resulting algorithm?
Sorry if this is obvious, but what is `dn`? Is that a constant multiplied by `n`?
Looking over your pastebin code, actually, this seems like a problem: `UnHit = [CoordList[0]]`. Should the `0` be a `:`?
What do you mean in terminal? Are you just in a shell prompt, or are you trying to capture arrow keys in an irb prompt?
Check what you get from $('input.in') -> is it the first input? is it an array of all elements of that class?
YUI Compressor can compress JS and CSS... What error did you get using packer?! Have you followed these rules while writing JS: http://javascriptcompressor.com/content/CompressedExample.aspx ?
Sounds like 'can anyone show me how to iterate over array and execute function on each element'. What's the problem with iterating it step by step, just as you described?
You should also consider the ergonomics of your setup. For instance, does one configuration or the other cause you to move your next out of it's natural position more than the other?
It would help if you described what your ultimate goal is. Do you really expect a given multigigabyte media file to have any resemblance to another multigigabyte media file?
Just to clarify - your want to output the strings from the short text file, subtracting any strings from the short text file that are in the long text file? Also, how large are each of these files, and what code have you written thus far?
I suppose there could be several valid solutions? If that is the case, are you looking for some optimal solution in some sense?
integer or float? continuous numbers?
I noticed you had 3 answers. Did they give you the information you need or did they not answer your question in full?
In this case, its the finite line segment. Is "line" called something else depending on if its finite or infinite?
Could there be quotes embedded inside quoted strings, and if so, how will they be escaped, i.e. `"Two by four (2""x4"")"` or `"Two by four (2\"x4\")"`?
The comments on the youtube mention that the framerate is too low to play the game comfortably. Why do you want to do this?
Weird, in JavaScript `1337 * (Math.PI * 0.01)` = `42.00309377849554`. Which one is correct?
To properly address the symptom, we need some information.  Do you mind following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/AlsaInfo, please?
$() and $j()? why? do you use jQuery.noConflict()?
@Hendrik: I just wanted to edit the question title (to be something better than "XXX question") ... if you think the question should not become community wiki, please do this instead of me. (My proposal: *How can I avoid my graphics overflowing the box?*).
How to check this? And if so, how to change?
"Slightly differently" is completely fine to me.  What is wrong with it?
Can you expand on your question?  Are one of the arguments in this function supposed to be passed from the server?
is it accessory to call only delegate method on button click ? or some how to call it ?
this question is getting flags. Can you improve it or make it more clearly a *question* please?
Your wording of the directory structure is a little confusing. Would you please update your question with a more specific directory structure and which HTTP error codes are returning for which files in that structure?
@Emil: Do you have a reference? Anything more recent than the ancient (1995) discussion linked in the OP?
One remark -- expand nMDS. Is it just non-metric or something more exotic?
someone sitting on the window sills? I assume they are wood underneath with plaster on top and 5/6 inch wide marble slab on top?
That's why I am confuse...though if I think twice, O(m*n + n), that should be the worst case. What's your opinion?
1st of all, I think `string` is a reserved word, and shouldn't be used. Second of all, have you tried debugging with console.log?
Now we can see FileList, it's simple. Out of interest, do you really need FileList at all though, as opposed to just using `List<string>`?
@danilo its not the file itself that requires the SUDO its what the files calls, which is `svn commit` but first I `cd /var/www` to call svn commit from the working copy. Is there a way I can add permissions to do that for apache user www-admin?
Hello Narendra. What is your question, exactly?
Will you have enough RAM to run the system off RAM (i.e. you can load a big compressed archive at boot time), or must it run from the flash card?
should pmf(X) be the normalized frequency distribution of X? If yes, do we have any function in Matlab to compute it?
Subsonic caches mp3's to the memory card.  So in this case, why would you want to do this?
There are 788657867364790503552363213932185062295135977687173263294742533244359449963403342920304284011984623904177212138919638830257642790242637105061926624952829931113462857270763317237396988943922445621451664240254033291864131227428294853277524242407573903240321257405579568660226031904170324062351700858796178922222789623703897374720000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 permutations of 200-element set.  You want them all?
What do you want to obtain from parsing? An expression tree?
Fixed it for you.  BTW, `apn_config` is a `std::vector`, right?
Really annoying default behaviour. How did you disable it?
There are ways, but to be honest this seems like a bad idea.  Why do you want to do this?
What language is this? (apologies for ignorance, assuming C#?)
Also, I seem to be missing that GPS checkbox from the settings interface... After Review i see Shutter Sound which should be on the next page according to the screenshot above. Any clues?
Interesting concept. Have you tried just adding them to a list as you get follow notifications ?
I like your hypothesis, however a more sinister option could be that they were attempting to use the tethering feature of their iPhone to take files off your network without them passing through your gateway. Although I think your hypothesis is more likely (do you work somewhere that people would go so such lengths to steal data?)
I'm following through here, with my comment on the original thread:  Vote to close as S&A.  On the other hand, perhaps (since this is particularly related to SE) we might carry this over to Meta?
Hmm It's a "promo" block that displays a picture with text underneath it on the left sidebar, on every page. So through your questions, Grezly, I'm perceiving that I must somehow make the home page show up as a block with a "teaser" underneath on every page?
would we not read the second example as 2 divided by negative 5? Or do negative numbers go beyond the level of mathematics intended for this exercise?
what defines whether elements are acceptable? is the compatibility matrix an input to the algorithm?
Please describe, what happens if you try to boot. What boot options are used?
So you want to remove classes `class2` `s2` `another-class2` and the like? Do you want to remove all of them, or just one at a time?
I met the same problem.  Have u resolved it?
pdfTeX does not alter images. Perhaps post the problematic file somewhere we can get at?
Where does it crash? Do you have a backtrace?
Okay, so, one more time, what are you expecting as output from the heuristic? that distance(3,2; 3,3) < distance(3,1; 3,3) < distance(3,2; 3,3) ?
just to verify, can you capture what the generated SQL looks like for a simple get like `Session.get(SecurityContact.class, id)`, hql with `from SecurityContact where securityId = ?` and your left join attempt? Also, what version of Hibernate are you using?
Is it homework? Also, in what language are you trying to implement this?
So use a merge sort. And the question is?
homework?  what have you thought of so far?
I feel like this is probably an issue with your configuration, since I don't see why C++ code would behave differently than Obj-C code. Can you post a screenshot of what you're seeing?
Have you tried? How? Some code?
Your question is phrased badly as it is both a double-negative and infers that we can read your mind. What you meant to say, I think, is, "Can you help me understand the meaning of this quote?"
I think part of your question is missing. Can you clarify?
...Bipolar? Electronic Jekyll-Hyde? :-P
Well, probably yes. But these are guys who shave their legs -- is fertility the top thing on their mind? ;)
It would be trivial to do this in awk.  Does that count as "doing it in bash"?
Strange, because it should use the Intel chipset drivers to run the USB. Have you updated to the latest Boot Camp?
Just curious, how much is a bunch of fresh mint where you are?
@Dunhamzzz doesnt the useragent change only on update of browser software or windows? and i think that doesnt happen everyweek?
Actually, it worked locally but then did not work live on the site.  On the site it is still saying "Access Denied" even if calling the jQuery file from the same domain/subdomain combination... any thoughts?
I added a simple out.println() message to the location where I am calling redirect and that output appears before any other output from the response. So shouldn't I be allowed to redirect at that point?
What exactly want you to install the mysql server? Can you give the commands you entered + the output?
Any ideas on how to create from scratch?? like what is required, ect?
To eliminate the (unlikely?) possibility that the Server migration is the cause, can you go back in time in your version control and get a version of your app from before the problem started appearing?
It would be helpful to learn what types of helper functions you've written.  Do they lend themselves well to a Term::Menus approach?
the endpoints of the arc & the center of the circle specify either of two arcs (they complement eachother to make up the entire circle). how do you determine which arc is relevant?
Which platform are you using? Which perl version?
What error? What exactly is not working?
@svante - I'm fine with that! Care to give any feedback on what I SHOULD be using?
We need to know more about your Julian format. Do you have a Julian date and the year/month/day it corresponds to?
what is the problem with the query you used? are you trying to get all "ticks" for an industry in just one row?
Does it reach the license initialization code before crashing?  What licenses are you initializing?
What is your cost model?  Is "AABC" meant to be more efficient that "CAAB"?
Using Apache? How about mod_security?
what is the problem exactly? you don't know how to phrase it so cucumber will understand it?
[This thread](http://forum.archosfans.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=17511) on an archos 5 mentions turning off the "static IP" setting on the device. Does your device have that setting?
Are these whole frozen crab, crab legs, or crab meat?  Is it pre-cooked or pasteurized?
Is your profile at 85-100% completion ? Also how active are you ?
Is `MPSection *section = [self.sections objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];` correct? or did you mean `MPSection *section = [self.sections objectAtIndex:indexPath.section]`;?
That's true, sorry. But couldn't we try to use the fact that comparisons are bitwise to try to "group" them by any way even if the order of the objects isn't the same as the order induced by the binary representation ?
this could be a very interesting problem if I could only understand what you mean... is it like a Hamiltonian path problem? "i to i+1" between as many nodes as possible?
So say a sample has size n = 40000.  Then you have one such sample of random variates from A, and 100 replicates each for B, C and D?
This post says some things about "ownership" and "GIS" and "land" but there's no recognizable, unambiguous question.  Could you please clarify and repost?
Why would the detection limits go up? Are they not a feature of the test instrument rather than that of the sample being tested?
Fails how? Do you have more information, such as error messages or sample code?
If you need a command to do that, you better provide us at least with the language/package you use. Are we talking SAS, SPSS, Stata, SPlus, Minitab, R, ... ?
Are you trying to simulate how it would look if someone pointed an ordinary movie projector at this surface? Or are you trying to adjust what you're projecting to try to cancel out the deformations in the surface?
i tried to get the angles and add 90 to the angles of the axis i want to rotate about ,but i don't know if this i true, 
can anyone give me a general algorithm???
Much slower? Did you switch off 'String Format Checking' switch in compiler options?
This is a pretty broad question to write out code for. What part of the process specifically are you having trouble with?
For solving an algorithm you have to now how the data is representeded. In this case.. how do you represent the rules and in what kind of data structure are they stored?
You say we are given a set **S**. Can we modify its contents, while still providing an answer relative to the original **S**?
A widget for what environment? Or are you talking about a theoretic algorithm to calculate and render such a widget?
An interesting problem, but it's not totally clear what do you mean by "compact". Could you give a definition, please?
How come you have a need to to_str on a name? Isn't a string already?
Could you explain your question further? Is {10,10,10} supposed to output numbers from 000 to 999?
I think this area of discussion is important.  Especially if we flip it around and ask "what should I as a photographer be [not] doing to make my clients happy", or "what should my clients be looking for in me"?
Sure seems to work for me on FF 3.6, Chrome 7, IE 8...  http://jsfiddle.net/x3MMA/ (added a console.log to test).  Are we missing some details of the problem?
Any chance of following this up?
@kalle43 what is the rest length of the springs? is there any tension without displacement?
@kalle43 All movement/displacements happens on a plane correct? Can you confirm this is a 2D problem?
Thanks.. but can you tell me how to promote only 200 nodes?
@Peter Smit: What do you mean in your comment about "latex processing"?  What did you expect to happen that didn't?
large as in 10^6 or large as in 10^12 ?  Are there any bounds on the end points of the range which includes all the intervals ?
Um,oops... sorry for editing your question; thought I was editing an answer. Want me to pull that down into a comment?
Sorry about that, yes it is a taxonomy page then. The code I posted above using get_terms() was working so that means your code should work too right?
What format is your heatmap in?  Do you have some function p(x, y) that gives you a probability density at x,y?

Unless you're building an ORM yourself, this is a strange question to ask. What exactly are you trying to do?
Are you saying this doesn't compile elsewhere? Ie this is xcode specific?
And how do you want the words to be sent? Each word separately, or the text as a whole?
Yes, it works. But if I write \path instead of \draw it doesn't work, could you tell me the difference between them, please?
In English, please?  Can someone translate this?
Which part is failing? Is it getting to the PHP code fine, or is the error occurring with how the PHP file is getting the data etc?
Is `n` fixed? I.e., do you need `n` groups regardless of whether `n-1` groups would give you a "better" partition?
"I'm aware of WSOD Walkthrough but none of the reasons seems to apply this case.." have you added the error reporting in the index.php? Do you get some errors then?
Sure, done.
(what's up with these 15-character minimums?)
Weird thing is that setting ENV in environment.rb was ignore. That should overwrite system globals, right?
I don't see why the trivial greedy algorithm does not work? Am I missing something?
Doubly linked list? You mean that one should be able to traverse it both ways having an external pointer to _any_ of its nodes?
How do you know it doesn't work? What if you use an absolute path instead of a relative one?
What about the size of the submatrix? Can it be anything?
Please clarify: Do you already have a table of network nodes with IDs or do you need to create IDs from scratch? If you have a nodes table, how does it look like?
@Sergei: Fair enough, but what I find remarkable are the people who not only prefer to devote their time to the everyday useful questions rather than "cool problems to work on" (fine), but also actively vote to prevent those of the opposite persuasion from answering these questions if they want thereby signalling that such questions and people are not welcome here, and that their presence makes this website worse. Does it?
Is it managed or native? Can you throw some more details?
As the log mentions, BTServer is posting a notification called BluetoothAvailabilityChangedNotification. Why don't you suscribe to this, and any other notification interesting to your app instead of reading and parsing the logs?
the edit just made things less clear! how does one reorder a list A to another list B when the elements may be different?!

""This waveform resembles a frequency modulated sinusoidal wave (only it is not)."" Is this a joke?
None of this is going to answer your question, but: 1) you probably want to swap 1st and 4th lines 2) What is the purpose of tmp_64_data? 3) should the second "if" be "else if"?
What separates movie title with the release date? Is it a tab ?
This is the first time I've heard of this. What is it?
-1: For not specifying what is to be done later with the data. If you claim the question is open-ended (interview and all) then why accept an answer?
I'm not sure what you mean by "it shows no impressions too". Do you mean that your site doesn't come up in the results when you put those keywords in?
I just tried it with gcc 4.1.2 and got the expected exception. Are you sure this is the exact code you tried?
Pipes are IPC tools. Where's your other process?

That should work. What is the error you are getting?
What is `:first-child` applying to in what you have written? What is it meant to apply to?
@Jeremy: What happens if you add this line to your code - `alert({iframe:true, innerWidth:425, innerHeight:344}.iframe)`. Does view source give you the same code?
Apparently, you correctly answered your own question: The watch window gets the value of a variable by calling its `ToString` method. So, what's your *actual* question?

Geeky and Cool do not coexist? :P What's Google then?
Request
@Brian useful != possible. The question was, what is possible?
could you give an example, please. What oportunity do you mean?
It is unclear exactly what the question is. Do you want the complexity for inserting into the set + finding the median, or just finding the median within various implementations of a set?
What is your wrapper supposed to do? I.e. what do you want to "wrap"?
yea, that code was crufty.. see the latest edit. it is still crashing when accessing the new array..perhaps the \0 characters are getting lost in the shuffle?
By "doesn't work" do you mean that you left off the `self.` that would make the various values part of the object?  Can you provide any error message or traceback?
I didn't test it, but does it properly remove the following comment: `--[===[ text ]====] more text ]===]`? And does it _not_ remove parts of the following code: `a='--[[' ; b=']]'`?
think this is too time localised to be on-topic. Any other thoughts?
I really want to know some context for this question. Why would you ever need a word for someone who loves frogs?
You might want to add some comments on what you mean by early game as this term is often confusing and interpreted differently. For example, at about what supply are you expecting the Marauder push?
Does it have to be breadth first? I mean does the root have to end up as a head of the list?
Nope, no sense. What's a conceptual break in this context?
I really don't know... but a GTK+ version would be awesome. Are you thinking .net, C++, or PyGTK?
Interesting question. Are you after a theoretical discussion or is there a specific problem you're trying to solve?
This might be a Facebook issue, but it might also be an issue with how your code is prepping the image to be sent. Can you share your code that reads the image (form your server) and calls the Facebook SDK?
maybe a bit harsh to close this. drop the last two sentences and it's an OK q, no?
If you unregister that option then any dependancies core code has on that option will fail (though it may not cause a problem - i'm just hesitant to say there would be no side effects).

The problem is that you're probably calling that function before the file that declares the function has been included, where are you placing the code?
You mean Properties? or the Autos/Locals/Watch window?

You have some efficiency constraints? How about finding all cycles, and excluding the non-chordless ones?
Clarification: Do you mean to run the container itself under a hot tap?  Is the result really "good as new?"
I assume you can code a balanced tree as a data structure. Why is forking processes interestingly different?
Do you have the source code? Have you tried starting it in the debugger?
Why are you storing the `first`/`second` iterators in another circular buffer? There could be arbitrarily many of those, why not put those into a linear container, preferably a container of pairs?

That depends upon the audience. Beginners, of professional programmers in some other language?
You'll have to give more information such as: what type of data are you rendering? do you have complex loops in your erb?
@bigp - Trying to nail down your definition of "evenly distributed".  Do you mean the distance between consecutive points is constant?
Yes the second for loop has no braces as it contains a single statement within it.

The "another set of numbers" is unordered? With no duplicates (since it is a set)?
Should I use EBNF, and then compile it using http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/file/view/ebnf.py to generate pyparsing grammar? Or should I write pyparsing grammar directly?
Sorry, I guess I edited at the same time as you answered. I'm guessing that atan2 is only in 2.10?
I don't repro this at all.  What *exactly* do you type?
Nice question!.  Which specific terms do you understand and which ones do you not understand?
It's pretty unclear. Where do you want to add an overlay view without using a `UIImagePickerController`?
@T.E.D.: Um...thank you?
What error? We should guess?
What do you mean by: "we would like to test whether it is an vis-a-vis the general population"? and "single sample S"?
This looks awesome, but I got lost at "You connect the two plates together with some solid core power cabling you can find at your local hardware store.". What is "solid core power cabling"?
But still, what do you want to measure with CV and in what purpose? To get a cutoff of attribute number?
What do you mean by "expected running time"?  Are you taking the expectation over some random distribution of inputs (as most of the answers seem to think), or over the distribution of random bits used by the algorithm (the usual meaning for randomized algorithms), or both?
What do you have so far? How are you storing what you get out of Nokogiri?

what is EPST?  What are you trying to do?
What do you mean?  The best OS to do Arduino development on, or the best OS to run on your Arduino (a la FreeRTOS)?
What exactly do you mean by tab-completion? Do you mean juts completing the commands available or completing the list of gems to install?
I remember seeing a table of bicycle laws in various states, but I forget where. A search isn't helping; does anyone remember seeing this?
This suggests a driver problem in the newer kernel.  Are you using wireless to connect to the internet?
Two questions: Can you assume some probabilistic model for the measurement times (or, better, the time between measurements)? For each measurement you have a (noisy) value of f(x) and also an (exact) value of x ?
does it have to be a C# example? can it be vb.net?
@Micheal- Thanks.Could you please elaborate on how I could set this up?
Some clarification questions: 1) Do you want BibTeX to get the information _directly_ from the database, or are you prepared to extract it yourself in .bib format?  2) Do you already have the information in a database in a specific format and want to use only that, or would you be happy converting to another bibliographic database system?
I'm being a bit thick but what exactly is the problem...Are you getting an exception? is so what?
It Works For Me (tm).  What's your O/S ?
What have you tried? What didn't work?
Can you please clarify, if you only care about the weights, why you don't simply do `data[x] += w`? What do you care about besides the weights?
Post the exception that occured - preferably including stack trace. Is it perhaps `InvalidOperationException` and you have a library with it's own .config?
that's two votes for reopen. what more do you need ?!
Are there anymore styles being applied this [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/s8d3R/1/) looks fine in Chrome. How does it look to you?

Ashvini, if you cannot tell the difference between answering a question and posting a discussion, you shouldn't be working on software to begin with. Really, what the hell?
Did you try it yourself? Profile it and see which one performs better?
Maybe I'm missing something... What's the purpose of a door on an oven?  Isn't it to keep the heat in?
It might be wise to specify what kind of maps you're looking for. Standard bouts against players, or those special kinds of maps with non-standard objectives?
Is your encoding consistent throughout, i.e. the DB table is utf-8?
You mean sample data, such as for testing? Or fuzzing?
Why the downvote?  Am I missing something?
What do yo mean by sum to 100%, given that your first is well over 100. It's also not clear what you mea by difference factor, since it'snot a factor - do you mean the difference between adjacent buckets needs to be + or - the difference "factor"?
C++ code updated again, compliments of Tim, however it the C++ takes 0.95s compared to the C uuugly code time of 0.59s. Is this speed hit the price I have to pay for better code?
Can you be more specific about how you want it to evaluate the logic? What should the code output?
In this question's current state, I feel it would fall under 'how do I make game X'. And if you've made more complex games, couldn't you simply pick up an up-to-date API reference and write a framework? ;-)
I think the inner div will resize, as it has a width of 100%, but you won't notice it. You probably want to resize the image, too?
"think I've pointed out something that is not yet satisfactorily proven"?  What have you pointed out that's not proven formally?
When you look at it in Firebug or Fiddler, do you see the headers? Does making the string all lowercase make a difference?
First time I hear about this, can you please supply more information - I'm curies how this thing works. You mean my CPU has a GPU inside of it?
I'd say the statement should be "... whereas not all Superkeys are Candidate keys". That's not the same, is it?
Shall try and dig an example up for you tomorrow.  But would you consider adding a `XmlReader` style class to the library in the future?
You get to name the row and field sets explicitly, i.e. you don't have to specify a contiguous rectangle in a fixed coordinate system (particular row and col permutations)?
@Stefan "Return the number of steps required to reach the exit from the starting point." Does it really have to be stated with a question mark?
Um, why are you doing this with Javascript? Is that really going to be the way to put things into the database?
How many 1600x1200 images are you talking about? Are you asking how to speed up the internet?
what language should be responsible for creating the empty file? is it a bash shell script?
@Henk Holterman, I knew someone would tell me this. But what else can I do?
Well, if you have a O(V+E) algorithm, I'm really interested! 
Could you post it here?
Consider adding a picture.

Could it be a drain for a sump pump, perhaps in your basement?
This happens when the system can't start another X server with the second (new) user - it disappears and goes back to your (locked) screen. Can you post up your graphics drivers' configuration and the hardware specs?
since the 2 cogs are interlocked. How would you suggest they can run 'out of phase'?
So, to conclude, it should be acceptable for the beginning to have only one SceneGraph, that would contain all the objects in the scene. Can you advise please, if cameras, lights, triggers should be in the scene graph as well?
Let's talk about the error in a little bit more detail, Sergey. What is the output you get and what is the output you expect?
It doesn't look like you have any image loaded at the time you are calling this. Do you know how to wait for the image to load to ask for height and width?
Please elaborate. Does it mean it's planned for Oneiric?
What this statement do is giving you "no hire" on interview and severe pay cut if found in production code. May be professor will like this answer? :)
@Jack first method under constructor. Is the binder code available?
You'll need to be more specific about your example in (c).  What are complete sentences/contexts that you use one of these two phrases, and why is one closer to German?
Indeed, this is more applied mathematics than physics, though I'm not sure it's a good enough reason to close this question. It's an odd question in any case; perhaps a little clarification would help? :)
@deceze Good point.  Have you used it before, and for what?
I dont understand "Toeing in Will" and by brake calipers, do you mean brake pads?
Thanks! Why not in refrigerator?  Does that do harm?
Can you restate the question? Do you want to display future events on the system calendar, or do you want to get the future events from the system calendar and display them somehow?
Can we assume contiguous IDs in [Employee Schedule] make a range? Or only [Day ID]?
I can't help wondering how you installed XP. Did it come bundled?
Where did you get the file from? What is the name/extension of the file?
Great question.  Could you clarify what you mean by "uniform": do you want to bound the amount of preprocessing of the parameter?

@Henning Makholm- That does not seem obvious.  Can you explain why?
are you using the webSockets API? and is this going to be open sourced at all?
We thought about that as well..where do you see the advantage? Browser independence??
Is this for homework? What have you tried so far?
@TLP thanks for the explanation. So `\@returned` is `$data_structure_reference`, right?
I didn't catch the connection. Could you please explain further?
@DADU What changes do you want to make on that HTML string? Can you give some examples?
as I said, here you can ask for *security* books. Btw, do you really mean "wireless", or did you actually mean more specifically "wifi"?
Sorry for being a nitwit.  But, where do I click to mark this as answered? :)
I don't really understand why this question is so heavily downvoted. Is it because of the patent thing?
Answer is very subjective. Is the bacon going to be used in a recipe, or just to be eaten or breakfast?
I've gotten curious about your experiences interviewing Russians. Would you go into details please?
If its your homework you should possibly do it yourself. Have you even tried it?
I'm not sure what you're asking... it is final; it is marked as such.  Are you wanting to test that its value never changes during the execution of `method`?
LOL the mods closed it right after we pretty much expressed our hate towards every language in existence (including English!!!)  Why are we in Software again?
I think there is probably a very useful question underneath this, but as it stands this is quite subjective; some individuals may worry more about one or the other (or both) but that might not be useful for you at the end of the day. Can you reword the question more towards specifics?
Those look really cool! Do you keep it at the same temperature as your eggs?
You're talking about computing the coefficients of the polynomial, right?  Is this equivalent to computing the product of $\sqrt{n}$ $\sqrt{n}$-bit integers in time $\tilde O(n \log n)$ (where $\tilde O$ hides sub-logarithmic factors)?
That does sound odd. Is there perhaps a threshold setting of some sort?
It _was_ a homework, but few minutes ago there was a deadline (solutions should be submited online), so I am interested in solution, because I couldn't find any (solution wont't be presented in class and I am interested how to solve this problem). So, I thought I don't need to use _homework_ tag, do I?
Just so I understand correctly the censoring issue: When you dilute a sample the concentration of a compound falls so low that the test instrument can fail to detect its presence. Is that an accurate re-phrasing of the censoring problem?
Stupid question perhaps, but what do the numbers in "25/15/15" and "10/7/7" represent?
Is the set of tasks known in advance, or are more tasks being added as you go? Do you have have to worry about starvation (for example, a task with high c_i never getting run if low c_i tasks keep getting added)?
I get error messages with line numbers.  How are you loading your scripts?
Can you provide any additional information on what you want to work? It looks like you have a solution - which one is the one you want to work, and why?
What is the definition of `buffer`? Is it a local variable?
@Ivo Wetzel So, you are saying there is not way to get all objects attributes and values ? Or to convert such object to an associative array ?
how you host your WCF service? Windows Service? IIS?
Why do you need builtin DB support? Do you want to call the graph functions with SQL code as argument?
in certain cases i had to first start the Zune player and then VS2010 to make it work. Perhaps that does the trick for you?
How do you pass the design into jasper? Is it doable to have two designs depending on the option selected?
@Sega: you need to state the question more precisely or it will probably be closed. How is the boundary defined, for example ?
Doesn't work either! If nobody sees a mistake maybe there is a jsf/ajax bug?
what about using F10? instead of F5 and steping through to see what/where your code is terminating?
Also, what about duplicates? It's not explicit, but it seems like you want to remove them?
Welcome, but you might want to rephrase your question - there is a rule of 'not asking how to make an entire game'. Maybe 'What resources exist for solitaire like games?'
any idea what makes a 'light' green tea different?  Does it have less of the actual green tea leaves?
I've re-read the question at least 4x's now and am still confused, re: if your manager has great faith in your development skills, why isn't your manager giving you senior-level responsibilities? Or is it just the title you are seeking?
@aroth: Ouch. Don't you ever need to view side-by-side diffs?
@tinker: In your comment right below the accepted answer you say *@Ivan: nope, adding chomp does not help.  tinker 41 mins ago* Do you think this is funny?
What is your exact question? How those effects can be achieved in general ('language-agnostic'), or how to do them in java and what libraries are best suited for such a task?
You seem to imply that globbing was restricted to a specific platform? Can you elaborate a bit?
When you lock your screen, the password prompt has a small keyboard layout indicator. Have you tried clicking on that to see if your layout isn't incorrect?
Ok, so could you be specific what is problematic for? Maybe show some code?
The last sentence makes me think that there is a bigger picture. What is it that you are really trying to do?
"Wordpress is not designed performance wise in the end" Making wild statements like that with no proof or backup is just flamebait. How about we stick to facts please? :)
I'll rename your X to T. I expect that i get one functor that calls "wrap<T,Y,bool (T::*mp)(Y)>(T* t,X x) { return (t->*mp)(process<Y>(x)); }. .... Btw, how do you do in-comment markup?

What platform are you coding for? iPhone/iPad or Mac in general?
Creating a single global XML would be just time harassing if I choose to save them in a database right? Do you have any link or coding example about what you are suggesting me ?
do you have a definition for complexity?  Do you know Big O Notation?
@Mike: I would stick to what I have if this is better than what I am seeking. My thinking is if there was already an calculated number assigned, I can use it because $(".chk:even") and $(".chk:odd") would be iterating through all rows twice correct?
It doesn't actually sound like there's a problem. Could you clarify the question?
I'm confuse here. You didn't understand OOP or you disagree with benefits spread by oop proponents?
It's a strange question. Can you rephrase it?
Getting error - when? While compiling, linking, running?
What kind of superblock do you mean? The ext3 superblock?

don't do that. why would you do that?
I found [this little recipe](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576420-get-a-posix-timestamp-from-a-type-1-uuid/) in Python. Since I'm not good at Ruby, could someone make this for Ruby please?
@There: That's a lot of code to wade through.  Are you saying you can't possibly simplify it in any further?
Who does not want to see such questions might want to include poll and subjective into the ignored tags. ;-)
What is the point of it being a wiki?
If the ads are script elements, does it really matter where you place them? Perhaps you can give an example?
Sorry for my misspelling. Any recipes on using it?
Please elaborate.  Did I give you enough info to do so?
are you talking about getting a code flow trace for the system call, i.e. like <kernel entry> -> syscall dispatcher -> ioctl -> device ioctl for socket -> tcp driver -> ..., and back out of there again ?
That's great. What's your question?
Presumably follows on from your previous question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4983820/excel-functions It was suggested in the answers to that question to use `=MAX(0, SUM(A1:A5))` to replace a negative number resulting from a formula with zero although the `SUM(A1:A5)` part seems to have been given as an example rather than as part of your requirements. Do you actually have any need to look at the range `A1:A5`?
Is there a reason your sample output for A1 doesn't contain C# and Perl?  Aren't those included based on "2) items only in a1 and not in a2"?
What would the XML contain? Do you want to extract all frames or just single ones?
Agreed with @Kyle. Did you try increasing the width of the container housing the #featurebox-secondary just to verify if the widths are not out of place?
What about chinese or cyrillic names? What character set are you operating with?
(Does this mean that below −78.5°C, dry ice will precipitate out of the air?  Or is there freezing point depression due to the atmosphere being a solution/mixture of several gases?)
There are two general notions with "RDP" there's remote login and Desktop Sharing both are covered in the "RPD" acronym.

*cough* PHP *cough*. I'm sorry - you were saying something about not worrying about the order of parameters?
I'm having the exact same problem. Did you ever find a solution?

I'd be happy to. Can you tell me how?
Also, what do you mean by "complete"?  NP-complete, perhaps?
But that's just the same as `where user_id = 6 and food_id=2 and type=6` - ie matching all three criteria, so that no rows from your example will match. Are you sure that's what you meant?

In the description of the O(n+m) method, do you mean "if J is _greater_ than the max, the target is not present", and compare just K, T in the max? Also, I may be missing something, but isn't `[ 100 200 ; 50 199 ]` a counter example, if the target is on the left of 100?

The way you were doing it at first looks right. Can you post the exact text of the error message you get?
@András: Sure, but that's not really related to the expansion properties. Let me rephrase: do we have examples of problems that are hard on $d$-regular graphs but easy on $d$-regular expander graphs?
Change them to what? If that is your input, what is your desired output?
Why is it necessary for there to be no data there? Is it because you think it's faster that way?
Are you aware that this problem is NP-complete (e.g.: via Subset Sum)?

Is the program run as another user or root?  Are you running as root?
I don't understand.  If you choose S' = {r} where r is the root, then \sigma(r) = V.  Do you mean sigma(s) to be all the elements less than or equal to r and greater than or equal to s (where less and greater are the lattice partial order)?
Surprising how many examples are about topology and geometry. Are we just more surprised by these two topics ?

What sort of non-Oracle database ? Is it running on the same machine or over a network ?
where are you viewing the records?? are you sure they are not stored well?

OT : Is my edit of the post a good way to add on-topic questions? What do you suggest else?

assuming you have a list of 1 million numbers, as opposed to digits, do you need to modify this list, or just see if the number input by the user is in the list?  If you just to check the list but not modify it, why not compile the list into the program in sorted order and do a binary search?

Perhaps a nitpick, but a win-loss ratio of 60-40 is a little under 2/3 wins, not 3/4. Also, aren't the points somehow affected by the difference between the players' rankings?
I've heard rumors of Pb-Sn solder being incompatible with certain RoHS PCB finishes.  Does anyone have real data about this?
I take it from your example that what needs to be indexed is a list `m` entries taken from a set of `n` known elements? Is a lookup table feasible?
@Shinto: Isn't the purpose of an English-usage Q&A site to answer questions? As opposed to telling people "Go look up the answer"?
Are you still working on this?  When do you plan on submitting it to Apple?
@Juan yeah, i figured it was something like that. Where is this magical chat room anyway?
Depending on the CUDA version you are using, device emulation may not be available, as it has been deprecated and possibly removed.  Is it feasible to get another GPU (a cheap one for display maybe)?
Explain what you mean by non-smaller? You mean bigger?
How can an Action take a fixed amount of time (Action.time)?  Shouldn't an Action's time be dependent upon the time it takes to accomplish each of its Tasks in Action.dependencies?
Needs `homework` tag ? You might also want to specify the programming language, at the very least, and perhaps mention what you've tried so far ?
Not enough details. What programming problem do you have?
It's a warning, which says that some entry has no book title! Would you please try and present a minimal example?
If I have a form that starts with a set of data, and I want to reset it to a different set of data this will not work? right?
That seems to be right since it still debugs in IE, but I cleared everything (see above). What else can I clear?
Queens have already been talked about in this question: http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/5642/spawn-larva-with-no-mouse-clicks
Perhaps a similar approach works for chrono boost?
Good, I'm confused with the special terminology. Could you please simplify the terminology (or even better remove it)?
This is programming related. Why is this flagged?
Definitely not, mainly because no such lens exists. Did you mean EF 70-200 f/4 L or EF-S 18-200 f/3.5-5.6?
Saranyya: what task are you trying to accomplish?  why do you need to sleep with such precision?
Could you explain how data were collected and what they intend to measure? Are the different columns of your data matrix independent measurements?
What OS are you running? Did you try to put the iPod in recovery mode?
Meant to ask -- what do you mean by whether the JVM can remember the order of the nodes? If you use a List, isn't it the JVM implementing the list for you?
@RoryAlsop - Yeah, the other thread, while still somewhat broad, is much more limited in scope.  Let's give this one a shot, please?
Thanks for the info, this is enlightening. A followup question - with panniers do you find it necessary to use a pair with the content's weight somewhat balanced between the sides?
Have you run it in the debugger? What's the crash?
Does the tree have some sort of ordering? e.g. is it a binary search tree?
This is quite cool, I'd almost consider suggesting the ability to encrypt the answers to your question for a day on user voice with a clickable "decrypt" link or something. What do other think?
How are the stops designated? Do they have unique numbers or names?
I've had a problem like this where it would just try to find the image by path and not from the Route. Have you tried debugging to see if the application goes into the controller?
why keep stuff that you don't access? why not leave the space for stuff that's needed?
@Mark C This question could hardly have been answered accurately in a high school text.  Perhaps it asked about two adjoining nodes?
What have you tried? What didn't work?
There is something that is not clear to me. Do you want to stop the assembly execution for debugging purposes and inspect the code at an arbitrary location?
Nobody?  Even with the bounty???
Thanks! How much batter do you use for each shell?
How doesn't it work? Does the image appear at all, or just nothing?
Vote down? Would you care to explain why?
Clarification: Do you need a simple *Do they intersect?* answer or do you need the intersection?
Sergio, can you please clarify? Do you mean "a wave or a particle"?
Yeah, it's difficult to tell what the columns mean from their names. Can you add more explanation of how the tables fit together?
There's usually an indicator the furnace is "on" (I would guess the flames icon to the right of the temperature in your picture). Does that turn off as well when the LCD dims?
Can you please explain what it does?
I think the error is in your index.php file (see my answer). can you pastebin the code of this file?
Is this on a server you control (ie. can set sv_cheats on)?
Are you getting valid numbers back when using the "+1" trick? Are you using `warnings`?
how are the arrays of characters "combined". Can you give a few example result strings or pseudocode?
I don't see how you can deduce the prototype of a C function with `nm`. To have the prototype mangled in, there, you'd have to compile the file as C++ and not as C, no?
Use headers like `cstdio`, not `stdio.h`, for C library headers in C++. And what's wrong with `std::vector`?
That's exaxtly what i meant for the point one....and as you said 200 in 1 week is definetly more impressive than 1000 in 1 year....Considering that i have a mysql db, php in the middle to make query and return json object and java for my android client that get the json and parse it.At wich level this "ordering" algorith should work? for example on the flight in php page...it mean that that the db is not ordered and in the php page i make a query enfding with ORDER BY and than my function ordering,or the MYsql db shoul already ordered,maybe running my algoruth once a day to reorder app table?
Still not clear what you mean by saying static or dynamic. In that  array you can push values, remove values, change values... so what exactly are you trying to achieve?
Could you post some of the relevant code? It would make it easier to figure out what is going on... Also, what do you mean by "the Map"?
You want *all* the paths? You want *all simple paths containing at least two members of the subset*?
Yeah- using a stack for depth first. Did you know that you use a queue for breadth first?
Could be a character set issue. Is the HTML in UTF-8 and stored as ISO-8859-1?
There's a lot of ***not* Mac OS X specific** answers, which is a requirement outlined in the question. Should the answers be revisited or the question edited?
Seems strange to me that you'd include no less than five tags, and yet not select one that indicate the language you're using. Is that some sort of Pascal?
You're most likely using Visual C++, so it can't be a compiler bug since I'm getting `C4430` errors for the second code snippet. Is there a `using namespace std` or `using std::string` in any of your header files?
Why do you need to compress it that way ? Do you need fast information retrieval once the data is compressed, it is a question of memory ?
I think I understand now, The pawls prevent the pedals from spinning around like crazy and mangling your feet?
The second example in your second question accesses unallocated memory. Was that on purpose?
What does `j^4` do? Is this XOR or exponentiation?
Default search comes with user search. You can't use that?
Okay, I have built a radar system before, I need one major thing, that I am not sure if you intended to answer. Do you plan to do this at a single frequency?
Seems like a very odd design for web applications. Would you mind to explain why MVCC does not work for you?
Are you asking "What is the least number of races that would be needed?" in the best case, or in the worst (general) case?
@pseudosudo `'rw'` is not a valid mode. What platform are you running this on, and under what version of Python?
what output do you expect? is it something like `1 2 3 4 \n 5 6 7 8 \n 9 10` or `0 0 0 1 \n 0 0 0 2 ...`?
Which platform are you using? If it's ASP.NET do you have access to the App_Browsers folder?
Why can't you just put the data in a database and let that organise the data for the fastest search results (i.e. indices on the criteria you will search the data by)?
Months? Are you insane?
So what exactly is the problem? Changing the size doesn't work?
So, what specificaly is it that you have problems with? Is it that you don't understand the assignment?
What was wrong with PostAffiliate? I was going to use them?
what is the expected number of points?  Is it a handful like 3,4,5 or could it be 20 or 100?
I believe this artifact is called "ghosting" but I'm not experienced in iOS development so I don't think I could help you. Is there a difference in refresh rate on the iPad?
What signatures are you referring to? Could you please clarify your question?
The 8080 could address 64K of memory (and 256 I/O ports).  What sort of bank switching would be in effect (or did you mean 8086/8088)?
Very weird indeed. Are there two newlines after each pubDate?
Wow, what are you doing that requires the microcontrollers to be so hot? Can't you just put the mcu outside of the hot area, maybe running wires to some sensors inside?
side comment: why don't you use the latest Eclipse? Is there any particular reason?
We need no code to reverse a string. And, who would need a reversed string anyway?
sorry about that. Can it be done in python?
What do you mean by prefix?  Do you mean to add a prefix to all the entity class names?
I'm not sure I understand the problem. What's wrong with dropbox?
-1: I've read that book too. Can you please be more specific about how the message in that book addresses this question?
We prefer not to just do your homework for you. What answers have you considered?
There are SO many plugins that will do this for you, with fancy transitions between images. Is there a specific reason you want to code it yourself?
I'm having the same problem on Xoom 3.1. Can anybody confirm this is a bug?
What is the priority - tracing the boundary or filling the shape? I mean, is it okay if the rectangles trace the boundary perfectly but leave a hole in the middle somewhere?
Can you write the URL of this page? Also, does it have any kind of authentication on it?
I think slicing means converting from derived class object to base class object. I think it is very common operation in C++, do you think slicing is a natural feature or a bad design?
what is the goal here?  echo (no concern for storing in php var) some fields from the X most recent rows meeting the max conditions from any of tables that begin with 'whatever'?
Are you sure that constraint generation/solving was not for type systems with subtyping, e.g. one of the HM(X) family (Hindley-Milner parameterized by a subtyping relation)?
Also, how do you know it failed? You get an error message?
Advantages over what?  What's your alternative?
Just the links alone ? not the tweet body ?
The computer may have multiple disks and multiple partitions, each one with one different file system. Do you want to know the type of root partition or what?
Not really following what you need, are you looking for something like:

http://drupal.org/project/hierarchical_select?
What value does CreateProcessAsUser return?  If it returns zero (indicating an error), what does the GetLastError() function return?
Could you post an example TeX file somewhere? Also, which editor do you use, or are you using the Terminal to run pdfLaTeX?
Is this just a confused marketing statement?  Or can you point us to a product that does this or a use of this notion in the wild?
@alexanderpas What servers? No servers are being mentioned?
Is this occurring in the same dev environment where the default page is displaying the image as desired?  Have you checked the DOM to see if there is some css class(es) or javascript applying styles that hide it on the login page?
As an additional data point, I'd recommend verifying the COM port is actually accessible by a simple terminal application like HyperTerminal. Is it?
Do you have the ability to authenticate users (through login or whatnot) and to "grade" them, a bit like SO users. In this fashion you will soon get enough "trusted citizen" susceptible of flagging offensive data ?
p.s.  why would having more molasses make it hygroscopic, I thought that meant water-seeking.  Wouldn't the drier ingredient absorb more water?
What does this have to do with programming?  Are you trying to solve this problem with a program?
WTF? Downvotes? What for?
@Kangkan: you're getting awfully technical, on a slippery road... Does the application effectively _knows_? Does the application exist outside of the computer?
What do you mean by auto-adjust? Auto-adjusting of the color?
"Crudo"? You mean raw fish like sashimi?
Don't you mean 2N edges? And you want the matching to include all nodes, correct?
Why not use a database such as MySQL? And more disturbing is why didn't anyone mention that ?!?!
TSOP is a series of IR receivers by [Vishay](http://www.vishay.com/ir-receiver-modules/), here it doesn't mean "thin small outline package" or something like that. Right, gomek?
sounds strange, do you get any runtime error before the breakpoints ? what versions are you using ?
The first attrib/value pair in your example data reads: `Name="value,` (the value is missing the closing quote), and the last attribute/value pair has a properly quoted value which includes an escaped quote. Is the first one with the missing close quote a typo?
This has got nothing to do with any of the tags. Please can you retag appropriately if you want an answer?
@OMG Ponies: I believe you. :)  So, am I misunderstanding that I should be able to access the information from within both tables or am I horribly misunderstanding *how* to set up the tables?
@Michael, now think of the relationships between Cows and Herds, and between Cows and Cartoons. Are there any many-to-many relationships there?
what is the & sign for? why do it?
"I + have" = proper agreement; "she + is" = agreement; "she + would" = agreement.  Am I missing something?
What's the purpose of a Riddle? If you get some kind of reward, shouldn't it be a SpecialSquare also?
Computer Science classes, always fun times. Have you identified the errors above ?
How is it awkward? Which version of VS (they have different levels of js intellisense support)?
Which part are you trying to debug? Content script, background page, popup?
Could you please be more specific? Which paragraphs from the [link](http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html) are relevant to me?
Except here is where the action took place, so here is where I questioned it. How about you answer it?
@Dennis attenDANCE? like in SquareDance? :D
How are you converting to decimal?  Why wouldn't that same method work for conversion to ternary?
Is it possible you have an error in your [`remove_action`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_action) and [`add_action`](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action) call? Your second parameter is `'show'`, but shouldn't it be the function you are adding or removing?
Is this a quiz? Do you know what the flaws are?
How does your grammar look like? It is a full-blown language, or just some math equation?
Drag what to the desktop?  Do you mean to make it the background image, or to drag and drop a file on the desktop?
Is the ssh_expect function something you have made yourself? What does it do, exactly?
Do you mean "What can you do with Drush that goes beyond what you can do through the Drupal web interface?" or "Can Drush be used for things besides Drupal?"
I would say that it has nothing to do with the language, but with programming. Since this is homework, I suppose that you should know at least something about this subject?
Please elaborate: UI design or general software architecture design? Or anything else?
Wow what a brilliant and crazy question! Can I ask what you're going to do with it? Candlemaking?
If you know nothing about the structure of the URLs, then it's impossible to do. How should the algorithm find out whether to group `a/b/c` with `a/d/c` or `a/b/e`?
It's not clear to me how to cause the Automator workflow to open a new terminal window and run the command inside. Can you please elaborate on this?
I have gone through Mergesort from back to front and final data will be generated at the end of the second array.This case second array or resultant array may have some empty spaces in the front. Any better way than this?
Squeegy, I didn't set any breakpoints, so I guess TouchXML had breakpoints included? How do I get rid of them?
@SKM : is your primary intent to **hide** the latent images, or to merely **combine** a number of images into a single image?  Also, from your code, exactly what error are you encountering?
Is your current code snippet working for you? If not, do you have a simple sample config file you could post?
and what's the problem? what did you try and in which way did it fail?
What is "this tab bar"? Can you provide a code sample or screenshot?
Put a breakpoint at the `pointsToCalculate[i].originalLocation = i;` line. Are you ever hitting it?
How about storage? O(n)?
I'm getting some warnings. Warnings can cause my problem?
You error seems to have something to do to with the function's invocation. Can you tell us where is line 26?
Why are you putting control characters into the string? And don't they count to whatever length limits apply?
did anything ever happen with this?  did you file a bug?
I don't know of a specific resource, but if you have specific questions I may be able to help a little.  Are you using WER?
Also why is there no "set bounty" button on my question? Does it have to be a certain age?
Where's the Perl? Are you talking about an off-the-shelf software here, if yes, what's its name?
You may want to post the code right here. Maybe use pastebin or something if it's too much to embed directly in your post?
Understood, been there. ;) Maybe I'll check out Carrierwave (HVAC?).
My context is: I want to capture an image which has width = 300px, height = 300px in android. how can I do this?
my problem is not really to solve this bug but to know how to find the line of a bug in a proxy. I don't think you need additional information about it, isn't it ?
just out of curiosity, why would you want to wipe out all (but the absolutely necessary) fonts? Is it a disk space constraint?
Do other people see your ads? Have you tried using a proxy?
Interesting.  why the sugar?
The lack of `display_name` is caused by a user not having a display name set in their profile.  Incorrect usernames...  do you have an example of that?
Sounds fishy to me. What are they going to give you for that $75?
Terrible question title. I don't know enough about graphs to generate a better one - any suggestions?
err..... huh???
How do you pronounce this? pan-near, panny-air, pan-near?
I don't quite understand what the question is. Are you asking for average-case results for NP-hard problems or are you asking whether we can solve NP-hard problems in the worst-case in expected polynomial time?
hmm... wait a minute... hmm... what?!
This is most likely a problem due to the encoding of your input. In what encoding is it in?
Is *r* necessarily positive? Is it an integer?
Your description of `guess()` needs improvement. Does it return `true` when you guess is less or equal to the answer?
Are you sure that it isn't due to the error that the compiler is thrown off, and generating multiple errors due to that one error? Could you give some example of this?
In what way is it failing? Exception?
It's a bug to multiply a scalar amount by an array.  Do you mean to be computing the sum of the weights?
First, why are you saving an image into the database? Second, how are you loading the bytearray into the other?
Please provide more details as to what exactly you are doing.  Are you currently using the Host & Play option?
what about my answer? didn't it help?
What's the class that it can't find? Are they all custom classes?
not a direct answer to your question. but shouldn't you be opening exclusive?
@Sandip, what algorithm are you working on? Is it something like memcpy/memmove (or STREAM?).
Could you please be more specific? What do you mean by "Library Errors"?
Great question; too bad none of the answers have any clues to the origin though. There must be countless words which can approximate one second, so why the name of a southern US state?
What do you mean by protecting them? What are you trying to prevent/avoid?
@Matthew Why not just use an existing hashtable implementation? Why do you need a custom hash?
From your responses, it looks like you've made up your mind to do this despite all the people telling you not to. Why did you ask the question if you don't plan to understand/listen to advice?
Well, with 4000 open files it also gets stuck, though later on, at around line 10000, and then it progresses, though much more slowly. (I guess it has to do with the output buffering?)
What kind of user knows JSON but not HTML?  How would you put bold text in a link?
I remember having a similar problem. However, the link to the full code seems broken, could you update it?
Why do you need randomness? Why can't you use sequential strings?
This should also be tagged "regex", but only five tags are allowed. This question seems only peripherally related to the Python language, so perhaps that tag should be replaced?
Bull - please try to edit your question with any answers to comments.  If using Firefox - have you tried the Add-on "Flash-aid" that usually resolves flash problems?
*"I'm developing a Java desktop application that is to be used with Ubuntu."*  What is the attraction of coding in Java when only targeting one OS?
Good question! What formula did you attempt, and in what situations was it wrong?
How did u feed the html to the browser? Is there a <base> element in the HTML?
can you expand your question please - what version of ubuntu, what version of mono - using what build instructions?  In addition - why have you not installed mono from the standard repositories?
Joe Mills's answe is technically correct but I'm not sure it's what you're after?  Why don't you explain what you're trying to do rather than ask how something works?
There may be a way to show a limited amount of content and then expand it or open in a box onclick using a custom script. How tied are you to the particular interface scetched in your image?
hmmm. off topic?
@sepp2k isn't fnc declaration and "worded" postcondition sufficient for this task (I wasn't given definition at all by the way)? What for would one need to see guts of a fnc in order to be able to give formal proof for postcondition?
Are the preferences of people always constant or are they somehow weighted, ie. some poeple's preferences count more than others'?
Delegates don't work!? Do you use Control.BeginInvoke() method to invoke delegates?
I thought I read about that as a feature of MobileMe, but I just looked and cannot find it.  Have you signed up for a trial yet?
D-Wave!  Have your lecturers recommended their technology to you?
may I suggest that you give different names (`\fooa`, `\foob` etc would be okay) to the different version of `\foo`, so that it's easier to refer to them? Including a name for "the second version of `\foo` with `\else\relax` uncommented", please :-) Also, I'm not sure I understand: do you expect the second version of `\foo` to give the same result as the first one?
I've never heard the term "code contracts". Are you referring to Design by Contract?
Is `getFreeCrawler()` synchronized? In which line does the error occur?
I don't get the question. Perhaps you can explain it more clearly?
you should post your xml layout here. What you have implemented so far?
What do you mean *excluding the $ and $*? What $ and $?
"...element 3 was compatible with 1": I don't see this in your chart. And if 3 is compatible with 1, why is 1 not compatible with 3?
Could you please include the whole content of your `/etc/fstab`. Also, what's wrong with using the standard `/etc/fstab`, with UUIDs (that seem more robust than paths), that Ubuntu creates on an install?
color(node) = if is_even(depth(node)) then "black" else "red" ... is that really the question? Or is he asking whether an AVL tree can be colored such that it obeys all the properties of a red-black tree?
@davka From what I can see from your examples, `\"` and `\\"` are already handled correctly. How do you want them handled differently?
please can you confirm where you have downloaded moonlight - and which version (add this to your question).  Also, which websites are not working (add the links)?
Do you want the actual algorithm, or a clue (ie. some kind of homework help)?
I've never tried comparing them, but I'd be very surprised if you saw a difference. Isn't the SQL engine going to optimize this for you?
If the form starts with pre-filled data, I would think that data would be populated with placeholder="my text". If that's the case, clearing all inputs should be fine, right?
At first sight I can't see what's wrong with the code you've posted.  What error or problem does this produce?
'Best' is rather subjective. Do you mean easiest to use, fastest, or most elegant?
Seems like a rather big project. From what I can read, you have no experience in programming?
Is it homework? Why not return a `Maybe a` in `pop` and `top`?
Hmm, that's what I get too: |O-E|/sqrt(E) = |17-16.5|/16.5 = 0.123. Can you add a link to the paper if it's available on the web?
Can you please focus your question on security topics? Is your question specifically wrt ASLR, or is it something else?
You also seem to have 'Web' there twice. Which browser are you using, and do you have any greasemonkey scripts or plugins which may be breaking the links?
@Emtucifor: My point is simply that if you're going to clutch your pearls this tight and go all " _O tempora o mores!_ " on us, it's more convincing if you yourself don't exemplify the decline of standards you are bemoaning.  If you don't hold yourself to a standard of perfection, then what could possibly be the point of your question?
@Grace: as in, _completely unrelated?_ What difference does it ever make to the everyday programmer? If I asked a question on USB vs PS2 mice, how long would it get to have it moved from SO to SU?
@DeLonge - The question looks pretty vague to me.  Care to specify what you're after?
Out of curiosity what software have you used to draw your plan ?
Hello Blix, and welcome on _Drupal Answers_. To which version of Drupal are you interested?
Per site, no.  In the future, who can say?
Are they a particular type of files? Do all users have access to all the files and do they require it?
This question is a little bit vague. Could you clarify please?
"Use images for transactions"????? Do you mean that you want to use images to represent certain info on the screen?
Could you try to render a case-use of the jussive mood from another language into english? As in, how would you use the imperative to command he/she/it/them separately from the second person?
Kolmogorov test is for distributions hence object lying in infinite dimensional space... not obvious to get asymptotic power=1. t-test is about testing the mean of a real valued random variable?
Maybe one of your Processors died?  Was it a dual core or more?
the ability to read and write in Korean. (including in the source) So are you writing this from scratch or modifying an existing one?
@space_cadet: Thanks for your answer.I have two question for you.Could please let me know how the conterfactual states are generated in the first place and what is the role of \alpha s in getting rid of them?Because I've always just been taught that measurement gives each possible state with probability Tr(\Pi_\alpha \rho) for different possible projections and we never talked about inconsistent states! And the second question is in a talk by Rob Spekkens (from PI) he said he believes an adequate set of postulates for quantum mechanics shouldn't have this inner-outer problem!What do you think?
it works, sorry :) another question - it displays only days ago the user last seen, can i use format_date to this somehow?
@Aaronut Hi.  Private message?
Interesting topic. A missing part of the question, I think, is "is homomorphic encryption considered *secure*, from a cryptanalysis PoV?"
If they're randomly placed, then you could have two different areas of overlap.  Do you want the sum total of all overlaps or what?
"given a text file as input": And what's in that text file ...? What is the relationship between the markov chain you want to construct and your input?
What do you get instead of the sorted array? What is the output?
why are you using the LET* ? For what?
What do you mean by *"the compiler thinks it's an integer"*. How can the compiler think a 30-digit number is an `Integer`?
When you say that the Sharpe ratio is the mean divided by the sample standard deviation... "Up to a constant factor (sqrt(n), where n is the number of observations)"... what does this last part mean?  Is it really the mean divided by the standard error of the mean?
More time spent does not imply more dollars spent. If the decision is between having to pay five developers for a month or having customers wait 0.5s longer for a request, what would you choose?
I see no problem with e-mail being used as a verb.  If you can mail a [paper] letter, why can't you [e-]mail an [electronic] letter?
What kind of network interface are you talking about? eth, wireless, ... ?
Flush ? Do you mean flash ?
What is the `ArrayIntStorage& AIS` parameter?  Is it relevant to your question?
For all we know they could easily just be two random numbers stored in a database somewhere with no actual mapping. Why do you want this - you want to scrape all the extensions off the site mechanically?
What are "the proper elements"? Are you given *two* matrices, one the "source" matrix and one a "target" matrix and you must decide in which order to "encounter" the elements so as to get the "target" matrix?
Seems like `HfJsonValue` is already an object. why treat it as JSON and convert it to object?
How many is "several different"? How big are |L| and |S|, relatively/absolutely? ~~~~
Minimum number of pictures per card, or minimum number of pictures given that there are 8 per card? Also, does every picture have to be matchable?
Is the crack getting bigger?  After you fix it, what happens when you say it comes back?
What is the question? What is wrong with it?
I assume you've already considered using the Featured Image and decided it doesn't meet your use case? (Are these a large number of existing posts, or are you designing a system for posts to be added in the future?)
Sorry I didn't mentioned it, but it's tab separated... It is possible to quickly replace the ',' by a '.' in the code or do I have to replace it with notepad++ or something?
As a sidenote, I wonder why they chose to call it "Reach"... I just got done playing some Halo: Reach so that came to mind immediately. But I suspect it's more because of the symbolism of "reaching" more devices?
In numpy, your array is 2 x 5, isn't it? And am I understanding that you want to extract a column slice as a column matrix, rather than a vector?
I know I can lose characters. But you find it normal that half the text after a particular character is lost though it does not contain special chars ?
Can you please try to clean-up your question if you want anybody to figure out what your problem may be (use `edit` button, use `code` tags). What is your boot priority in BIOS?
That's what I like in the interview questions: the question is theoretically interesting but I would be hard pressed to find a usecase within a minute. Seriously, who manages linked list explicitly ?
An API is not at fault if they allow requests to take place more than 30 time in 5 seconds, right?  Or do we need to build throttling into our API?
How are you closing the connection on the server? `close` or `shutdown`?
Do you mean you only want the alternate caps inside of `"` delimited portions of your string, e.g. output should be `hello "HoW ArE YoU DoInG?"`.
Why are you doing this? If `rate` has a 1:1 relationship with `Posts` why not just add a new column to the `Posts` table?
That code looks good. What isn't it doing that you want it to?
@forcefsck I tried the exact steps as outlined in the answer, but got an error from Grub saying "could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.". Please see the screenshots of it and my /etc/fstab, any other ideas?
@Rippo: Tried it and it doesn't work. Isn't the `$form.find('.person')` supposed to find all elements that have the `person` class inside the form with `personas` id?
What version of bash are you using? Is it 4.x or 3.x?
Sorry, which Documents? Is this some iPhone directory?
I see you figured out how to ask questions.  Why not earn a badge and go back and delete your "non-answer" to the TAOCP question?
Please look at me edit. If i'm right and it does have something to do with being logged in can someone please explain to me WHY WHY WHY would that matter???
Sorry. What do you mean by "burn in the images"?
That doesn't seem possible to me.  Got an example?
Sorry @p_upadhyay, I reopened the question. Can you add the elaboration from your comments to the question?
if you need to debug a batch file potentially you are using the wrong tool for the task. Why not try cscript.exe?
Triangulation? Do you mean trilateration?
Anil, most people here are probably more comfort with US $ prices. Can you translate?
Sounds like it was trying to go down the stack, but found itself going up instead. I'm not sure how that might have happenedstack smashed?
When I run the code I am able to select store and that validation is good, however when I enter in a purchase amount I get invalid message and am still able to enter in the negative values. Not sure if there is an issue with my while statement?
Sorrry,but i dont know where are these project properies. Could someone tell me?
As you can see from the answers so far, it's not quite clear what context we're talking about. Could you please clarify?
Its not "really" fast, it just runs at a normal rate. Ever heard of the saying, in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king?
Did you try it? Did you encounter any errors?
Sorry I'm still not clear, the movies are not just different between cinemas, the movies change too. If one cinema starts playing a new interesting movie while the others haven't, this one cinema may have bigger change in gaming sales, no?
Where is labelHashTable declared?  Is it a file-scope (global) variable?
How about `Class<? super T> type`?
To clarify the question: You have (say) 5 schedules and 10 meetings, each with 5+ non-overlapping meeting times, and you want all 5 schedules to contain all 10 meetings, with no overlapping times in any one schedule.  Is this correct?
It didnt work when I replaced Lbs2 by t.  Lbs2 is the model that has been created to store lat, lng and body. Can you please suggest some other changes should be made?
In that case it might not be the answer then (hence the comment). Are you using the VS web server or IIS Express?
Please specify your Drupal version. Have you looked at Migrate module (http://drupal.org/project/migrate)?
I guess we could but this seems like such a small subset of a problem that I'm sure it could be solved easily enough in the database. Setting up sphinx/solr or any other indexer just seems a bit like overkill?
Please givez me the codez? What have you tried so far?
Here's a simple example based on what you provided: http://fbrell.com/saved/58a66f765babcdd3d7b452afe02b4e41 -- works fine for me. Maybe you can provide some more details?
So how do you get it working again?  iisreset?
I hate that they give no choices for being anonymous.  Why do I have to use my real full name to sign up?
I have a question about your question. Did clean urls configure correctly?
A markdown file can just be read when you open it in an editor, you don't really need fancy tools to read it.  What do you want it for/what format do you want it to be in?
What are you protecting, exactly? You're worried your OS X install is attacked?
While this may not be your homework, you are essentially just asking us to write you code to solve this problem. Maybe you should do a Google search?
"It's my own program " - then, presumably you have the source code. Debug that?
Hi, could you provide a bit more detailed explanation with your code?  The part "i need a certain area of the screen to be drawn in my app" I understood, but you could at least try to explain a bit the code you posted and give a small working example?
Web Apps? How about Meta Stack Overflow? :)
You need to narrow the problem down. Is your question actually "how do I update an entity reference in EF"?
Depends on the size. Broiler-fryer?
I've been told that a Banana can take up to two hours to digest but I didn't believe this is true. Why is it that Pro Tennis players are always eating Bananas?
Follow-up question: There are some slight errors on the elapsed times displayed on the site due to treating all months uniformly as 30 days and ignoring leap years.  Do you think it's a good idea to keep these errors to match the site (see my answer) or should we try to fix them?
How do you do it presently? Do you persist the RedirectToRoute values in the POST form or hold them temporarily on the server somewhere?
did't you just ask this on the Ubuntu Forum?  Same person?
@Lev: Your graph model can be seen as the sum of d independently chosen random graphs where each vertex chooses a next neighbour uniformly at random.  This would seem to make analysis easier?
Do the squares have to be the same size? Do they have to be axis-aligned (i.e., have the same orientation as the rectangle)?
Umm, which code do you have a problem with? Could you be a little more specific with what the issue is?
Ah, I see. If you don't mind, I've more or less understood everything, but just wish to inquire about 2 things: (1) could you please explain the `$form_state` variable a bit more; and (2) I'm guessing that `$job_node->field_number[0]['value']` writes that value to the first webform field?
I'm sorry, but your example only makes me more confused. Why don't you first put the first `r` into the first container, the second `b` into the second container, and the next two `r` into the first container, getting the sum of `0`?
Ising ?? or Icing ??
There is no image attached.  Also, what have you tried by yourself?
Do you mean you need real world use cases for these data structures? Or do you need explanations of how they work using examples and metaphors?
ya but in upper left side of your xcode you specified simulator and debug? or device and debug?
sorry for the dumb question..one thing that I don't get is why /sites route and other routes in the documentation have **This method is new to version 1.1** description. Is it new or just updated?
I don't understand the comments below arguing against this style. I think it can be quite attractive in certain designs; furthermore, to counterpoint the "what about nested lists" comment: how common are nested lists, really?
This question, while not an award-winner, is at least much more specific. How about we close the *other* one?
Which images specifically? Did you look in the F12 Network tab or Fiddler to see if there are any networking failures?
How long does it take to complete the process? Will you allow more than one web user simultaneously?
@codeka - 4 in all of those bases is still 4. A more interesting question would be, what base is "10"? :P
Since this came up in another question, is there a UK equivalent for what we in the US call "biscuits"?  The Cookies -> Biscuits correlation is listed above, but what about Biscuits -> ??
hmmm....odd. can you give us the source you're searching?
I'm not sure what the distinction is that you're making. What do you want to store, and how do you want to retrieve it?
How many items do you expect on each user's lists?  How many items total are there, if there's a limit at all?
I included a screenshot. Do u have any idea?
Can you describe the content of the flash application?  From the question, it sounds like it includes multiple HTML files, and not just a single .swf - is that correct?
Did that string come from an attribute? Or the content of an element in XML?
@brian Actually, yes. Is that possible without causing the "world to burn"?
Same question as @Justian Meyer plus one of my own: what exactly must you output? A simple yes or no if one rectangle's edges intersect another if their length increases, or report possible intersections for each line?
This cannot be the *only* relevant parts of your code, because this compiles fine.  Are you sure that the error message really corresponds to the lines you've shown here?
I just tried this bc I was thinking along the same lines but for some reason when I implement with my data1.csv file it makes no difference, I think it is because of userID numbering and lettering. Is possible for me to send you the data file, so you can see what I mean?
`lte IE 8` means "less than equal IE 8" so this seems to work as designed. Can you clarify what the problem is?
Is your POST tag variable set?
Is that query returning rows?
Bah, I'm a little rusty with compilation theory...
Do you know where the conflict is in your grammar?
Did you try to run it? What did you see?
did you mean when you try to load application context from jar its not working ? if so error message ?
Just out of interest, how long is "incredibly long"?  How fast does the program run for other puzzles?
@Pax: would you really call this a _basic_ question? Considering it depends on the alignment of the instruction bytes?
Your title is a little ambiguous. Are you asking "how well does it work" or "how does it work"?
What should happen if "Some Filename" and "some_filename" both exist in the same directory?  And for non-empty directories "Some Dir" and "some_dir" with the same parent?
could you give a little more information? what are you using this for?
There already a bunch of free IDE out there, and you want to use Visual Studio ??? You have arguments to not use Eclipse or Netbeans ?
Why did you make this community wiki? Why are you refusing to read the documentation?
@yassale: N is large as in 10^3 or as in 10^9 ?  Kilo-large or giga-large ?
What do you mean by "scalable"?  Would running a separate thread to monitor each agent and to actively flag if there were no heartbeat for ten seconds be "scalable"?
Is this a way to create passwords for personal use? (like on your bank website) or a way to 'secure' your website?
I vaguely remember using Sugiyama's with more than one input/output, but I could be wrong. Can you write down a pointer to the alg logic you are using to refresh my memory?
You might want to specify what language you're trying to do the parsing in - if in C, C#, JavaScript. If JavaScript, are you perhaps trying to your own HTML document from within a browser, or offline?
Soap on porous clay sounds like a good way to make your water taste like... soap. Perhaps consider disinfecting with a bleach solution instead?
Actually it's probably a structure. I bet you declared `struct mystruct { int something; }` and then tried `struct mystruct myobj` followed by a `myobj->something` when you meant `myobj.something`, right?
I am sorry but I don't see how this is related to uncertainty and time evolution. Could you explain that?
did it find the vehicle? i.e put a breakpoint inside your var number = $(this).find("number").text(); is it actually hitting the bp?
Sorry, I'm not clear on what's happening in the question. Are you saying that the cart zooms over power rails while they're *unpowered*?
Is the function given the ready-made number (`1491625...`) or does it have to compute it itself? Extracting the nth digit should be easy (regardless of the base - but I assume you talk about base 10?).
@spinning_plate - These are useful links. Do you know by any chance if parallelizing the computation will speed up the processing and if so how can a graph traversal problem like this be broken down into smaller pieces computable on numerous machines?
What do you mean by "solution". Do you actually need stationary states?
I haven't ever experience `GetClientRect` returning anything but the full client rectangle, no matter what overlaps it or if it is fully on-screen.  Are you sure?
I don't understand your concern with "the user might think that margins contains only :left and :right". How is it different when you use the chart.marings(:left, 10) syntax ?
Isn't SMS text only (max 140 chars). Afaik MMS is for images?
Isn't that a bit of an odd measure? Would you choose to become a factory worker because it's *easier* and *faster to learn*?
Please clarify title / question. Do you wish to identify the start of a cycle, or remove a cycle?
What's the deal here? Question asked and answered by the same person, who's profile is mysteriously not linked any more?
Thanks for the approval :)  But as I said, my photoshop-fu is weak on this.  Can you please post a tutorial?
The C specification says tm_years is "Years since 1900."  Why not just stick to the standard and avoid this whole mess?
Can you define butter spread for us? Do you mean margarine or other non-butter spreads? Or is there some spread that uses butter as a component that you're referring to?
The name of that site is "CodeKata" not "Code Katas"; "can anyone .." is a yes/no question, what you really want to ask is "what are some more .."; the title "Code Katas" is too short and is automatically rejected by the system; greetings and signatures ("thanks!") are currently considered out of place on SO (see Meta); the [best-practices] tag is out of place, and [coding] (at least [currently](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/coding)) has lost any specific meaning (effectively all programming involves "coding", right?).
@Roger, set the LocalSqlServer connection string to attach that db. Do you know how to do it?
@Rishav Rastogi - I've got it in application.rb (pasted in above). Should that work?
What do you mean by "detect" exactly? What do you want to do in reaction, show a scrollbar?
Right. So, using them within the calling scope is safe, and beyond that, it should be `retain`ed, right?
By "robustness", do you mean that it handles well under load and scales? Or are you talking about its level of imperviousness to malicious input?
Yes, we can. But should we?
I'm having trouble visualizing the floaty skirt car with sticks.  Do you have any pictures?
Assuming the code is mostly the same in all functions, have you considered solving it using an argument? Can you post the code?
Aha! Can I also give you an answer which is not coded??? You and me need codes... Okay?
I've never seen a key between Shift and Z either.  Could that be European thing?
Can you add more hardware data to your question please? Like the output of lspci and dmesg?
I'm sure the error says more than that. What else does it say?
The Magix software doesn't work on Linux. Did you install it in Wine or do you mean a different application?
Also, what's your workflow? Are you shooting raw?
i'm not sure...but don't you need Android 2.2 to debug with gdb? Do you have Android 2.2 on your Droid?
What happens if you export the layer to a gdb featureclass - does it have coordinates?  Does the exported fc's spatialreference match that of  zlevels?
Suresh is saying that you don't have to put "community wiki" on this question, if you rephrase the question to be something other than a big list, and were more specific about what you're looking for. Also, is it really a "soft question"?
This should be the default behavior of a site using OG. Can you provide more details that may help figure out why this isn't the case in your configuration?
Depends on your preference. How much do you dislike food poisoning?
The project page you linked provides a fairly specific overview of what the module does. Do you have specific questions about why a module would depend on it other than what they lay out there?
I'm hesitant to deal the final blow to this question to be honest. If dealing with CSS isn't a part of webmastering, then what is?
Does the error show up with any data set? Is there a minimum reproducible test case?
I had really hoped to get some more opinions on this question. I modified it a bit, possibly vote to reopen?
Wait, I answered too quickly. Do you mean, you want the string **`2009-08-14 00:37:02`** or the number of seconds since the epoch?
This looks so much like when I try to mount my USB (not encrypted). What do you get from dmesg?
No half cells no. The distribution of window sizes, smallest should be 1x1, largest... I'm unsure, perhaps 64x64?
This wouldn't explain all the problems, but the discrepancies may be related to syncing. Have you looked at your autosync preferences?
... not possible to my knowledge. Any reason you want something like that?
I think this is off topic but I'm not 100%. Any thoughts?
do you do dfs from every node? if not, what nodes do you begin the search from?
Do you want to simply have all the standard input in a single byte buffer at once?  Do you know a maximum length of the input stream?
@user391 - I really don't like doing this but I'm going to recommend we close this because it is really not about WordPress but about those other solutions and by definition will be off-topic, see http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1500?phase=definition As a moderator I can close but I want 1 or 2 other opinions before I do. Others agree or disagree?
From where are you calling the URL? Client side (JavaScript) or server side (PHP) ?
