aVIt came up in my front page and I clicked it without reading what subreddit it was from, only right at the end I twigged :D

aVIt's obviously not the first time you've acted the pillock, is it?
p11
aVEdit: hey /u/Alaukik, why so shy about what you wrote all of a sudden?
p12
aVWhat did /u/Alaukik write?
p13
aVFirst I asked him what was confusing about this post and in the second post I asked him if he had ever read satire before.
p14
aVI deleted it because after his reply I realised it came off as quite rude.

p31
aVSoon ukpolitics won't be taking these scot news, unless other stuff doesn't happen
p32
aVThis post as an incredible amount of upvotes for the subreddit....
p33
aVAs for a real answer, for any women in a similar predicament - a lot of medications interfere with mens' sex drives - I mean he's 46 afterall.
p34
aVThe ending cracked me up
p35
aVYou mean the funny bit in the joke was the punchline?
p36
aVAre we playing the blame game here?
p37
aVI think someone didn't read all the way through.
p38
aVCould you try that again but this time make sense?
p39
aVClicked on the link thinking this was /r/unitedkingdom.
p40
aVThen I [checked the comments.
p41
aV](http://i.imgur.com/OGfBeRl.gif)\u000a
p42
aVThere are only two of them and they're only visible because there are no other comments.
p43
aVI think they're downvoted.
p44
aVYeah, you are right.
p45
aVMy problem is that I've been conditioned by SRD to open pretty much every hidden comment chain I find...
p46
aVYou realise that you can change Reddit's settings to never hide comments right?
p47
aVI like it this way.
p48
aVIt's like a festive gift of drama whenever I come across one (so long as it's fun drama, not hate-filled drama!

aVsenorgif.com.
p53
aVIt could be best to counter them with an observation or two of your own.
p54
aVIt might raise the tone a few clicks.
p55
aVI've debated topics like this more than enough in my lifetime!
p56
aVinb4 people with closed minds insisting that "muslims have always been barbarians stop posting this propoganda that conflicts with my existing worldview"
p57
aVMmm, well done.
p58
aVVery much before.
p59
aVI've literally never heard anyone say that about Muslims.
p60
aVTry r/worldnews
p61
aVThen you keep very good company.
p62
aVBut they exist; and lots of them.
p63
aVThey won the European elections in France!
p64
aVAnd while UKIP aren't quite like that they certainly have significant elements of it.
p65
aVThat'd be because you're white and thus fail to notice racism because it's never directed at you.
p66
aVEDIT: whole lot of downvotes from upset white folks
p67
aVHey, you know it's still racial profiling if you've got no idea what racial background I'm from.
p68
aVTwo ignorances don't make an... unignorance.
p69
aVI apologise if that interferes with your worldview.
p70
aVRacism against white people is a vanishingly small problem and so I choose to channel my energy towards fighting problems that cause actual harm to large numbers of people.
p71
aVIsn't 1400 white children in 1 small town alone large enough for you?
p72
aVStill 'vanishingly small' when compared to the widespread institutional and societal racism against non-white people in Western countries.
p73
aVOf course, because "societal racism" is far far more serious than children being gang raped.
p74
aVIn fact, 11 year old children being gang raped whilst being called white slag and white prostitute is really a vanishingly small problem.
p75
aVWhat we really need to focus on is people using bad words, or the fact that black people get stopped and searched more often.
p76
aVThat should clearly be the priority. 
p77
aVYou seem to have read some things that I didn't write.
p78
aVThat is in effect what you are saying.
p79
aVPlease point out to me the "institutional raicsm" today in 2014 Britain? 
p80
aVThat was a joke, right?
p81
aVWhat makes you say that?
p82
aVThat's.
p83
aV...racist!
p84
aVoh no how will whitey cope
p85
aVAre you retarded?
p86
aVseriously when did we start using the word retarded as an insult if the UK its fucking spastic you twat.

p92

p93
aVYeah!
p94
aVHere on reddit we don't welcome people who are non-white or disabled!
p95
aV"on the wrong side"?
p96
aVBecause I'm sick of racism?
p97
aVBecause I think that using the word "retarded" as an insult is lazy and unnecessary?
p98
aVYou're hilarious because I bet you're one of those people who really hates seeing other websites act like Reddit has one opinion that every single user of the site agrees on.
p99
aVBut then you read what I'm saying and then you decide that my words don't fit into this convenient little idea of what you want to read on this site, and therefore I'm some invader who's come over from Tumblr to steal your mansrights.
p100
aVThere are plenty of people on Reddit who have the strength of character to stand up against oppression.
p101
aVYou're just terrified because you're part of the increasingly shrinking group that is too cowardly to start asking if you could be doing things better.
p102
aV&gt;tolerance\u000a\u000aYou mean when the Abbasids were the biggest slaving empire in the world to the point that they had a 500.000 thousand strong african zanj slave revolt (whom they wrote some very nasty racial things about as a people, comparing them to animals and calling them the least of mankind) and considered non-Arab muslims "mawali" banning them from proper Arabic muslim court rights and and representation in government?
p103
aVPresentism.
p104
aVThe Medieval Islamic world was certainly relatively tolerant for its time. 
p105
aVThe Abbasid Golden Age was nowhere near "relatively tolerant" for it's time, it was exactly as oppressive in it's second-class citizen notions of it's conquered people and far more so in those it made slaves.
p106
aVThat's the sort of moronic revisionism only found in the same shady orientalist circles that claim the Mongols were really merciful in reality.
p107
aVyep the abbasid golden age was an entirely monolithic period where everyone was universally oppressive of other religions and/or peoples.
p108
aVpeople all did the same bad things regardless of when and where in the empire they lived.
p109
aVRAAA I HATE MILD JOKES IN SATIRICAL MAGAZINES
p110
aVhello I am a commenter on the internet what is presentism and historical context
p111
aVI think I got this, in the context of this, presentism seems like comparing standards of the past to today's.
p112
aVAnd historical context is like what was going on around whatever it is that you're talking about. 
p113
aVI would like to read more on that.
p114
aVDo you have a source or the name of the book you read this in. 
p115
aVWhich in particular?
p116
aVIf you want to read about the Zanj Revolution there are numerous treatises including the nearly contemporary "History of the Prophets and Kings" by Tarikh al-Tabari (who also writes about Arabs rather pro-racially).
p117
aVFor their nasty writings on the Zanj there's Al-Muqaddasi, al-T\u016bs\u012b and the satirical works of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 are common examples though there's no doubt more there if you can be bothered (i've heard that Avicenna said they were a natural [aristotelian] slave race though I haven't read his works myself).
p118
aVLots of denigration of their intellectual capabilities and some unfavorable comparisons with apes pop up.
p119
aVIf you want to know about the mawali situation then the general anti-Persianism ("red people" etc) and the arab tribal affiliations during the Umayyads and the Abbasids all tend to be treated by more serious history books.
p120
aVYes, the ancient Islamic/Arabian world was centuries ahead in mathematics, medicine etc., but for all the advancement of the civilization I've never heard of them being world leaders in tolerance.
p121
aV[The Islamic world was notably tolerant of Judaism at a time when Christian Europe really wasn't.
p122
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_under_Muslim_rule)
p123
aVThat's fascinating, thank you very much.
p124
aV&gt; Some historians refer to this time period as the "Golden Age" for the Jews as more opportunities became available to them.
p125
aV[9] But this approach is commonly referred to as a myth.
p126
aVThat's from your own link.
p127
aVSafe to say there isn't much of a consensus on this. 
p128
aVEven your own source makes light of that claim calling it a myth before the orientalist revisionist views are presented.
p129
aVSee the pogroms it links to such as examples [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohads#Status_of_non-Muslims), [two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_Fez_massacre) and [three.
p130
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre) \u000a\u000aThey were all perpetrated during the height of their scientific and supposedly "tolerant" Golden Age.
p131
aV&gt;the ancient Islamic/Arabian world was centuries ahead in mathematics, medicine etc.
p132
aVCenturies ahead is still a bit of a stretch since it was mainly confined to Baghdad and it was heavily based on the works of previous and contemporary Greek and Chinese tracts but still I didn't really question that part since it specifies architecture and medicine (Rhazi could certainly be argued to have been at forefront of his field at the time for instance). 
p133
aVThing is the Islamic world was only ahead of Europe for about 4 centuries after Mohammed - until the 12th century or so.
p134
aVFrom then on, nothing of any real value was produced in the scientific realm.
p135
aVHere's a good article on it which is a bit long but worth the read.
p136
aVhttp://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science\u000a\u000a
p137
aV&gt; \u201cfor many centuries the world of Islam was in the forefront of human civilization and achievement.\u201d \u201cNothing in Europe,\u201d notes Jamil Ragep, a professor of the history of science at the University of Oklahoma, \u201ccould hold a candle to what was going on in the Islamic world until about 1600.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat seems to be quite a bit longer than 4 centuries.
p138
aVYes you read the first 4 paras but do read the rest.
p139
aVThe author then goes on to show why that quote isn't true.
p140
aVThe article doesn't say that.
p141
aVIt discusses how they succeeded, what was achieved and so on but there's nothing there which says that Europe eclipsed them at the 12th century.
p142
aVThat itself would be a peculiar claim since the Renaissance was still a few centuries away. 
p143
aVIt does, do a Ctrl + F for "Al-Ghazali", 2/3rds down read the paragraph.
p144
aV*It is an exaggeration to say, as Steven Weinberg claimed in the Times of London, that after al-Ghazali (died 1111) \u201cthere was no more science worth mentioning in Islamic countries\u201d; in some places, especially Central Asia, Arabic work in science continued for some time, and philosophy was still studied somewhat under Shi\u2019ite rule.
p145
aV(In the Sunni world, philosophy turned into mysticism.
p146
aV) But the fact is, Arab contributions to science became increasingly sporadic as the anti-rationalism sank in.
p147
aV*
aVNo one will dispute that there was a deterioration of their science, but you specifically claimed that they were only ahead of Europe until the 12th century, which isn't corroborated by the article.
p148
aVThe part about Al-Ghazali's influence speaks of there being a decline that started because of him, which isn't the same thing as saying that European scientists surpassed them.
p149
aVDepends what you mean by Europe.
p150
aVByzantium was never behind.
p151
aVWestern Europe only took off with the fall of Byzantium.
p152
aVThe flight of educated Greeks to the west sparked a massive cultural revival.
p153
aVSo longer than the current scientific revolution, Western democracy, the Enlightenment, Britain, the US, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, etc.
p154
aV7th century to 12th century is about 500 years.
p155
aV12th century to the 21st is 900 years.
p156
aVYes you can count.
p157
aVWhy are you measuring from the 12th Century though?
p158
aVIt seems a bit random.
p159
aVMore sensible to measure from the scientific revolution etc.
p160
aVThe 12th Century was still very much the middle ages.
p161
aVThere's no logic in starting your European count based on what the Islamic world *wasn't* doing!
p162
aVAlso, your 12th century cut off for the End of the golden age seems entirely arbitrary.
p163
aVThe Wikipedia article on the golden age says the end is described as being either the 13th (Mongol invasions) or end of the 15th century (Reconquista) and describes a number of achievements in this period.
p164
aVhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age\u000a\u000aIt would seem bizarre to describe a Western European golden age as being initiated by the mass invasion of Central Europe by the Mongols!
p165
aVHundreds of brilliant political cartoons in Private Eye, yet the one about extremist Muslims is the one that gets uploaded and upvoted on /r/ukpolitics.
p166
aVI've seen loads of Private Eye cartoons here over the years, don't be silly.
p167
aVLoads of stuff from PE has been posted here recently...
p168
aVInstead of moaning, why not post links to some of the funny or insightful cartoons?
p169
aVStop making sense!
p170
aVIt's accurate, relevant, and witty.
p171
aVWhy is it a problem that people are upvoting it?
p172
aVWhy wouldn't it be?
p173
aVISIS, you know, those people slaughtering/raping people in the middle east in the name of Islam are currently a hot topic.
p174
aVThis cartoon is relevant to that, so it makes perfect sense that it would get attention.
p175
aVAlso, the only people who should be offended by this are the Muslims who think the killing/raping etc is good.
p176
aVI am ok with offending them.
p177
aVinteresting\u000a\u000asadly, the islamic golden age is something of a myth.
p178
aVthe fabled, pioneering technological advancements purported to have come from the muslim world consisted of raising large armies, overwhelming more advanced cities (alexandria, byzantium, countless indian settlements lost to the ages), taking their works and claiming it as their own.
p179
aVthis is akin to little barry the bully beating up stewart the swot, taking stewart's homework, writing his own name over it, and handing it in for top marks.
p180
aVthis is demonstrated in their inability to rebuild after being wiped out by the mongols; it turns out that ibn ali baba never actually understood the treasures of the classical world he had stolen.
p181
aVthe muslim world was very good at subjugating non believers however, through things like the barbary coast, north african slave trade, janissaries and treatment of the dhimmis unfortunate enough to be trapped within the empire (syriacs, coptics, hindus etc.).
p182
aVof course, such things are common in all empires, but usually forgotten about in non-european ones, thus important to note and keep in mind
p183
aVPersonally, I couldn't disagree more.
p184
aVOur advancements in medicine came through the help of the islamic world, mainly through the crusades and the fall of Constantinople.
p185
aVIslamic countries were the first to heave modern hospitals which were far better than the Askelpios' that were found in the Greek and Roman world which were focused more on superstition than medical science.
p186
aV(Admittedly these were different ages, however after the collapse of the roman empire and the advancement of the dark ages, Europe fell into disrepair and it was just the works of Galen that were practiced.
p187
aV)\u000a\u000aDuring the dark ages and medieval period, the church controlled much of the medical world within Europe, with anyone whose ideas dissagreed with Galen were banned.
p188
aVIt took a further 500 years until the Renaissance for the western world to create ligatures (Ambrose Pare), which had been found in the islamic countries much before.
p189
aVThe fall of Constantinople meant that scholars fled to Europe and so much knowledge was brought alongside, including "The Canon of Medicine" by Aviccenna, who I feel that you wrongly do not give enough credit too.
p190
aVIslamic countries also had the idea of infection much before western civilisation, which can be seen in how hospitals were positioned.
p191
aVMeat was hung around Islamic cities, and depending on how long the meat to to rot, depended on whether a hospital was positioned there.
p192
aVThis idea was not known in medieval Britain, where years later people were still contracting diseases from cesspits, as well as the much later cholera outbreak which was determined to be caused by bacteria by Dr John Snow in the 1800's.
p193
aVI hold islamic medicine in high regard when considering that western cultures were too busy destroying what we had and plunging ourselves into the dark ages, where as medical knowledge pioneered in other parts of the world. 
p194
aVGreat post.
p195
aVBut the idea of a European dark age has been proven wrong aswell, although in decline after the fall of the western empire Rome made many great advancements - the heavy plow, a huge increase in water wheels etc. 
p196
aVThe area that we know as the dark ages has faced much controversy by historians, and i'm in the camp that say that it did in fact happen, although we do not know how long for.
p197
aVOur language was one of the few things to evolve during this time, which words that originated from the anglo saxons become present which were not used widely (or in some cases at all before).
p198
aVAlthough there were some improvements as you rightly say, such as water wheels, great works such as the aqueducts were lost as they did not spread across Europe.
p199
aVThe Phantom Time Hypothesis is also particularly interesting here, as we have no certain proof if the dark ages and middle ages ever happened, but I wouldn't say that this was proof.
p200
aVI believe it did happen, but the period of time is unknown to us, as many different things did happen during this time which otherwise could not be explained.
p201
aV- Thats not too say either of us are right, as it most certainly is a debatable point.
p202
aVMy apologies this post doesn't really make much sense, the ideas here are hard to articulate well.
p203
aVI believe it happened as its a method of explaining the time period and events that happened, but I may be wrong.
p204
aVIt does also help my argument about Islam's contribution to medicine.
p205
aVI think by saying it didn't really happen doesn't help explain why these events occurred, and looking at evidence in my opinion suggests it did.
p206
aVIt is really a matter of interpretation though, like all things in history!
p207
aVI think that as you say, "such things are common in all empires", and that while many practices of the Islamic world were undoubtedly cruel, they're really no more cruel than any other medieval kingdoms.
p208
aVI also don't really buy that all advancement was a result of theft from other cultures - it's a bold accusation and if you have any evidence I'd like to see it.
p209
aVI'm as antitheist as you like, but there's no denying the great leaps in mathematics and medicine of the ancient Arabic/Islamic world, and that their universities were the oldest and easily the best in the ancient world.

aVAlso, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world#Notable_scientists
p214
aVI disagree with him, but it's much better to debate the points he makes than assuming he's a raider.
p215
aVAs he points out, while his post may be (mildly) Islamophobic, your accusations are a bit over the top.
p216
aVI also think it's a bit ironic how paranoid you sound while accusing him of being a conspiracy theorist.
p217
aVThis sub is going to die if we just accuse anyone we disagree with of being a shill, as is mentioned at the top of the thread you linked.
p218
aVMate just look at his posting history.
p219
aVHuh, fair enough.
p220
aVHe even uses the absurd "Intolerance of racists is a contradiction!
p221
aV" argument thing.
p222
aVUgh.
p223
aVi would be interested to see if you can explain how 'intolerance will not be tolerated' is a sound statement \u000a\u000aalso, please respond directly to the contents of my post, rather than the score, or even the name attached to it.
p224
aVsuch is the way of proper discourse 
p225
aVBecause we don't have to live by extremes?
p226
aVIt isn't hypocritical nor impossible to tolerate most things while abhorring intolerance. 
p227
aVnot extremes, just logical standards.
p228
aVrelativism will get you into some sticky situations when you find someone who draws the arbitrary line unresolvably different from you.\u000a
p229
aVLuckily we are creatures of judgement and don't require absolute consensus.
p230
aVindeed, that way everybody can be right 
p231
aVBecause tolerating a different viewpoint allows discourse to move forwards.
p232
aVTolerating some people saying "these people are inherently inferior because of where they were born", "The Sky is pink and we're ruled by lizard people" etc etc doesn't actually advance anything and just wastes everyones time.
p233
aVIf you want the view to be tolerated you have to prove it, and just screaming "THEYRE ALL SUB-HUMAN RAPISTS, AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A RACIST!!
p234
aV" Isn't (contrary to /pol/) the same as a rational discussion, and nor is it a "debate" its just an attempt to shout your view and then shout down any opposing arguments, This is why everyone hates /pol/
p235
aVYou are an idiot.
p236
aVof the 4 charges you have laid against me, only 'islamophobia' could potentially be contained within my post.
p237
aVhowever, the events of history are not racist, nor 'white supremacist', nor a conspiracy theory; they are merely facts, things that were (as far as we can tell).

p239
aVnext time, perhaps a more measured response sans the charge of the light political correctness brigade would be better
p240
aVYeah, none of those links provide convincing evidence towards your key statement that 'all Islamic advancements were stolen'.
p241
aVevidently, making such an absolute statement such as that is foolish; i assumed people would be able to work that out.
p242
aVperhaps i should have said 'broadly consisted of', my apologies 
p243
aVWhy are some of the lefties on this site so fascist?
p244
aVIf you really believe in what you espouse you shouldn't fear a dissenting view point, you should welcome it and debate the point instead of screaming "racism" and "Islamophobia".

aVTo be fair, the reason why Pokémon prices are so high is that 1 Yen is roughly equal to 1 pence or 1 dollar.
p265
aVDid you actually put this up, or is it photoshopped?
p266
aVIt's real, I have an Epson 3800 which can make those :)
p267
aVAmazing printer.
p268
aVI used to have one.
p269
aVThem were the days (last year).
p270
aVWhat's so good about them is I expect they won't even get noticed for a while by guards and the like.
p271
aVJust don't get caught, unlike dropping kittens into a woodchipper, messing with paid advertising loses companies money, and therefore you'll be in big legal trouble :) However, please DO keep doing it, as I'm sure you're cheering up far more people than you're annoying.
p272
aVYeah I already considered that so I only use empty ad slots ;) It can take a while to track down trains with unused slots but this way no-one can claim I'm doing any harm.
p273
aVNice, I now have full support for you knowing I'm not encouraging you to get arrested :)
p274
aVAfter 2008 one thing I noticed was there were loads of empty slots.
p275
aVTFL even started putting in their own advertising/propaganda to make it less noticable.
p276
aVEvery time I heard Labour's "green shoots" rubbish I'd think of all those empty advertising slots and think "nope!

p285
aV&gt;ITT: Humourless right wingers.
p286
aVMakes a decent change from the typical humourless left wingers throughout this sub.
p287
aVRight wingers don't have jokes do they?
p288
aVThe only right wing comedians I can think of are Chubby Brown and Bernard Manning.
p289
aVEdit: Unless you count Nick Griffin as a joke because he most certainly is.
p290
aVPeter Hitchens is hilarious, too bad many miss his jokes, as he has quite a dry wit.
p291
aVI didn't realise Peter Hitchens was a comedian.
p292
aVI wouldn't mind watching one of his stand ups.
p293
aVDo you have a blog I can link to if i share on twitter?
p294
aVNice work!
p295
aV[deleted]
p296
aVYeah I don't really have a blog yet, but I put that specific image [on twitter](https://twitter.com/mudkip2014)
p297
aVI didn't see the twitter link for this, which I have totally theived.
p298
aVHave gold instead!
p299
aVI did put it up [on twitter](https://twitter.com/mudkip2014) so you could link to that, thanks
p300
aVThis is actually brilliant.
p301
aVI herd u liek Ukipz
p302
aVHaha, I saw this today!
p303
aVIt's a shame I can only upvote this once
p304
aVIf only we didn't use FPTP, we might have more than one vote!
p305
aVHow do people react if you put these up?
p306
aVBeing British... they ignore it!
p307
aVMaybe they were part of the huge majority of adults who don't watch childrens cartoons.
p308
aVWell, it would be pretty unusual for people to be putting *anything* in the tube ad slots, but, you know, what if they're *supposed* to be doing that?
p309
aVCan't possibly risk the potential embarrassment of asking them!
p310
aVFantastic.
p311
aVDo you have a collection of these somewhere online?
p312
aVYears ago I [tried to start a thing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/66766356@N06/), but didn't really have the time to devote to it to build it up so I've just been doing occasional stuff off the record since.
p313
aVIs it legal to put these on tubes?
p314
aVDo you pay a rent space or just do it sneakily? 
p315
aVSneakily of course, tho I only use already empty slots so no-one can claim I'm stealing ad space from anyone.
p316
aVIt amused me.
p317
aVPiccadilly line?
p318
aVI'd say please stick some in the Northern Line, but during commuting hours people are so crammed in there that nobody would even see them.
p319
aVActually that is the Northern line
p320
aVAh, I forgot that the zone labels are dark blue on all lines.
p321
aVCarry on!
p322
aVApologies for being a bit off-topic, but can you suggest a printer?
p323
aVI've got similar ambitions, but can't work out how to do a short run without it costing the earth. 
p324
aVthey said they were using an epson 3800
p325
aVCheers, I didn't get that far in the comments.
p326
aVAppreciated. 
p327
aVJust to add I bought my Epson 3800 2nd hand, they're too pricey new but they do come up used on ebay now and again.
p328
aVThe nice thing about them is while they're more expensive to buy than cheapo consumer printers, the ink is around 10x cheaper than consumer ink by volume (tho the cartridges are huge, so individually they're quite expensive)
p329
aVI nearly fell off my chair when I saw the price.
p330
aVIt is a beast though!
p331
aVI might start keeping an eye out on ebay just in case!
p332

p333
aVIts those dam fire types, with there red and there fire that always beat us.
p334
aVThey have such a advantage over us water types, we need them gone!
p335
aVIs this political?
p336
aVIsn't it a meme post?
p337
aVGoing to do some about the other parties?
p338
aVHe could probably do one that just, might, maybe, might fit all of your butthurt about this image onto a single poster.
p339
aVI did do some [for Cameron](https://www.flickr.com/photos/66766356@N06/sets/72157627510204256) after the riots, didn't really keep it up so haven't done any for a while tho.
p340
aVI did UKIP this time because they've been putting some rather silly ads out recently.
p341
aV[deleted]
p342
aVyou realise this isn't far off their actual posters
p343
aVIndeed, if UKIP didn't make it quite so easy to mock them I'm sure there wouldn't be so much like this :)\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, angry about a pokemon parody, that's a lot of spare anger there!
p344
aVPut a little effort in at least
p345
aVLeftists can't make up their minds.
p346
aVThey say immigrants come to work and then they laugh at people who claim they;re taking jobs.
p347
aVDo they think there are infinite jobs?
p348
aVBizarre.
p349
aVThank you for illustrating the main problem, which is that it's impossible to have a sensible debate about things like this.
p350
aVFor a start jobs aren't a zero sum game so suggesting that every migrant employed has taken that job from a British person is just as nonsensical as suggesting there are infinite jobs.
p351
aVSecondly while I agree with a lot of Farage's finer points, I absolutely disagree with using dodgy statistics, exaggerated claims and completely unnecessary inflammatory images and statements.
p352
aVIt's quite unfortunate that UKIP has gone down this route really.
p353
aVOne thing I do find it funny tho is that the right-wing press, who for years have been printing inflammatory and exaggerated anti-EU stories which helped create this atmosphere, has now turned against UKIP for doing exactly the same thing.
p354
aVIf someone from a foreign country is more qualified than you then tough shit.
p355
aVI'd rather have someone who's more qualified and foreign then someone who's less qualified and English.
p356
aVDon't like it?
p357
aVBless.
p358
aVGo out and get more qualifications. 
p359
aVFirst of all:\u000a\u000aDon't like that people might vote against your immigration preference?
p360
aVTough shit.
p361
aVThis is democracy.
p362
aVYou can't always get what you want.
p363
aVSecond of all:\u000a\u000aThats exactly what UKIP is avocating.
p364
aVThe rest of the parties want to preference people simply because hey're citizens of "the EU" instead of  based on skills.
p365
aVThats part of why theres the new EU passports.
p366
aVThink clearly.
p367
aVThirdly:\u000a\u000aYour stance is a globalist one which is purely chasng GDP growth.
p368
aVIs GDP growth really worth the erosion of heterogeneity of race, culture and identity?
p369
aV---------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aTangent here:\u000a\u000aOnce we're all global citizen serving our corporate masters.
p370
aVOnce the English race has been de-constructed and Britain as a nation has seen its abolition.
p371
aVOnce thats happened its gone forever.
p372
aVIf its inevitable than so be it.
p373
aVBut for you to fob off the entire idea of the ethnic British person reeks of masochism and hatred.
p374
aVI think British culture is worth preserving.
p375
aVI think much of British history is worthy of praise.
p376
aVI think destroying it for the sake of your metric is a quite frankly disgusting.
p377
aVI know that we can't go back to the past, but we are in the process of choosing the wrong future.
p378
aVAsk yourself who you're serving.
p379
aVBecause to me, the final thing standing in the way of total globalism is the nation state and the ethnic identity of people.
p380
aVThe "nations" of the future will be McDonalds, Mars and Toyota.
p381
aVThe religion will be "GDP".
p382
aVWe forgot somewhere along the way that our increases in productivity and our progress in technology was supposed to serve and uplift man.
p383
aVAnd instead we're steeped in a left-wing who argue in the favour of macro-corporatists (multinationals) and right-wingers who argue in favour of same corporations but under the pretense that it will preserve nationality.
p384
aVLets face it the conservatives aren't conserving jack shit.
p385
aVThey bait their own members so they can shame them and remove all the old guard.
p386
aVLabour don't care about the poor and disenfranchised labour class of British people.
p387
aVThe EU doesn't care about Britain.
p388
aVIt has no reason to serve Britains interests exept for when they expressly match with its own.
p389
aVAnd it seems like few people can actually tell me what the EU stand for.
p390
aVIts "head" (although people on't even seem to agree who the head is) was a maoist.
p391
aVI know that I'm rambling but I think you'll come to regret your flippant attitude to british culture and the ethnic English/Irish/Scottish/Welsh.
p392
aVAre you ethnically from the UK and currently enjoying some masochism?
p393
aVOr are you advocating your own immigrant interests in an arrogant manner?
p394
aVI imagine you want to make me annoyed with your language but I've head it all before and you can't disenfranchise me any more with the state of politics across the West.
p395
aVWe're all living in quasi-America.
p396
aVand it won't take long before everyones culture is American.
p397
aV**I'll be shocked if anyone read all that**
p398
aVOk firstly: of course I don't like it, people don't like it when people disagree with their views.
p399
aVI strongly oppose them but I know they will vote.
p400
aVThat's democracy - just because it's democracy doesn't mean I have to like what they say.
p401
aVI don't really have a reason to use a phrase involving shit here but hey shit.
p402
aVNo their not.
p403
aVThey're saying (source recent radio interview with Farage) that they don't want people because of their race.
p404
aVThat's racist.
p405
aVNo I don't care about GDP.
p406
aVI care about what will kill us i.e.
p407
aVglobal warming, global food shortages and rising populations.
p408
aVI also believe in progression.
p409
aVNone of those things can be achieved with regressing back out of the EU.
p410
aVI believe these problems (not GDP) are worth erasing hetrogeneity of race, culture and identity.
p411
aVI see no problem with these being erased.
p412
aVI'd rather be a part of a United Europe than a United Kingdom, national divisions can lie in sport, elsewhere they're pointless.
p413
aVYour tangent seems to be based purely upon the assumption I care a lot about GDP.
p414
aVBeing in the EU benefits it but it's not my main point for arguing against UKIP.
p415
aVIll respond to your accusations and nothing else.
p416
aVI'm English but also 3/8ths Welsh.
p417
aVI'm not arrogant I just don't like this argument.
p418
aVI don't want to annoy you I just want to say why I don't agree with you.
p419
aVI won't regret my flippant attitude because I know a lot of people agree with me.
p420
aVUltimately it is the way forward.
p421
aVI love a lot of cultures, I love the Buddist culture, I love the Cornish culture.
p422
aVI love the Australian culture, the country's I have been I love what I've seen.
p423
aVI don't see mixing race, culture and identity as a problem.
p424
aVBecause it isn't.
p425
aVThe main technological advances have come from co-operation not one country rejecting all help from everyone else.
p426
aVYou can't destroy history.
p427
aVIt is there in the books and will forever be in our memories.
p428
aVDamn.
p429
aVThat was one hell of a tangent you got there.
p430
aV&gt;No their not.
p431
aVThey're saying (source recent radio interview with Farage) that they don't want people because of their race.
p432
aVThat's racist.
p433
aVNo.
p434
aVThey aren't.
p435
aVEven Milliband has disagreed with this.
p436
aV&gt;No I don't care about GDP.
p437
aVI care about what will kill us i.e.
p438
aVglobal warming, global food shortages and rising populations.
p439
aVI also believe in progression.
p440
aVNone of those things can be achieved with regressing back out of the EU.
p441
aVThe EU will stop rising populations?
p442
aVThe EU will stop food shortages despite being protectionist?
p443
aVI get the global warming argument, but cmon.
p444
aVAnd "progression".
p445
aVPlease.
p446
aVAbsolutely disgusting.
p447
aVProgressivism is just the destruction of society.
p448
aVThe erosion of standards, duty, the family and culture.
p449
aV&gt;I believe these problems (not GDP) are worth erasing hetrogeneity of race, culture and identity.
p450
aVWOW.
p451
aVJust... wow.
p452
aV&gt;I see no problem with these being erased.
p453
aVWhats the point of preserving humanity if we lose all of what makes us so great.
p454
aVWe're not numbers.
p455
aVWe're not a squirming brown mass of machine operators.
p456
aVThis sort of comment reeks of the sort of person who has never taken the time to enjoy education as more than getting a job.
p457
aVThe beauty of humanity is our diversity of thought.
p458
aVInto my heart an air that kills\u000a    From yon far country blows:\u000a    What are those blue remembered hills, \u000a    What spires, what farms are those?
p459
aVThat is the land of lost content,\u000a    I see it shining plain,\u000a    The happy highways where I went\u000a    And cannot come again.
p460
aV-------------------------------\u000a\u000a    He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,\u000a    That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,\u000a    But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust.
p461
aVIf we who sight along it round the world,\u000a    See nothing worthy to have been its mark,\u000a    It is because like men we look too near,\u000a    Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,\u000a    Our missiles always make too short an arc.
p462
aVThey fall, they rip the grass, they intersect\u000a    The curve of earth, and striking, break their own;\u000a    They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.
p463
aVBut this we know, the obstacle that checked\u000a    And tripped the body, shot the spirit on\u000a    Further than target ever showed or shone\u000a\u000a-------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aThere is more to life than living.
p464
aVThe human species is above merely surviving.
p465
aVI often reflect on my favourite poem.
p466
aVThe Charge of the Light Brigade.
p467
aVI had an ancestor who fought in that cavalry.
p468
aVAnd it strikes me that although men of so many nations fought in the same wars and battles, often alongside eachother as comrades.
p469
aVThat where the beauty of war comes from is not the exquisitely sharp tragedy, but in the difference in perspective.
p470
aVThe Eastern philosophy revolutionised Western thought.
p471
aVThe same way hat the Enlightenment shocked Prussia and created the German powerhouse.
p472
aVThe power of man is his isolation to brew his own thoughts.
p473
aVTo foster and nurture a new and radical idea.
p474
aVAnd then to unleash that idea upon his fellows and to watch it take wing and fight.
p475
aVPolitics is a war of ideas.
p476
aVWar is an evolution of human thought.
p477
aVYou think your homogenisation of humanity would be for its betterment when it would rob it of its entire soul.
p478
aVI'm not suggesting it should go, I just see no problem with walking down the road and having 7 or 8 different cultures of food available to me.
p479
aVI'm just saying I have no problem with cultures mixing.
p480
aVNot suggesting we should stop nurturing new ideas.
p481
aVWhats the point in preserving humanity?
p482
aVUh...I want to live.
p483
aVWhat makes the human race great is our ability to co-operate.
p484
aVYou and I wouldn't be alive if we hadn't.
p485
aVI personally believe discriminating against someone on grounds of their race to be racist.
p486
aVYOLO.
p487
aVYeah but I think we need to be as united as we can to face these issues.
p488
aVThey won't get solved by everyone doing their own thing.
p489
aVUnity will get us through it.
p490
aVProgression isn't disgusting.
p491
aVWe're moving towards a more united world.
p492
aVI want to see a more united world.
p493
aVShoot me.
p494
aVYeah I stand by what I said.
p495
aVI want to see the human race survive.
p496
aVI think culture being mixed is not a bad thing, actually I love what all these cultures have delivered.
p497
aVI want to survive and I want to see a united world, yeah it sounds naive.
p498
aVI hate some cultures where there is repression and an abuse of human rights.
p499
aVI just want a free united world. 
p500
aV&gt;I'm just saying I have no problem with cultures mixing.
p501
aVNot suggesting we should stop nurturing new ideas.
p502
aVYou can't have both.
p503
aVLocalised diversity applied to the whole globe (globalisation) is only diversity in the short run.
p504
aVOnce you mix all the paint you start off with interesting swirls and you end up with one colour.
p505
aVThe internet.
p506
aVTV.
p507
aVInternational banking.
p508
aVMultinational corporations.
p509
aVAlmost every country in the world eats mcdonalds and drinks coca cola.
p510
aVThats not diversity on a macro level.
p511
aVYou're looking too small.
p512
aV&gt;our ability to co-operate\u000a\u000aNo its our ability to compete.
p513
aVCommunism failed.
p514
aVDidn't you hear?
p515
aV&gt;I personally believe discriminating against someone on grounds of their race to be racist.
p516
aVYOLO.
p517
aVWhat does that have to do with anything I posted?
p518
aV&gt;Yeah but I think we need to be as united as we can to face these issues.
p519
aVThey won't get solved by everyone doing their own thing.
p520
aVUnity will get us through it.
p521
aVThey will be solved by everyone doing their own thing.
p522
aVThats the point.
p523
aVUnity is a farce.
p524
aVEuropean governments cannot be trusted with centralisation of power.
p525
aVYou would gamble everything for the sake of non-issues.
p526
aVGlobal warming needs solving.
p527
aVBut thats one problem.
p528
aVTo combat it you think we should throw caution to the wind and centralise power in the EU.
p529
aVA blatantly communist piece of trash.
p530
aV&gt;Progression isn't disgusting.
p531
aVWe're moving towards a more united world.
p532
aVI want to see a more united world.
p533
aVShoot me.
p534
aVI'll be he one getting shot when I'm seen as "delaying progress".
p535
aVThey'll march me out onto the cambodian killing fields.
p536
aVOr ship me off to the siberian gulags.
p537
aVOr have me starved of rice on a chinese farm I can't hope to farm.
p538
aVMarx believed that the classes were stuck in an endless war and the working class could prevail and overcome oppression.
p539
aVHe was proven wrong, repeatedly.
p540
aVBut his ideas were reborn in cultural marxism.
p541
aVAnd they now seek to open a million fronts against "oppression".
p542
aVRacism.
p543
aVSexism.
p544
aVAgeism.
p545
aVAbleism.
p546
aVTransgenderism.
p547
aVPolytheism.
p548
aVetc etc.
p549
aVSlowly but surely the population will divide internally.
p550
aVStripped of a national narrative, stripped of a cultural identity, stripped of race and name and creed.
p551
aVWe'll look about ourselves and see that there is no community but THE community.
p552
aVThere is no refuge.
p553
aVThere is no diversity.
p554
aVAnd then perhaps we'll shrug our shoulders and flip over to see the next episode of Big Brother.
p555
aV&gt;Yeah I stand by what I said.
p556
aVI want to see the human race survive.
p557
aVNo you don't.
p558
aVYou want its soul torn from its body.
p559
aVIts passions withered and quashed.
p560
aVIts hopes and faiths crushed.
p561
aVIts fire and fury forever quelled.
p562
aVYou want stability.
p563
aVYou want the pendulum to stop swinging and the chaos that is life to organise itself.
p564
aVYou're a communist.
p565
aV"Progression" is really erosion.
p566
aV&gt;I just want a free united world.
p567
aVAn oxymoron.
p568
aVWow.
p569
aVJust wow.
p570
aVI have better things to be doing, seriously it would take a while to explain what is wrong with what you have just said on what I have said.
p571
aVI need to revise and progress in my life.
p572
aVYou know, progression.
p573
aVOh please.
p574
aVSpare me.
p575
aVWow.
p576
aVDat hate...
p577
aVI don't hate you.
p578
aVYour post was just flippantly pretending that you could show I was wrong but have better things to do.
p579
aVWhich doesnt seem likely.
p580
aVAre you a communist?
p581
aVYou seem to take on the denial of reality and anti-culture.
p582
aVI could take a selfie with me and my work if you really like...?
p583
aVI honestly I have an exam in 14 hours time.
p584
aVThe length of the posts were taking up too much time.
p585
aVBelieve what you like :L\u000aNope.
p586
aVI very much disagree with communism.
p587
aVPlease don't degenerate to insults. 
p588
aV&gt; I very much disagree with communism\u000a\u000aOnly economically.
p589
aVYou could always come back after your exams.
p590
aVGet off reddit and go study.
p591
aVI want you to succeed. 
p592
aVNo, no I completely disagree with communism.
p593
aVEconomically I completely disagree with it, it just ends up being one silly dictatorship with no elections.
p594
aVAnd cheers, all the best with whatever you are doing an all!
p595
aV&gt; Do they think there are infinite jobs?
p596
aVDo you think the number of jobs in the economy is static, and doesn't vary with the population and the level of demand for goods and services?
p597
aVNo.
p598
aVAnd thats why you need a controlled immigration which targets jobs that need filling in skilled roles.
p599
aVLike UKIP advocates...
p600
aVI keep hearing about these mysterious "Leftists" but still don't know what they are
p601
aVEver boiled a frog?
p602
aVThe trick is to do it slow.
p603
aVI think their really laughing at people who claim they're taking jobs, who are usually the same people who claim they're taking benefits. 
p604
aVWhenever you create more competition for unskilled jobs in a pool of limited jobs you create unemployed people who have to resort to welfare.
p605
aVThis is undeniable.
p606
aVSo any immigration into the country which isn't managed in correlation to job availability (ie jobs that can't be filled) will result in unemployment.
p607
aVThis is undeniable.
p608
aVThere seems to be this strange paradigm where people think immigration can't cause an increase in unemployment, welfare and still be taking jobs.
p609
aVWhen really they are all tied together.
p610
aVActually you can make infinite jobs.
p611
aVHere is how: give spoons to workers instead of shovels, intentionally destroy bus stops (it creates new jobs!
p612
aV) etc.
p613
aVThis way you make a lot of jobs but no progress to society.

aV50% of welfare claimants are pensioners because they hide the cost of pensions under welfare and then constantly blame "lazy" people of working age.
p619
aVPension costs are set to rocket so "welfare" costs will too.
p620
aVInteresting to see Osbornes latest 'How did we spend your money' leaflet picked apart.
p621
aVFor instance slipping public sector pensions into the welfare section to increase its size, even tho they'd seperated the state pension from welfare so they could show how much they spent on their core voters.
p622
aVSpun to look like welfare is over a quarter of the budget, when work age benefits are under 14% and unemployment benefit a tiny sliver of that.
p623
aVInteresting picking apart of it, with the original pie chart Osborne released [here...]  (http://kittysjones.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/conservatives-should-repay-cost-of-misleading-tax-stunt-says-tuc/)\u000a\u000a
p624
aVPublic sector pensions as part of welfare is utterly bizarre.
p625
aVThat is going beyond simple misrepresentation and into the realm of outrageous lying.
p626
aVThe most honest thing would have been to include public sector pensions in the same section as public sector salaries (nurses' pensions in Health Spending, teachers' pensions in Education Spending, etc.
p627
aV) seeing as it's a cost of employing these people.
p628
aVIf you replaced these conventional salaries with modern DC personal pensions, the state's contribution would be counted as part of the salary.
p629
aVYet you just wait and watch people use that massive section of 'welfare spending' as a reason to blame the sick and unemployed for our financial woes.
p630
aVStep 1: have direct pension payment from the current public sector employees to the retired public sector employees (ie, no 'pension pot')\u000a\u000aStep 2: reduce the size of the public sector\u000a\u000aStep 3: claim the tax man has to 'step in' to pay public sector pensions which are 'out of proportion'\u000a\u000aStep 4: unilaterally smash public sector pensions\u000a\u000aStep 5: re-election?
p631
aV&gt; could show how much they spent on their core voters\u000a\u000aExcept that public-sector workers are largely Labour supporters (and are members of the trade unions that fund Labour), not Conservative supporters.
p632
aVEDIT: Apparently I misunderstood what was meant by that sentence.
p633
aVI think you misunderstood.
p634
aVThey distinguished state pensions - their core voters - whilst hiding public sector pensions in the welfare budget.
p635
aVYeah, I meant they'd seperated the state pension from welfare, so they can show their core pension age voters how nicely they're treating them.
p636
aVEDIT: Heh, sorry, didn't realise two other people had explained my meaning before I commented, came here from my mailbox, not the thread.
p637
aVCertainly explains why they want to lump typical labour voters in with the 'scroungers' too, tho.
p638
aVI think he was referring to the fact that they'd separated the state pension from welfare.
p639
aVBoth parties can shuffle away - the UK is going down.
p640
aVHardly.
p641
aVFastest growing economy in the West, and a bunch of other goodies.
p642
aVWages are being kept down by a variety of reasons, including immigration as one factor (immigrants willing to work in terrible conditions for very little money forces wages down).
p643
aV1 Million people in this country use food banks?
p644
aVout of a population of ~63 million?
p645
aVThats pretty good going, i'd say.
p646
aVA better position than most EU nations.
p647
aV13 million in 'poverty'?
p648
aVDefine poverty.
p649
aVI've been in the houses of people who are in 'poverty' and they have smartphones, large TV's, games consoles, computers, designer furniture and clothing etc etc etc.
p650
aVHardly poverty ridden.
p651
aV&gt; 50% of welfare claimants are pensioners because they hide the cost of pensions under welfare\u000a\u000aIt's more because the pension system in this country hasn't changed significantly in the last 40 years, yet life expectancy has increased and interest rates have fallen, making the system increasingly unsustainable.
p652
aVAdditionally, one of the main reasons for the increase in life expectancy are the improvements in geriatric medical care, which are expensive and have significantly increased the "cost of life" for older people.
p653
aVOf course, whenever any government tries to take steps to improve things (e.g.
p654
aVraising retirement age, increasing pension contributions), there are massive protests (particularly from the unions).
p655
aVFact is, a significant chunk of the average Briton's tax is going to provide a level of retirement income for the previous generation that unless major reforms are made soon, they won't get themselves.
p656
aVWe're taking money from the "pension poor" and giving it to the "pension rich".
p657
aVIt's ridiculous and unfair and needs to end.
p658
aV&gt; Of course, whenever any government tries to take steps to improve things\u000a...\u000a\u000athe boomers all vote to shaft the young!\u000a
p659
aVThe vast majority of people vote primarily in their own self-interest.
p660
aVAgreed, IMHO this is totally the wrong way to think about it.
p661
aVIt's just mob rule.
p662
aVThat's all democracy will ever be.
p663
aVI don't think it has to be like that.
p664
aVPerhaps my faith in man is too high...
p665
aVExcept the working class Tory lunatics who have happily stagnated wages for them and their sprogs and will more than likely vote for them forever.

aV£40 btw is about the same money that some one unemployed under 25 gets per week for unemployment benefits.
p670
aVUnemployed 24 year old here, £57.35 a week.
p671
aVGood point.
p672
aVWe should base all decisions on MP pay and expenses on what an under-25 unemployed person gets in benefits.
p673
aVthat was not what i was saying i just thought it was an interesting contrast
p674
aVIt's a relatively open secret that during the 80's, MP's salaries were intentionally stagnated because of the state of the wider economy so as not to kick up a shit-fit.
p675
aVThis meant that they had actually *not* seen a rise for a while and with a nod and a wink it was accepted that this rise would come in the form of expenses so that their living costs were lower even if their salaries couldn't be higher.
p676
aVFast forward 25 years and you have the expenses scandal when it reality the main cause for that was the fact wages for MPs - a serious and significant a job as exists, for the most part - wasn't as high as it should have been by historic standards (thus the non-historic abuse of the expenses system). 
p677
aVSo what, we should be grateful our benevolent overlords are not taking more? 
p678
aVBe grateful?
p679
aVI dunno, feel however you like.
p680
aVI'm just explaining why the expenses system is the way it is. 
p681
aVor we could pay them a decent wage.
p682
aVThere are middle managers in the BBC who earn more money than our Prime Minister for god sake.
p683
aVHow can that be justified by anyone?
p684
aVWe do pay them a decent wage.
p685
aVThe basic annual salary for an MP is £67,060.
p686
aVThere is no excuse for struggling to survive on that and still needing to claim tax payers money to buy duck islands and decadent breakfasts.
p687
aVMaybe these people shouldn't be MP's representing society if they are so disconnected from the reality of living as a normal person on an average wage. 
p688
aVAnd it is a part time job at that level. 
p689
aV£67k in London is barely enough to afford a one bedroom flat.
p690
aVIt's not a decent wage, however much you want to spin it.
p691
aV£40 breakfast - so what.
p692
aVThat's maybe 8 cups of starbucks coffee.
p693
aVWho cares.
p694
aVIt's not going to fix our massive deficit.
p695
aVDid you know the investigation into MPs expenses cost the tax payer more than the original expenses claimed?
p696
aVWhat the hell was the point of that?
p697
aV!
aVif you earn over £60,500 a year you are in the top decile.
p698
aVhttp://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare\u000a\u000aMP's are some of the highest earners in the UK.
p699
aVThere is no reason the taxpayer should have to fund MP's decadent lifestyles as expenses whilst putting them in the highest percentage of earners.
p700
aVThey are free to go and work in the private sector if they want more money, and many of them do whilst still being MP's.
p701
aV£40 for breakfast?
p702
aVYeah I care.
p703
aVWhy should I have to fund MP's extravagant lifestyles whilst I am financially crippled with student loans and declining wages.
p704
aV£40 could feed me for a week.
p705
aVThey preach austerity for the masses and live like kings on our tax money as expenses.
p706
aVI'm all for them spending their own wages however they like.
p707
aVI live in london, earn less than them and I don't receive additional expenses for my commute, food, work clothing and the cost of living within a certain proximity of the office.
p708
aVIt doesn't matter if the investigation was expensive.
p709
aVYou are saying we should tolerate the problems in our society because it's cheaper to just accept it.
p710
aVThis is a nonsense argument.
p711
aVShould we tolerate crime because it works out cheaper than maintaining a police force? 
p712
aV&gt; if you earn over £60,500 a year you are in the top decile.
p713
aVeg you're in London.
p714
aVYou get what you pay for.
p715
aVIf you pay MPs far less money than they could earn at an equivalent job in the private sector, or even as a manager at the BBC or some town council, then you will get two types of people become MP:\u000a\u000a    1.
p716
aVIndependently wealthy people who don't care about the money.
p717
aV2.
p718
aVIncompetent people who would never get a job in the private sector.
p719
aVThat's why MPs are so ridiculously bad at the moment.
p720
aVI personally wouldn't have launched a full scale investigation into MPs expenses no.
p721
aVIf they were paid properly you wouldn't get them trying to claim everything.
p722
aVThere's probably thousands of people claiming benefits who shouldn't be - which is a *real* problem, and adds up to a large amount of money.
p723
aVUnlike some government minister claiming £40.
p724
aVCan you explain how exactly you're "crippled" by student loan?
p725
aVCome on now.
p726
aVAnd if you can't afford to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, perhaps you shouldn't live there.
p727
aVThey are paid properly.
p728
aVThey're in the top 10% of UK earners.
p729
aVTo claim 67k a year isn't being paid properly is insane.
p730
aVIt is easily enough to live in london.
p731
aVTo claim it isn't is simply nonsense.
p732
aVAlso you haven't included the people that actually want to be in politics and aspire for that to be their career.
p733
aVYou personally would have accepted our politicians taking the piss out of the taxpayer to save a couple quid.
p734
aVThat isn't how the system works.
p735
aVBy your logic all court cases are a waste of time.  
p736
aV&gt; To claim 67k a year isn't being paid properly is insane.
p737
aVIt isn't when some of them work 100+ hrs a week, no.
p738
aVSorry, but constituency meetings, surgeries, paperwork at night and travel does all count as work.
p739
aVI know numerous high end professionals that work ridiculous hours and don't make anywhere near 67k.
p740
aVDoctors, accountants, barristers.
p741
aVNone of them are in the top 10%.
p742
aVBritish army officers with oxbridge backgrounds don't make that much money as a basic salary, and not just do they do more than 100 hours a week on deployment they actually risk their lives and their work is grueling.
p743
aVThey do however get to go on into high paying jobs afterwards in the private sector, just like MP's.
p744
aV67k a year as a basic salary is extremely good.
p745
aVYou can't in any way claim they are poorly paid. 
p746
aVOne of the arguments in favour of paying MPs a decent salary is that is raises them above the level of petty corruption, as it eliminates most of the temptation and makes it pretty difficult for someone to purchase a vote outright.
p747
aVYes there are some people with less than scrupulous morals, but on the whole I do think our politics is fairly clean by global standards.
p748
aV&gt; 67k a year as a basic salary is extremely good.
p749
aVThat depends.
p750
aVIf I had to travel between - for example - a Scottish constituency and London three times a week and had to spend significant amounts of time away from my partner and young children, I probably wouldn't think that would be an overly fantastic deal to tell the truth.
p751
aVIt's not a bad salary in terms of the money, but what you have to do to earn it and the conditions that come with it aren't all that brilliant.
p752
aVObviously if an MP has to travel, like from Scotland to London, as with all professions that should be covered as an expense.
p753
aVI'm not saying they should have to cover the expenses of their professional duties.
p754
aVI'm saying when they're in the top 10% of UK earners they can pay for their own bloody breakfasts, TV's, chocolate bars and furniture.
p755
aVThere is a subsidised canteen in the houses of parliament.
p756
aVOne does not need to spend 40 quid on breakfast at the expense of the taxpayer.
p757
aVBreakfasts do not cost 40 quid in London.
p758
aVJust because expensive breakfasts are available doesn't mean they can live outside of their financial means on the tax payers money.
p759
aVThe average Brit doesn't get to spend 40 quid on breakfast, so why should MP's at our expense?
p760
aVI don't expect them to cover the costs of performing their parliamentary duties.
p761
aVI expect them to cover their personal expenses out of their personal salary like everyone else.
p762
aVIt's not the common man's responsibility to fund the bourgeois lifestyles of the Aristocracy.
p763
aVTheir working conditions are a million times better than those in many, many of other occupations.
p764
aVLots and lots of people work long hours in physically demanding conditions and make a hell of a lot less than them, and have no additional expenses paid for them.
p765
aVBeing an MP really is not as bad as you are making it out to be.
p766
aVIt requires skilled, intelligent and committed individuals, and if they are suffering under the conditions of being an MP they are in the wrong line of work, because it is pretty cushdy compared to most menial jobs.  
p767
aVIf you are travelling for work then a breakfast isn't a personal expense, it's a business expense.
p768
aVLike I say, sometimes that hotel IS the only option available when your staying in a hotel and you have a 9am meeting - that's why hotels price it accordingly, as they know that nobody is ever going to paying out of their own pocket.
p769
aVHonestly, I have no problem with this *depending on the circumstances*.
p770
aVIf you are travelling for work then it's only fair for your employer to pick up the cost, including breakfast and snacks.
p771
aVBreakfast still doesn't cost 40 quid.
p772
aVThe problem was they were abusing the system.
p773
aVIf I went on a business trip and spent 40 quid on breakfast I would get in trouble.
p774
aVObviously there are some exceptions, like a breakfast meeting in which I cover the client.
p775
aVBut still them being in London isn't a business trip, it's a regular part of their job and there is a plethora of places to buy food for a reasonable price, including in the building in which they work. 
p776
aVDo you think a boss of a local council should be paid more than the prime minister of the country?
p777
aVDon't you think the prime minister of the country should be the highest paid public sector job?
p778
aVOr do you think "head of contemporary history at the BBC" should be paid higher?
p779
aVOnly a couple of MPs were actually prosecuted for fiddling expenses.
p780
aVThe majority were just taking what they were allowed.
p781
aVSo I'm not quite sure how you make the leap that all court cases are a waste of time.
p782
aVThe MP expenses "scandal" wasn't to do with the law.
p783
aVIt was about how much MPs should be able to claim expenses for to make up for their extremely bad pay.
p784
aVThat isn't even remotely how the world works.
p785
aVIt's the same as debating the fact that soldiers are paid less than footballers.
p786
aVBeing the PM is not about getting rich, although it is practically guaranteed that all PM's will end up rich.
p787
aVAlso being the PM is not a career.
p788
aVIt's a temporary elected position.
p789
aVNo one should aspire to be the PM for the paycheque.
p790
aVIf these people want to be rich they are free to go and work in the private sector.
p791
aVYou are simply deluded if you think 67k a year is "extremely bad pay".
p792
aVBeing in the top 10% of UK earners is extremely good pay.
p793
aVAlso the expenses scandal was about the widespread misuse and abuse of the system.
p794
aVYou are stating we should allow MP's to abuse their positions because doing something about it will cost more money than they have been pocketing at the taxpayers expense.
p795
aVDid you actually follow any of it whilst it was happening?
p796
aV&gt; No one should aspire to be the PM for the paycheque.
p797
aVIf these people want to be rich they are free to go and work in the private sector.
p798
aVeg you will only get independently wealthy people, or incompetent people being PM.
p799
aVLook at singapore.
p800
aVThey pay their officials millions, which makes them un-bribable.
p801
aVThey will not take bribes, and will not do what corporations ask them to.
p802
aVThey are paid handsomely by the state, and so their only allegiance is to serve the people.
p803
aVThis obsession with what other people earn is unhealthy.
p804
aVBeing in the top 10% of UK earners isn't hard.
p805
aVYes I followed the whole sordid Guardian lead waste of time and taxpayer money.
p806
aVIt was utterly pointless.
p807
aVSomeone accidentally claimed for a porn movie at a hotel which cost the taxpayer £10.
p808
aVBig deal.
p809
aVWho the hell cares.
p810
aVYep you don't live in the real world.
p811
aVBeing in the top 10% is hard, which is why only 10% of people manage it.
p812
aVThat's how percentages work.
p813
aVIf it was easy it would be a larger percentage.
p814
aVPeople go into vocations because that is what they aspire to do.
p815
aVTo suggest we pay MP's millions is totally absurd.
p816
aVWhat you are saying is the taxpayer should have to bribe MP's with extortionate salaries so as not to accept other bribes.
p817
aVThere are lots of positions open for bribes.
p818
aVDoesn't mean they should all be paid millions.
p819
aVIt means they should be arrested if they accept them.
p820
aVYou logic is totally flawed.
p821
aVYou claimed the expenses investigation was too expensive and we should have accepted MP's abusing the system and now you are claiming they should be paid millions.
p822
aVEvidently you didn't follow the expenses scandal, as it wasn't an accidental claim for porn.
p823
aVIt was Jacqui Smith's, the former home secretary's, husband who watched two porn films and then later he and his wife claimed it as an expense, despite arguing over it.
p824
aVThy knew it was wrong and still did it.
p825
aVRich people can pay for their own bloody pornography.
p826
aVYou literally can't defend these people spending taxpayers money on frivolous things when they all make more money than 90% of the rest of the country.   
p827
aVBS.
p828
aV90% of people are lazy and can't be bothered to try.
p829
aVThey'd rather watch X factor eating turkey twizzlers and playing candy crush.
p830
aVBeing in the top 10% of anything isn't an earth shattering achievement.
p831
aVThis is why arguments involving "most people", or "average wage" etc are silly.
p832
aVIf you really think they claimed two porn films "for the money", you're extremely deluded.
p833
aVThey obviously claimed for the hotel stay, which happened to include some films, which they forgot/couldn't be bothered to put on a separate bill.
p834
aVIt's hardly crime of the century, except in the world of self righteous Guardian readers.
p835
aVAnyone can be a soldier - shoot at stuff, try not to get killed etc.
p836
aVThat's why it's low pay.
p837
aVIt's manual labour.
p838
aVBeing a footballer requires a *lot* of skill, training, fitness, work.
p839
aVThat's why it's high pay.
p840
aVOnly a few people can do it.
p841
aVI would argue that the job of prime minister of an entire nation should require some pretty unique skills, risk, hard long hours of work, ridiculous scrutiny, loss of privacy etc that should mean it's high pay.
p842
aVThe PM should at least get a comparable amount to the CEO of an average sized company.
p843
aVSay £500k or something.
p844
aVNot the laughable £142k he gets.
p845
aVI believe when Tony Blair was PM, his wife earned considerably more than him as a barrister.
p846
aVWhich is pretty messed up.
p847
aVAnyway, you get what you pay for, and we have appalling politicians, because we pay them extremely badly.\u000a
p848
aV&gt; 90% of people are lazy and can't be bothered to try.
p849
aVThere goes 100% of the credibility of your opinions.
p850
aVAlso Jacqui Smith stated she knew her husband had watched the porn movies.
p851
aVIt wasn't accidental.
p852
aVShe was angry he did it and stated they had an argument over it.
p853
aVThere are a thousand news articles on the topic.
p854
aVIf I watched porn at my employers expense I, like virtually everyone else, would lose my job.
p855
aV67k a year is not extremely bad.
p856
aVIf you think it is you don't live in the real world.
p857
aVIt's more than 90% of the country earns.
p858
aVIt's more than a Lieutenant Colonel in the army earns and they are usually of the same educated background as an MP, have had more training, and have had to spend many years getting to that position.  
p859
aVYes.
p860
aVBy the same argument those who can't make a living in a low paid job would be OK to take up theft as it's justified in the same way.
p861
aVTheir wages have stagnated over the years in exactly the same way, add the 1980s in many parts of the UK and the government in power actively took their work away and devastated economies while the rich elite got richer.\u000a\u000a
p862
aVI'm not sure how that justifies thievery.
p863
aVTaking a £40 breakfast that's allowed might be in poor taste but it's entirely "allowed" by their employers accounts department (ie IPSA).
p864
aVIf he wasn't allowed and still did it then by all means, charge him with theft (as a few of the more obtuse expenses claimants were). 
p865
aV&gt; Taking a £40 breakfast that's allowed might be in poor taste but it's entirely "allowed" by their employers accounts department (ie IPSA).
p866
aVThere often isn't really any other option in some hotels.
p867
aVThat's the price they charge for the buffet because they know that pretty much everyone staying there will be putting it on expenses.
p868
aVIf you're travelling on business and have to get up early to meet a client or to be somewhere for 9pm (and want to do your teeth and freshen up after eating) then you either take the hotel breakfast or you go hungry.
p869
aVAnd no, staying in a Travelodge is NOT an option for some meetings - not when you have to be somewhere for 9pm.
p870
aVThe problem is that your first point is general to MPs but then you have dropped to the specific to defend your point here.
p871
aVAs stated above, I wasn't making a point, merely explaining why we have the system - a generous expenses system - that we do.
p872
aVYou then suggested this justified thievery.
p873
aVI wasn't expressing a view on the rights and wrongs of this policy, but you brought up a comparison to another situation and I'm explaining why I think it's a crap comparison.
p874
aVI used the example from the OP as an indicative case. 
p875
aV&gt; a serious and significant a job as exists\u000a\u000aHysterical.
p876
aVTry spin it harder mate.
p877
aVYou'll drill right through to Australia and you can join your brain dead buddy Abbott.
p878
aV&gt; Hysterical.
p879
aVTry spin it harder mate.
p880
aVHow many hours do you think the average MP actually works per week?
p881
aVIt varies from MP to MP.
p882
aVTo claim all of them are indispensable and doing the most important job in the country is sort of nulled when one of them keels over choking on a quails egg(bought on expenses of course) and there's no ambulances to save them.
p883
aVI don't really know what you're talking about re: Abbott.
p884
aVAs for the issue, well, I dunno - these people decide what happens to the NHS, who we kill with guns and bombs, who goes to prison, what you're taught in schools.
p885
aVI'm not sure why part of this isn't serious or significant.
p886
aVIf you think they don't do a decent job or contribute sufficiently, I'd like to know how you think paying them less will help fix this. 
p887
aVI'd like you to explain why you don't think they get paid enough(in a time of austerity) and why throwing money at them will fix that problem if you don't mind.
p888
aVWell I don't really think there is much of a problem in terms of the people in parliament.
p889
aVThere are problems with our system but I'm not convinced the caliber of MP's is one of them.
p890
aVAs such, I don't really want the system to change (though I do think that their pay should be in their own hands rather than outsourced to a quango as now).
p891
aVThat said, I don't want to see the caliber of MP *decrease* so I don't want to see the wages go down either.
p892
aVPeople often look at the job with slightly rose tinted specs and ask "Do you want the sort of people who only care about money running the show?
p893
aV" But I think that's a silly question, tbh.
p894
aVNurses don't *only* care about money, but I doubt many would show up to work if they weren't paid.
p895
aVIt doesn't mean they don't care and nor is their pursuit of money a sign they're a worse nurse than altruistic ones who would give their time for free.
p896
aVUltimately, I don't care what the motives of MPs are - can they legislate well, debate well, conduct informed and police local services for their constituencies and represent them as set out in their manifestos?
p897
aVThen I don't care if they're only in it for the pension.
p898
aVI don't believe it needs to increase from where it is right now to necessarily attract the right people, but if I saw evidence that the salaries were deterring decent, qualified people and leaving us with less qualified people, I'd absolutely support raising it and I'd question the orgasmic blood-lust of anyone that disagreed tbh. 
p899
aVSo again.
p900
aVIn a time of austerity, when across the board people are taking wage cuts and generally struggling, should MPs be exempt from a pay rise freeze?
p901
aV&gt;I'd question the orgasmic blood-lust of anyone that disagreed tbh.
p902
aVI think the allegations of pedophile rings in Westminster that have been raping children for decades along with a massive recession caused by a rampantly unregulated financial sector cause bitterness.
p903
aVThe MPs aren't doing a very good job.
p904
aVPeople don't want to pay them more.
p905
aV&gt; So again.
p906
aVIn a time of austerity, when across the board people are taking wage cuts and generally struggling, should MPs be exempt from a pay rise freeze?
p907
aVBut people aren't taking wage cuts?
p908
aVWages are going up.
p909
aVAnd I said their pay shouldn't change, so I'm not sure why you're addressing me as if I said they should all be given a bonus for being jolly good fellows.
p910
aV&gt;I think the allegations of pedophile rings in Westminster that have been raping children for decades along with a massive recession caused by a rampantly unregulated financial sector cause bitterness.
p911
aVThe MPs aren't doing a very good job.
p912
aVPeople don't want to pay them more.
p913
aV"People like Coldplay and voted for the Nazis, you can't trust people Jez.
p914
aV"\u000a\u000aBut really, the people generally want low taxes, high quality public servants and their politicians to lick their boots whilst having their reputations shredded on Have I Got News For You.
p915
aVWhat the public want doesn't impact what I feel is a justified wage for people.
p916
aVThe bit you quoted there - re: blood lust - was about a payrise with the caveat that there was evidence proving that increasing it would get better MPs.
p917
aVAgain - I'm not really sure how anyone could disagree with that unless they're a) actively revengeful towards politicians to the point of harming their own interests or b) anarchists. \u000a
p918
aV&gt; The MPs aren't doing a very good job.
p919
aVI'm curious what you base that on.
p920
aVI don't know if they're doing a good job or not - I don't know how to tell how much better or worse things could have been with a different batch of MPs.
p921
aVAre you just basing that on personal experience, or something substantial?
p922
aVJust to update you, Abbott is what you'd get if you managed to clone Neanderthal Man, put him in a suit and then let Australia vote for him.
p923
aVHe's on a mission to turn Australia backwards so hard his next policy is immigration, he's only going to take British prisoners.
p924
aV&gt;13 million\u000a\u000aI'm skeptical.
p925
aVHow does she define poverty?
p926
aV&gt;I'm skeptical.
p927
aVHow does she define poverty?
p928
aVMy guess is that she took her figures from the JRF, as they're the ones claiming 13 million in Britain live in poverty:\u000a\u000a"*People are counted as being in poverty if their household income is below 60 per cent of the median (mid-point) income for all UK households*"\u000a\u000ahttp://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/MPSE2013.pdf
p929
aVWhy isn't is gauged in absolute poverty terms?
p930
aVWouldn't that make targeting the poorest for support much easier?
p931
aVFurther by doing it based on a median in theory if everyone made a million but the richest made a lot more you would eventually have millionaires who were in "poverty".
p932
aVHaving seen actual poverty in the third world I highly doubt 1/4 of the country is living like that.
p933
aVNot to say that there aren't those in dire straights, I just think we need to be real about the situation to have any chance of addressing it.
p934
aVNobody here is actually giving you the reasons why people use relative poverty as a measure, so I'll go through a few of them.
p935
aV1.
p936
aVRelative poverty gives a good measure of social exclusion.
p937
aVSocial exclusion is defined, roughly, as not being able to do the sorts of things that we expect people to be able to do in society.
p938
aV2.
p939
aVIn terms of outcomes, relative poverty is a pretty good indicator.
p940
aVYou can look at health, education, imprisonment, mortality, or whatever, and see serious declines as incomes drop too far below the median.
p941
aVThis is largely a consequence of social exclusion (see above).
p942
aV3.
p943
aVIn rich countries like the UK, there are often expectations that people should be able to maintain a standard of living that is something above baseline survival.
p944
aV4.
p945
aVRelative poverty also gives a measure of the level of community deprivation.
p946
aVThis gives a sense of the lack of resources that particular communities have to deal with problems.
p947
aV5.
p948
aVAbsolute poverty is not overly easy to determine.
p949
aVWhat defines a basic need, and how o we know whether or not people are able to fulfil them?
p950
aVWhat level of access to housing, clothing, nutrition, medicine constitutes deprivation?
p951
aVThese things are not easy to agree on, in the first instance, and equally difficult to measure.
p952
aVYou might not agree with any or all of these factors, but it pays to know the reasons that things are measured in the way they are.\u000a
p953
aVThanks for the actual answer - I think most people thought I was attacking it but was genuinely interested in understanding where it comes from.
p954
aVYour answer makes a lot of sense, I think poverty is a very evocative word, especially so for me so I always take these stats with a grain of salt.
p955
aV&gt;if everyone made a million but the richest made a lot more you would eventually have millionaires who were in "poverty"\u000a\u000aNo, you wouldn't, that's not how medians work.
p956
aVIf practically everyone made £1,000,000 but a few percent made £1,000,000,000, then the median income would still be £1,000,000 and the poverty cutoff would be £600,000.
p957
aVAre you perhaps confusing the median with the mean?
p958
aVBecause if 'everyone' made a million but the top few made *billions* - then if it were calculated on the mean your statement would be true.
p959
aVAnd that's why you don't try and pick flaws in someone's argument without reading up on the difference between mode, median and mean
p960
aVYou're right but the stat is still disingenuous.
p961
aVIf all those 13mil were earning £25k (they arent) then you shouldnt say they are in poverty.
p962
aVIf you have basic needs met then you arent in poverty, there are many people who arent but nowhere near 13 million.
p963
aV&gt;If you have basic needs met then you arent in poverty\u000a\u000aI want to be clear precisely what you mean by this, because while it sounds like "Common sense" it's actually *more* extreme than even Victorian attitudes.
p964
aVSomeone in a Workhouse has their basic needs met, but the people running those weren't quite disingenuous enough to claim they had therefore eliminated poverty.
p965
aVNot that there aren't very valid reasons to distrust the report, or the idea of "relative poverty", but in my opinion, it's not just those at the absolute bottom who are deserved of assistance.
p966
aVNot sure if comparing living standards of our worst off to that of the "third world" is really something we should be too proud of either, I think we could at least do better than that.
p967
aVI get that - however it's the word "poverty" that I take issue with.
p968
aVI'm not suggesting we let people starve and say "well they starved slower than some Africans so it's not all so bad!
p969
aV"\u000a\u000aFor me I just feel that the word poverty is bandied about with out any context in this country.
p970
aVThere is a context.
p971
aVThere's fairly solid international consensus that 60% of median income represents poverty.
p972
aVIt's not simply an arbitrary number (although an arbitrary cut-off was made at some point); the 60% figure is where the effects of poverty are generally quite acute.
p973
aVThe trouble with that number is it gets better if people in the middle get poorer.
p974
aVIf the middle fifth of the population had a chunk of their incomes transferred to the top fifth, it would lift many lower earners out of poverty.
p975
aVThat is a problem, but it doesn't play out as simply as you might think.
p976
aVWhen median incomes drop, there is a removal of demand from the economy.
p977
aVThis lowers prices in many important areas, particularly housing.
p978
aVSimilarly, many realities of society are oriented around median incomes.
p979
aVThis includes social expectations, assumptions being made by schools, stigmatisation, expectations around transport and work equipment, and endless other factors.
p980
aVIt pans out that being relatively poor is significantly problematic.
p981
aV&gt; I get that - however it's the word "poverty" that I take issue with.
p982
aVPoverty just means scarcity of material goods or wealth; if you earn less than 60% of the bottom median UK income, I would say it's fair that is considered poverty.
p983
aVStarving in Africa or destitute in India would be an extreme example of poverty, but not the only one.
p984
aVOf course there will always be those who are considered to be living in poverty by the JRF's definition, but the point is that now 20% of Britain (if we are to trust their figures) live like that.
p985
aVEdit: I see this comment has been downvoted, anyone kindly care to say why this is the case?
p986
aVIt is easy to look at absolute poverty - it makes sense - if you don't have enough calories or good enough housing you're poor.
p987
aVIt's a lot harder to look at relative poverty and look at its effect.
p988
aVThese would be things likte social/political representation.
p989
aVIt is unlikely the 'relative poor' are able to get their voice heard.
p990
aVThey can live but they can't participate fully in society.
p991
aVPeople don't want to look at these questions.
p992
aVFor me, poverty means nothing if it isn't relative.
p993
aV&gt; It is easy to look at absolute poverty - it makes sense - if you don't have enough calories or good enough housing you're poor.
p994
aVTry to define "good enough"  housing in a way that most people would agree with and you'll find it's not even actually "easy" to define absolute poverty in the first place.
p995
aVA roof and four walls?
p996
aVRunning water and a toilet?
p997
aVElectricity and heating?
p998
aVHow much space per person?
p999
aVA room for every two children?
p1000
aVOr every four children?
p1001
aVOr every child?
p1002
aVWhat if someone can't afford the heating bill because the lack of, I dunno, double glazing makes it too high?
p1003
aVDouble glazing sure doesn't sound like a minimum requirement, that's luxury, right?
p1004
aVBut then someone not being able to pay the heating bill does sound like poverty.
p1005
aVEt cetera ad infinitum.
p1006
aVI mean, I obviously agree with your broader point - but even the idea that absolute poverty *would* be easy to define isn't all that clear.
p1007
aVWell, it is not 'easy', but it is certainly easier than relative poverty when you might be measuring political inclusiveness.
p1008
aVInstead the World Bank will use a dollar a day or whatever it is currently.... a lot easier to make graphs...
p1009
aVI don't really see how pegging an absolute poverty level at, say, 1 dollar a day is easier or less arbitrary than pegging a relative poverty level at, say, 60% of the median income, as the Brits appear to do.
p1010
aVBoth are fairly arbitrary but apparently do the job. 
p1011
aVI think I'd prefer it too, if you're on JSA, you're really living week to week and can't save money for emergencies, which means if and when you're sanctioned, and people still don't get this, you're left with nothing, zero money for a minimum of three weeks.
p1012
aVTHIS is why people need food banks, why they lose hope, and despair can set in and terrible things happen.
p1013
aVThere's multiple reasons people end up on welfare, and they're often single people with no family, and no friends, and then the state decides their lives don't even have the value of JSA.
p1014
aVIt might stop people being able to think that everyone's just fine because we're not living in shanty towns in Rwanda.
p1015
aVNO, we're not living as horribly as the poor in India, but should we not be aspiring to treat our poorest better than that in a first world country that deals in trillions each year?
p1016
aV&gt; emergencies\u000a\u000aWhat emergencies would there be that welfare wouldnt pay for?
p1017
aVYour freezer / oven / bike / car breaking for example.
p1018
aVYou pop in the Jobcentre, and let them know your freezer's broken, they tend to not just issue you with a voucher for £200 and tell you to pop next door to Currys.
p1019
aV(and I wouldn't expect them to, but perhaps all the cuts to emergency short term loans, grants to help people get back into work, and all the other little cuts designed to just make it that much harder to get back on your feet...aren't really helping.
p1020
aV)
aVOf course, if you're in rented accommodation then the landlord would have to replace those ... if you're not in rented accommodation then ... lucky you :D
p1021
aVI had to supply my own oven/fridge/freezer etc when I moved in.
p1022
aVThey have the responsibility of the boiler and the bathroom stuff, but afaik that's about it.
p1023
aVBare walls and bare stone floors, and every room empty except the bathroom.
p1024
aVAlso, had me and the parents spend about half a week cleaning the walls, ceilings and repainting it to remove the layer of smoke and grease left by the last lot.
p1025
aVStill hugely grateful for a roof over my head, but you don't just get a free fully furnished flat, and you can't just snap your fingers and get a free 50" flat screen with SKY subcription thrown in either :)
p1026
aVSomeone has never lived in a council house I see.
p1027
aVIm fairly certain you can get more then just JSA that will cover those.
p1028
aVCertainly used to be 'crisis loans' and 'emergency funds', but AFAIK they've been scrapped, after all, we have Wonga now.
p1029
aV[Not that I'm suggesting the Tories would have anything to gain by pushing people into the desperation of turning to payday loan companies.
p1030
aV](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/top-tory-funder-runs-highcost-loans-company-8656356.html)
p1031
aVPicking absolute numbers is difficult.
p1032
aVIf most people in the UK made a million, prices would also reflect that.
p1033
aVThe bus would cost thousands because where do you think the million for the driver come from?
p1034
aVBread would costs thousands because that's where the baker's million comes from.
p1035
aVThe NHS would cost (I don't have words big enough) so we can pay all the nurses their millions.
p1036
aVAnd very quickly you'd find that half a million just doesn't get you far.
p1037
aVAnd while I doubt many of us are living in 3rd-world style poverty - if stereotypical old lady is at risk of dying this winter because she can't afford heating, that's poverty.
p1038
aVMaybe not muddy water and mud hut poverty, but still an embarrassing standard for what's apparently the 5th?
p1039
aV6th?
p1040
aVlargest economy in the world.
p1041
aVSeriously.
p1042
aVLet that sink in.
p1043
aVWe are one of the largest economies in the world - and we're predicted to climb a few more rungs yet.
p1044
aVNow look around you?\u000a
p1045
aVAbsolute poverty is often used in studies, but absolute poverty by any measure has been always declining, and that's no use to attack your political opponents. 
p1046
aVAbsolute poverty may be declining, but relative poverty, globally and within many countries, is rising.
p1047
aVWhat is the effect of relative poverty?
p1048
aVIs it possible for a relatively poor person to properly engage in social decisions?
p1049
aVDo they have as much of a voice as the rich?
p1050
aVThat is where the problem comes.
p1051
aVI agree that reducing income inequality is beneficial.
p1052
aVBut you're deceptively using poverty to describe income inequality.
p1053
aVIf a minority (business owners) control resources, technology or the means to communicate it would obviously affect poor people's ability to shape and control their society.
p1054
aVPoverty is about power and income is a relatively good indicator of someone's power.
p1055
aV&gt;Why isn't is gauged in absolute poverty terms?
p1056
aVWouldn't that make targeting the poorest for support much easier?
p1057
aVBecause JRF, those who quote that figure like Ms. Yaqoob, and other organisations who use similar measures and call it "poverty" are much more interested in engaging in misleading political point scoring against the government than caring about the welfare of people in real poverty who can't provide for basic needs like food, water, heating and shelter.
p1058
aVIt's not often that I feel confident speaking in absolute statements when it comes to politics, but I am 100% confident in this; Never trust anyone who uses such measures and calls it "poverty" instead of a measure related to inequality.
p1059
aVThey have ulterior motives that don't include the welfare of the truly poor.
p1060
aV&gt; than caring about the welfare of people in real poverty who can't provide for basic needs like food, water, heating and shelter.
p1061
aVThe report considers any single person earning less than £128 per week, or £357 for a couple and two children to be in poverty (after housing costs are deducted).
p1062
aVWe could argue whether this counts as poverty or not, but I still think that's going to make living extremely difficult, especially if it's in London, even with access to basic amenities. 
p1063
aVOutside London that is a very livable wage.
p1064
aVThat might not be true in London, but in that case you should move.
p1065
aVAfter you take away costs of food, clothing, personal hygiene, transport, and non-household bills (like phones), there's next to nothing for savings left.
p1066
aVYes, it's theoretically possible, but even with the absolute tightest controls on spending and nothing on leisure.
p1067
aVAs for moving, that's not always going to be an option for everyone.
p1068
aV&gt;After you take away costs of food, clothing, personal hygiene, transport, and non-household bills (like phones), there's next to nothing for savings left.
p1069
aVNot really no.
p1070
aVIm not even sure why you brought up savings, presumably its for when they retire, but give them extra money on welfare (which in all likelihood theyll just spend anyway) and not just raise the pensions fund?
p1071
aV&gt;Not really no.
p1072
aVCare to show how this was worked out?
p1073
aVFood and transport alone could realistically alone make up much more than half of £130.
p1074
aVYes, £130 is possible to live off (the poor aren't by and large, dying in the streets), but looking at the ONS figures on average monthly expenditures, it's not much more than just living.
p1075
aVRemember, it is still £130 *or less* that counts as poverty, and London isn't the only expensive place to live in the UK.
p1076
aVAs for savings, no, I did not mean pensions, I meant savings for rainy-days, emergencies, financial security and future spendings.
p1077
aVIf your budget can't even allow for a measly £50 or so a month, that there is something you need to address.
p1078
aVYay for relative poverty, the idea the left had when they finally realized nobody cares about income inequality. 
p1079
aVThose damned Liberals trying to make us notice the peasants!
p1080
aVOr, those damned lefties trying to mislead people by re-branding income inequality as poverty, giving us numbers which bear no real relation to actual poverty.
p1081
aVI am living in poverty at the moment.
p1082
aVI'm telling you that from my laptop, because I just turned off my main pc, so I could get into bed in my reasonably comfortable house in a decent neighborhood.
p1083
aVBecause poverty, as defined by the lefties you deride, references median incomes, you can have increasing increasing inequality while poverty decreases.
p1084
aVIndeed, where high incomes increase, low incomes remain static, and median incomes decrease, you would expect this to happen.
p1085
aVEven as someone whos left, I think those statistics are skewed.
p1086
aVBeing below average doesn't mean you're impoverished
p1087
aV&gt; Being below average doesn't mean you're impoverished\u000a\u000aWhich is okay, because that's not the measure they used.
p1088
aVThis is the measure they used:\u000a\u000a&gt;  People are counted as being in poverty if their household income is below 60 per cent of the median (mid-point) income for all UK households.
p1089
aVGiven that median income is well below the mean, which is what is usually meant by 'average', and given we are talking about incomes significantly below the median, suggesting that the measure of poverty is what is 'below average' is a misrepresentation.
p1090
aVWhich is an absolutely batshit crazy measure of poverty.
p1091
aVExplain? 
p1092
aVpoverty should be defined in absolute terms - do you have the money to eat, clothe, shelter or not.
p1093
aV"poverty" in the UK is more like 'are you able to keep up with the joneses?
p1094
aV" "Do you have an ipad?
p1095
aV" etc.
p1096
aVIt's obscene.
p1097
aVThe left is absolutely obsessed with the rich, as if the rich being richer has some detrimental impact on their own lives.
p1098
aVIt doesn't.
p1099
aVThe gap between rich and poor is irrelevant if everyone is better off than previous generations, which we undoubtedly are.
p1100
aVAbsolute poverty is certainly the more important, but /u/MasterEk explained quite well why relative poverty is still important: \u000a\u000ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2rc8fe/on_austerity_in_the_uk/cneoeis\u000a\u000aSimply put, relative poverty is the standard and living and income far lower than those sitting in the middle of income distribution, to the point that excludes them from normal and expected patterns of living standards.
p1101
aVIpad is only a toy, but not being able to afford a computer and internet connection would only make it harder to find work or communicate with friends and family.
p1102
aVSure, I could live like a monk; without internet access, transportation, wear a hair shirt and eat only bread and water - and still be better off than I would be in 1200.
p1103
aVBut there isn't any reason why someone should be expected to live like that today.
p1104
aVThere will always be relative poverty, but if the JRF report is correct, that's 13 million people (or 20% of the population) who aren't even on 60% of the median income, the demographics is skewed too heavily on low income households. 
p1105
aVWe have different definitions of poverty then.
p1106
aVPoverty is not being able to eat, shelter or clothe yourself.
p1107
aVIt's not about if you're got an internet connection or not.
p1108
aVComparing yourself to the rest of society is simply "keeping up with the jonses" and a pretty pointless way to live.
p1109
aV&gt; We have different definitions of poverty then.
p1110
aVThe definition employed in the report is the same one used by the UK government, EU and other charities, it's not as if it was plucked right  out of thin air:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.poverty.org.uk/summary/social%20exclusion.shtml\u000a\u000a&gt;Poverty is not being able to eat, shelter or clothe yourself.
p1111
aVIf we are going by dictionary definitions, it just means "the state of being extremely poor", of which could just easily apply to either absolute or relative definitions of poverty.
p1112
aVLike I said, internet connection would make a good indication of poverty; not all family households without internet is poor, but poor households are less likely to have one.
p1113
aVAnd in either case, they are going to be at a relative disadvantage to those with. 
p1114
aV1st world problems really isn't it.
p1115
aVNo one's starving or having to walk 20 miles to get water.
p1116
aVWhat does an internet connection mean?
p1117
aVIt means the ability to spread your views, integrate yourself into social decision-making and get your voice heard.
p1118
aVMaybe 'poverty' should mean consumption, but really it should be a measure of your power within society.
p1119
aVDemocracy can't possibly work if one person has the economic power of 100.
p1120
aVRegardless of whether the 'poor' are getting enough calories, have adequate housing, or in fact, an internet connection.
p1121
aVThe key UK government measures take 60 per cent of median income as the poverty line.
p1122
aVAh, good old "relative poverty" - if the average family can afford two holidays a year, you are now officially poor if you can only afford one.
p1123
aVAlso, free time to vote, socialise, spread your ideas and agitate.... shouldn't be allowed that.
p1124
aVThe average British family can afford two holidays a year?
p1125
aVYou are right to be skeptical.
p1126
aVIn the UK, Poverty is defined relative to the average wage, which means there will *always* be a percentage of people living in "poverty", even if they aren't actually poor, especially by global standards.
p1127
aVDefining poverty in this way gives lefties something to unnecessarily kick up a fuss about, even though there were probably similar numbers of people in "poverty" under Labour.
p1128
aVIndeed, the biggest driver of the increase in poverty has probably been mass immigration from poor Eastern European countries within the EU. 
p1129
aVThat's not true.
p1130
aVGet better at maths.
p1131
aVIt is possible to have a distribution of income where there is no relative poverty.
p1132
aVIf the poverty rate is 60% of the median income then it is of course possible to have half the population between 60%-100% of median income.
p1133
aVSo if you killed off (for sake of argument) people at the top-end of the income scale, you'd improve the stats for those in relative poverty, as the median shifts downward?
p1134
aVThe median would likely shift downward in that situation, but not by as much as you'd imagine.
p1135
aVYou might be thinking of mean averages (where that shift would be more pronounced), whereas this measure uses median.
p1136
aVAs the richest several percent are dramatically richer than average (i.e.
p1137
aVthere are a very small number of millionaires and the gap between millionaire and average is much larger than between minimum wage and average), you could remove the top few percent without median being affected much or at all.
p1138
aVQuick GCSE refresher.
p1139
aVMedian works by lining everyone up in a row in order, counting exactly halfway along the row, and taking that middle person's value as the average.
p1140
aVImagine you had 100 people, the middle 60 earned £30k, the lowest 35 earned £10k, and the top 5 earned £1m.
p1141
aVThe median (the 50th person) would be £30k.
p1142
aVIf you remove the top 5%, the new median (the 47th person in our now shorter line) would still be £30k.
p1143
aVObviously that's over simplified, but the principle is correct.
p1144
aVEdit: I meant to include mean figures for the same sample set to illustrate the difference.
p1145
aVThe mean for the original set of 100 people would be a much larger £71.5k.
p1146
aVThe mean for the reduced 95 person set would be £22.6k.
p1147
aVThis shows that the mean is both far more volatile and a less realistic representation of reality (our original "average" is twice or more than what 95% of people earn).
p1148
aVAusterity in principle is a ridiculous economic concept to begin with.
p1149
aVAttempting to reduce the deficit while still undergoing economic difficulty, or before growth has even returned, is nothing short of economically suicidal.
p1150
aVAs opposed to shrinking, cutting spending and investment the state need to provide stimulus to the economy by devaluing the currency, investing in infrastructural investment projects thereby catalysing economic activity, boosting business confidence and in turn coercing private enterprise to invest and drive the economy out of a crisis.
p1151
aVBy shrinking the state does itself no favours, a lack of intervention on its behalf results in a blow to business and investor confidence thereby making companies more reluctant to invest and take on new workers.
p1152
aVIt's unreasonable to assume that private enterprise will pick up where the state has left off, it hasn't worked in the Eurozone and it never will.
p1153
aV&gt; devaluing the currency\u000a\u000aThat means taking money out of savings and assets (i.e., houses).
p1154
aVThat's not likely to go down well.
p1155
aVIt would make more sense, if that's the road they're going down, to either raise a one-time tax or increase income tax.
p1156
aVIt's also a pretty serious issue for anyone holding British debt (i.e., all other countries) - people don't like it when you just decide arbitrarily to pay them less back than they expected.
p1157
aVAnd when your country is dependent on selling debt (as we are) to fund the public sector, we really need confidence to be high that we will repay money.
p1158
aVCurrency devaluation would be [utterly catastrophic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso_crisis#Economic_impacts).
p1159
aV&gt; investing in infrastructural investment projects thereby catalysing economic activity\u000a\u000aThere's a strong argument that this is a good thing.
p1160
aVI think they probably should be doing this - perhaps a huge new social housing project, which would also help with the housing shortage.
p1161
aVUnfortunately, you do need to find some money to do this in the first place, and our deficit is already eye-watering.
p1162
aV&gt; boosting business confidence\u000a\u000aThat's more or less what austerity does.
p1163
aVIt boosts confidence for people investing in the UK, either through bonds or through business.
p1164
aVYou're sending a message that, even if times are tight, we'll bear the brunt and make sure we pay our debts.
p1165
aVAusterity is all about confidence.
p1166
aVI'd guess that we have two choices - levy a tax, or wait for economic growth.
p1167
aVI think a tax, probably a one-time progressive tax (maybe on property?
p1168
aV), is probably the sensible choice, with the money going exclusively to infrastructure investment.
p1169
aVBut that's not going to be a popular option, and will kill whatever party puts it into place.
p1170
aVAnd will likely prompt a flight of wealth out of the UK.
p1171
aVAnd a lot of households are just scraping by, so that would likely push them under.
p1172
aVSo ...
p1173
aVI guess ... it's complicated.

p1181
aVnot quite http://chrisbrosnahan.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/iain-duncan-smith-and-scrounger.html
p1182
aVThat that blog shows, to me, is the minister in charge of the DWP doing his job, answering questions about it and the papers running the story with 'scroungers' in the title.
p1183
aVThe blog suggests he should be complaining to the papers about their own narrative.
p1184
aVSo to follow that to its natural conclusion would such bloggers not take issue with cabinet ministers attempting to dictate how they should be reporting on?
p1185
aVOf course they would.
p1186
aVContrary twats.
p1187
aVperhaps because as has been pointed out the major issue with benefits is not people taking 'unfair' advantage of the system (ie scroungers) and the issue is quite a tougher question that cannot be summed up in a sound byte.
p1188
aVwhere the people on benefits are very very rarely to blame.
p1189
aVhowever the minister is happy to allow this misconception to not only hold but actively promote it as it give him excuses to cut more and more as people suffer while avoiding the real problems with low wages in both the private and public sector.
p1190
aVthat IMO makes him a bit of a twat.
p1191
aVIt's pretty clear to anyone with eyes or ears that that's what he thinks of people on benefits.
p1192
aVArguing over the semantics of what he has or hasn't said doesn't mean she's wrong. 
p1193
aVYou cant just make stuff up and claim you're "reading between the lines".
p1194
aVI don't need to read between IDS's lines. 
p1195
aVSure I can - I just did it.
p1196
aVJoking aside, why IDS making it so hard for people to get benefits?
p1197
aVWhy is he forcing people to go on courses that achieve nothing?
p1198
aVWhy is he forcing people to apply for jobs that they don't want to or physically cannot do?
p1199
aVWhy are there so many sanctions?
p1200
aVWhy are so many sanctions being appealed?
p1201
aVIt's because IDS thinks there is a significant portion of people on benefits who are not entitled to them, not deserving of them or not working hard enough for them.
p1202
aVThat's close enough to the definition of a "scrounger" for me. 
p1203
aV&gt; Arguing over the semantics of what he has or hasn't said doesn't mean she's wrong.
p1204
aVPutting words in his mouth isn't "semantics".
p1205
aVShe claims he "happily labels the poor people as 'scroungers'": a serious accusation she makes no attempt to substantiate. 
p1206
aVYou're just making stuff up, right?
p1207
aVSalma says that 50% of benefit claimants are pensioners (by definition out of work) and that another 50% are in work.
p1208
aVThat makes 100%.
p1209
aVIs she really suggesting that there are no out of work but non-retired benefit claimants?
p1210
aVOr is something wrong with my maths? \u000a
p1211
aVProbably poorly worded, but I would interpret that as 50% are pensioners, and 50% (of the rest) are in work.
p1212
aVthat leave 25% or total claimants now remove the short term unemployed and those receiving disability benefit and those working as carers for relatives, i am assuming the 50% in work also includes people who have children and are receiving some form of child benefit.
p1213
aVand you are left with very few scroungers, a lot less than people like the daily mail would want you to think.
p1214
aVWell the definition of a pensioner isn't someone who is out of work.
p1215
aVSo it theoretically could be the case that those two bouts of 50% are one and the same group of people.
p1216
aVObviously they aren't, but there's nothing impossible about there being an overlap. 
p1217
aVI had the same thought.
p1218
aVEven if you consider that pensioners might take on work to supplement the pensions (which have been utterly plundered by the Government and companies) it hardly seems to make enough room for claimants of working age.
p1219
aVThe fall in pension schemes has to do with the fact that pensions cost many times more than they used to on account of people living longer - so the pots have been drained dry.
p1220
aVThat, the Gov allowing pensions holidays during the good times and Gordon Brown quietly introducing taxation on them.

p1227
aVAnyways, it's surely just a temporary spike while it's highly visible, there's high voted comments.

p1249
aVThe thing about 'hard-working' is that it's a qualitative (and relative) measure, so it can mean pretty much anything.
p1250
aVThe man who works a 60-hour week and receives a generous salary sounds like he works hard.
p1251
aVBut what about the man who works a 60-hour week in a mine and receives fuck-all.

p1254

aVUnbelievable that people should have to explain simple market economics on here. 
p1284
aVI'm simply maintaining that it's absolutely balls, the continued use of 'hardworking' when it doesn't really mean anything except the gentle massage of people's ego while he's slipping it in from behind.
p1285
aVOF course I understand how it works.
p1286
aVI'm just suggesting we stop promoting the myth that anyone who's not successful just isn't hardworking enough.

aVYeah that's the thing, salary doesn't dictate how hard you work or how hard you studied.
p1288
aVI mean look at the remuneration people in finance get.

p1300
aVthis is a very small problem within the system and the truth is much more complex that we could be having constructive argument about.
p1301
aVbut for the minister it is easier to push the 'scroungers' narrative (of course he will never actually use the word when its so easy to insinuate), while cutting more and more , and implementing more red tape that attack the weakest in society as people struggle (such as the massively misjudged changes to disability allowance saving us almost nothing after costs and cause a lot of distress for many people), with out have to address the real problems of both public and private sector wages being well under the true cost of living.

p1304

aVExcept he doesn't label the poor as scroungers, claiming for breakfast sounds quite legitimate; and since it's unlikely he chose that hotel we can't really blame him for the price, and the £1.5 million in taxpayer money goes to the Swanbourne Estate as part of EU farming subsidies that *reduce food prices for the poor*, and it isn't even his wife's estate (she's a trustee, not an owner).
p1310

p1318
aVI know people who live on much less.
p1319
aVYes, I find the idea of this overweight, bald headed scrotal sack claiming more than my weekly food budget on one sodding meal and charging it back to the tax payer ludicrously offensive.
p1320
aVHave you ever been obliged to stay at a hotel as part of your job?
p1321
aVIf you were then would you expect your employer to also pay for breakfast?
p1322
aVBut I guess you're slim with a full head of hair so different rules apply. 
p1323
aVYes and they do.
p1324
aVOnly I am not getting paid £67,000 a year for a part time job, I am not a multi millionaire and I am obliged not to eat at 4 and 5 star hotels for a living.
p1325
aVIt is ludicrous to compare.
p1326
aVYou still cost your employer several days worth of your food budget if you get the hotel breakfast.

aVIf you're a busy person, what are you more likely to do, carefully sort through all of your expenses and which will then go for assessment for eligibility, or just dump all expenses on the bean-counters who make the assessment and save yourself some bother?
p1344
aVThat's how you get people making claims for things like duck houses which would never be approved and the people making the claim know that they wouldn't be approved.
p1345
aVIf my accounts department would allow me to dump receipts on them and they'd take care of the rest, that's what I'd do, bloody hate doing expenses.
p1346
aVThat is not to say that the expense system was not used as a pay-rise by the back door, or that some MPs did not take advantage of the system way beyond the spirit and at times the letter of the law.
p1347
aVHowever using a cost that was never incurred as the basis for an attack is utterly disingenuous and detracts from all other arguments because it demonstrates bad faith.

aVIf you're going to attack him, do it on the grounds on the subsidised bars in parliament, on the expensive lunches they are allowed to claim which are also subsidised by the tax payer.
p1353
aVThere's no need to make piss-poor, disingenuous arguments when MPs do have their noses deep in the trough and the whole system leans to their benefit.
p1354
aVNo, we attack them on all of those, including this ridiculous £39 breakfast. 
p1355
aV&gt;duck houses which would never be approved\u000a\u000aDidn't the duck house get approved?
p1356
aVI don't believe so.
p1357
aVIt was marked "Unallowable" or some such but the press said that there was no concrete proof that it had not been paid - because proving a negative is such an easy thing to do, especially when no one anticipates the need.
p1358
aVNo, he intended to claim for the breakfast.
p1359
aVHe just didn't actually get any money.
p1360
aV...that's what I said?
p1361
aVHe doesn't get off the hook just because he didn't get away with it
p1362
aV[deleted]
p1363
aVI don't know anyone in my company who would behave that way.
p1364
aVI think you'll find that most people are more honest and honourable than that.
p1365
aVUmm me?
p1366
aVWhen I do fieldwork I get to claim £50 a day for sustinence and I just have to write down what I spent.
p1367
aVI literally only claim for bare essential food and drink because I have to buy ready to eat stuff as opposed to cook my own food which is much cheaper.
p1368
aVIf I go for beers later, I pay myself, even though technically I can claim the tab for networking with the other researchers.
p1369
aVI could just say "I spent £50 every day eating at resturaunts, and spent £20 on taxis and took the workers to the bar and spent £30 on a round for them" and that money would go into my account, no questions, no enquiry.
p1370
aVI don't ask for the money because it's not mine. 
p1371
aVAnd, of course, the kicker is that the money he was trying to claim actually *is* yours (well, all of ours).
p1372
aVYup.
p1373
aVTechnically Im funded by a research council so mine is public cash too.
p1374
aVMe too!
p1375
aVI'm also a researcher and funded by a research council.
p1376
aVI always try to buy the cheapest train tickets, stay in budget hotels, avoid taxis if I can and don't take the piss on food &amp; drink (most of my expenses claims are boots/sainsburys meal deals), although I have claimed for a pint on occasion.
p1377
aVI know the money I'm funded by comes from public funds and I feel it is my duty to get the best value for that money.
p1378
aVI had to buy a fairly high end workstation recently and took a little time to bargain with the supplier in order to keep the budget sane - I know plenty of others who just accept the first quote they get (I'd have spent £3000 more if I'd done that...).
p1379
aVYeah I spent 3 weeks (which was maybe too long) reducing the costs of my supplies for the lab.
p1380
aVIn the end I brought it down about £300.... which when you take into account my wages was probably wasting cash... but the university hadn't had any discounts with them yet, so hopefully in the long run this will help.
p1381
aVukpolitics sciencecrew ASSEMBLEEEEE \u000a\u000a    *blows bugle*
p1382
aVI have no research costs, as I sit in a dark room on my computer all day. 
p1383
aVWhat is it you do that requires a £3000 workstation?
p1384
aVJust wondering.
p1385
aVI'm doing research into solving inverse imaging problems and electromagnetic problems.
p1386
aVMostly high-order finite element methods for the bulk of it, which I write code (C++ and MATLAB for testing) for.
p1387
aVIt basically boils down to iterations of very large linear algebra problems, so I need lots of memory and a quick CPU (or several CPUs - although the parallel stuff is probs a year away).
p1388
aVThe idea is to recover information about an object in terms of it's electromagnetic properties based only on measurements you take using electro-magnets e.g.
p1389
aVif you want to detect an iron object inside something you know it'll be highly conductive, etc.
p1390
aVI've got access to much larger machines, but this is a lot more useful for testing and development than having to use time on a cluster.
p1391
aVI was going to say, I would have thought working on a cluster would have been easier/cheaper for most purposes.
p1392
aVI have access to a departmental cluster and we have a HPC cluster if the department cluster isn't fast enough (although I have limited time on that).
p1393
aVI do most of my work on there. 
p1394
aVYeah, there are arguments for it but I need so much memory and I when I'm developing the code I don't really want to sit in a PBS queue waiting while twiddling my thumbs!
p1395
aVThe grant had money set aside for it and I got pretty good value for money given that they'd basically budgeted for something fairly weak in the proposal.
p1396
aVI'm allowed to claim £15 a day for my lunch.
p1397
aVI get a £3 meal deal from the Co-op.
p1398
aVOne time I got a Nando's and felt like I was taking the piss so didn't do it again.
p1399
aVExactly the same, I'd be embarrassed personally to spend to the expenses limit just because I could, even more so if I was a public servant.
p1400
aVTrouble is, he sees everyone in the light he sees himself in, which means he thinks everyone's out to fuck the system for every penny they can get.
p1401
aVEDIT: I remember getting a £10 lunch allowance on a training course on a job, and while I admit I went 'large' in BK, I still used a voucher and spent about £5, I could have spent a tenner I'm sure but I'd have felt like I was taking advantage for the sake of it.
p1402
aVLast time I was at a conference I decided to sleep on the floor of a friend's living room rather than claim for a hotel.
p1403
aVNot everyone's out to grab as much as they can.
p1404
aVI pity you for having such a grim view of humanity.
p1405
aV*\u000a''I'm a bit of a prick so everyone else must be too, they all just pretend to be nice in public so they can get what they want''*\u000a\u000aama rite r ama rite?

aV&gt; Find me someone who does not try to push work expenses to the limit and you may have a point.
p1407
aV\u005c*Raises hand*
p1408
aVI've done a lot of travelling and I've had a lot of food on expenses as part of my academic travels.
p1409
aVIt would take serious effort for me to spend £40 on breakfast.
p1410
aVI would probably not be able to move afterwards.
p1411
aVhttp://www.roast-restaurant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/breakfast-menu-web1.pdf\u000a\u000aOne of those, a couple of coffees and 12.5% service charge should do it.\u000a
p1412
aVYeah, I am not sure a restaurant with a website that slick and a page entitled "Our Philosophy" is really the example to use.
p1413
aVWhilst I appreciate he could've gone to a greasy spoon, it's not atypical for somewhere to go for a breakfast meeting, especially for someone of the stature of a cabinet minister.
p1414
aVI picked that one as I've had AM meetings over bacon and eggs in there myself, and I'm no one special. 
p1415
aVIt is a bit different when it is a pool of finite public money, i.e.
p1416
aVit gets taken from someone that actually needs it - the money doesn't appear out of thin air.
p1417
aVSimple, we take the money from G4S, ATOS, Maximus, Avanta, and dozens of other shitty private companies providing less than zero value to taxpayers, and use that.
p1418
aVGlad to help.
p1419
aVPrivate money is finite too. 
p1420
aVLiberals don't understand this.
p1421
aV&gt; When and who did he call scroungers?
p1422
aVI googled "Iain Duncan Smith scroungers" and all I got in return was click-baity web articles going back to the video clip from Question Time.
p1423
aVAs far as I can tell, IDS had never used that term in public.
p1424
aVIt was a cheap but effective sound-bite.
p1425
aV[deleted]
p1426
aVHe was telling the truth, he's hit the middle classes, the low paid and those on welfare instead.
p1427
aVI agree, trouble is, with IDS, it's not about what he says, but what he does.
p1428
aVHe strips away benefits from the most vulnerable, and then claims he's 'encouraging them back to work'.
p1429
aVHe's spent SO much taxpayer money on all manner of various ways to ensure that that money doesn't reach those in need, but instead gets siphoned off to incompetent private companies.
p1430
aVHe's not daft, but he IS a sociopath with no empathy for the the race of humans his kind shares a planet with.
p1431
aV&gt; he IS a sociopath with no empathy for the the race of humans his kind shares a planet with.
p1432
aVWow, you went off the deep end kind of fast there didn't you.
p1433
aVThere is no universal agreement on the effect of providing welfare to people long-term.
p1434
aVNo country has unemployment support, housing support, and so on, completely worked out.
p1435
aVThe aim is to provide help for those in need, but not to have a system that allows people to simply not bother trying to work.
p1436
aVThe perception, right or wrong, is that there are a lot of people not bothering.
p1437
aVSo the politicians are fighting over them.
p1438
aVBecause there's an election coming up.
p1439
aVSo, Tories are saying that the scrounging should be prevented, and Labour are painting that as an attack on anybody claiming benefits.
p1440
aVPerhaps Labour think there are no scroungers and everybody who has ever claimed benefits is doing everything in their power to find work?
p1441
aVPerhaps the Tories think everybody claiming is a scrounger who actually has a job and is just claiming on the side, or a family of 12 kids and never worked a day?
p1442
aVOr, perhaps, both are actually somewhere in the middle, and are both aiming to improve the system, and in doing so improve the standard of living for everybody.
p1443
aVThe problem with politics, at least at the moment (and typified by your post), is that people seem incapable of assuming good faith from anybody they disagree with.
p1444
aVTry that for a bit - try understanding that there's more than one point of view, and that yours isn't necessarily automatically correct just because it's yours.
p1445
aVOh indeed, I realise there's a minority that are taking the piss, but sadly, the measures taken to deal with them, they easily dance around the checks, while it hits those claiming honestly.
p1446
aVIt's mainly the things IDS has done just don't seem to have any basis in economics or common sense, they tend to just be designed to make life harder for people just trying to get by.
p1447
aVWe don't need more pressure on people to find work, we need more assistance to help people find work, and in the end, either more work, or an acceptance that full an employment is a thing of the past.
p1448
aVEDIT: In short, he's convinced that everyone not working is choosing that way of life, and if you've been on JSA in the last few years, you'd be so crazy to choose that, that you'd not pass a mental health assessment by ATOS.
p1449
aVIn the end, not enough paid work, too many people, it's generally not a simple case of 'lazy people who just need to be punished into getting a job'.
p1450
aVI admit I can't help but be genuinely angry at the things IDS has done as I see the effects of what he's done, and it's clear it's not helping anyone, and to me it's purely being done ideologically and to sate the nastier urges of the Daily Mail demographic.
p1451
aV&gt; The perception, right or wrong, is that there are a lot of people not bothering.
p1452
aVAre you confusing cause an effect?
p1453
aVDoes this perception originate with the general public, or has it been fed to the public by right-wing media anxious to support government policy?
p1454
aV&gt; Does this perception originate with the general public, or has it been fed to the public by right-wing media anxious to support government policy?
p1455
aVThe idea that people claiming jobseekers or housing benefit are sometimes (or often) scroungers is not new.
p1456
aVWhen there are cuts, welfare becomes a controversial topic.
p1457
aVI have no idea when that originated, but it's not a recent addition to political discussion.
p1458
aVIf a government applies cuts everywhere it can, at some point it's going to try to cut welfare.
p1459
aVWhether that's through efficiency, removing management, closing branches, or reducing payments, every government tries it.
p1460
aVAs it happens, Labour did most of that, except reducing payments, in 2004-2006, as part of the "Efficiency Savings Programme" - closed lots of branches, reduced management, etc.
p1461
aVAnd I think you have the media backwards.
p1462
aVRight-wing media aims to sell papers to right-wing readers.
p1463
aVThey are going to write stories that reinforce the views of their target audience, and they are going to use headlines that entice those people to buy.
p1464
aVExactly the same as the left-wing media.
p1465
aVThat's how you end up with the right wing media headline "migrants cost £120bn" and left wing headline "migrants contribute £20bn" - for the exact same story, and the exact same figures.
p1466
aVI'd agree that the phenomen isn't new.
p1467
aVIt was definitely active during the Thatcher years, and I wouldn't be surprised if it dates back to the 1930s or earlier.
p1468
aVHowever I'd disagree with your assertion that right wing newspapers sell exclusively to right-wing readers.
p1469
aVIn particular I'd suggest that the average "Sun" reader is probably either apathetic, or centrist politically, although the paper is definitely right wing.
p1470
aVEven more blatantly right wing newspapers, still don't have an exclusively right wing readership.
p1471
aVFor example [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/05/sun-labour-newspapers-support-elections#zoomed-picture) points out that in 2005, 38% of Daily Mail readers who voted chose either Labour or Liberal Democrat. 
p1472
aV&gt; However I'd disagree with your assertion that right wing newspapers sell exclusively to right-wing readers.
p1473
aVSo would I, and that's lucky because it wasn't an assertion that I made.
p1474
aVGood point.
p1475
aVI guess I read your post too quickly.
p1476
aVMay I instead suggest that "aiming to sell to right-wing readers" isn't the only motivation behind right wing headlines?
p1477
aVSometimes these newspapers are pushing an agenda prompted by either their owners, or their advertisers?
p1478
aVI'd also suggest that sometimes the influence is more subtle.
p1479
aVRight wing owners tend to appoint and promote journalists and editors with right wing views.
p1480
aVThis means that these right-wing views are automatically pushed, without any day-to-day oversight.
p1481
aVSelling newspapers isn't the only motivation.
p1482
aVSure, there's probably a bit of that too.
p1483
aVIt's not exclusive to right wing media though, that's common to all media. 
p1484
aVthis is government not a for profit organisation.
p1485
aVperhaps they should be allowed the same lunch allowance as state school students.
p1486
aVhttp://chrisbrosnahan.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/iain-duncan-smith-and-scrounger.html\u000a\u000ahe certainly pushes that narrative.
p1487
aV&gt; this is government not a for profit organisation.
p1488
aVperhaps they should be allowed the same lunch allowance as state school students.
p1489
aVAnd it would seem the fees office agreed with you and the expense was turned down.
p1490
aVWhether Iain submitted it maliciously or (I believe more likely) included it as part of a wad of monthly receipts for his PA to enter into the system, the checks and balances in place have done their job.
p1491
aVI can say hand on heart that I've worked for many companies where the staff with assistants don't bother entering their own expenses - their PAs do - and that in most situations something like this would get rubber-stamped anyway.

aVI understand where you're coming from, but in this case u/ProfessorZOOM literally did nothing but an ad hominem.
p1502
aVIf you want to be technical, he didn't because he didn't make an argument.
p1503
aVIf I wanted to be technical, I'd argue that there was an implied argument being made, and that it was an ad hominem.
p1504
aVI feel that that's largely the point.
p1505
aVIt's a passive-aggressive way to tell someone they're being a dick.
p1506
aVIt's not passive-aggressive.
p1507
aVIt's explicitly critical.

aVYou'd have a point if he did anything in his reply but an ad hominem.

aVI fucking hate all of you and anyone else on reddit who thinks its ok to link these 'logical fallacies'.
p1520

p1523
aV***It is fucking impossible to reply to a point without breaking half a dozen of these 'rules'***.
p1524
aVStop it, stop it right now.
p1525
aVYou might hate logical fallacies and everyone on Reddit who uses them, but they're a useful tool to measure the correctness and intellectual honesty of a person's argument.
p1526
aVPeople who are interested in having honest debates (which is an art in of itself and within exists the idea of logic as a form of rhetoric) find it frustrating and somewhat difficult trying to argue against a flawed argument that has not been reached through a correct and logical thought process.
p1527
aVPossibly even as much as you find their logic intolerable.
p1528
aVHighlighting the existence of a fallacy and therefore putting the opposition in the position of justifying why their original argument should be considered at all is a perfectly reasonable thing to do if having honest debates is something we're interested in.
p1529
aVNo, people use them as a snide, condescending way to kill debate.
p1530
aVPeople forget about the argument and start arguing about whether they were 'appealing to authority' or asking 'loaded questions'.
p1531
aVExactly what happened above and is happening consistently now that people are learning about more of these 'fallacies'.
p1532
aVPlease pull your head out of your arse.
p1533
aVYou are not the shining beacon of logic that you think you are.
p1534
aVYour past comments are all the same; telling the other person that they are ignorant about the topic whilst  bigging yourself up as a rational genius.

aVYou're not here to debate, you're here to feed your precious little ego.
p1536
aV/u/TinyMarsh master of logic and expert in the art of debate!
p1537
aVHooray!
p1538
aVAnd by the way, assuming a argument is invalid because a fallacy has been committed is known as the [fallacy fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/poster).
p1539
aVSEE HERE http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fallacy_fallacy.

p1542
aVAn argument however is generally invalid and shitty if it only contains ad hominem.
p1543
aVIt is the worst style of argument and should always be pointed out.
p1544
aVSometimes people have good reasons for doing so.
p1545
aVAgain, it's not the concept of fallacies I'm against, it's just the mindset of some people where if you dare commit one of these logical sins, then the debate is over.
p1546
aVTrue enough.

aVWhat does her opinion on Trojan Horse Schools, however wrong it is, have to do with this?
p1552
aVFair, I just don't like people linking to a wiki page on 'Ad Hominem' or 'Strawman'; its patronizing and condesending.
p1553
aVIt's easier and more social to attack it directly by saying what you just did.

aVI still don't understand why people are relying on food banks.
p1562
aVFood is really cheap.
p1563
aVWe do need educated people more on how to look after themselves and how to work there finances.
p1564
aVThere are scroungers but there are also those who don't help themselves out of poverty either, making poor decisions or over spending.
p1565
aVWe need to educate people as well as give them enough to live on. \u000a\u000a
p1566
aVMany peoples finances are tight, meaning there is no fallback short of getting a short term loan at an exhorbitant rate.
p1567
aVSo if something unexpected comes up in finances, you have to make massively tough \u000adecisions.

p1573
aVA topic for another debate, I saw a TED talk where a doctor prescribed his poorest customers money, and they nearly all found themselves feeling healthier very quickly, being able to afford to eat properly, have the heating on, etc.
p1574
aVI wonder how much we'd save on the NHS if we weren't quite so tight to those at the bottom, and I include full time workers on minimum wage in that.
p1575
aVI'm in full time employment and barely spend over £20 a week on food.

p1582
aVMany just cannot gather the willpower to change.\u000a
p1583
aVA big factor in the increase of the need for food banks are payday loans.
p1584
aVThey take advantage of people who may want to make it to the end of the month if they run out of money and are not educated enough to understand the consequences of a 4000% interest rate.
p1585
aVWhen they end up paying more and more of their income on these interest payments, and many people have found themselves homeless and/or relying on food banks.
p1586
aVThese payday lenders do not want their customers to pay back the loan straight away, that isn't where the money is.
p1587
aVIt is in getting people hooked into the trap, and then getting them to pay indefinitely.
p1588
aVThere is a reason that they are outlawed in the rest of Europe and half of the US.

aVThey are seriously dodgy, two thirds of the people who use them are on less than £25,000.

aVTry not to assume everyone can afford food like you or I, there are a shocking number of people in the UK who are in absolute poverty (not relative poverty, not that the inequality gap isn't a problem).
p1593
aVFood may not be that expensive, but good, healthy food is, and for people on benefits, zero hour contracts or whatever it can be extremely difficult to give your family a good, healthy meal.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV&gt;not educated enough to understand the consequences of a 4000% interest rate.
p1595
aVNot mine, yours or anyone elses problem but their own.
p1596
aVI almost feel sorry for them.
p1597
aVBanks spend a hell of a lot of money on marketing, telling everyone that living in debt is ok. Want a big tv?
p1598
aVTake a loan!
p1599
aVWant a holiday?
p1600
aVTake a loan!
p1601
aVIt is utterly irresponsible to get into debt for that kind of purchase.
p1602
aVThen when the banks stopped lending - due to the inevitable outcome of irresponsible lending, people who had been "educated" to live in debt turned to the next lender.
p1603
aVI agree with you though.
p1604
aVIt's their money, their life and their debt.
p1605
aVIt should be a problem between the lender and borrower.
p1606
aVIt would likely be good for society if a large number of people went bankrupt so the lesson that borrowing is bad sank back into the national consciousness.
p1607
aVPeople defaulting on their payday loans would be good to see to.
p1608
aVNot sure where I get it from, but I thought there was a law against usury.
p1609
aVThat is your view of it, I suppose it depends on your empathy and how much you care for a stranger.
p1610
aVIt sort of is our problem when our country allows people to be exploited for the benefit of the richer in society.
p1611
aVI just don't see how you could not want to help the 1 million people who need to use food banks but that's just my opinion.
p1612
aVIt has nothing to do with empathy.
p1613
aVIt's about understanding that the tax payer is not responsible for the bad decisions you make in your own personal life.
p1614
aVJust because you advocate taking money away from people and giving it to those that have squandered their own does not make you empathetic. 
p1615
aVI am not advocating giving people money, I advocate educating people with their finances and outlawing payday lenders.
p1616
aVI did not once say we should give them money.
p1617
aVMorally perhaps, but surely economically a large group of people in that situation is bad for us all, no?
p1618
aVThe main reason has been clearly stated repeatedly, sanctions, often applied unfairly for spurious reasons, and people often don't even get told they've been sanctioned, finding out when they've suddenly got no money.
p1619
aVIn the end, you can't make 'zero' stretch very far even if you buy budget range foods.
p1620
aVPeople have returned food to food banks, because they don't have the money to turn the gas or electric on to cook anything.
p1621
aV&gt; People have returned food to food banks, because they don't have the money to turn the gas or electric on to cook anything.
p1622
aVThis is shocking.
p1623
aVI can't believe the UK has become this way.
p1624
aVGive it a couple of more years and people will be taking to the streets.  
p1625
aV&gt;indignity of relying on food banks \u000a\u000aPenn Jillette:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u201cIt's amazing to me how many people think that voting to have the government give poor people money is compassion.
p1626
aVHelping poor and suffering people is compassion.
p1627
aVVoting for our government to use guns to give money to help poor and suffering people is immoral self-righteous bullying laziness.
p1628
aVPeople need to be fed, medicated, educated, clothed, and sheltered, and if we're compassionate we'll help them, but you get no moral credit for forcing other people to do what you think is right.
p1629
aVThere is great joy in helping people, but no joy in doing it at gunpoint.
p1630
aVPeople try to argue that government isn't really force.
p1631
aVYou believe that?
p1632
aVTry not paying your taxes. 
p1633
aV&gt;People try to argue that government isn't really force.
p1634
aVWho tries to argue this, exactly?
p1635
aVThe world is full of 'Libertarian' havens with no taxes and weak government.
p1636
aVTake your pick from the underdeveloped hell-holes where no one will bother you to fund things you don't want to.
p1637
aVGo to north Korea If you like powerful governments. 
p1638
aVWhy?
p1639
aVI'm happy with the extent of the state we have evolved here.
p1640
aVI'm not the one under the impression the development of the Social Contract was a backward step.
p1641
aVHaha social contract, good one.
p1642
aVThere is no social contract.
p1643
aVI'm not happy and will vote/debate accordingly as our democracy and current state allows despite how much you might dislike it. 
p1644
aV&gt;I'm not happy and will vote/debate accordingly as our democracy and current state allows despite how much you might dislike it.
p1645
aVGood, I'm pleased, and I will *continue* to point out that you enjoy that right because our society is cohesive enough to support a representative government strong enough to compel people to pay for a police force and schools.
p1646
aVThe genuine irony is that if we ever *did* find ourselves living in a Libertarian society I'm all set to fund a private army and become God-Emperor - however much you may dislike that.
p1647
aVIf we did find ourselves in a Libertarian paradise I don't suppose your funds would be much use.
p1648
aVUnless you've been stockpiling tinned food and ammo?
p1649
aVOr go to Somalia if you like no government.
p1650
aVExcept the current situation is in your philosophy taking money from the middle and lower classes to subsidise corporations and the city.
p1651
aVStraw man. 
p1652
aVNot really, simply making a point about the current allocation of tax.
p1653
aVTrue, I misread what you said. 
p1654
aVI never get this opinion, and I like Penn Jillette on a fair few things.
p1655
aVIn the end, we all live as part of society, and it just makes sense that when society needs a thing, like law enforcers, roads, schools, etc., it makes more sense to charge everyone an amount they can afford according to their ability to pay, to ensure it's there for everyone, rather than just allowing the richest to have access to say, the legal system.
p1656
aVAlthough it's slowly shifting that way.
p1657
aVIn the UK we expand that to welfare and healthcare among other things, and while that's debatable, the idea that you should have zero taxes and want to live in a chaotic wasteland of no laws, no rubbish collection, and no street repairs etc... well, that's a bit wild.
p1658
aVAgain, I understand the view of being against welfare, and to an extent healthcare, tho I don't agree, but the idea of wanting zero taxes because you think it's theft and would rather live in a bunker somewhere constantly alert to anyone who might attack rather than pay for police and other emergency services is a bit mad.
p1659
aVThis is also why we should close tax loopholes, places like Top Shop would be fucked without the emergency services, the NHS and schools to help their staff do their jobs and keep the stores open.
p1660
aVOf course the Government collects by force, I imagine they tried just leaving it up to people to send in a third of their wages voluntarily, and gave up on that idea pretty quickly when it was evident that people, while wanting a safe, clean, and good society, don't want to pay for it, even tho they know it's in their best interest.
p1661
aVI think what libertarians would like is to be able to choose where to spend their money.
p1662
aVSo instead of an inefficient government monopoly collecting their waste, you could choose from a host a companies (that might offer slightly different services at different prices).
p1663
aVThis would create competition and likely bring down the price.
p1664
aVIt's not about not wanting to pay for it, it's about having the choice to pay for it and the choice of who they pay to do it.
p1665
aVPoverty is proportional to wealth of the country - so is a bizarre statistic, as it can improve despite everyone being better off.
p1666
aVAs to food banks - We had almost none 10 years ago, so obviously if you build them, and subsidize them, more people will use them.
p1667
aVIt's a point that no one wants to talk about but safety nets must be very carefully managed.
p1668
aVThere's a reason JSA isn't £300 a week - people would rely on it.
p1669
aVWe may yet get to a situation where people don't save money for food because they can just go down the food bank, then there'll need to be another support system in place to support that.
p1670
aVCarrot AND stick. 
p1671
aVYeah, we sure could use some carrot, like bringing back 'back to work grants', crisis loans etc, instead of expecting charities to step in.
p1672
aVHonestly, even from the right, I can't see the sense in stripping away small grants to help people get thru the first month of work when their benefits have stopped but they're over a month away from seeing any pay.
p1673
aVRKO from outta nowhere!
p1674
aVWhy don't we lower the poverty line?
p1675
aVWe could lift the majority out of poverty just by doing that
p1676
aVHitler sort of did that by saying that Jews, women, gays etc weren't included in employment figures.
p1677
aVUnemployment almost disappeared!
p1678
aV[deleted]
p1679
aVFirst off, "poverty isn't a bad thing" is a serious contender for the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.
p1680
aVSecond, I don't know why rich people think that poor people should only be provided just enough to avoid death. 
p1681
aV[deleted]
p1682
aV&gt; Without poverty, you have no reason to do anything.
p1683
aVIf everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1684
aVI think you are mixing up inequality with poverty.
p1685
aVIf someone is working and still in poverty, that's pretty fucked up.
p1686
aVTo be above the "relative poverty" line, you have work 47 hours a week on minimum wage.
p1687
aVIt's not difficult to do that. 
p1688
aVThat's close to the maximum work week for any one job.
p1689
aVIf you work shifts, it might be the case you have to look for a second job (or third) for those extra hours, hard enough to find even the one depending on where in the UK you live, and skills you have.
p1690
aVAnd then there are those with additional responsibilities, like those with young children.
p1691
aVAll this just to be above the bottom 60% of the median household income...
p1692
aVThat's true.
p1693
aVBut that doesn't mean it's not possible.
p1694
aVAs for children - if you're poor, don't have them.
p1695
aVThat's really quite simple in my honest opinion.
p1696
aVYes accidents happen, I am aware of that.
p1697
aVIf you can't afford it, get a termination.
p1698
aVI have no sympathy for religious views in general, certainly not when you're choosing between having a job and making something of yourself, or bringing a child into an impoverished family where it's going to have an awful upbringing.
p1699
aVHaving child benefits doesn't really help the case...\u000a\u000aMaybe I'm just cold and have no empathy but that just seems pretty obvious to me. 
p1700
aV"Not being impossible" is not a good argument; it's not impossible to win the lottery jackpot either, don't mean you should treat buying lottery tickets as a sound financial investment.
p1701
aVAs for children, people's employment situation changes, couples split up and so on.
p1702
aVDo you really think the children ought to be punished too?
p1703
aVTo suggest working 7 days a week or day and night shifts on the same day is not even an lack of empathy (it's not something you should be proud of either) , it demonstrates exactly what's wrong: the only way for those 13 million to escape poverty is to work inhuman hours. 
p1704
aV47 hours a week is easily doable.
p1705
aVIt's effectively 8-6 (with 1 hour lunch break).
p1706
aVThen perhaps two extra shifts per year (or probably only one of you got paid extra for overtime).
p1707
aVMany many many people work longer hours than that.
p1708
aVIn the case of divorces, you get child support, if one parent tragically dies, there's life insurance, and so on.
p1709
aVThat should be a non-issue.
p1710
aVI don't think children should be punished for their parents' actions, no, but I feel no sympathy for the parents who complain about the cost of children when they had children despite knowing they couldn't afford them. 
p1711
aV&gt; 47 hours a week is easily doable.
p1712
aVIt's effectively 8-6 (with 1 hour lunch break).
p1713
aVThen perhaps two extra shifts per year (or probably only one of you got paid extra for overtime).
p1714
aVMany many many people work longer hours than that.
p1715
aV8-6 shift workweek shifts are not acceptable.
p1716
aV48 hours is the working limit, but even then not many people do or could work up to the maximum, nor would they for long.
p1717
aVWe aren't even talking about directors for major companies who are rewarded with an large salary and company car, but the *minimum to get out of poverty*.
p1718
aV&gt;In the case of divorces, you get child support, if one parent tragically dies, there's life insurance, and so on.
p1719
aVThat should be a non-issue.
p1720
aVI don't think children should be punished for their parents' actions, no\u000a\u000aBut then you go on to say that 8-6 day shifts for their parents are acceptable, so yes, that would hurt children too.
p1721
aVLife insurance is not a solution either.
p1722
aVahh your an edgy middle class 17 year old with no life experience, got it.
p1723
aVBootstraps, yada yada.
p1724
aV&gt;If everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1725
aVNobody implied that because that would never happen and would never work as a system.
p1726
aVExactly.
p1727
aVBut that's why you need inequality and poverty is a consequence of inequality.  
p1728
aVBootstraps, yada yada.
p1729
aV&gt;If everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1730
aVNobody implied that because that would never happen and would never work as a system.
p1731
aVApparently 'not letting people starve' = 'full on Communism'. 
p1732
aVIf poverty gives people an incentive to better themselves then why do people born in poverty tend to stay in poverty?
p1733
aVHead to any council estate and point out all the people trying to better themselves, please. 
p1734
aVBecause they've resigned themselves to the fact they can have a life on benefits which may not be "comfortable" by our standards but to them it's reasonable enough because they've grown up with it.
p1735
aVIf we cut the benefits cap to 10% below minimum wage of 40 hours a week (~£12,000) then you'll see a lot more people looking to better themselves. 
p1736
aV&gt;  If everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1737
aVNone of the doctors I know do it for the money.
p1738
aVUnbelievably, some of us aren't all that motivated by cash- if anything, I'd say it's a necessary evil.
p1739
aV&gt;it provides people with an incentive.
p1740
aVreally i was under the assumption that is usually causes depressions and a higher chance of alcohol dependence.
p1741
aVi though giving people the opportunity to better them selves gives them an incentive.
p1742
aVat least i know i was very depressed when we could not afford heating in the middle of the winter and there was no work available.
p1743
aV&gt;and you will get a job that pays enough to not be poor.
p1744
aVliving in LALA land here.\u000a\u000a
p1745
aVThe coalition has eradicated unemployment!
p1746
aVAccording to her, yes. 
p1747
aVJust the same old David Cameron.
p1748
aVHe'll say anything to gain favour even if it means contradicting himself.
p1749
aVHis first proper job was in public relations fer christ sake, he is a manipulator.
p1750
aVI don't know how anybody who identifies on the right of British politics can not throw up when voting for his party. 
p1751
aVAs the old saying goes: In the UK we don't vote people in... we vote people out. 
p1752
aVI HOPE WE'RE NOT SUPPORTING UKIP NOW\u000a\u000aand Islamist is definitely a 'scare word'\u000a\u000athere's 1,800,000,000 muslims on earth
p1753
aV&gt; He'll say anything to gain favour even if it means contradicting himself.
p1754
aVI don't get why it's considered "bad" for a politician to change their views in response to events.
p1755
aVSurely we want a responsive government, rather than one that sticks rigidly to ideologies regardless of the circumstances?
p1756
aVChanging policy isn't bad.
p1757
aVWhen your entire framework of principles is fluid you cannot be trusted.
p1758
aVIdeally politicians should hold solid principles and vary policy to suit said principles based upon the facts as they arise.
p1759
aVNot have no principles at all.
p1760
aV&gt;When your entire framework of principles is fluid\u000a\u000a8 years =/= fluid.
p1761
aVChanging your basic principles in 8 years is pretty fluid.
p1762
aVThe first quote's arn't necessarily contradictory, as no context is given it is a null point.
p1763
aVThe second point, the rise of ISIS and generally very active middle east is plenty reason to change the opinion.
p1764
aVAlso he says not to label the threat as Islamist.
p1765
aVHe then labels it as Islamist Extremism.
p1766
aVThere is a difference between the two.
p1767
aVThe third point.
p1768
aVIn the first he is saying the whole labour market.
p1769
aVIn the second he is specifically talking about factories.
p1770
aVMacro =/= Micro.
p1771
aVThese arn't contradictory statements and with no context given we can't see if the intent is contradictory either.
p1772
aVAre you in politics ?
p1773
aVNo?
p1774
aVYou should be.
p1775
aVI'm not sure if you are trying to be edgy or pay me a compliment?
p1776
aVThanks either way.
p1777
aVBit of both really.
p1778
aVI get the feeling you could argue white is black, which (if you're a politician) is a redeemable quality. 
p1779
aVThese trashposts just bug me.
p1780
aVIf UKIP made a poster like this you can bet the comments would be full of people condemning 'crappy propoganda'.
p1781
aVTo a blind person white is black, it's all about perspective.
p1782
aVAre these basic principles though?
p1783
aVI think so.
p1784
aVThe latter quote especially shows he's gone from being a defender of a free labour market to taking a view that could almost be French.
p1785
aVI sincerely doubt the original statement are even his views.
p1786
aVWhat people are saying is that he sees that UKIP has found support and are taking supporters from the Tories so he is leaning more to the right in order to try and keep those leaving.
p1787
aVIts not responsive, its reactionary.
p1788
aVA few reasons.
p1789
aVFirst it suggests that perhaps their original understanding of the situation was poor.
p1790
aVFor example policy u turns are seen as a bad thing because it means that for whatever reason the policy was not fit for purpose and time and money has been wasted following through anyway.
p1791
aVSimilar thing with broad policy.
p1792
aVWhy have migrant workers suddenly become a bad thing?
p1793
aVDoes that mean they were always bad and you just didn't see it?
p1794
aVAnother big reason is that this is just populist pandering.
p1795
aVWe expect our leaders to do and say, within the realms of possibility, what they consider to be the correct thing rather than the popular thing.
p1796
aVIf the right thing isn't popular, then you make it popular.
p1797
aVThat's a huge part of being a leader- getting people to understand and accept the what and why of things they don't like.
p1798
aVIt's also very hard to do, so many just slip into this pandering.
p1799
aVWe've all that boss, the person who expects to be obeyed without question regardless of how stupid or crazy their instructions are.
p1800
aVIn short there is nothing wrong with a sincere change in view or policy, but it opens the box as to what you got wrong before and why.
p1801
aVPlus it has to be a sincere change, not sound bite slinging to try and get on the fence conservatives on side.
p1802
aV&gt; First it suggests that perhaps their original understanding of the situation was poor.
p1803
aVOr, it means that the situation has changed or that a particular policy theory didn't pan out (nobody can be right every time, even the best experts on economics and social policy frequently disagree).
p1804
aVI'd have a huge amount of respect for a politician who could say "I honestly and reasonably thought that this policy would improve things, but events have proved me wrong, so I'll reverse it".
p1805
aV&gt; Similar thing with broad policy.
p1806
aVWhy have migrant workers suddenly become a bad thing?
p1807
aVDoes that mean they were always bad and you just didn't see it?
p1808
aVMaybe because in 2007, we didn't have an imminent "wave" of new immigration approaching.
p1809
aVi.e.
p1810
aVthe 2007 levels were "good", but higher levels are "bad"?
p1811
aVOr because in dealing with immigration and its effects on society over the last few years, his opinion of the net effect of immigration has changed?
p1812
aV&gt; We expect our leaders to do and say, within the realms of possibility, what they consider to be the correct thing rather than the popular thing.
p1813
aVBut they only get to become our leaders if they say the "populist" thing...
p1814
aVSeems to be a bit of a contradiction there.
p1815
aVWe want them to be democratically subject to the "will of the people", but when they acknowledge that will, we accuse them of being "populist"...\u000a\u000a&gt; If the right thing isn't popular, then you make it popular.
p1816
aVYou mean through propaganda campaigns?
p1817
aV"Spin"?
p1818
aVWe rightly disliked the previous government's blatant manipulation of the media for propaganda purposes and you're suggesting that there should be more of that?
p1819
aVYes situations change.
p1820
aVThat's why I didn't use absolute language.
p1821
aVThank you for ensuring the point was driven home.
p1822
aVI thought I managed it the closing lines but the post was truly enriched by your contribution to that key facet.
p1823
aVThe populist versus 'correct' policy is a key flaw in how democracy works with a largely apathetic pool of voters.
p1824
aVIt's not a contradiction of the argument, it's hilgihting a key flaw that causes a rift between how democracy should work and how it works in reality.
p1825
aVThere's a massive difference between using obfuscation, selective material and double speak to bluff and badger your point into something acceptable, and making a genuine argument to the people to justify your decisions.
p1826
aVI argue for the latter, not the former, so that should make you happier.
p1827
aVAgain, this doesn't invalidate the point, it just hilights why the desire is not the reality- it's easier to spout populist rhetoric and then spin the decisions that really annoy the mostly passive electorate.
p1828
aVIt all depends on the context.
p1829
aVTake the first quote on intergration.
p1830
aVAt first he says the British should intergrate with the Asian community and in the 2nd quote he promotes the opposite, where we encourage "liberal" values.
p1831
aVHow much has changed from 2006 - 2014 to make such a turnaround?
p1832
aVIt's quite clear in quote (1) he is courting the Asian vote and in quote (2) he is riding on the anti-immigration / multiculturalism wave of the last few years.
p1833
aVIt is sheer spin-docterism from the doctrine of Blair. 
p1834
aVContext.
p1835
aVContext and timing.
p1836
aVAt this time, he was in opposition and Blair was dishing it out to Muslims willy nilly .
p1837
aVWhat's surprised me, is that people seem to  still think 'principles and conviction' play any part in setting policy.
p1838
aVOf the 2 main parties, both are only interesting in serving their funders by winning re election.
p1839
aVBelief and conviction just don't feature.
p1840
aVPolicy is set by public opinion and the agenda of funders.
p1841
aVThat's really all there is to it, isn't it ?
p1842
aVI'm not so sure, both of those statements are devoid of all context for a start, but notice that the first statement doesn't say "Asian", it says "British Asian".
p1843
aVTherefore the "British values" mentioned in the second statement could easily be interpreted to include "British Asian" values (since "British Asian" could be considered a subset of "British").
p1844
aVIf you change your opinion you should say why it changed.
p1845
aVYet he would never do this, as with most politicians they just present their "new viewpoint" as fact and hope the vast majority of people forgot the last one.
p1846
aVLook at the reasoning though.
p1847
aVDo you think he's changing his views because immigration is harming the economy or social fabric of Britain more today than it was several years ago?
p1848
aVNo.
p1849
aVHe's changing his views because UKIP are gaining strength and changing the political landscape.
p1850
aVThey have forced issues into the spotlight the he would have rather remained stifled.
p1851
aVTherefor he's not changing his views for a greater good.
p1852
aVHe's changing his views to remain electable and not lose out to UKIP.
p1853
aVI'll cut the deficit, not the NHS
p1854
aVHe actually followed through on that.
p1855
aVI think you're thinking of, 'No top-down reorganisation of the NHS'.
p1856
aVHe still cut the NHS.
p1857
aVThe "Nicholson Challenge" wasn't optional, it was cuts by another name. 
p1858
aVNo he hasn't, spending has increased in real-terms.
p1859
aVHe might not be spending enough in order to keep up with demand, but in no way can you describe an increase in spending as a cut.
p1860
aVHas it really?
p1861
aVWhat does real terms mean? 
p1862
aVNothing it's a political buzzword.
p1863
aVIt is calculated on an ever changing basket,  does the NHS spend a lot of money on MP3s?
p1864
aVIf your rent went up by less than inflation would you call that a real terms cut?
p1865
aVOr would you say your rent went up? 
p1866
aVIt went up in proportion with the value of inflation calculated by the bank of England which means that the amount of money spent on the NHS today should buy the same amount of stuff as the amount of money spent on the NHS five years ago (even though the actual quantity of money is greater - £140 billion this year compared to £119 billion five years ago).
p1867
aVOne can dispute whether or not the Bank of England measures inflation accurately, but that's what the government relies on for its economic planning.
p1868
aVThe Social Protection budget and spending on debt interest are the only other parts of the budget that haven't been cut in real terms.
p1869
aVEducation spending has been reduced by ~5%, partly because the government no longer contributes as much to university tuition as it did, and partly because of the ways schools are being reorganized.
p1870
aVAll other arms of the government have been cut by 15% or more.
p1871
aVAll totaled, government spending excluding that on debt interest has decreased by 10%.
p1872
aVTotal government spending has decreased by 7%.
p1873
aVI'm sure you hold all the same opinions from 8 years ago.
p1874
aVEven when the facts have changed.
p1875
aVIsn't that right?
p1876
aVPoliticians!
p1877
aVhaving the nerve to change their opinion when confronted with a changing situation.
p1878
aVAbsolutely terrible.\u000a
p1879
aVFirst of all, don't get so personal and leary.
p1880
aVIn Cameron's word's "calm down dear".
p1881
aVI'm not automatically opposed to changes of heart providing the facts on the ground have changed.
p1882
aVTake the first quote, Cameron goes from extolling the values of "British Asians" and believes that non-Asian British people should emulate those values.
p1883
aV8 years later he is now advocating for typical western liberal values.
p1884
aVProviding those two sets of values are distinct (only Cameron can decide that) than he has changed his mind.
p1885
aVSo what has changed in those 8 years to have altered his mind?
p1886
aVRemember, values don't change over peroids of 8 years.
p1887
aVMore like generations.
p1888
aVTherefore I can't take Cameron's change of heart seriously and I'll put this down to hypocritical politics. 
p1889
aV&gt;First of all, don't get so personal and leary.
p1890
aVIn Cameron's word's "calm down dear".
p1891
aVRight, because asking you to hold yourself to the same standards as you hold others is personal.
p1892
aV&gt;I'm not automatically opposed to changes of heart providing the facts on the ground have changed.
p1893
aVTake the first quote, Cameron goes from extolling the values of "British Asians" and believes that non-Asian British people should emulate those values.
p1894
aV8 years later he is now advocating for typical western liberal values.
p1895
aVProviding those two sets of values are distinct (only Cameron can decide that) than he has changed his mind.
p1896
aVAll of these quotes are taken completely out of context, it's cheap propaganda and not worth looking into.
p1897
aVFor instance these British Asians are a part of British culture already.
p1898
aVThe second quote therefore already includes those values and is arguing against outside influences.
p1899
aVEither I or you could build countless context's around these quotes to make him look good or bad, without the context this is just a cheap gimmick.
p1900
aV&gt;So what has changed in those 8 years to have altered his mind?
p1901
aVRemember, values don't change over peroids of 8 years.
p1902
aVMore like generations.
p1903
aVTherefore I can't take Cameron's change of heart seriously and I'll put this down to hypocritical politics.
p1904
aVAnd in doing so you show one of the worst traits of British political support.
p1905
aVThe instant, oh tories?
p1906
aVfuck them.
p1907
aVOr Labour?
p1908
aVfuck them.
p1909
aVYou make snap judgements without looking for context or the reason behind the statements.
p1910
aVThis picture doesn't promote conversation, it promotes knee jerk reactions from people who have already decided they don't like the conservatives.\u000a\u000a
p1911
aV&gt; Right, because asking you to hold yourself to the same standards as you hold others is personal.
p1912
aVEh?
p1913
aVYou wrote a post dripping with a mean brand of sarcasm.
p1914
aVAnd yeah I do hold my politicians to a higher standard than I do for a normal member of the public.
p1915
aVThey have far greater responsibility on their shoulders.
p1916
aV&gt; All of these quotes are taken completely out of context, it's cheap propaganda and not worth looking into.
p1917
aVSo you say the above...but then:\u000a\u000a&gt;For instance these British Asians are a part of British culture already.
p1918
aVThe second quote therefore already includes those values and is arguing against outside influences\u000a\u000aSo you acknowledge they're out of context and "not worth looking into" but you try to explain them anyway.
p1919
aVSo why are you allowed to explain these quotations but not me?
p1920
aV&gt; Either I or you could build countless context's around these quotes to make him look good or bad, without the context this is just a cheap gimmick.
p1921
aVFair enough I agree with that.
p1922
aVIf you read my first comment on this thread, I barely make any reference to the actual content of the image.
p1923
aVHowever, it did chime with my view of DC, as a dishonest, snake oil salesman.
p1924
aVI think he will say whatever is the most politically advantageous with the view of winning an election, not any moral conviction based on a vision for the country.
p1925
aVAs Douglas Caswell said, DC and his cronies just want to sit on the sofa.
p1926
aV&gt; And in doing so you show one of the worst traits of British political support.
p1927
aVThe instant, oh tories?
p1928
aVfuck them.
p1929
aVOr Labour?
p1930
aVfuck them.
p1931
aVYou make snap judgements without looking for context or the reason behind the statements.
p1932
aVYou're confusing me with somebody who takes their political input from these sort of images.
p1933
aVBelieve me, I read manifestos.
p1934
aVI watch the news I'm interested in politics, I'm still disillusioned with all three main parties.\u000a\u000a
p1935
aV&gt;Eh?
p1936
aVYou wrote a post dripping with a mean brand of sarcasm.
p1937
aVAnd yeah I do hold my politicians to a higher standard than I do for a normal member of the public.
p1938
aVThey have far greater responsibility on their shoulders.
p1939
aVAnd you wrote a post just plain out being rude based on cheap propaganda.
p1940
aV&gt;So you acknowledge they're out of context and "not worth looking into" but you try to explain them anyway.
p1941
aVSo why are you allowed to explain these quotations but not me?
p1942
aVI am not explaining, I am creating a context to demonstrate my point.
p1943
aV&gt;I barely make any reference to the actual content of the image.
p1944
aVWell I'm sorry if you were in fact not talking in relation to the post.
p1945
aVHowever this is the comments section of the post and it is implied that you are talking about the post, if not maybe say otherwise.
p1946
aV&gt;You're confusing me with somebody who takes their political input from these sort of images.
p1947
aVBelieve me, I read manifestos.
p1948
aVI watch the news I'm interested in politics, I'm still disillusioned with all three main parties.
p1949
aVThen you probably don't need this self validation propaganda do you?
p1950
aV&gt; I don't know how anybody who identifies on the right of British politics can not throw up when voting for his party.
p1951
aVSomething tells me you don't know many of the 10,703,654 people who voted conservative in 2010 then.
p1952
aVYes David Cameron is a politician.
p1953
aVI'm not sure why this angers you so
p1954
aVWhen he was asked why he wanted to be PM, he said because he thought he'd be rather good at it.
p1955
aVThat's it.
p1956
aVNo vision, just pure self-indulgence from the man who already has everything.
p1957
aVAnd he wasn't even right.
p1958
aVI don't say this because I don't like his politics or anything...
p1959
aVI think even Tories agree, he's not particularly good at his job.
p1960
aVHe's just a caretaker PM - we won't remember him in ten years except as the PM who lost Scotland.
p1961
aVWell, all the tory voters I've spoken too have either gone for:\u000a\u000aa/ they stand for something.
p1962
aVWhatever that means, and if it means traditional old fashioned values I'm perplexed on so many levels.
p1963
aVEspecially since this man stands only really for himself.
p1964
aVb/ They save me having to pay taxes to help poor people who deserve it.
p1965
aVWhich would lose the Tories their UKIP swing voters if they just came out straight and said it.
p1966
aVIt's that last one which really gets me.
p1967
aV* [University rates are climbing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17069298)\u000a* [Graduation rates are dropping](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/07/education-graduation-oecd-university)\u000a* [Employers need more skilled labor](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10424148/Immigrants-fill-one-in-five-skilled-British-jobs.html)\u000a* [Non-EU immigration is capped at 20,700 per year](http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hro/news/1072802/immigration-cap-set-remain-700-2014)\u000a\u000aSo ... the UK is producing fewer skilled workers *and* refusing to import them.
p1968
aVSomeone tell me how this situation isn't totally fucked.
p1969
aVPart of the problem with point 3 is that employers don't actually want to pay skilled workers adequate salary/wages, so obviously they don't get any employees.

p1988
aVI think people just need to be more informed when they choose a degree, because if you choose something like philosophy with barely any prospects you can't blame anyone but yourself for the lack of employers who want to hire you.
p1989
aVSame goes for if people choose a mad competitive degree like law.
p1990
aVat the same time, this country would be all the poorer if ALL we offered was computing/engineering...\u000a\u000aso basically if your not good at maths you don't belong at university, you can't narrow the frame of what constitutes an intellectual by that much and expect good things..\u000a\u000ai was in awe of my old head of department when i was in uni.
p1991
aVHe couldn't code a "hello world" in c# or design a bridge, does that mean he doesn't belong at uni teaching because his subject wasn't computing/engineering?\u000a\u000a
p1992
aVYou read into that way too much.
p1993
aVI never said people who aren't good at maths don't belong at uni, I never tried to define what constitutes an intellectual, I never said your head of department didn't belong at uni because of his chosen field.
p1994
aVWhat I did say was people need to be more realistic when choosing what they study.
p1995
aVFact of the matter is there aren't many jobs out there for people with humanities degrees.
p1996
aVWhat I'm saying is don't go to university to study a course with terrible job prospects then get uppity when you have a hard time finding a job after uni.
p1997
aVI personally would've loved to have done history, but took the safer bet of computer science.
p1998
aVCan't believe people dislike the idea of compromise and being realistic with what they choose to do.

aVWell 'ish' the problem isn't so much what they deserve.
p2011
aVA worrying number of graduates enter professions where there degrees aren't directly applicable thus they aren't so much skilled as they are showing promise, other graduates with career specific degrees fall foul of the well where else are you going to go trap.

p2014
aV&gt; A worrying number of graduates enter professions where there degrees aren't directly applicable thus they aren't so much skilled as they are showing promise\u000a\u000aThis is how it's always been.

p2022
aVIn fact, if you read through the above list, you'll find right-wing sources, left-wing sources, "neutral" sources, etc.
p2023
aVNobody who is paying attention is ignorant of the problem.
p2024
aVThe government knows this.
p2025
aVBusiness knows this.
p2026
aVIt's the retarded UKIP and BNP fucks with their heads up their arses who are *completely* clueless as to how economies work.
p2027
aVThe UK has a fucking problem.
p2028
aVUnfortunately, people who are in complete denial of said problem have an annoying tendency to both a), vote, and b) scream loud enough about "immigrants takin' are jerbs" that a completely ignorant public starts to hyperventilate about a non-problem whilst ignoring a real one.
p2029
aV**Update**: for anyone who shrugs and says "so what", it means that the UK, long term, will be less competitive, will turn out fewer new technologies, will have fewer entrepreneurs, will attract fewer businesses.
p2030
aVThis is a **serious problem**, but I actually feel bad for politicians.
p2031
aVThey know that the short term "anti-immigrant" solutions they talk about are a disaster for the UK, but they risk getting voted out in favor of someone who really *is* anti-immigrant if they don't do a bit of pandering.
p2032
aVShort-term, lowering tuition won't solve this problem because the UK needs these workers *now*.
p2033
aVMedium term, it's unclear if lowering tuition will work because countries like France have dirt-cheap tuition, but not enough students enrolling in STEM fields.
p2034
aVLong-term, the UK needs to get those workers, but that's either going to be skilled immigrant labor (which is being turned away) or skilled domestic labor (which isn't being created).
p2035
aVVery interesting stuff.
p2036
aVOut of curiosity, what's your political persuasion.
p2037
aV&gt; Out of curiosity, what's your political persuasion.
p2038
aVDamn it, I'm about to out myself.
p2039
aVI don't *have* a political persuasion any more.
p2040
aVI'm an American who's lived in the US, the Netherlands, Japan, France (currently) and in the UK for several years, of during most of which I found myself working for the BBC.
p2041
aVI originally went to Uni to be an economist, but stopped taking economics classes because I took all of them.
p2042
aVI'm now living in various countries with my wife and daughter and I see the same fundamental problem over and over again: people want "one size fits all" economic and social solutions to problems and *it ain't gonna happen*.
p2043
aVAny economist (I'm lookin' at you, Austrians!
p2044
aV) who tries to claim their preferred system is the only way to go is full of shit.
p2045
aVI sort of liked Cameron when I first moved to the UK in 2006, but I didn't like the Tories due to their slavish worship of US Republicans (my wife worked as a political advisor and got to see Tory functions first hand).
p2046
aVI definitely *didn't* like Vice President Blair, as I called him, but sort of preferred Labour to Tories, except that Labor, under Blair, were going nowhere.
p2047
aVThen there were the LibDems whose *ideas* I sort of liked, but whose policy positions were often incomprehensible to me (and a hearty round of applause for the comedy performance of Nick Clegg for completely failing to realize that Cameron's promise of a referendum on a voting system that would gut the Tory party was worth as much as one might think it would be).
p2048
aVIn short, there are many brilliant ideas out there and no one party has the monopoly on them (even here in France, the disgusting Marine Le Pen is raising issues that, damn it, need to be raised \u2014 talk about mixed emotions on my part).
p2049
aVI don't stand for any sort of bigotry or other forms of discriminations against race, creed, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender identification, blah, blah, blah.
p2050
aVBut other than that, my political beliefs don't fit too neatly into any category.
p2051
aVBravo. 
p2052
aV&gt;I actually feel bad for politicians.
p2053
aVThey know that the short term "anti-immigrant" solutions they talk about are a disaster for the UK, but they risk getting voted out in favor of someone who really is anti-immigrant if they don't do a bit of pandering.
p2054
aVWhy feel bad?
p2055
aVThey are being fundamentally dishonest.
p2056
aVPeople have two issues with immigration: one is that it is perceived as depressing wages and hoovering up unskilled employment opportunities, the other is that the numbers are simply so large.
p2057
aVThey could do what the people want and implement a Canadian / American / Australian style policy to *every* foreign country, but they won't.
p2058
aVThey are committed to the EU and must mislead the public.
p2059
aVThey are intentionally bringing about a situation whereby Indian doctors get excluded and any unemployable thug from the former Soviet Bloc can walk right in.
p2060
aV&gt; Why feel bad?
p2061
aVThey are being fundamentally dishonest.
p2062
aVI sympathize with that point of view, but let's assume that you're a really, really good person and you're also a politician.
p2063
aVHowever, through no fault of your own, the economy has gone to shit, you're sinking in the polls, and a large part of your electorate is out of work and buying the whole "immigrant job" line that the BNP candidate is giving.
p2064
aVNo matter how hard you try, he's steadily eating into your voter base.
p2065
aVSo now you have a choice:\u000a\u000a1.
p2066
aVContinue to be true to your values and risk a BNP thug take your job and start calling the shots.
p2067
aV2.
p2068
aVAbandon your values and start fighting immigration.
p2069
aV3.
p2070
aV*Say* that you're fighting immigration, but quietly working to support the UK economy anyway.
p2071
aVThis is effectively the position Obama was in in his first term: he tried to push through a lot of policies he believed in, but his own party said "we won't support you because we won't get re-elected.
p2072
aV" As a result, he could have appeared to have been a good-hearted but ineffective leader, but instead took paths 2/3 above (you decide).
p2073
aVI sincerely believe that some politicians find room to compromise because the alternative, in their minds, would be much worse.
p2074
aVIt's a problem which can only be alleviated by a deep education of the public, but we've already seen that this isn't going to happen.
p2075
aVThinking "the alternative to me is much worse" is fine, but actively misleading people so they are voting for you when you don't plan to do what you're saying is just plain wrong.
p2076
aV3 is a terrible way to do politics.
p2077
aV2 is clearly off the table.

aVIf we lack skilled workers it is because our government is retarded, they let abundances of talent do useless degrees that simply have no demand.
p2082
aVThe solution is not immigration, the solution is proper education and that doesn't involve throwing money at it, it just means the government giving people less freedom to study what they want. 
p2083
aVYeah because people should not be able to pick what they study.

p2092
aVOh, so the retarded government is supposed to decide which degrees are worthwhile?
p2093
aVThe *government* can decide if it will *let* you follow a given degree?
p2094
aVAre you fucking insane?
p2095
aVI'm not going to respond to that lest I invoke the wrath of Godwin, but I don't think too many people are going to be comfortable with the "retarded government" telling them what they can and can not study.
p2096
aV&gt; The solution is not immigration, the solution is proper education\u000a\u000aWhich involves:\u000a\u000a* Convincing people to take degrees which will benefit the economy\u000a* And convincing them to graduate *today*\u000a\u000aThis isn't a problem that might happen in a few years.
p2097
aVThis is happening now.
p2098
aVThis is a real problem *now*.
p2099
aVThe UK economy has been sputtering along for years and it might finally be coming out of it, but it's unclear.
p2100
aVThe unwillingness (actually, the inability) of the government to address the problems which exist *now* isn't helping the UK, it's hurting the UK.
p2101
aVOf course, if you have a solution that will help solve the **known problem that exists now**, I'd love to hear it.

aV**Update**: as an aside, I like how you first made the blanket assertion that there's no lack of skilled workers, and then you responded to my response with "if we lack skilled workers it's because ...".
p2115

p2119
aVAre you fucking insane?
p2120
aVThat guy you're talking at is clearly not too smart, but this part got to me.
p2121
aVWhy would it be so bad for the government to subsidise certain degrees more?
p2122
aVSTEM subjects being half the price of non-STEM subjects *as an example* would be a degree of control without the government just telling someone outright what degree they can do.
p2123
aVIf that's what he meant, I could be less concerned about that, but that's not what he said.
p2124
aVIn fact, I'm unsure that's what he meant because he repeated that idiocy *twice*:\u000a\u000a* *[the government] let abundances of talent do useless degrees that simply have no demand*\u000a* *it just means the government giving people less freedom to study what they want.
p2125
aV*\u000a\u000aI could easily see the government supporting STEM degrees.
p2126
aVI do have a concern, though, about how the university system itself is managed.
p2127
aVThere are many "useless" degrees (history, art, literature, philosophy, and so on) which nonetheless broaden the experience of the entire country.
p2128
aVWe don't want those taken away, but neither do we wish to go the American route of unrelenting student debt crushing down on those who study degrees which enrich in ways other than money.
p2129
aVFurthering the divide between the "haves" and "have nots" by punishing with debt those whose degrees we don't value isn't helping.
p2130
aVThe UK should ask itself: do we want to continue to promote a society where *money* is seen as the primary objective of learning?
p2131
aVTolkien was a uni professor, but he wasn't teaching STEM.
p2132
aVOr consider [Deidre Hyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_Hyde), an exceptionally talented British artist who graduated with a fine arts degree and today paints incredible works or art.
p2133
aVOr what about almost every teacher teaching our children today?
p2134
aVMany of them have acquired "useless" degrees and yet are today shaping the future.
p2135
aV[Prior to 1998, tuition fees weren't charged](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students).
p2136
aVUniversity was part of a continuum of the free public education process where you could finally choose your specialty.
p2137
aVWhy isn't the government charging for, say, primary or secondary?
p2138
aVBecause *that's an investment in the future of the UK*.
p2139
aVUnfortunately, when you start getting a short-sighted "we need to balance everything *now*" attitude towards government, it makes it much harder to start laying out long-term plans.
p2140
aVRather than subsidizing STEM, I'd rather see a return to subsidizing the nation's future, regardless of whether or not we necessarily understand or approve of it, and roll back the tuition fees altogether.
p2141
aVHowever, it will never happen.
p2142
aVStudents are now a source of revenue and the politicians are quite happy with that.
p2143
aV&gt;If that's what he meant, I could be less concerned about that, but that's not what he said.
p2144
aVIn fact, I'm unsure that's what he meant because he repeated that idiocy twice:\u000a\u000aYeah, I have no clue what that guy was chatting about.
p2145
aVI just thought I'd raise what I saw as an interesting possibility.
p2146
aV&gt;Furthering the divide between...
p2147
aVI think I should be clearer here, I meant the monetary support as an example of the government having some control over which degrees people do without having outright control.
p2148
aVPersonally, I think things like education should be free as there's nothing more valuable to a country than an educated population, but that's beside the point I was making: There are ways the government can have control over what happens at universities that aren't absolute control, there are degrees(badumtsh!
p2149
aV) of control.
p2150
aVI hadn't read the rest of your post until this point, but I must say we completely agree.
p2151
aVI think the only thing that should dictate whether or not you do a degree is your willingness to learn it, and the only real way to measure that at the moment is through grades.
p2152
aVI also think we should promote other means of higher education than just universities, as there are people who go to university just for the sake of it, rather than to learn something at degree level; promoting tradeskills, which to me are another form of higher education, for reasons other than monetary would be very beneficial to the UK.
p2153
aVAs an Englishman more skilled workers does nothing to benefit me it will just lower wages and force me to up my standards for the same wage I can get now.

aVFuck off.
p2174
aV2) So?
p2175
aVWhy do we care about their past all we care about is their ability to contribute to our country now, whether we trained them or not is no concern once they are an adult, besides it doesn't seem like a lot of them have an education.

aVDoes anyone have a source for the last 'after UKIP' quote?
p2188
aVnotice the years, I don't think it's as much a case as before and after UKIP, more before the 2010 general election, and after it. 
p2189
aVGovernments are supposed to represent their people.
p2190
aVIf David Cameron is changing what he says to reflect general opinion, it isn't a bad thing.
p2191
aVTo be fair, how much of this is up to UKIP, and how much is it up to him not being in power in 2006/7.
p2192
aVLots of politicians say lots of things when they aren't in power, but they all start sounding strangely similar when they are. 
p2193
aVI see nothing wrong in changing one's position when events &amp; circumstances demand it. 
p2194
aVBut broadly speaking the events are similar and the circumstances haven't changed.
p2195
aVWe had substantial immigration 7 years ago and our borders were open to everyone in the EU.
p2196
aVWe had an issue with islamic extremism, indeed some of those Before quotes are only 4 years after 9/11.
p2197
aVYeah, he's lurched to the right on rhetoric, but there's no real changes of policy there.
p2198
aVWhen more than half of immigration, and a larger proportion of unskilled and low skilled immigration is from the EU, there's no point talking tough unless you're talking about leaving.
p2199
aV&gt;  When more than half of immigration, and a larger proportion of unskilled and low skilled immigration is from the EU\u000a\u000aOnly 38% of immigration is from the EU (47% from outside the EU and the rest Brits coming back).
p2200
aVIf you meant Net migration, then sure 54% of it is from the EU.
p2201
aVBut 67% of it is from outside of the EU (the difference is the fact more Britons leave than come back).
p2202
aVIt also turns out that Immigrants tend to be more educated than natives (although this could be function of the age of people we attract):\u000a\u000a&gt; By 2011, the percentage of natives with a degree had nearly doubled, to 21%, while the percentage of EEA and non-EEA immigrants had increased even further, to 32% and 38%, respectively.
p2203
aVSimilarly, about one in two native born individuals fall into the \u201clow education\u201d category (defined as those who left full- time education before 17), while only one in five EEA immigrants and one in four non-EEA immigrants do so\u000a\u000a[source](http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/CDP_22_13.pdf)\u000a\u000aBut let's not let either of these get in the way of (yet another) good circlejerk about the EU.
p2204
aV&gt; Immigrants tend to be more educated than natives\u000a\u000aFor both EU and non-EU immigrants?
p2205
aVAlso one of the problems is the 2nd generation immigrants.
p2206
aV2nd generation Muslim immigrants are far more radicalised than their parents.
p2207
aVFar more likely to support killing people for apostasy etc.
p2208
aV&gt; For both EU and non-EU immigrants?
p2209
aVEEA stands for European Economic Area.
p2210
aVSo yes - 32% for EEA immigrants had a degree and 38% for non-EEA (compared to 21% native).
p2211
aV&gt; 2nd generation Muslim immigrants are far more radicalised than their parents\u000a\u000aI'm sure 2nd generation Muslim immigrants are also far more likely to be educated and employed than their parents as well (and I suspect far less likely to value their religion).
p2212
aVWhether any of these 'facts' are because of their religion or immigration status or because of their socio-economic status is another question.
p2213
aV&gt; EEA stands for European Economic Area.
p2214
aVSo yes - 32% for EEA immigrants had a degree and 38% for non-EEA (compared to 21% native).
p2215
aVThanks.
p2216
aV&gt; (and I suspect far less likely to value their religion)\u000a\u000aActually it's well known that British Muslim youths are more radicalised than their parents.
p2217
aV[Here's an paper that discusses it](http://www.academia.edu/1063860/British_Muslim_Young_People_Facts_Features_and_Religious_Trends).
p2218
aVAnd here's a newspaper article about it:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1540895/Young-British-Muslims-getting-more-radical.html  \u000a\u000a&gt; I'm sure 2nd generation Muslim immigrants are also far more likely to be educated and employed than their parents\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy would you expect that?
p2219
aVYou said yourself that the parent are likely highly educated.
p2220
aVThat makes it unlikely that their children are even more educated than their parents.
p2221
aVWhat we are seeing is high unemployment among Muslim youths.
p2222
aV&gt; While the greatestnumbers of Muslim young people appear to have only cultural attachments to theirfaith, a signi\ufb01cant, visible number are increasingly turning towards religion\u000a\u000aThe paper you linked only seemed to show the cultural influences of the religion.
p2223
aVIt made no mention of how young people are being radicalised.
p2224
aVHere:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/29/thinktanks.religion\u000a\u000aAnd\u000a\u000a&gt; A 2007 poll by Policy Exchange revealed that 31% of British Muslims believed that leaving the Muslim religion should be punishable by death\u000a\u000ahttp://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/living%20apart%20together%20-%20jan%2007.pdf\u000a
p2225
aV&gt; Why would you expect that?
p2226
aVYou said yourself that the parent are likely highly educated.
p2227
aVThat makes it unlikely that their children are even more educated than their parents.
p2228
aVYounger people tend to be more educated than older people generally: the number of people going to university from School is rising.
p2229
aVYounger people also tend to have less interest in religion that older people - the census demographic data backs this up.
p2230
aVThere's no real reason to suggest it is different for immigrants or Muslims (or a combination thereof).
p2231
aV&gt; Younger people tend to be more educated than older people generally\u000a\u000aYes, but we're dealing a group that is already highly educated to start with.
p2232
aVIf you looked at only university professors, for example, then you'd expect their children to be less educated than their parents.\u000a\u000a
p2233
aVI don't really see many people complaining about immigration from the EU.
p2234
aVI think people only complain about the Romani gypsies in general.
p2235
aVI haven't personally seen people complain about Polish people - is that really a thing?
p2236
aVAside from Romani gypsies, pretty much all the complaints that I hear about immigration is about 3rd world cultures and Islam.
p2237
aVIt isn't UKIP.
p2238
aVThe Electorate want a financially competent nice party.
p2239
aVThe Tories lost in 97 because they were financially questionable and generally arseholes and while Labour weren't better on the issue of money they were nicer, ergo landslide.
p2240
aVThey then spent 10 years borrowing money to keep everything afloat while being generally nice other than on civil liberties and Iraq, hence they won 2 elections against Tories who remained stuck in their fiscally questionable arsehole phase.
p2241
aVCameron comes along and realises that the only way to get power at this point is to be even nicer than Labour while being as fiscally competent, so signs up to their spending plans and starts saying nice things to pretend his party of arseholes seems nice.
p2242
aVWhen the financial crisis comes along both sides are harmed, but Cameron gets the most seats because he is a bit more competent than Brown while seeming like he is nice.
p2243
aVMove to now.
p2244
aVThe Tories have an advantage on the economy, the nice people weren't enough to get Cameron a majority.
p2245
aVHowever there are a lot of arseholes out there.
p2246
aVHis plan therefore is to make a fiscally competent nice party which appeals to arseholes.
p2247
aV&gt; while Labour weren't better on the issue of money they were nicer, ergo landslide.
p2248
aVThey then spent 10 years borrowing money to keep everything afloat while being generally nice other than on civil liberties and Iraq\u000a\u000aActually, Labour was running a budget surplus in 2002 and 2003.
p2249
aVThe first surplus in decades.
p2250
aVIt was Iraq what scuppered it.
p2251
aVIt was supposed to last 6 months and be paid out of the reserves, but lasted 8 years and sucked a whole lot of money.
p2252
aVAnd the Labour govt didn't dare cut spending to pay for war, people were angry enough about Iraq.
p2253
aVSo they borrowed.
p2254
aVUnfortunately, it suits a lot of people to gloss over how **very expensive** war is.
p2255
aVThey like to pretend its all down to public spending and blowing up millions of pounds (literally) every time you launch a Tomahawk costs nothing.
p2256
aVThat was a very entertaining read!
p2257
aVNecessarily simplified but good.

p2261
aVHe actually had some fair points back in the day.
p2262
aVNow he is just being pushed further and further right which is both a mistake for him and for the country.
p2263
aVthe huge upsurge in UKIP support shows a large percentage of our country wants a hard stance on immigration, why would he not jump at the chance to appeal to them?
p2264
aVYeah people cry that Miliband refuses to offer a referendum and thus appeal to those who want nothing to do with the UKIP agenda.
p2265
aV&gt;the huge upsurge in UKIP from having no members of Parliament and no local councils to no members of Parliament and no local councils shows a large percentage of our country don't.
p2266
aVFTFY
p2267
aVThey've gone from having no local Councillors to having some local Councillors.
p2268
aVJust because they don't control any councils doesn't mean they don't have a voice.
p2269
aVI am vehemently against pretty much everything they stand for but diversity in politics is a good thing. 
p2270
aV1.
p2271
aVI was just trying to point out there was no "huge upsurge".
p2272
aV2.
p2273
aVThere were definitely UKIP Councillors already before media started paying attention to them.
p2274
aV12 MEPs to 24 MEPs might suggest otherwise about the huge upsurge. 
p2275
aVWhile increased diversity is good thing, increased extremism and nationalism are not.
p2276
aVThere will always be a fringe at either end of the scale, hiving them off into their own marginal party is better in my mind than poisoning the ideology of the moderates.
p2277
aVFPTP
p2278
aVI enjoyed that
p2279
aVWell most people have a reasoned and principled stance on these issues, rather than just adopting whatever fits to appeal to people.
p2280
aVIn reality we all know, if a politician changes his view constantly, it's probably because he is manipulating voters and has intention of carrying through with his rhetoric.
p2281
aVNo, nonononono.
p2282
aV**Edit:** Well, that was not a very good argument of my part...
p2283
aVQuite the transformation.
p2284
aVIt always makes me laugh thinking how much influence UKIP has already, they haven't even got an MP yet (not counting Carswell until after the by-election) and they've got the Prime Minister whistling their tune.
p2285
aVIf he was really whistling their tune instead of pretending to do so, wouldn't you think he'd be proposing an EU referendum sooner?
p2286
aVYou're otherwise right, though, UKIP does have a lot of influence.
p2287
aVIt doesn't matter if he's pretending or not.
p2288
aVHe's still whistling UKIP's tune and it's effecting the direction of the tories. 
p2289
aV&gt; If he was really whistling their tune instead of pretending to do so, wouldn't you think he'd be proposing an EU referendum sooner?
p2290
aVYou're otherwise right, though, UKIP does have a lot of influence.
p2291
aVHe can't get it earlier.
p2292
aVThere is no way that it would pass through parliament at the moment because Labour and the Lib Dems would vote against it and together they have more votes than the Tories.
p2293
aVWell if Cameron managed to get even half of UKIP's supporters back to the Tories, than he would win the election easily.
p2294
aVSo it's easy to see why he's sucking up to them.
p2295
aVAh yes, because things can't change over an 8 year gap?

aVWhen will we get robot overlords whose unwavering opinions are completely immune to a constantly changing world?
p2317
aVHas he thrown out all his principles like Blair did in the 1990s, or is it just this one thing?
p2318
aV&gt;When will we get robot overlordsNext year, if Milliband gets in to office.
p2319
aVcome on now sir.
p2320
aVat a time when negotiations are still going on i think it's unwise to post negative comments about the millibot\u000a\u000aand what i mean by that is that negotiations are still going on and it's unwise to offer negative opinion on a currently untested millibot at a time when the negotiations are still going on  
p2321
aVHave you tried switching him off and on?
p2322
aVWe tried that AND we've patched his bacon sandwhich protocol \u000a\u000afear not citizen.
p2323
aVYou're millibot will be fully functional in time to take high office in 2015
p2324
aVI'd prefer one that can also pass the Turing test.
p2325
aVEDIT: Forgot the word "pass".
p2326
aVI think I would also fail the Turing test.
p2327
aVIt's almost as if politicians say things to get votes rather than say things they actually believe.
p2328
aVor as if things change over an 8 year gap and people's opinion's change to meet those.
p2329
aVPerhaps, I think David Cameron is a conservative, Ed Milliband is a social democrat.
p2330
aVBut I also think that on some issues their opinions matter far less than what will get them votes. 
p2331
aVYou may well be right.
p2332
aVBut this is a garbage post and proves nothing.
p2333
aVOh yeah definitely.
p2334
aVWas just a little joke, didn't mean it as a wholesale statement.
p2335
aVI seem to recall there were some whispers of this years ago when Obama first met Cameron pre-election describing him as a "lightweight" \u000a\u000ahttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/8169382/WikiLeaks-Barack-Obama-regarded-David-Cameron-as-lightweight.html\u000a\u000a
p2336
aVFuck, I'd say whatever the hell I felt the British people wanted if they would make me pm. 
p2337
aVHe flips more than a pancake.
p2338
aVYou have to remember that Cameron said this stuff when the Conservatives were almost dead as a political force.
p2339
aVHe had to appear to be ultra-liberal to get press attention.
p2340
aVSaying stuff like 'Hug a hoodie' was never meant to be a serious political point, just a way of garnering attention during a time of liberal popularity. 
p2341
aVThis makes Cameron c. 2006-07 sound vaguely reasonable. 
p2342
aVBritain having to conform to asian values is reasonable and makes sense?
p2343
aVDude you should just move to sweden and check your privilege on a daily basis.
p2344
aVNot what he said, and I did say vaguely
p2345
aVNah you support this.
p2346
aVYou support Britain having to integrate to "asian values" because you are insane and hate your own culture. 
p2347
aVAlright, sure.
p2348
aVYou're quoting something that he simply didn't say.
p2349
aVHe said:\u000a\u000a&gt;Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around.
p2350
aVIntegrating doesn't mean taking on another cultures values, but instead respecting them and not marginalising them.
p2351
aVGoogle's definition:\u000a\u000a&gt;bring (people or groups with particular characteristics or needs) into equal participation in or membership of a social group or institution.
p2352
aVMeanwhile we let them rape our little girls for years yet we need to be more tolerant of them?
p2353
aVAh yes, let's take a small sample size and totally ignore the fact that White British people commit similar crimes
p2354
aV&gt; 1400 girls getting raped in one town alone by muslims and progressives such as me covering it up is a small sample size as if that makes any sense.
p2355
aV&gt; white British people form rape gangs where they molest children!
p2356
aVBELIEVE ME\u000a\u000aYou are pathetic. 
p2357
aVNo, because what you've done is taken one town in an entire country.
p2358
aVOf course it's a terrible,terrible thing that happened in Rotherham but don't paint all Muslims on the actions of that.
p2359
aVIn 2011 220 people of Asian descent went to jail on sexual offences - a tiny, tiny part of the Asian population and very very similar to the same proportion as white people in jail for similar offences in the same period. 
p2360
aVIt's not even one town.
p2361
aVAlso they don't get arrested because they get called racist by people like you.
p2362
aVWho have I called racist?
p2363
aV"One town" is your words, not mine. 
p2364
aVI said just one town as in one town alone.
p2365
aVThis is likely happening in many muslim areas across england.
p2366
aVAhem, those jobs still existed before the immigrants came.
p2367
aVFucking UKIP
p2368
aVSo what he's a lier and will say what ever he has to in order to get votes.
p2369
aVNo news there.
p2370
aVThe key to being a politician is being able to distance yourself from your words.
p2371
aVSo much for "conservative"
p2372
aVThis makes me sick.
p2373
aVFucking David Cameron, WHATTA DICKHEAD.
p2374
aV45 years ago David Cameron hated bath time, now he bathes everyday.
p2375
aVPS, fuck conservatives. 
p2376
aVI thought this was quite good, actually.
p2377
aVVery Benjamin-Franklin-esque. 
p2378
aVWell spotted.
p2379
aVThe quote in full:\u000a\u000a"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.
p2380
aV" - Benjamin Franklin
p2381
aVI find the spotlight-esque lighting quite disquieting.
p2382
aVThere should be holes in the security fence.
p2383
aVOr the security fence should be made out of cling film or something.
p2384
aVThe type of security people are asking for is of course impossible.
p2385
aVI think it's fitting how the artist doesn't detail any of the builder's faces - it shows how with no privacy, everyone will have to conform and it will be the death of individuality.
p2386
aVAnyone who thinks that privacy is coming back is deluded.
p2387
aVI agree it's annoying but privacy is never coming back.
p2388
aVDoesn't make much sense since their privacy walls ought to double up as a security measure anyway.
p2389
aVThe point is that they're losing elements of their privacy to live within the confines of security - which now includes the security workers \u000a\u000aBrilliant cartoon.
p2390
aVI know what the point is m8.
p2391
aVI just felt like pointing out that it's a bit unrealistic.
p2392
aVThen again, it's a cartoon so it's probably meant to be ;)
p2393
aVThere should be more than one house within the fence.
p2394
aVYeah, at least them and their neighbours exchanging nervous glances, that'd be perfect.
p2395
aVI find these things facile, and it's been done so many times before.
p2396
aVIf they gave a description of the scene instead of drawing it, it wouldn't look so goddamned out of place when they use words to explain the joke.
p2397
aVWow, The Sun behaved unprofessionally I'm so surprised 
p2398
aVThis is outrageous no matter how unsurprising it is.
p2399
aVRupert Murdoch is trying his hardest to subvert our democracy, it's a big deal.
p2400
aVDon't give in to outrage fatigue.
p2401
aV"The Sun: News before it happens!
p2402
aV"\u000a\u000atbh, it's kind of inevitable, I mean, various people have been reporting things that come out of twitter without varifying the facts around them for a while now, why not just go a step further and just make shit up?
p2403
aVIt's ridiculous and hideous and people need to be encouraged to read news from multiple sources.
p2404
aVDoes this not remind you of  the bond villain who creates news for his company to profit on?
p2405
aVHalk confirms this revelation will have exactly zero effect because anyone dumb enough to get their politics from the Sun will be dumb enough not to care.
p2406
aVSadly.
p2407
aVWhat about those smart enough to realise the other papers aren't much better?
p2408
aVThat would be most of the public given current paper circulation figures.
p2409
aVUmm, internet?
p2410
aVInternet media is completely different to print media though.
p2411
aVMainly because people tend to not be inside a political echo chamber.
p2412
aVIt is harder to control the narrative on the internet.
p2413
aVBut most of the people that read the Sun, Times or Grauniad on paper probably read the same online and not necessarily looking for a broader picture. 
p2414
aVI'm just glad you used 'Grauniad' while commenting on a Private Eye post.
p2415
aVThey go on Reddit ;)
p2416
aVI see little point in belittling people who read The Sun.
p2417
aVThey might on average not be the brightest sparks but they're clever enough to earn and buy a paper for a break from something.
p2418
aVIt does matter that a national newspaper is lying to try and influence an election, no matter the peecieved intelligence of the reader.
p2419
aVIntelligent people swallow lies just as well, making yourself feel superior doesn't make you exempt.
p2420
aVIt's not the first time they've made shit up though.
p2421
aVAll that will happen is they'll print a retraction somewhere in the depths of the paper if they're wrong.
p2422
aVWhat needs to happen is some rule gets put in place that says "if something is reported faulsly or incorrectly, then the correction needs to take up the same space and position as the original mistake"\u000a\u000aAlthough then the Sun headlines would alternate between "SHOCKING SHIT THAT HAPPENED!!!!
p2423
aV" and "YESTERDAYS HEADLINE WASN'T BASED ON ANY FACTS OR EVIDENCE!!!
p2424
aV"
aVIt should be written by an independent adjudicator, too.
p2425
aVI'd vote for someone who had that as a policy!
p2426
aVOf course it matters that the paper is lying, that lie will have an effect on the reader's political choice.
p2427
aVWhat OP is saying is that exposing the lie changes nothing.
p2428
aV&gt;Intelligent people swallow lies just as well, making yourself feel superior doesn't make you exempt.
p2429
aVThey really don't.\u000a\u000a
p2430
aVIf the Nazis can happen, they do.
p2431
aVWe're talking about blatant, simple lies in the tabloid press here... Not the nazis.
p2432
aVI'm just saying, if you think intelligent people are less likely to be coehersed then you are mistaken.
p2433
aVI invoke the nazi card legitimately to show that propaganda works on all levels of society.
p2434
aVIts quite simple really.
p2435
aVIf you don't understand something like basic statistics, its ridiculously easy to be mislead by a dramatic looking graph that is actually total bollocks.
p2436
aVHappens all the time.
p2437
aVIf you have a basic grasp of statistics its pretty easy to know if the wool is being pulled over your eyes when people fuck about with graphs.
p2438
aVAlso general knowledge and experience counts for a lot.
p2439
aVLook at how skewed peoples views are about the number of single mothers, immigrants, muslims etc.... are compared to the reality.
p2440
aVI get what you're saying about whole nations occasionally being moved towards extreme ideologies.
p2441
aVBut I think theres a difference between that and people just being told bare faced lies by media that they trust in an effort to make them believe certain things.
p2442
aVThe Sun for example would have a much easier time of manipulating a story than The Guardian or the financial times.
p2443
aVI'm making a distinction here between two people who have the same comprehensive understanding of a subject, but holding different views because of their personal leanings, and two people where one or both of them simply don't understand the subject and for that reason come to different views based on flawed premises.
p2444
aVHey, Godwin!
p2445
aVGodwin be damned, we're talking about propaganda-fuelled populism here. 
p2446
aVThey may still swallow lies, but that does not mean they "swallow lies just as well".
p2447
aVIf intelligence means anything, surely it means the ability to see flaws in reasoning?
p2448
aVWe're not going to get to the bottom of this without a physiologist, really.
p2449
aVI think there is a case for saying intelligent people can be minipulated just as well.
p2450
aVThe approach might be different between intelligence levels of the mark but it could reach the same end.
p2451
aVYour spelling and grammar isn't doing much for your case.
p2452
aVYou have to actually be intelligent before you can make generalisations about intelligent people.
p2453
aVI'm a dyslexic typing on a phone, what going to do about it?
p2454
aVBut cheers for your insult, point well made!
p2455
aVThis is absolutely wrong.
p2456
aVThe Sun plays a huge part.
p2457
aVAbsolutely everybody is encouraged to vote these days and people with no knowledge, pressured to vote, will read this and immediately say "well I better not vote for this guy". 
p2458
aVYou didn't understand what I said, please read it again.
p2459
aVI'm saying that revealing the Sun has a bias will have no effect.
p2460
aVAbsolutely not what you said in anyway.
p2461
aVYour comment was that people dumb enough to get their politics from the Sun are dumb enough not to care.
p2462
aVWell I couldn't disagree more.
p2463
aVPeople are encouraged to vote vociferously, there is no IQ test.
p2464
aVThe Sun is a very influential paper, whether those people have a high IQ or not.
p2465
aVI don't take my views from that paper and I don't suppose you do either but I would certainly guard against assuming others wouldn't. 
p2466
aV&gt;Absolutely not what you said in anyway.
p2467
aVEverybody else seems to have understood it apart from one other guy who apologised for reading it wrong.
p2468
aVDo we have to do this internet thing where you steadfastly refuse to admit you got something wrong?
p2469
aVI'm not saying what the other guy was saying at all.
p2470
aVI have read it over and over again, and I have even used your exact words.
p2471
aVI have a different view to you and automatically I'm refusing I got something wrong?
p2472
aV&gt;Do we have to do this internet thing where you steadfastly refuse to admit you got something wrong?
p2473
aVYes, we do by the looks of things.
p2474
aVYeah ...
p2475
aVI'm not wrong.
p2476
aVYeah I think they're preaching to a mixture of the choir and the bored schoolkids not really paying attention during the sermon. 
p2477
aVLearn some history.
p2478
aVThe sun had a rather large affect in the past.
p2479
aVIt might not even be taken seriously by the people that read it but day after day properganda tends to wear in to people's minds.
p2480
aVLearn to read.
p2481
aVYou did not understand my post.
p2482
aVI'm saying Private Eye exposing the Sun does not matter at all.
p2483
aVOh fair enough that was a failure in my reading compression.
p2484
aVI'll take the hits.
p2485
aVI'd say it's questionable how much effect the Sun has actually had on elections, it's more a case of backing winners than making them.
p2486
aVCertainly when Murdoch shifted the Sun from the left to the right, it's readership remained Labour voting (that was at the time, it's readership may have shifted over the long term, I've not seen any work on that).
p2487
aVYou are right that the real effect they (and our overwhelmingly right wing press in general) have is in framing and limiting the debate, which pushes previously mainstream policy positions to the fringes.
p2488
aVOverall the evidence is that the population as a whole are incredibly discerning when it comes to how they engage with the media (which is a relief), so whilst there are questions about media plurality and press accuracy, we shouldn't worry too much about undue influence directly on our democracy. 
p2489
aVOh, well thats ok then.
p2490
aVDo you have links for the sources?
p2491
aVMore an accumulation from my undergrad and masters years.
p2492
aVI'd say 'Power Without Responsibility' by James Curran and Jean Seaton is a must read if you want a comprehensive introduction to media history and press issues (actually I think the stuff about voting intention of Sun readers is in there)

p2496
aVWell, that's a libel case in the offing then. 
p2497
aVNothing new for the Eye then
p2498
aVTo me what's more egregious is the Mail's reporting - which was after the fact but encouraged a complete misread of the figures\u000a\u000aEd Miliband comes in top of the "who won" poll at 35%.
p2499
aVMail headline?
p2500
aV"Miliband comes out bruised from debate that only a third say he won"\u000a\u000aFuckers.
p2501
aVWhat if...
p2502
aVThe entire debate was heavily scripted.
p2503
aVAnd the sun managed to get their hands on a copy of it.
p2504
aVJust asking questions people.
p2505
aVI really want to quote that bit from Tomorrow Never Dies while he's writing about the fishermen killed in the South China sea and changing the numbers of people killed!
p2506
aV&gt;I really want to quote that bit from Tomorrow Never Dies\u000a\u000aGo on then.
p2507
aVI won't stop you.
p2508
aVYou can't seriously defend this.
p2509
aVYou just look unreasonable. 
p2510
aVIt's a joke. 
p2511
aVGood one. 
p2512
aVI chortled savagely.
p2513
aVMe too.
p2514
aVI honestly can't contain myself.
p2515
aVA lot of people are denying this.
p2516
aVNick Sutton has already tweeted that he only received the page at 10:51, quite a few Sun people are tweeting that the page was designed after 10. 
p2517
aVYup - it's been denied very strenuously.
p2518
aVGiven how tone deaf it was compared to what people really thought of the debate, frankly I'd be more surprised if they hadn't pre-written it.
p2519
aVAs Labours lead continues we're only going to see more of this.
p2520
aVIt's amazing how blatantly misleading and deceitful papers can be without it being illegal.
p2521
aVIt's really bad this time round because Milliband has promised to implement Leveson and clamp down on tax avoidance.
p2522
aVSo it's personal.
p2523
aVits a rag anyway.
p2524
aVif you look at the front pages of the last few weeks, about two thirds of them manage to squeeze a non-story about milliband onto them.
p2525
aVlike "whitehall officials fear milliband as pm", "experts say milliband will steal office of pm with the help of SNP despite having less seats and less votes than the tories"[clearly they dont read their own opinion polls], even bringing the two kitchens thing back for a full page spread a couple of days ago.
p2526
aVpictures of milliband are almost always captioned "failure", "loser"\u000a\u000a      \u000ai cant imagine who is actually persuaded by this
p2527
aVTo be fair to them, you can only judge who "wins" a debate like this subjectively anyway.
p2528
aVIf you are against a certain party, then you'll always find ways to paint things negatively.
p2529
aVThe Sun would never have written anything good, even if Miliband stormed it somehow.
p2530
aV&gt; To be fair to them\u000a\u000aWhy, the fuck, would you want to do that?!
p2531
aV?  
p2532
aVIt'll have a massive impact on voting, because all the Sun readers will believe what they read.
p2533
aVThe Sun can literally print anything and nothing will happen to them, but it'll effect everyone.
p2534
aVIsn't this been standard pratics for quite some time?
p2535
aVI remember the DM accidentally published an article about a court verdict that was the wrong one
p2536
aV&gt;accidentally \u000a\u000a" "
p2537
aVThat's a bit different.
p2538
aVWith that, there were two clear outcomes: guilty or not.
p2539
aVThey'll have had stories written for either eventuality ahead of time in an effort to be first with the news, perhaps with little details left to add in once the verdict was through, and just published the wrong one by mistake.
p2540
aVSloppy, sure, and the DM *are* a shower of shite, but it wasn't quite the same as outright making up a result to fit your narrative before it's even happened.
p2541
aVWhite van man supports UKIP but is too dumb to register to vote.
p2542
aVSee, this is when I don't like Private Eye, when it's being the news equivalent of "Watchdog" and misrepresenting things it either doesn't understand, or worse, does.
p2543
aVIt would seem to me to be entirely standard practise to prep some likely outcomes of a particular event.
p2544
aVI mean, Nigel was always going to stand firm on immigration, and the Sun was always going to say that Miliband had lost the argument.
p2545
aVAdditonally, these were the few words that represent the front pages, not the story within.
p2546
aVThe papers can and do change their headlines after the first edition anyway.
p2547
aVAnd childish downvotes don't make it any less true. 
p2548
aVPrepping likely outcomes is standard practice, publishing them before they've happened isn't.
p2549
aVI think the issue is that it was sent out before the debate had even started.
p2550
aVI would have thought it was bloody well obvious that was the issue.
p2551
aVOh come on.
p2552
aVSee, this is why I don't like you.
p2553
aVSorry, but I just can't join in on every outrage, no matter how well intentioned.
p2554
aVI swear every comment I see from you bitches about downvotes.
p2555
aVSee what you've done /u/Lolworth, you've made me agree with /u/ANAL_McDICK_RAPE

p2559
aVGood to see that the English bar continues to uphold high standards of precision. 
p2560
aVThe two aren't mutually exclusive
p2561
aVTrue, but I would think that being a 'fucking dickhead' is considerably less hateful than being a 'cunt'.
p2562
aVif someone was a fucking dickhead AND a cunt, could you legitimately tell them to go fuck themselves? 
p2563
aVYou could, I think.
p2564
aVFurthermore, I imagine some people would pay a lot of money to see it happen.
p2565
aVparticularly if there was a cheeky girl involved too.
p2566
aVDepends.
p2567
aVIn the UK we can use cunt to describe a best friend or a worst enemy. 
p2568
aVTrue, but then in context any number of words can act as either insult or otherwise.
p2569
aVI don't know.
p2570
aVCunt seems to be one of the words the Americans won't touch with a barge pole.
p2571
aVThe UK and Australia are fine about it, I'm not sure how different countries in Europe feel, nor Africa or Asia, but I often feel that it's like the last 'offensive' word to some people.
p2572
aVTaboo, if you will.  
p2573
aVYes, calling someone a dick is only offensive to the person whereas calling someone a cunt is offensive to all women past, present and future the world over because feminist logic.
p2574
aVYup, that's why, it's not simply because 'cunt' is considered to be a harsher insult than 'dickhead'.
p2575
aVIt's actually all about feminist women and how stupid they are.
p2576
aVIn fact, everything is!
p2577
aVWho decided cunt is a harsher insult than dick then?
p2578
aVThe weighted meanings of insults are not exactly decided by one person.
p2579
aVIt's also not a gender thing, either.
p2580
aVTwat, for example, is roughly similar to dick in terms of offensiveness.  
p2581
aVLike all swear words, the level of insult is purely down to the recipient.
p2582
aVIf you choose to be more insulted by 'dick' than 'cunt', that is entirely your prerogative - perhaps you think 'ham' is more insulting than both.
p2583
aVSaying one word is more insulting than another is like saying apple juice is better than orange juice, it is entirely down to the individual.
p2584
aVThat being said, the media does have a tendency to be less approving of 'cunt', but that doesn't actually mean anything.
p2585
aVThe Daily Mail are more favourable towards the Tories than Labour, doesn't actually mean the Tories are better. 
p2586
aVIf I call someone a cunt though, it's much more likely that a bystander will take offence as well as the person it was aimed at, than if I were to use dick.
p2587
aVOrange juice is also better.
p2588
aVThis is one of those online phenomenons where people pick you apart for not outright stating something that is left implicit in most human speech for the sake of sanity.
p2589
aVIn this case, append "*'cunt' is considered to be a harsher insult than 'dickhead'*" with "*by the majority of individuals*". 
p2590
aVthis has made my day
p2591
aVMet Lembit several times.
p2592
aVCan confirm what the judge said.
p2593
aVHm.
p2594
aVI've met him a few times, and I'd definitely go with the original descriptions.
p2595
aVBit of an over-eager eejit than a proper evil twunt.
p2596
aVAbsolutely right. 
p2597
aVPure gold, love this.
p2598
aVI'd love to know which newspaper has the balls to print those words without asterisks.
p2599
aVLooks like Private Eye
p2600
aVPretty much the only rag worth reading.
p2601
aVI'm always amused at the notion that asterisks make everything ok.
p2602
aVI've seen front page headlines with "F**K" in quite clear view.
p2603
aVWe all know what it says, so I don't quite understand what the point in that pathetic censorship is. 
p2604
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg-Ke36aBh4\u000a\u000a"f**k means fuck more than fuck means fuck".
p2605
aVAh I knew there was something out there.
p2606
aVMany thanks :)
p2607
aVMy favourite use of asterisks was in The Metro some years ago - they quoted someone as calling someone else a "M****rfucker"
p2608
aVYou're kidding?!
p2609
aVThat's amazing!
p2610
aVAh but sure it could have been "feck"
p2611
aVIt's Private eye.
p2612
aVTry a copy, it's very entertaining/outrage inducing reading.
p2613
aV(They don't really believe in the web, but some articles are available there, and some scanned articles can be seen in /r/PrivateEye)
p2614
aVTry a subscription!
p2615
aVIt's ~£20 a year and the best value for money of anything I buy
p2616
aVThanks Ian.
p2617
aVIt took me a while to work up to a subscription as for such a small paper its unbelievably dense so I hadn't always finished it before the new issue was out.
p2618
aVNow I happily subscribe (although I kinda miss being able to buy it before a long train journey or on holidays etc...)
p2619
aVI love Private Eye, but I find it a very depressing read, knowing to what extent our political class is open to lobbying and corruption, and how a great many of our civil servants are hopelessly inept.
p2620
aVIt's Grauniad policy to print swear words in full.
p2621
aVThe asterisks are the preserve of the 'moral outrage' peddling shit-sheets.
p2622
aVBut not necessarily to spell them correctly.
p2623
aVIt is a pity that the Grauniad didn't use technology to simulate the random creativity of their alcoholic typesetter.
p2624
aVWhy haven't I heard about this on BBC News ?
p2625
aVProbably because pre-watershed the content would be confusing and pointless
p2626
aVI'd love to see them try and explain it on the morning news.
p2627
aVDelete as applicable.
p2628
aVWell this sure is a first for me, seeing a political party (of any colour) reject a perfectly legal donation pre-emptively out of ethical rigour.
p2629
aVI can't imagine any of the "Big 3" doing anything quite like this.
p2630
aVIf anyone can point me to any other cases similar to this I would be grateful.
p2631
aVI can imagine more likely is take it, and then beg for forgiveness if they get caught out for it. 
p2632
aVThey rejected £7,000 so I donated £25.
p2633
aVHopefully ~280 other people will do the same and for the first time in a generation we can have a party not in the pocket of special interests.
p2634
aVToday I am mildly ashamed of my overwhelming cynicism towards UKPolitics.
p2635
aVwhere can i donate?
p2636
aVThere's a section on their website:\u000ahttp://greenparty.org.uk/donate/
p2637
aVIt took me two stabs at it as I got 404'd the first time!
p2638
aVdon't feel too bad, you're just being realistic.
p2639
aVUnfortunately, cynicism and realism go hand and hand with regards to politics.
p2640
aVsaid Gordon to Tony, as the tanks rolled into Baghdad
p2641
aVThanks, Satan.
p2642
aV&gt; we can have a party not in the pocket of special interests.
p2643
aVOh my god, those illusions...\u000a\u000aKeep talking the talk greenies, but we've all seen what you do when you're elected.
p2644
aVCuts, cuts, scab, and cuts. 
p2645
aVCan you give some examples of what you mean?
p2646
aVGreen Party is the strongest in two places: Brighton and Bristol.
p2647
aVIf you looked at Green records, Tory records, Labour records, and Lib Dem records, in terms of austerity measures and cuts, they are absolutely indistinguishable.
p2648
aVThat's not hyperbole, I'm being totally serious.
p2649
aVWhere they aren't in power, but have a lot of councillors, they just form coalitions with whoever else and vote for cuts, closures, and attacks just as the other big parties do.
p2650
aVWhere they are in control, like Brighton, they act no different than the tory government.
p2651
aVClose this, shut that, cut this, end that.
p2652
aVIt's as much as bloodbath as Labour council.
p2653
aVAnd when I say scabs, it's because they are.
p2654
aVThey don't support workers fighting to protect their pay or keep their jobs.
p2655
aVCaroline Lucas, for example, during a binmen strike led a group of people to go remove all the waste the binmen weren't removing until they were met in negotiations.
p2656
aVYou might be saying "well it needed to be moved!
p2657
aV", right, but the entire point is that the people removing this waste are under attack, so they're not removing it in order to be able to bargain.
p2658
aVCaroline Lucas, darling of the Green Party, completely undermined it.
p2659
aVIf they'd just come out and say "We don't support worker's rights" then that's one thing, but they have the gall to tell people they do.
p2660
aVActions speak much, much louder than words. 
p2661
aV&gt;Green Party is the strongest in two places: Brighton and Bristol.
p2662
aVIf you looked at Green records, Tory records, Labour records, and Lib Dem records, in terms of austerity measures and cuts, they are absolutely indistinguishable.
p2663
aVThat's not hyperbole, I'm being totally serious.
p2664
aVWhere they aren't in power, but have a lot of councillors, they just form coalitions with whoever else and vote for cuts, closures, and attacks just as the other big parties do.
p2665
aVWhere they are in control, like Brighton, they act no different than the tory government.
p2666
aVClose this, shut that, cut this, end that.
p2667
aVIt's as much as bloodbath as Labour council.
p2668
aVCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't council funding set by central government?
p2669
aVIf the government is giving the councils less money to spend, it seems a bit harsh to then blame the council for spending less money.
p2670
aVPeople usually think this because it's what Labour councils, Lib Dem councils and Green councils love to say as a sort of "wash my hands of any blame".
p2671
aVBut councils can, and have in the past, run on a needs budget - scrapping vanity projects, using reserves, and if absolutely necessary their borrowing power (which sounds scary, but councils borrow money all the time).
p2672
aVIf the Greens acted on their words - they wouldn't enter coalitions with the big three, they wouldn't vote for and support the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres, and homeless support services.
p2673
aVThey could use their national reach, and strength in quite a lot of councils, to oppose the cuts, to prevent Labour, Tory, and Lib Dem minority councils from passing on these cuts.
p2674
aVAnd in places like Brighton, put together a needs budget and force the government to provide more money by refusing to pass on their cuts and by spending the money they should be receiving.
p2675
aVWhen one council does it, it looks like Liverpool Council 1983-87 - alone but fighting for the rights of people in Liverpool to have basic services.
p2676
aVWhen it's done on a larger scale, the government are forced into concessions, because there's nothing else they can do. \u000a
p2677
aV&gt;If the Greens acted on their words - they wouldn't enter coalitions with the big three, they wouldn't vote for and support the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres, and homeless support services.
p2678
aVThey could use their national reach, and strength in quite a lot of councils, to oppose the cuts, to prevent Labour, Tory, and Lib Dem minority councils from passing on these cuts.
p2679
aVAnd in places like Brighton, put together a needs budget and force the government to provide more money by refusing to pass on their cuts and by spending the money they should be receiving.
p2680
aVCan you show some examples of the Greens supporting the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services?
p2681
aVCan you show that the greens promised a needs budget before being elected to council positions?
p2682
aV&gt; Can you show some examples of the Greens supporting the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services?
p2683
aVI don't really know where I can get examples of this online?
p2684
aVBest I can do is put you in touch with someone who can?
p2685
aVhttp://michaeljamesbarker.wordpress.com/  &lt;---- This guy lives in Leicester, and you'll have to forgive the amateurish design, but he's probably the best person I personally know for writing criticisms of the Green Party. \u000a\u000a
p2686
aVSo just some guy talking shite on his blog?
p2687
aVNo, he's a published academic, he writes for journals and all that other stuff they do.
p2688
aVI just linked to the blog because that's how I personally read his stuff, otherwise I'd have to pay to use a university library to access the journals and stuff. 
p2689
aV&gt; No, he's a published academic, he writes for journals and all that other stuff they do.
p2690
aVAppeal to authority.
p2691
aVSo, I can't win?
p2692
aVHe's a qualified and established academic writer, and that's no good, but if he ISN'T that, then he's just "some guy talking shite on his blog".\u000a
p2693
aVI just read [this](http://leicestersocialists.org.uk/?p=2510) article and that guy isn't making anything like the same claims you do. 
p2694
aVNo, he's not me, he has his own opinions.
p2695
aVI linked to him because they asked for some more specific information, and I think that guy will be able to get it. 
p2696
aVI'm not going to go and find your evidence for you.
p2697
aVYou've made it clear you don't have anything to back up anything you've said, that's all I needed to know.
p2698
aVWhat I said was, I don't know how to access council voting records for all the Green dominant councils, and I'm not going to go and google the names of every green councillor and cross reference if with their voting record (assuming such a website exists, like the one for MPs) - and if you believe me not willing to spend the next 5/6 hours doing this is me not having anything to back that particular thing up, then whatever.
p2699
aVYou've chosen to ignore all of my other accusations and the evidences I gave.
p2700
aVIf you had clicked onto some of the articles, you'd have seen his commentary on his experience with Bristol greens.
p2701
aVBut you've chosen to decide he isn't legitimate, without having even looked at it.
p2702
aVAm I restricted to only using people you personally know? 
p2703
aV&gt;You've chosen to ignore all of my other accusations and the evidences I gave.

aVBut you've chosen to decide he isn't legitimate, without having even looked at it.

aVAm I restricted to only using people you personally know?
p2707
aVNobody's opinion is good evidence.
p2708
aVLink to a Green Party candidate or councillor or manifesto declaring their support for a "needs budget".
p2709
aVIf you can't do this, there is absolutely no reason for anything in this thread to believe that the Green Party have gone back on their word by not implementing one.
p2710
aVOr, alternatively, link to anywhere where the Green Party declares their support for closing elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services, or a manifesto declaring that they intend to.
p2711
aVIf you can't produce any of this, why should anyone in this thread believe you when you accuse them of it?
p2712
aVI didn't say they supported a needs budget - they absolutely don't, because they're as bad as the big three - do you even know what a needs budget is?
p2713
aVIf you did, you would have understood my point - they COULD adopt one and run a council that way, they won't, ever, that is my entire bloody point.
p2714
aVJesus Christ this is irritating, I didn't respond to your request for evidence of a green needs budget because it didn't make sense... You might as well have said "Show me evidence the greens support turning david cameron into a hoola-hoop", because they're both something I didn't say.
p2715
aV&gt; Or, alternatively, link to anywhere where the Green Party declares their support for closing elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services, or a manifesto declaring that they intend to\u000a\u000aAgain, did you read what I said?
p2716
aVTHIS IS NOT IN THEIR MANIFESTO.
p2717
aVPlease, please read my bloody comment.
p2718
aV"They're all chat", they talk about how they DON'T do this stuff.
p2719
aVDo you understand?
p2720
aVThey say they DO NOT DO THIS STUFF EVER EVER EVER.
p2721
aVAs for the others, they're EXAMPLES of the kinds of cuts these councils are passing on.
p2722
aVI have ALREADY SAID that I don't know where I can find you an online source for this info.
p2723
aVDo you have any suggestions of a place online?
p2724
aVI don't work online.
p2725
aVWhen I'm active, it's on stalls, with physical leaflets and info.
p2726
aVIs there a repository for this information online?
p2727
aVI'm not saying "I don't have evidence", I'm saying "There's fucking tons of evidence, but you won't accept as evidence me going to council meetings to lobby green councillors only for them to vote for cuts" as evidence, and that's fine, but I don't know how to give you the evidence.
p2728
aVI honestly don't.
p2729
aVYou won't accept me just posting this stuff.
p2730
aVYou want an official document.
p2731
aVAnd if I knew where I could find a link online to give you, I'd fucking give you it.\u000a\u000a
p2732
aVThis is really good news.
p2733
aVAt least politics to them is not all about the money.
p2734
aVOk, they probably did it for a little bit more publicity but it is right that they rejected it in the first place.
p2735
aVGood on the Greens
p2736
aVAgreed, I'd rather hear about parties behaving responsibly by their own accord than after weeks of public pressure in a desperate backtrack.
p2737
aVGood for them, thats what actual "anti-establishment" behaviour in a political party looks like.
p2738
aVMight disagree with them but if all parties were like this we wouldn't be so fucked politically.
p2739
aVcue "hurrdurr" from cynics I guess. 
p2740
aVWhat do you disagree with them on?
p2741
aVI'm pretty sure I'm going to vote for them on Thursday, but if there are good reasons not to, I'd like to know now!
p2742
aV(Other than their nuclear policy)
p2743
aVYep the hysterical absolutism on nuclear power mainly and a couple of other bits where I think its a bit too "anti-market" (Im no free-marketer but there's definitely strong reasons for a lot of it).
p2744
aVI don't think its a deal breaker for me but I'll decide when I vote on thursday between them and Lib Dems, Im fairly pro-europe and have benefited myself from free movement of labour and the single market so thats a main point for me that a party is clear in their policy and their reasoning behind it.
p2745
aVI think they'll come round eventually, and I can understand their point of view as its the same one as here in germany (the point about diverting that investment to renewables is a lot more feasible than people think), even if it was still a dumb decision. 
p2746
aVI gather they are directed on policy by membership votes, the more pro-nuclear members the sooner the party will change position.\u000a
p2747
aVTheir manifesto says no new nuclear power stations, rather than a blanket ban.
p2748
aVI think they're evolving on the issue of nuclear finally...
p2749
aVNuclear power, that is the no.1 thing most people disagree with them on.
p2750
aVI think though that if the party increases in size they may be forced to dump that policy, they have already changed their tone about the reasoning behind the policy maybe it will change further as greater scrutiny is brought to bear.
p2751
aVIt's the same single reason I'm not a green party member/donor.
p2752
aVI always assumed they were too tightly bound to CND etc to ever change their mind on it.
p2753
aVI'd be thrilled to be wrong though.
p2754
aVThey are led by their membership though so perhaps if more pro-nuclear power people joined their views could be changed.
p2755
aVHowever I am one to talk, I have an aversion to joining political parties as I feel you have to accept some degree of hypocrisy by doing so (as you are unlikely to agree with every single policy of the party you join).
p2756
aVTheir aversion to nuclear isn't singularly linked to the waste produced, its also that mining uranium (non-renewable) is very carbon intensive, building the plants is incredibly expensive and it's simply not a viable option to fill the energy gap on the planet because even if we built a 1GW reactor every 1.6 days for 45 years, it would only generate 8TW a year, with a life span of 100 years before we run out of uranium.
p2757
aVWith the expected energy usage of the planet doubling in the near future, that's nowhere NEAR the amount we'd require.
p2758
aVIt is more cost effective, and sensible, to invest in renewable energy and further research into grid level storage.
p2759
aVStats from [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHkWGoD1Ap8)
p2760
aVthere is a difference between UK energy policy and planet wide energy policy :)\u000a\u000aNuclear is a stopgap, but it's a very good stopgap.
p2761
aVhave a play here,it's based on Mcaky's book that is namechecked as the first thing in your linked lecture:\u000a\u000a http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways/31111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111/primary_energy_chart
p2762
aVI like this calculator, and while I accept there is a difference, I wish the world could be a bit more united when it came to having an energy policy that provides energy to the entire planet.
p2763
aVwe can't even manage water or food yet.
p2764
aVmaybe one day :)
p2765
aVI've played with this before, here [my attempt](http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways/20d22g2111cj11110233422001412430244402102303440310231/primary_energy_chart) at meeting our emissions targets for anyone who's interested.
p2766
aVMost 'renewable' energy comes from burning biomass.
p2767
aVGermany tried to cut out nuclear while increasing renewables but the result has been: increased use of coal, increase production of CO2, and some of the highest energy bills in the world.
p2768
aVNuclear isn't just about Uranium and nuclear 'waste' isn't waste at all; it can be re-used by fast-breeder reactors and the like.
p2769
aVThorium, modern fission and, finally, fusion would enable civilisation to flourish for thousands of years.
p2770
aVAlso, to address the numbers you gave: 8 TW would produce something like 70,000 TWh per year (half global energy consumption) for a total of 7,000,000 TWh over 100 years.
p2771
aVI'd like to know how much it would cost to produce 7,000,000 TWh with solar or wind (and I mean real production, not just capacity).
p2772
aVIs that hypocrisy?
p2773
aVIt sounds like compromise to me.
p2774
aVI see voting for a party as the compromise.
p2775
aVIt's just a personal matter, I'm not really a joiner I instead give support from the sidelines to those I think deserve it.
p2776
aVI have no issue with those who do want to join a party of course.
p2777
aVThey change their tone and suddenly find nuclear power to be safe (when it's not being attacked by tsunamis), and you get a bunch of people saying how they're just like all the other parties, changing their mind with the tide.
p2778
aVMy problem with them is that they have made a complete pigs ear of running Brighton and have proven themselves completely incapable of holding real responsibility. 
p2779
aVI have decided to vote green on thursday partly because of this.
p2780
aVThis is the right attitude from a political party.
p2781
aVPutting principles ahead of gain.
p2782
aVIt's such a shame that maintaining such ethics will be to their disadvantage in the political world.
p2783
aVA party...with integrity?
p2784
aVOh my.
p2785
aVThe people who criticise them for this would be just as quick to criticise them for the hypocrisy of accepting the donation.
p2786
aVI guess some people are just hard to please. 
p2787
aV"Green Party decides publicity worth more than £7k donation.
p2788
aV"
aV"Green Party upholds ethics policy on donations which has been in place for... how many years?
p2789
aVQuite a number, I'd wager.
p2790
aV"
aVI doubt there will be anything about this in major papers.
p2791
aVhttp://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1412136.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2014_05_17
p2792
aVNo, what they decided is that morale/publicity of this rejection is worth this 7k aswell as every other prospective donation from similar circumstances.
p2793
aVExactly, the guy was worth £500 million, £7K is peanuts to him.
p2794
aVHe may well have given them more later on.
p2795
aVI hope the extra support they get from the public makes up for their potential losses, but I do honestly think this was a decision based on principle rather than a cold calculation based on the total revenue/support they would gain.
p2796
aVIf they'd have accepted it, the other parties would have shouted hypocrisy.
p2797
aVThat bad publicity would more than negate the £7k.
p2798
aV'Ow that hurt my head' cried the nail.
p2799
aVomg just take all my votes
p2800
aVIt's a gut reaction because it's a moral choice.
p2801
aVIf you made your fortune in a country and rely on that country's infrastructure and people for your wealth, IMO you owe that country to pay your full taxes there.
p2802
aVOther people paid their taxes for you and you benefitted.
p2803
aVWhat puts you, as a successful businesses person, above the community that raised you?
p2804
aVThey will be the ones who suffer, in the long run.
p2805
aVyoung voter here.
p2806
aVIs the Green party against science?
p2807
aVEdit: Forgive my ignorance.
p2808
aV&gt;  Is the Green party against science?
p2809
aVNo.
p2810
aVThat is just a view perpetuated because of the fact that they are against nuclear energy (and to a certain extent GMOs, but they're more against the way that the patent systems exist than GMOs themselves).
p2811
aVThey have a whole, detailed section on their site about their [science and technology policies](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/st.html).
p2812
aVRead it and decide for yourself whether you agree with it or not.
p2813
aVThat cleared some things up, thanks.
p2814
aV&gt; and to a certain extent GMOs, but they're more against the way that the patent systems exist than GMOs themselves\u000a\u000aIf that were true, they wouldn't have advocated destroying an experiment at a research facility where there were no patent issues.
p2815
aVOne of their elected representatives was also planning to attend this stupid event.
p2816
aVThey are anti-GMO because they have a tendency to be reactionaries.

aVsource?

aVhttp://www.latentexistence.me.uk/why-take-the-flour-back-are-wrong-and-im-leaving-the-green-party/
p2819
aVNo the Greens (despite a few digressions, because hey there are idiots everywhere) are probably the most pro science party in the UK
p2820
aVI am curious as to why you ask that.
p2821
aVBeing anti-nuclear and anti-GMO gives them a bad rep.
p2822
aVI don't understand why the Greens are considered anti science for their policy on nuclear and GM while UKIP who are climate change deniers get a clean rap.
p2823
aVI will be voting Green despite being pro GM myself and having nothing against nuclear.
p2824
aVThere are no parties that I agree with 100%.
p2825
aVPersonally I don't think the greens are anti-science, I was simply explaining as to why a person may think they were.
p2826
aVI agree, UKIP are a joke in terms of their stance on climate change.
p2827
aVI think the problem with them and reason that they're getting away with it is that everybody is spending so much time branding them as racist that it's strangling all chance of outing UKIP on some of their more ridiculous policies.
p2828
aVSome science, they'll believe in the overwhelming scientific consensus about global warming but ignore the overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety of genetically modified food. 
p2829
aVSafety is a small part of the argument.
p2830
aVThe real reason to reject GMO is because the process of copywriting that which springs forth from the earth is massively unethical and hands control of the most basic resources to Corporation, who will then decide who eats what.  \u000a  \u000a 
p2831
aVPatent law protection ensures that those who invest billions in advancing technology and science are able to make their investors' money back so they can continue employing people and developing new things.
p2832
aVIf I invest a billion into developing a new technology and then Bob can take my research for free and use it to make stuff, leaving me high and dry with no way to make my initial money back, then that's not very fair imho. 
p2833
aV\u000aPotatoes exist already.
p2834
aVThey do not need inventing by 'advance technology and science'.
p2835
aVTry innovating.\u000a 
p2836
aVLuckily potatoes aren't patented.
p2837
aVNew, superior varieties of potatoes that companies have spent many years and much money developing, however, may be.
p2838
aVBut based on a stolen design.\u000a
p2839
aV&gt;The real reason to reject GMO is because the process of copywriting that which springs forth from the earth is massively unethical and hands control of the most basic resources to Corporation, who will then decide who eats what.
p2840
aVIt's precisely attitudes like this that turn people off the green party.. Just fantastical hippy dippy nonsense.
p2841
aV&gt;Copyrighting that which springs forth from the ground \u000a\u000aYea 'springs forth', after years of R&amp;D and billions of dollars of investment.
p2842
aV&gt; hands control of the most basic resources to Corporation, who will then decide who eats what.
p2843
aVThis is just bizarre.
p2844
aVHow precisely do you see this happening? 
p2845
aVNo.
p2846
aVAnd being young isn't sufficient disclaimer for saying dumb things.
p2847
aVThey asked a question - that's not dumb.
p2848
aVAll questions are clever ?
p2849
aVNot necessarily clever =) But asking a question is never dumb, unless you're just asking so that you can then steamroll in with some 'answer' you already had in mind to rant about.
p2850
aVI don't think it's helpful to call someone stupid for asking something, personally.
p2851
aVEverybody's ignorant about something.
p2852
aVYes.
p2853
aVThe publicity this move will generate is worth 100 000.
p2854
aVSmart move
p2855
aVI hope it does, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even mentioned in the national press.
p2856
aVFirstly it's a good news story, and secondly it's not about UKIP.
p2857
aVWhen's the last time we read 'Political Party does something ethical'?\u000a
p2858
aV[deleted]
p2859
aVI'd say they're against using non-dom status as a tax avoidance loophole. 
p2860
aVGiven this... yeah, I imagine they are.
p2861
aVI am a UKIP voter but credit to the Greens for standing by what they support and not buckling.
p2862
aVI actually admire the Greens for going against the main three parties like UKIP and have no issues due to my true socialist roots with people voting Green.
p2863
aVI want out of the EU and then I can go back to voting for a socialist party that serves purely in the interests of Britain.
p2864
aVPretty sure the Greens want out of EU too, its not just UKIP.
p2865
aVThe Greens are pro-EU.
p2866
aVTalk about shooting yourself in the foot.
p2867
aVIt's all very well patting themselves on their collective back for the ethical fortitude, but when they cry about not having the exposure coverage of the other parties, I will sit back and laugh.
p2868
aVHad it been a £1m donation they would have taken it and shut up.
p2869
aV£7000 is nothing to even a medium sized political party.
p2870
aVTheir publicity is worth more than that.
p2871
aVAnd as to the article itself, I hardly think not paying income tax on money which you *didn't even make in the UK* is really tax evasion.
p2872
aVPresumably his operations in other countries are taxed at the local rate there? 
p2873
aVThis is why they can't get anywhere as a party. 
p2874
aVSo you say reject principle and take cold, hard cash?
p2875
aVNoble, but foolish.
p2876
aVNobody's going to remember this next week and they will still be un-elected.
p2877
aV£7 000 wouldn't get them elected either but it does give them some positive press coverage today and the ability to criticise others who do accept donations from non-tax payers in the future.
p2878
aVCrucially though, it is also doing right by their supporters which is where the green party derives most of its power from.
p2879
aVHell yes, lets face it, there's few massive corporations who want the Green Party to win... so they may as well not bend over for them and stick with people power.
p2880
aVThey have more MPs than UKIP
p2881
aVWith about a third of the votes.
p2882
aVHurray for FPTP, as I'm sure you meant to add?
p2883
aVI'm not a great fan of FPTP but the greens won that seat because they were the most popular in that area.
p2884
aVOn a micro scale it's a success that they won.
p2885
aVCertainly helps when all three major parties also have substantial votes, resulting in a four-way split - she had the [thirteenth lowest winning share of the vote since 1945](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election_records#Lowest_winning_share_of_the_vote), less than a third of the votes cast...\u000a\u000aWould be interesting to see what would've happened there under an alternate voting system, where would the Lib Dem and Tory votes have gone had their candidates been eliminated I wonder.
p2886
aVAh didn't realise that, pretty stupid then.
p2887
aVI reckon even more people would have had green as their first choice.
p2888
aVOh of course
p2889
aVbecause we'll elect the Lying Crooks again ?
p2890
aVUnfortunately putting ideology over practicality isn't the best idea if you want to accomplish anything outside of a sense of personal pride, in my experience atleast.
p2891
aVI assume you oppose UKIP putting ideology over practicality by repeatedly refusing to vote in the European Parliament, then?
p2892
aVThere isn't much practicality in voting in the EU at all though.
p2893
aVWhy not?
p2894
aVThe votes don't mean anything, if something doesn't pass, the comissioners can just keep putting it through until it does.
p2895
aVAnd our MEPs comprise only 8.6% of the EU parliament.
p2896
aV&gt;  if something doesn't pass, the comissioners can just keep putting it through until it does.
p2897
aVDoes our Parliament operate in a substantially different way?
p2898
aVI'm not too sure on the precise mechanics of either.
p2899
aVAlso, if something doesn't pass at first, putting it through again and again doesn't make it magically more likely to pass.
p2900
aVIt's not a fruit machine.
p2901
aV&gt; And our MEPs comprise only 8.6% of the EU parliament.
p2902
aVWell, yeah.
p2903
aVWhat's your point?
p2904
aVUKIP make up about 3% of the vote, so their votes are pointless.
p2905
aVThat's the same logic that leads people not to vote at all, because "one vote won't make a difference.
p2906
aV"
aVThey do vote though.
p2907
aVThey vote no, which is in interest of everyone who votes for them
p2908
aVThat just seems petulant, especially when you're voting against [tackling the ivory trade](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-criticised-after-its-meps-vote-no-on-a-resolution-to-tackle-world-ivory-trade-9278390.html).
p2909
aVThe ivory trade  is already illegal in the UK, why should we be forcing laws on other countries instead of letting them decide for themselves?
p2910
aVSo they should have  taken the money to advance their ideology ?
p2911
aVOr refused the money to demonstrate their practicality ?
p2912
aVWhy are people even saying this is an ethical decision?
p2913
aVIt's a shameless attempt to link to the recent leitmotif of tax evasion, yet he's done nothing wrong!
p2914
aVWhy should he have no right to donate?
p2915
aVHe's done nothing *illegal*.
p2916
aVCheating on your partner isn't *illegal*, but I still would rather not be friends with you.
p2917
aVRestrain having a gut reaction about this - think about what I said.
p2918
aVWhy should someone be forced to pay taxes in just one country if you live in one and do the majority of your business in another?
p2919
aVHow would it be socially equitable to remove the the requirement to pay tax in either the country you do business OR the country you are living in?
p2920
aVYou should pay tax in both as you have a stake in both. 
p2921
aVIt's a gut reaction because it's a moral choice, not just a legal one, IMO.
p2922
aVWhen you're taxed after creating a successful businesses, those taxes aren't just about what you're doing now.
p2923
aVYou're paying back all the state funds you - we all - benefit from when we don't have a successful business or a nice hedge fund to support ourselves.
p2924
aVBusiness people are helping support the community they were raised in with that money, and by leaving they're cutting off support to many people they actually owe somewhat for their success.
p2925
aVThat's true on a national scale or a local one.
p2926
aVIf he created a successful business in the UK - he was taxed at the time.
p2927
aVSo, a quick question.
p2928
aVWhere do you think he should be paying his tax?
p2929
aVI could understand the issue if he wasn't a UK tax payer at all but he pays in both countries!
p2930
aVI fail to see the furore over this. 
p2931
aV"Business people are helping support the community they were raised in with that money, and by leaving they're cutting off support to many people they actually owe somewhat for their success.
p2932
aVThat's true on a national scale or a local one.
p2933
aV"\u000a\u000aSo what about individuals that migrate?
p2934
aVOr does this perspective only apply to average working people and not business owners?
p2935
aVIf they've genuinely migrated then so be it.
p2936
aVThere's nothing the government could do.
p2937
aVIf they're returning after arbitrary deadlines as a way of avoiding paying the standard amount of tax, then they're cheating the system and should feel bad about it.
p2938
aVSo there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with paying tax in two countries then, and the judgement we're making (with very little information to go on) is that he's gaming the system?
p2939
aVIs that it?
p2940
aV&gt;Mr Tabatznik is registered to vote in the UK and has a house here  \u000a  \u000a&gt;However, his non-dom tax status means while he pays tax on his UK income, money accrued abroad is out of reach of the taxman  \u000a  \u000aHe is gaming the system.
p2941
aV"money accrued abroad is out of reach of the taxman".
p2942
aVThat's not gaming the system.
p2943
aVGo ask migrant British labour in Dubai whether they're gaming the system?
p2944
aVThat's perceived differently despite being pretty much identical. 
p2945
aVDo they vote in the UK?
p2946
aVYes, they do.
p2947
aV"If you are a British citizen living overseas you are entitled to vote in UK general elections and European elections for up to 15 years after moving abroad.
p2948
aV"
aVSo he should pay all his tax in the UK including tax on income made entirely outside the UK should he?
p2949
aVHow is that fair?
p2950
aVDownvotes, but no actual explanation as to why you think this is unethical.
p2951
aVI would certainly like to hear one but I won't hold my breath. 
p2952
aVThis is very good reason why you should NOT vote on them.
p2953
aVThey don't know how to manage money.
p2954
aVSeeing the leader's debate, I think Cameron felt a little extra betrayed every time Clegg insulted coalition policies. 
p2955
aVI would expect he's pretty damn frustrated after being so close, yet so far from being able to exact any of the changes he wanted to.
p2956
aVI can't imagine his job has been a happy one at all.
p2957
aVNot surprised at all.
p2958
aVLol this was originally from /r/blackpeopletwitter when they switched to "whitepeopletwitter" on April Fool's Day.

aV**I doubt Nick's allowed to touch.
p2975
aVAnd definitely not on the mouth.
p2976
aV**\u000a\u000a'Hm what?
p2977
aV' he replied, reluctantly opening his eyes and looking up, seeing the face of his deputy.
p2978
aV'You can't fall asleep here,' Nick said, lightly chuckling.
p2979
aV'Is there something wrong, David?
p2980
aV**Are you having guilt about rising tuition fees and cutting benefits for the disabled?
p2981

p2982
aV**Unfortunately it's a 4 hour wait at A&amp;E and a two week wait for a GP appointment**'\u000a\u000a'Mm headache,' the Prime Minister muttered, rather uncharacteristically as he rubbed at his eyes again.
p2983
aVNick hadn't moved his hand, he also noted.
p2984
aVNot that he was complaining.
p2985
aVThe touch of the other man was quite\u2026comforting\u2026 **as it had been many years since Eton**\u000a\u000a'Let me get you something for it,' **a shotgun?

p2989

aV'I do, but so do you.

aVCheryl Gillan, I think
p3015
aVLooks like a traitor. 
p3016
aVClegg has done such a great job and all people ever talk about are those bloody fees.
p3017
aVNick Clegg is a great politician and the Liberal Democrats are a great party, they're going to do terribly in the election and it is an absolute shame. 
p3018
aV&gt;all people ever talk about are those bloody fees.
p3019
aVWell if you make something a centerpiece of your election campaign and sign a pledge publicly to do the same people will remember it.
p3020
aV&gt;they're going to do terribly in the election and it is an absolute shame.
p3021
aVShouldn't have gone into coalition with the Tories then.
p3022
aVMost people who voted Lib Dem last time did not want their vote propping up a Conservative government.
p3023
aVI will concede they have done [some positive things in the coalition](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/) but most of their voters(at the 2010 election) did not want their vote to contribute towards Cameron being PM.\u000a
p3024
aVI think the Lib Dems did what any reasonably large third party would have done.
p3025
aVStaying in opposition at the time of worst economic crisis in living memory would not have been good for their polling either.
p3026
aVAny third party?
p3027
aVI think UKIP are a bunch of rats, but can you see them getting into a coalition by voting no on having an EU referedum?
p3028
aVNo, because fucked as their priorities are, they'll stick to them.
p3029
aVopposition polls better during economic problems, not worse.
p3030
aVThey would have been accused of bottling their big chance to have an impact.
p3031
aVThere would have been outrage had they tried to prop up labour, too.
p3032
aVBasically there was no scenario in which they didn't get burned.
p3033
aVReally?
p3034
aVI think if they had said the tories had wanted them to act against their principles and so agreement could not be met, and then let the government run in minority, then people would have respected that.
p3035
aVThey would have had more compromising power, they wouldn't have had to threaten their own MPs to vote against their wishes.
p3036
aVThey'd have had more respect than trading anything for the first taste of power, which is what we see this as now.
p3037
aVBesides, each MP had a choice on the fees vote.
p3038
aVThey could do what Mr Bossman whip said, and be given a treat like 28 did, or keep their word and be a real democratic representitive, taking the hit to career chances that that costs, like 21 did.
p3039
aVNot if they've shirked all responsibility and left the UK with a government that can't pass any policies. 
p3040
aVReally?
p3041
aVShirked responsibility?
p3042
aVIt was their responsibility to go against their principles and promises so a few guys could get ministry jobs?
p3043
aVI think they did shirk their responsibilities as it happens.
p3044
aVIf we'd had leadership by minority we could still have passed policies but they would have been a LOT more compromised.
p3045
aVAnd either way, yes the opposition of a hands tied government still polls higher when the country is doing badly.
p3046
aVLook, firstly I don't think they did go against their principals by entering government.
p3047
aVThey got far more of their policies passed than they would have done if they had gone with confidence and supply and picked and chose which Tory bills to pass.
p3048
aVYes maybe they made mistakes in the negotiating processes but I think the idea that they gave up all they believed in is simply untrue.
p3049
aVSecondly, even if you completely disagree with what I just said, if the UK had been left with a minority government, it's likely there would have been a confidence crisis and the economy would have crashed even further.
p3050
aVNow whether that wily have actually been the Lib Dem's fault or not, many would see that they had a chance to form a stable government and they didn't.
p3051
aVIt wouldn't be hard to spin it as if they were to blame and I think they would almost certainly suffer in popularity. \u000a\u000a
p3052
aVI didn't say they went against their principles by going into government, I said they went against their principles TO get into government.
p3053
aVI think all the rest is just an attempt at after the fact reasoning.
p3054
aVIt's not like people are bemoaning them that they didn't get lords reform, or make strides in drug reform or bring in PR.
p3055
aVThese are things they said they would do if in power, but they didn't have the chance to do, so we get that.
p3056
aVThe difference with the fees vote was that they **100% had the ability to keep their word!
p3057
aV** They didn't promise that fees wouldn't go up, they promised (and campaigned around the country signing documents that stated) **they would never vote for a rise** all that would have taken was voting how they had promised, which 21 lib dems MPs did, against whip wishes.
p3058
aV28 went against their word.
p3059
aVAn MP has the power to vote how he wishes even if the whips threaten repercussions to their career.
p3060
aVThat is what people are pissed off about, that's why nobody can trust them again.
p3061
aVI feel bad for the 21 (and 8 or so who abstained) but the leadership and high players in the party sold out a generation and then harped on about fairness the whole next five years.
p3062
aVThey said they'd never do something, then did it.
p3063
aVWhen your job is being sent to run the country how you said you would, thats unrecoverable.
p3064
aVAnd now you know how the yanks felt with Obama. 
p3065
aVAs far as I know the only promise he made was to shut down guantanamo, then he started the process on day one, but congress repeatedly blocked any legislation to do anything else about it.
p3066
aVSo he didn't have the power to do what he wanted, he didn't outright vote against shutting it down.
p3067
aVWhilst I agree with your point, I feel it's essential to look back to five years ago when the idea of a coalition was very alien to English voters (Scotland and Wales having had them, not sure on NI) and the view being that without a formal arrangement the minority Tory government would limp on, blame the lack of seats and call a snap election which all indications said that a country sick of inaction in the face of global financial meltdown would deliver a Tory majority.
p3068
aVSo, it was Lib-Lab ("coalition of losers") or an eventual Tory majority.
p3069
aVIt's easy to forget how weak the LDs bargaining position was as the Tories would have preferred to say "see these LD oiks wouldn't think of the country, so give us a proper mandate this time".
p3070
aVHaving said all that, not making It clear that tuition fees was a red line was stupid and has damaged them.
p3071
aVGetting in bed with the Tories?
p3072
aVPersonally, I won't vote for them until I see change because I was very uncomfortable with them propping up the right-wing agenda but many others would have punished them for not taking the chance to get to power.
p3073
aVWho will ever know which would have cost them more?
p3074
aVThis time, the LDs have a strong bargaining position as Lab won't want to go back to the polls quickly.
p3075
aVIronically, if they can really pull off the 'moderating influence' bit again they will look like the more experienced party in a Lib-Lab coalition. 
p3076
aV&gt; call a snap election which all indications said that a country sick of inaction in the face of global financial meltdown would deliver a Tory majority.
p3077
aVSource.
p3078
aVLib Dem proponents use this excuse every time and there is no evidence to support it.
p3079
aVThe evidence and polls actually suggest Labour would have closed the gap once GB had stood down and before the anti Ed propaganda machine kicked in. 
p3080
aVThe Tories had money left in their campaign chest, nobody else did... 
p3081
aVAll the new lib voters would have gone hard onto labour to keep tories out once it was clear what would happen.
p3082
aVVarious polls after showed lib dem voters said they would have voted labour had they known lib dems would have joined tories.
p3083
aVMoney is one aspect but don't forget the disarray that Gordon Brown's summary exit would have caused (a house divided...).
p3084
aVAlso, the Tories would have had all the economy stuff (Greece, Spain) in the background and the Liam Byrne note in their pockets. 
p3085
aV[deleted]
p3086
aVWhat they did wasn't popular but it was what needed to be done to get this country moving forward.
p3087
aVThe collapse of a coalition would have been terrible in a time of economic crisis.
p3088
aVHe put the interests of the country ahead of political points and he has been punished for it and that is bad for our political system.\u000a\u000a
p3089
aV[deleted]
p3090
aVYeah...
p3091
aVExactly, the coalition would have collapsed and we would have had to have gone through another period of political stagnation as they tried to form a new government and that would be terrible for the country. 
p3092
aV[deleted]
p3093
aVThe Lib Dems would not have gained votes through bringing down the coalition and forcing another election.
p3094
aVIf they had done it early in 2010 the further uncertainty would have been economically damaging and would be spun as the fault of the Lib Dems.
p3095
aVAccording to commentators Labour were bankrupt and unable to afford another election fight.
p3096
aVYou would most likely have given the Conservatives more votes after a difficult few months.
p3097
aVI think that would have been worse for the country.
p3098
aVIt might have resulted in the Lib Dems getting more votes at this election having not signed off on tuition fees and still playing the underdog.
p3099
aVHence I agree with /u/mixturemash - the decision of the Lib Dems to form a coalition was better for the country and damaging for the party.
p3100
aVThe Tories would have likely taken a majority with the Lib Dems and Labour losing seats and the Lib Dems taking a serious credibility hit when it came out the Tories were offering them in terms of a coalition agreement.
p3101
aVTuition fees would have come in regardless, possibly unlimited tuition fees and they would have lost credibility as a possible party of government having plunged the country into political and economic turmoil, there was no good solution for the Lib Dems after they made a promise they couldn't fulfil given the likely hung parliament and probable coalition.
p3102
aVIn the event of a GE following the Lib Dems leaving the coalition, why would you expect the Tories to gain a majority?
p3103
aVMost likely outcome would be the way the polls are now (without the SNP swing if before the referendum, so maybe even a Labour majority).
p3104
aVEven with a Labour government you would have almost certainly had an increase in tuition fees, for the constituency of people who voted Lib Dems because of their pledge to not vote for tuition fees there was no good outcome available.
p3105
aVThe only mistake they made was making that pledge.
p3106
aVNo, you're twisting.
p3107
aVIf there is need for a No Confidence Motion there should be, despite the political stagnation it causes.
p3108
aVBut the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were able to come to a very reasonable agreement so it is right that they did that because in this case there was clearly no need for unnecessary political stagnation. 
p3109
aV[deleted]
p3110
aVSure.
p3111
aVI see your point, but leaving the Conservatives in an unworkable place would mean a worse off economy. 
p3112
aV&gt;Well if you make something a centerpiece of your election campaign and sign a pledge publicly to do the same people will remember it.
p3113
aVExactly... hilariously, this little gem of a campaign video begins with a shot of a flyer that says "no student tuition fees"\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLR8R9JXz4\u000a\u000aClegg did well in the debate but stands a good chance of losing his seat at the election, because he's like an inverse Farage - prepared to do what's needed instead of what's popular, and totally clueless about what's popular.
p3114
aV[MFW OP expects the Lib Dems to deliver on promises made on the premise of a majority as a minority government.
p3115
aV](http://i.imgur.com/6cwz4ll.gif)\u000a\u000aGod knows I won't vote Lib Dem in May, but I don't think Clegg entered the coalition to willingly renege on his policies and deliberately make life worse for his voters.
p3116
aVAnyone who criticises him for 'a lack of effort' and the like should spend a month in his position and try and get some extremely left-wing legislation of their own passed in the Commons.
p3117
aVGood fucking luck.
p3118
aVWhat else were they supposed to do, contradict their much larger coalition partner at the first hurdle?
p3119
aVYes it was a flagship policy that won them a lot of support, but on the premise that they would have a majority, like all political policies.
p3120
aVYou're criticising them for not enacting a policy that they couldn't enact in the first place.
p3121
aVThey didn't have a majority, and their dominant coalition partners were hostile to the proposal.
p3122
aVYeah, he could have ended it by switching sides and working with the opposition to force a vote of no confidence on his own government, which would have been perhaps the single greatest act of political suicide ever seen in Westminster.
p3123
aVNo one would ever agree to work with him again after he had deliberately co-operated with the leader of the opposition.
p3124
aVIt would tarnish the Lib Dem's reputation as a party, and they would undoubtedly lose seats in the subsequent election because who would vote for a party that doesn't have confidence in its own position?
p3125
aVThere would never be a Con/Lab coalition, especially not after a Labour-backed vote of no confidence.
p3126
aVSo what result could you possibly have except the same coalition as before, but with Clegg hounded out of Parliament and the Lib Dems having fewer seats (thus less influence in the Commons) than they had in the first place?
p3127
aV**TL;DR: Stop ragging on Clegg guys, I won't vote for the man but holy shit you couldn't do any fucking better in his position**
p3128
aVYou clearly don't grasp what actually happened.
p3129
aVThe tuition fee promise was absolutely not contingent on winning a majority.
p3130
aVThey sign promises with the NUS that they would not vote to raise tuition fees in the next Parliament and would lobby the government to scrap them.
p3131
aVI would still say LibDems are most in line with my political views, I rank the treasonous erosion of our civil liberties as the single most important issue, but the LibDems who voted for the increase after promising not to are straight up cunts.
p3132
aVYou clearly don't grasp what actually happened.
p3133
aVThey signed promises that they would not vote to raise tuition fees, yes, but then find themselves as the sole party capable of creating a government, *by forming the minority part of a coalition with a party that ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THIS.
p3134
aV*\u000a\u000aThey had the choice of genuinely influencing government policy on a massive range of issues, [as has been pointed out](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/), or alternatively sacrificing five years of parliamentary power over a single issue that the majority of the electorate doesn't give a flying fuck about.
p3135
aVWhat would you do?
p3136
aVOh don't be so obtuse.
p3137
aVThey promised not to vote for an increase.
p3138
aVThey should have at the very least abstained.
p3139
aVPeople like you would allow politics to remain morally bankrupt in this country. 
p3140
aVYeah, they promised not to vote for an increase, *whilst campaigning*.
p3141
aVCircumstances change.
p3142
aVI'm not being obstuse, I'm being pragmatic, as they were.
p3143
aVThey should have abstained from what, forming a coalition?
p3144
aVThe exact same result would have happened, only they would have had absolutely no parliamentary influence for five years, rather than some.
p3145
aVBut go ahead and tell me that I'm the problem if it makes you feel better.
p3146
aVNo one cares whether or not you think they're morally bankrupt for acting as they did.
p3147
aVThe world isn't run on ideals.
p3148
aVWe'll see how much people care after the next election.
p3149
aVI strongly suspect that people will be annoyed that the LibDems broke their word and opinions of people like you who excuse them will be a fart in the wind.
p3150
aVWell yes, the Lib Dems are not going to fare well.
p3151
aVI strongly suspect that people will be incapable of appreciating the position they found themselves in and opinions of people like me who have a perspective that is wider than just university fees will be like a fart in the wind.
p3152
aVI should make clear that I have no issue with the LibDems forming a government with the Conservatives.
p3153
aVThe country needed a strong government and the LibDems tonned down Tory efforts to do things like repeal the HRA.
p3154
aVMy issue is not that they did not introduce a manifesto promise but they signed a declaration with the NUS stating they would not vote for an increase and broke it very quickly.
p3155
aVAnyway it's a shame the party is done for.
p3156
aVI have no issues with the LibDems who abstained. 
p3157
aVSo what would you have had them done?
p3158
aVEndanger that strong government you said the country needed over an issue they couldn't hope to win?
p3159
aVMy word is my bond.
p3160
aVI would have said I promised not to do this so I won't.
p3161
aVThe coalition agreement would have gone ahead anyway. 
p3162
aVThug4lyfe.
p3163
aVThere is absolutely no certainty whatsoever that the coalition agreement would have gone ahead anyway, and the chances of the Tories simply letting this issue slide were precisely jack shit.
p3164
aVEither the Lib Dems dropped this issue, or the coalition didn't form.
p3165
aVYou can't create a government out of two parties and then expect it to function when one immediately advocates a policy that the other detests.
p3166
aVSo it was fine for the Tories to advocate for a rise in tuition fees a policy the LibDems detest? 
p3167
aVUh, yeah, why shouldn't the Tories advocate for it?
p3168
aVThey could actually enact it.
p3169
aV100% my 2010 thinking !
p3170
aVThe global economy *was* crashing at the time of 2010 general election.
p3171
aVSo Nick Clegg made a brave choice to give the British people the stable government they needed to help them through the crash and was able to be major influence stopping alot of tory policies and putting through some lib dem ones
p3172
aVI don't think it's strictly to do with what they did (even if this is important too), but also to do with the fact that we have more than three parties competing at the moment. 
p3173
aVI was at the Lib Dem special conference in Birmingham, at which the members officially endorsed the coalition.
p3174
aVMost were so excited about finally being in government, and finally able to enact some 'liberal policy', that they failed to grasp the inevitable outcome.
p3175
aVThe recently dethroned Dr Evan Harris, stepped up to give a speech.
p3176
aVHe received a rapturous ovation.
p3177
aVHe warned the crowd that the coalition will be a big mistake, that teaming up with the Tories will inevitably isolate vast sections of Lib Dem support.
p3178
aVHe received many cheers of agreement during the speech.
p3179
aVAfter the speech, he received another rapturous ovation.
p3180
aVThey then voted unanimously to join the coalition.
p3181
aVA student stepped up to make a speech about an amendment to the coalition agreement, to ensure no Lib Dem support for increasing tuition fees.
p3182
aVHe received many cheers of support from the crowd.
p3183
aVA Lib Dem Councillor, sat to my right, whispered to me "but where do these people think the money is going to come from?
p3184
aVIf the students don't pay, then the money has to come from somewhere, and we just can't afford it.
p3185
aV" She then voted in favour of the amendment, along with the crowd.
p3186
aVThe party subsequently ignored the amendment.
p3187
aVThere was the leader of a large, northern city council, giddy with excitement at forming a government for the first time in his life time.
p3188
aV12 months later, he was shocked and despondent at losing his seat, and control of the council, in the local elections.
p3189
aVThe trouble with the Lib Dems, as I observed during my time as a Lib Dem activist, is that while most of their members are well-meaning individuals, they tend to be naive, and gullible to their own propaganda.
p3190
aVThey allowed the party leadership to be taken over by 'Tories in disguise'.
p3191
aVWhen faced with a choice between Chris Huhne, a much respected party stalwart, and Nick Clegg, they chose the latter, because he was saying the exact same things as Huhne, but with more charisma and with a more handsome face.
p3192
aVWhen they started to regret this decision, Huhne was eliminated over a rather petty 'scandal', involving a driving offence and a disgruntled ex-wife.
p3193
aVThe coalition was safe.
p3194
aVAfter the annihilation of the Lib Dems at the 2011 local elections, a clear backlash for coalition policy, I drank through the early hours of the morning with some of the fallen Councillors.
p3195
aVEven after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, few were able to admit to any perspective on their downfall.
p3196
aVAs if there was nothing they could do about it, and blamed the electorate for being stupid.
p3197
aVTheir tactics at the 2010 General Election, in an attempt to win a seat in a Labour stronghold, was to 'squeeze the Tory vote'.
p3198
aVIt almost worked, but it meant being disingenuous about things like immigration.
p3199
aVRather than to emphasise their left-wing policies, to a predominantly Labour (albeit disgruntled with New Labour) electorate.
p3200
aVI finally gave up all hope for the party after the response to the London riots in 2011.
p3201
aVSuddenly these 'liberals' became knee-jerk fascists, wanting to 'throw the book' at anyone involved.
p3202
aVAs for Clegg doing a 'great job'.
p3203
aVDoes this include agreeing to invade Libya, on evidence which turned out to be false?
p3204
aVPart of the reason I supported Lib Dems in 2010 was their anti-war sentiment.
p3205
aVClegg shit all over that theory\u000a
p3206
aVInteresting read, thanks for the perspective.
p3207
aVTrials of a party with little in government experience I suppose. 
p3208
aVI actually thought Clegg did the best in the Magnificent 7, \u000aand i am a YES voter.
p3209
aVYes to what?
p3210
aVhashtagindyref
p3211
aVWell when you go round the country promising to never vote a certain way on something, and the.
p3212
aVimmediately vote that way, adding £18,000 of debt to hundreds of thousands.... people will tend to remember that.
p3213
aVThey didn't "immediately" vote that way, they were forced by the Conservatives to compromise on that commitment.
p3214
aVWhilst it's understandable for students and those with concerns over fees to be annoyed, they should be annoyed with the Conservatives first and LibDems second.
p3215
aVThey were probably already annoyed with the Conservatives, that's why they voted Lib Dem.
p3216
aVand the tories ran saying they would increase fees, so hard to blame them for doing that.
p3217
aVforced?
p3218
aVReally?
p3219
aVThey chose to enter the agreement, and yes it was immediately.
p3220
aVThey could just as easily let the tories have to rule in minority, which would have meant a hell of a lot more compromise as they'd have to agree with labour or lib dems on EVERY VOTE.
p3221
aVWhy would I blame the tories, who ran saying they would do what they did?
p3222
aVNo, I blame the individual MPs and leadership who campaigned saying and promising and holding up signed fucking pieces of paper declaring their pledges that they would never vote yes on an increase in fees (when the increase we were talking about was to £7,000 by the way), and then DID vote that way in order to get some government positions for the leadership.
p3223
aVWhy would anyone ever  trust them again?
p3224
aVThey'll betray their principles in a heartbeat for a shiny new title and ministerial car.
p3225
aVI'm not too sure that they did it for cars.
p3226
aVPolitics is a very hidden and tricky subject.
p3227
aVI highly doubt the Lib Dems took it lightly to turn their back on their plans.
p3228
aVIt is much more likely that they used it as a giant bargaining chip to push through a series of policies using the Tories as a political pawn so they could make their mark on the current state of the government.
p3229
aVThere have been a ridiculous amount of sensible policies pushed through by the Lib Dems that push the country forwards.
p3230
aVSorry to use the chess analogy, but even the Queen must be sacrificed in order to gain ground.
p3231
aVDon't tell me you wouldn't do the same.
p3232
aVBecause that would mean you're a terrible chess player.
p3233
aVOh bugger right off.
p3234
aVMasses of students and young people across the country voted lib dem based largely on that single policy.
p3235
aVIt wasn't some small side policy, it was front and centre key political commitment that a huge chunk of their voters based their vote on.
p3236
aVThey betrayed every single one of those people.
p3237
aVThey deserve to burn as a party and sink back into obscurity.
p3238
aVBut the Lib Dems had the audacity to pretend they were different.
p3239
aVBut they're worse.
p3240
aVEven worse than tories.
p3241
aVEven a tory government would be better than the Lib Dems being back in power.
p3242
aVAt least with the tories you know where they stand, and you know exactly what they're going to do.
p3243
aVFuck the Liberal Democrats.
p3244
aVThey're a disgrace to politics.
p3245
aVComplete scum. 
p3246
aVWell my flatmates and I certainly don't mind the debt and apparently neither do the record number of my fellow students, especially poor students, who have gone to uni.
p3247
aVThe debt may have increased but the deal isn't that bad.
p3248
aVBut regardless of that, you might not have realised this, but the liberal democrats didn't win!
p3249
aVThere is no reason to expect them to implement policies that are promised on a majority win scenario.
p3250
aVThey entered a coalition and that means compromising so they can do the best for the people and they have done exactly that.
p3251
aVThey have done a lot of good in this term. 
p3252
aVI can't believe how many times this needs to be said.
p3253
aVThey promised not to vote for an increase in the next Parliament.
p3254
aVNothing to do with their policy of scrapping them. 
p3255
aVThe broken promise on fees is one thing.
p3256
aVShutting down the investigation into Cyril Smith is another.
p3257
aVThey aren't.
p3258
aVI wouldn't trust them further than I can throw John Prescott.
p3259
aVThey make 'commitments' to things like an EU referendum and PR to hoover up votes and then as soon as push comes to shove they flake.
p3260
aVNick Clegg is the ultimate sophist.
p3261
aVHe's a great debater, but he's talking shit.
p3262
aVAt no point has Clegg promised an EU referendum.
p3263
aVYour opinion seems to be based on misinformation...
p3264
aV[deleted]
p3265
aV"We have this referendum next time (and every time) there is a large new treaty being proposed.
p3266
aVIn fact, we've even made this law.
p3267
aV" That is the key bit.
p3268
aVUnless there is a new treaty it isn't happening. 
p3269
aVIt won't happen because there won't be a treaty change ever again.
p3270
aVLisbon gave the EC enough power to expand its powers without constitutional assent of member nations.
p3271
aVThe Passerelle clause was most recently used to give birth to the EU Stability Mechanism without a single national referendum.
p3272
aVEven when memeber (or rather, constituent nations at this point) are given permission to hold a referendum, the EU will just make then re-do their referenda until they vote *correctly* (see: Ireland).
p3273
aVThe EU truly is a menace to self-determination and democracy. 
p3274
aV&gt; The EU truly is a menace to self-determination and democracy.
p3275
aVMatter of opinion but okay.
p3276
aVWithout going into the academic grievances of the democratic deficit of the EU's organs, the turnout is damning enough.
p3277
aVI can't see how the EU can claim a mandate in the UK when the turnout was 35.6%, and the single largest voting block was anti-EU.
p3278
aVOf the entire electorate, from whom all de jure power comes, 75% either abstained or voted for an anti-EU party.
p3279
aVBanana Republics have more convincing elections.
p3280
aVWell, our country let it happen and we the voters didn't really care, in fact if you take polls into account, 85% of people in this country are going to vote for a party that wants to be a part of the EU and by default will end up giving more power to it.
p3281
aVIf people really hate the EU that much they should vote for anti-EU parties, but they don't so they keep voting for pro-EU parties.
p3282
aVIt's either that or we as a country aren't very democratic at all, which would make your point moot, seeing as you are speaking out against the threat of our democracy, so it can only be that people are actually indifferent to the EU, they are neither for or against it or they just don't care enough.
p3283
aVThe Conservatives demanded that it just be a referendum on PR instead of actually implementing it, then they threw the full force of their party resources and donors to defeat it.
p3284
aVHardly Clegg's fault.
p3285
aVThe yes vote was better funded.
p3286
aVThe yes vote wouldn't campaign with Farage because they wanted to be idealogically pure rather than win the vote.
p3287
aVMeanwhile the no vote had recognisable politicians from left, right and centre representing their side resulting in an easy win.
p3288
aVExcept it wasn't PR it was AV, hardly worth breaking your promises over. 
p3289
aVWell, Clegg did kind of sit back believing the Conservatives would take a softcore approach to it then acted with total shock when they didn't, but I put that to political inexperience for trusting the Conservatives to keep their word rather than just shoddy thinking on his part.
p3290

p3323
aVLiam Fox, a former GP, takes on the position of health secretary then moves to Minister for defense.
p3324
aVWhy would you move someone with intimate experience of his portfolio from the ground up into something he has no experience of?
p3325
aV2.
p3326
aVAlistair Darling - marxist to DWP, then minister of transport then to chancellor\u000a\u000aAre these people polymaths or bullshitters?
p3327
aVThe thing is the role of secretary of state for X is supposed to be kind of a managerial post.
p3328
aVThere are committees and white papers and civil servants to actually create the policy, all the minister has to do is make sure the project moves along.
p3329
aVIt's a rare minister who can set their ego aside to do this, however. 
p3330
aVThat sounds like our democracy is a waste of time.

aVAs a citizen of the former Colonies, this boggles my mind and im not sure where will smith's character comes in, can someone please explain?

aVFormer colonies doesn't really narrow it down old chap.

aVThat's about a quarter of the world.
p3335
aVAs to your main point, the Will Smith character is the former education secretary Micheal Gove.
p3336
aVHe had made a number of reforms which were pretty unpopular with teachers, and seemed to not really listen despite very limited (read no) experience with education policy.
p3337
aVDespite this he was supremely confident in his own position.
p3338
aVI just love this comic, it's perfect.
p3339
aVIt always drives me to fits of giggles I rarely find outside of the Far Side.
p3340
aVI don't get it?
p3341
aVIt's depicting Gove as completely inept and useless at something he thinks he can do.
p3342
aVA lot of people think this about his stint as Education Secretary.
p3343
aVa lot of idiots.
p3344
aVI have yet to meet a teacher who doesn't hate Gove, and have met one who encouraged murdering him.
p3345
aVHas there been an education minister that any teacher ever liked?
p3346
aVNot "liked" in the sense that history noted "*x*, in their stint in government, served as a unifying figure, to which teachers, parents, and pupils rallied behind, in pursuit of the educational standards set forward in their party's manifesto.
p3347
aV" But Gove is the only secretary of state for education to have a motion of no-confidence passed against him by the NUT
p3348
aVI didn't say people liked him, I was arguing that he is not inept.
p3349
aVHe is trying to undo the flittering away of standards in education as we have turned into continuous assessment city.
p3350
aVLearning should not be compartmentalised in its current "modular" form.
p3351
aVI don't like him as a person but we have to do something. 
p3352
aVMany teachers don't like continuous assessment, nor LEA control, nor any of the other things that Gove tried to tackle.
p3353
aVBut he didn't take much time to listen to their professional ideas and opinions on how to do things better, and instead ploughed on with ill thought-out schemes which were seemingly pulled out of thin air.
p3354
aVHis intention might have been good but frankly it was based on a lot of assumption and ignorance.
p3355
aVWhen teachers protested or questioned his decisions, his reaction often constitued an "[I'm right, you're wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QriZJ-X3wbU)" dressed up in polite rhetoric.
p3356
aVYou can see how they ended up despising him.
p3357
aVThe pensions and pay issues have just made things worse.
p3358
aVedit: 'Many teachers' rather than just 'teachers'.
p3359
aVI know I can't speak for every teacher out there!\u000a
p3360
aVI feel like he's taking the wrong steps though.
p3361
aVWasting money on sending every school a Bible, for instance (my school used it *once* for a mock court case).
p3362
aVAnother area I feel he's being narrow minded in is stripping non-British literature from the English curriculum.
p3363
aVI agree with you're point completely, but the the money for the bibles was privately sourced.
p3364
aV^^^sorry ^^^for ^^^playing ^^^devils ^^^advocate
p3365
aVStill indicates the backwards thinking.
p3366
aVPlease justify your conclusions; it's easy to write off your opinion if you don't.
p3367
aV[deleted]
p3368
aVRegardless it's historically important; one of the most influential pieces of literature ever written.
p3369
aVI wouldn't oppose students studying Hamlet just because there's a little murder in it.
p3370
aVTo be fair, if you're learning English in a British school it ought to be British English and not American English or some other variant.
p3371
aVIt's bad enough in science where sulphur and foetus are taught as "sulfur" and "fetus".
p3372
aV[However, the IUPAC adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990, as did the Nomenclature Committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1992, restoring the spelling sulfur to Britain.
p3373
aVThe Oxford Dictionaries note that "in chemistry ... the -f- spelling is now the standard form in all related words in the field in both British and US contexts.
p3374
aV"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur)
p3375
aVI'm a developmental biologist - if I used foetus in a paper my colleagues would laugh at me.
p3376
aVedit: for those silly downvoters, from the OED: [In technical usage fetus is now the standard spelling throughout the English-speaking world](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fetus).
p3377
aVIn developmental biology it is categorically wrong to use foetus.
p3378
aVYes, and the first thing you should probably do is get the teachers on board with you...
p3379
aVTo be fair, teachers hate anything that's not bigger pay or less work.
p3380
aVI'm not saying this is true for just teachers btw, it's pretty much human nature
p3381
aVLargely, the more recent strikes were against Gove's changes to the curriculum.
p3382
aVI've yet to meet a teacher that I could consider a capable and competent person though...
p3383
aVYou must not meet many teachers. 
p3384
aVi agree actually \u000a\u000ayou surround yourself in lessons and rhetoric designed for 4-16 year old's, standards start to slip.. \u000a\u000awhen was the last time a GCSE english teacher had to give an intensive 2 hour lecture and Q n A on chaucer or milton ?
p3385
aVinstead it's *maybe if i teach my year 11's all year on of mice and men, they might pick up on the themes of the impossibility of the american dream and the predatory nature of humanity to cough up in the exam god i hope so* \u000a\u000ait must be so very dull 
p3386
aVI realised that around the time I was subjected to Mice &amp; Men by Mrs. Wall.
p3387
aVI resolved never to become a teacher because it was so obviously repetitive and boring.
p3388
aVI am not an english teacher (or a teacher) but i know many who are.
p3389
aVif you're talking about the lower ability classes, then yes, it looks dull and they dont really cover what an intelligent person would think worthwile.
p3390
aVhowever, it's important to remember that these are generally kids who have NEVER read anything other than the tv guide or the captions on a computer game.
p3391
aVI shit you not, many of them can't even tell the freakin time, despite being teenagers.
p3392
aVWhile what they achieve might be superficial and banal to you, its a pretty monumental achievement to get these kids to take any interest at all, and actually a lot of them do find it empowering.
p3393
aVit's all relative.
p3394
aVthe higher sets do cover things like chaucer, and even old english.
p3395
aVhowever old you are, I can assure you education has come a long way, while the raw material the teachers have to deal with has deteriorated massively, due to mindless or sometimes rotten home lives, that are increasingly common.
p3396
aVI've been through your posting history (because I agreed with most of it) but please try to respond politely if you respond at all.
p3397
aVan enlightening comment.
p3398
aVhowever the joy of posting anonymously on the internet, is i don't have to be polite aha \u000a\u000ait's like a safety valve so i'm not a rude bastard in the real world \u000a\u000aand more on topic still... \u000a\u000awhile i appreciate where you're coming from, *from my perspective* i would be incredibly bored, going over the same source material *every year* i'm guessing one could even recycle lesson plans once that year has moved on/up?
p3399
aVi guess for some, the joy of teaching is it's own reward, but stimulation in a job is what keeps you getting up and putting 2 feet on the floor every morning.
p3400
aV&gt;however the joy of posting anonymously on the internet, is i don't have to be polite aha \u000a\u000a&gt;it's like a safety valve so i'm not a rude bastard in the real world \u000a\u000aI hear ya, and definitely relate.
p3401
aVI'm generally OK unless people are being rude or irrational, then I might flip.
p3402
aV====\u000a\u000aEDIT: I think if english teaching was exactly as you imagine, anyone would be bored.
p3403
aVI don't think they have time to be.
p3404
aVThey have to choose the material each year and they will be teaching lots of different classes of kids, so it's more relentless than boring.
p3405
aVThey all hate the teaching system, but they feel its worth it when they make a difference to the kids.
p3406
aVI couldn't do it, and neither would i go through that hell, 70 hours a week, plus the constant insults from the parents and the public for a pathetically meagre £25k p/a.
p3407
aVThet's not even half my salary, and my job is half those hours and an utter and total peice of piss!
p3408
aVThey need proper performance-related pay and salaries much more commensurate with the time, stress and aggravation the job entails.
p3409
aVHowever the biggest thing holding them back are their own unions, who resist every change claiming its the end of the world as we know it (#standard).
p3410

aVReally, I shan't be accepting of anything post-1910.

aV1913 at the latest.

aVI do support the proposal for the new Number 10, probably a lot cheaper plus that Van can transport the whole cabinet so bonus 
p3425
aVThe cabinet, or a cabinet? 
p3426
aVAn inanimate object would probably do a considerably better job than politicians.
p3427
aVYeah, an inanimate object can't make things worse.
p3428
aVEither or 
p3429
aVThink they're taking English votes for English laws a little too far with the new number 10.
p3430
aVAnd I understand that they're trying to cut costs, but I think a new build is a little too modern.
p3431
aVHow about something more traditional and ten times as patriotic: http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3668323.ece/alternates/s615/PAY-Patriotic-house.jpg Bonus England flags covering the windows for privacy.
p3432
aVerror: The length of the value of the variable vPatriotism exceeds the maximum length.

p3444
aVYou are a broken record, aren't you?
p3445
aV&gt; The likes of you\u000a\u000a\u000aJust have a bit more respect for people who don't agree with everything you think hook line and sinker.
p3446
aVI'm really sick of the brigading accompanied by claims of being victims, this isnt that site for angsty teenagers. 
p3447
aV&gt; Have a bit more respect\u000a\u000aWhy are you telling me this?
p3448
aVYou should probably pay more attention to who is replying to you, as I am not the OP, and no, I am not from /pol/ either.
p3449
aVWait until you see the karma scores in this thread, then show me the evidence of vote manipulation.
p3450
aVIf this sub is being brigaded as much as you say, where are the endless Ukip posts on the front page?
p3451
aVI counted about three, and two of those were negative.
p3452
aVWhy is the top comment ITT one that is in total agreement with the Private Eye front page, despite it being satirical in nature?
p3453
aVIt's a joke, the same as Bacon sandwiches et al.
p3454
aVStop lashing out at everyone because someone was mean about a party that's in the news a lot that you happen to like. 
p3455
aVYou are truly the king of straw men.
p3456
aVI am not having a go at Private Eye, I thought it was funny.
p3457
aVI'm calling you out on your paranoia about this endless /pol/ brigading.

p3462
aVThere may be about five or ten of them.
p3463
aVIt is getting to the stage that people gets called a /pol/ shill simply because of their support of Ukip.
p3464
aVNo, that would be your sub.
p3465
aVAs much as I enjoy the personal attacks, would you mind specifying which one?
p3466
aV&gt; personal attacks\u000a\u000aIt was nothing personal.
p3467
aVI was referring to your silent little britpol sub, the one that has tried to emulate how this sub was back in the day when you could count on any Ukip post being pummelled into the turf and circled by baying leftist hyenas.
p3468
aVThat one.\u000a\u000a
p3469
aVI think you mean the sub that is blissfully free of a large cadre of people trying to impose their UKIP-aligned view and similarly a lack of a disturbing trend towards ethnocentric nationalism.
p3470
aVAs I have remarked before, it is incredibly ironic that for all your "circling by baying leftist hyenas" claims you are incredibly blind to the equivalent UKIP circle of hyenas now present. 
p3471
aVIt's just the opposite way around.
p3472
aVInstead of a UKIP circlejerk its a left-wing circlejerk.
p3473
aVI think I'm the only right wing guy who posts there.
p3474
aVI'm fairly sure your impression of what goes on here is vastly different to what actually transpires.
p3475
aVWhat we have now is rather balanced.
p3476
aVAttempts to stifle a chuckle
p3477
aVTake a good look at the front page.
p3478
aVPlease explain  how that equates to a "cadre of people trying to impose their UKIP-aligned view"?
p3479
aVIf that is what a Ukip echo chamber looks like, then the "imposers" are rather lacking in vigour.
p3480
aVEdit: I didn't think I'd get a response.
p3481
aVFor a party with two seats there seems to be a lot being posted about them...
p3482
aVWhere?
p3483
aVBy the way, two seats and consistently polling between 15-19%, you mean?
p3484
aVNot to mention taking the lead on matters that the other parties have found it in their best interests to follow.
p3485
aV&gt; Not to mention taking the lead on matters that the other parties have found it in their best interests to follow.
p3486
aVYes, the EU and immigration are the most important issues in this country today.

p3489
aVThe biggest scam perpetuated by the elite has been to convince people that immigrants and Europe are to blame for most of their problems.
p3490
aVIt simply isn't true.
p3491
aVUKIP is just an exercise in cynical anti-intellectual demagoguery.
p3492
aVThis is the politics of fear and ignorance.
p3493
aVBut thats life...
p3494
aVVery, very strange comment.
p3495
aVIt's like you just woke up yesterday.
p3496
aVThe immigration issue had been swept under the rug for *decades* by the political elite, since Powell dared to mention it.
p3497
aVIt is only in the last few years that the debate has been able to proceed without as many shrill cries of "racist" because of grassroots concerns, and those concerns have found a voice in Ukip.
p3498
aV&gt; UKIP is just an exercise in cynical anti-intellectual demagoguery.
p3499
aVThis is where your side of the argument really falls down.
p3500
aVIt is not anti-intellectual to be concerned with the explosion in immigration and the rate of change in cities and towns across the UK.
p3501
aVYou will no doubt retort with the economics of it all, but that is just a smokescreen that can easily be seen through.
p3502
aVYou might even say "What British culture?
p3503
aV" like so many others do.
p3504
aVThat borders on treason, and won't be looked kindly upon by future generations of Britons, reduced to making up 5% of their country and asking their great-grandparents why they sold their country out for the sake of "diversity" and economics.
p3505
aVI really have no interest in debating this with you.
p3506
aVNobody will win, and we wouldn't agree on anything.
p3507
aVI just think its a sad turn of events to see the political elite jump on the "all my problems are caused by other people" bandwagon.
p3508
aVIts really boring to read how people like you think people like me are the reason why people who aren't like either of us can't get a job. 
p3509
aV&gt; I really have no interest in debating this with you.
p3510
aVBecause you would lose.
p3511
aVHe is right, immigration has been swept under the carpet and ignored by the politicians, even while the public were going out of their minds over the issue.
p3512
aVLabour have now admitted they "made mistakes" on immigration, by opening a door to unlimited numbers of people from Eastern Europe back in 2004, and Boris Johnson has admitted it was a "deceit" when his party claimed they could control the numbers - they can not.
p3513
aV&gt;Nobody will win, \u000a\u000aNo, he would win, because you are lying\u000a\u000a&gt;and we wouldn't agree on anything\u000a\u000aBecause you are denying facts. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p3514
aVLying?
p3515
aVYes, lying.
p3516
aVWhen you said this : -\u000a\u000a&gt;The biggest scam perpetuated by the elite has been to convince people that immigrants and Europe are to blame for most of their problems.
p3517
aVIt simply isn't true.
p3518
aVThe political elite have avoided, obfuscated and danced around the issue of open door immigration, preferring not to discuss it, and lying when they do.
p3519
aVIt is the *public*, not the political elites, that have demanded the issue be brought to the table, and this is why UKIP has succeeded, because they haven't been afraid to address the matter, despite the elite's politically correct silencing tactics used to attempt to shut down the discussion, accusing anyone that does not have an 100% positive view of immigration of being a "racist".
p3520
aVIt's a lie when you claim the political elites have told the public all their problems come from immigration.
p3521
aVThe elites only ever try to claim that immigration is a net benefit to the country, economically, and culturally.
p3522
aVThey ignore the truth, that mass immigration has driven down wages, and pushed up house and rent prices due to increased demand on a limited supply of housing.
p3523
aVThe UK is one of the most crowded countries in Europe, and has a growing population mainly because of mass immigration.
p3524
aVNo mainstream politician has a ever admitted that.
p3525
aVHonest question - Would you rather that every government policy or piece of legislation was decided by public referendum?
p3526
aVIf anything the biggest scam perpetuated by the elite is the constant bashing of UKIP in the media by "mock the week" style cretins.
p3527
aVHow dare those proles not accept that immigration and more competition in the work place is good for them, eh?
p3528
aVIts hardly a scam.
p3529
aVUKIP don't seem to be too popular amongst satirical show producers, so their attempts to ridicule mostly backfire.
p3530
aVThe fact is that many people don't really have a clue what the EU is, or why we're in it, so when people come along and say they'll pull us out and save money, its something they want to hear.
p3531
aVSatirists are saying "Look at these crackpots, they think immigrants are the number one problem with this country!
p3532
aVHah!
p3533
aV" and Johnny Electorate is seeing nothing wrong with that...\u000a\u000aIts depressing - And it happens in the mainstream news too.
p3534
aVThe BBC for example tells a story about how Mark Reckless kinda, almost, sorta says he's going to deport europeans, isn't this horrible?
p3535
aVAnd a significant proportion of the public agrees with what he's implying.
p3536
aVI think the media mocking and bashing UKIP is 90% of the reason why they're seeing a relative surge in support...
p3537
aV&gt;I'm fairly sure your impression of what goes on here is vastly different to what actually transpires.
p3538
aVLikewise. 
p3539
aVI would enjoy being able to fly an English flag and not feel like a scumbag because of it.
p3540
aVMaybe I should get a St. George duvet so I can feel patriotic before I nod off.
p3541
aVI don't like the St. George's flag from a design point of view, its pretty dull 
p3542
aVThat's true, but luckily the Union Jack is the best flag there is.
p3543
aVI think you misspelled ugliest.
p3544
aVBoo!
p3545
aVI think people misread joke.
p3546
aVI think you misread our hatred of traitors.
p3547
aVTo be fair a good fabric one looks a million times better than the £3 nylon ones most people fly.
p3548
aVMaybe I could get a matching union jack pajamas.
p3549
aV&gt; I don't like the St. George's flag from a design point of view, its pretty dull \u000a\u000aWith a cross on background it looks pretty similar to generic North West European flags - Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland...
p3550
aVUnion Jack is way better.
p3551
aV^(or the EU flag)
p3552
aVThe EU would be greatly improved if we agreed to call it the HRE and used the double headed HRE eagle.

aVBy that time, France is in a revolution and Poland is way behind on tech, so we would be *fucked*.  
p3556
aVLooks like EU4 is creeping in here...

aVWe need an imperial double headed Robin.
p3561
aVThe EU flag is pretty meaningless, especially when its also used by unrelated bodies 
p3562
aVI'd settle for the 1980s.
p3563
aVYou mean when there was a backward thinking Conservative in charge and riots and strikes up and down the country led by people that were being put out of work because of cuts after a recession?
p3564
aVAnd the heir to the throne was expecting, Bob Geldof made a charity record and an upstart political party was benefitting from defecting MPs.

aV&gt; backward thinking\u000a\u000a[read: non-progressive]
p3569
aVMaggie was the epitome of progressive, a little too much for some.
p3570
aVI have never heard of anyone saying she was 'backward thinking'.
p3571
aVIn terms of business, yes progressive.
p3572
aVIn terms of human rights, happiness, culture, wellbeing, etc etc, she wasn't just backward thinking, she was completely bankrupt
p3573
aVCan't worry about human rights when your best friends with Jimmy Saville now can you? 
p3574
aVIs that you, Arthur?
p3575
aVSome of us won't be forgetting Section 28 any time soon. 
p3576
aVIt was tongue in cheek mate basically saying today is no different.

aVAlso the knight character has St. George's flags

aVNo one should be beyond taking a ribbing, should they?

p3581
aVIs Private Eye like a left-wing foil to the Daily Mail?
p3582
aVBecause that's the impression I'm getting here.
p3583
aVNot really.
p3584
aVIt's a parody magazine that also has a sideline as the watcher-of-the-watchers, reporting on interesting/scandalous news about the other newspapers, including things like D-notices (government censorship of a particular story) and things other newspaper won't report on because they are scared of rich folks' lawyers.
p3585
aVThey get sued.
p3586
aVA lot.
p3587
aVThey are, probably, a little left of centre, if only because they are so firmly in opposition to powerful monied interests, but they are most on the "taking the piss out of everyone"-wing with a side of anti-corruption.
p3588
aVSuch is the way of the most esteemed organ.

aVPeople in power in general.
p3592
aVIt's not like they lay off the shadow cabinet...
p3593
aVI do feel that Ian Hislop himself is probably a bit left leaning though.
p3594
aVAt least that's what I gather from the various talk shows he's been on over the years.
p3595
aVI like that man.
p3596
aVYeah he appears that way on HIGNFY, but he also appears to be fairly critical of very left wing people like Livingstone 
p3597
aVThink The Onion, but with serious investigative journalism and 50 year old in-jokes (*eyes passim*)
p3598
aVThe other reply more-or-less covered it, although I'd say it's more "an investigative journalism magazine with a sideline in parody" than vice-versa.
p3599
aVThey frequently put the rest of the British press to shame when it comes to actually doing proper journalism, IMO - their [special reports](https://privateeye.subscribeonline.co.uk/Products/digital-editions) (not free to read online, unfortunately, but the gists are there) in particular are always fantastic pieces of investigative work, of a depth &amp; rigour so rarely seen these days.
p3600
aVIf you're thinking they're left-wing because of this cover, note [the previous issue's cover](http://private-eye.co.uk/covers.php?showme=1379) was mocking the head of the Labour party... and [this one during the recent European parliament elections](http://private-eye.co.uk/covers.php?showme=1367) made fun of everyone.
p3601
aVIt's pretty common for them to attack "both sides" of a story, even in the same issue.
p3602
aVProbably worth mentioning they also satirize international politicians as well \u000a\u000ahttp://private-eye.co.uk/pictures/covers/full/1372_big.jpg
p3603
aVAnd journalists, and bankers, and CEOs... no-one is safe!
p3604
aVI'm pretty confident I'm safe.
p3605
aVSouth of the river?
p3606
aVThis time of day?
p3607
aVI should coco.
p3608
aVAh yes.
p3609
aVIf you walk up to someone and say \u000a\u000a\u000a"Do you think the UK has enough capability to house so many immigrants from Europe?
p3610
aVIt seems unfair that our Government can't do anything about it because the EU dictates our terms.
p3611
aVPerhaps we should ask the UK to vote on whether they agree?
p3612
aV"\u000a\u000a\u000aIs equivalent to wanting to go back to 1950.
p3613
aVAlso implying that 1950 were apparently horrible.
p3614
aVWhich would be a reasonable thing to discuss if it was based on, you know, facts and stuff like that.
p3615
aVRight now, there are more immigrants from outside Europe than inside, EU migrants tend to be profitable and healthy, and the government doesn't use the tools it has to send home those (very few) who can't support themselves.
p3616
aVAlso, the UK government, which UK voters put there, approved both free movement *and* no restrictions on A8 workers when they joined.
p3617
aVVoters agreed all along.
p3618
aVAs one of those pesky EEA migrants, I'd love a discussion that acknowledged these things.
p3619
aV&gt; more immigrants from outside Europe than inside\u000a\u000aHow does that negate the idea that there are too many?
p3620
aV&gt; EU migrants tend to be profitable\u000a\u000aAlways with the cold economics of it all.
p3621
aV&gt; \u000a&gt; the government doesn't use the tools it has to send home those (very few) who can't support themselves\u000a\u000aHence the dissatisfaction with them and the rise of Ukip.
p3622
aV&gt; the UK government, which UK voters put there, approved both free movement and no restrictions on A8 workers when they joined.
p3623
aVVoters agreed all along.
p3624
aVFigures were spouted of 10,000 to 15,000 coming per annum.
p3625
aVDo you think everyone would have agreed to 220,000+?
p3626
aVAnd what choice did people have?
p3627
aVWho would people have voted for if they didn't want free movement/no restrictions?
p3628
aVBoth Labour and the Tories were keen on the idea.
p3629
aV&gt; &gt; more immigrants from outside Europe than inside  \u000a\u000a&gt; How does that negate the idea that there are too many?
p3630
aVIt doesn't, but it illustrates that the debate is incredibly skewed for some reason.
p3631
aV&gt; &gt; EU migrants tend to be profitable\u000a\u000a&gt; Always with the cold economics of it all.
p3632
aVWhat else do you want?
p3633
aVIf migrants pay for their use of public services and then some, don't affect salary levels a whole lot for British people, create as many or more jobs as they take, what's required to keep you satisfied?
p3634
aVAnd why aren't we talking about fixing those things instead of clouding everything with wrong information?
p3635
aVEdit: That your politicians are lying to you is also not the fault of migrants, but there was a lot of wilful ignorance from both politicians and public regarding those figures.
p3636
aVThe growth in migrants from Europe is flattening, so hopefully we can all get over this in a few years.
p3637
aV&gt; what's required to keep you satisfied?
p3638
aVIt's not about the problem, it's about the solution.
p3639
aVIf this problem stops fitting the solution too much, a different problem for the solution will be concentrated on.
p3640
aVIf you look at the data surrounding this current one, "EU immigration" already doesn't really work.
p3641
aVAs they are a net gain to the economy.
p3642
aVBut right now, people are relying on "common sense", not data, so the problem can still be used.
p3643
aVWell they should start looking at the data, then.
p3644
aVPeople root up their lives to come here and try to make a better future for themselves and their families and to contribute to the UK, the least people could do before shutting the door is to try to learn some damn facts.
p3645
aVOh I agree, but it's all about easy blame.
p3646
aVIs very poisonous.
p3647
aV&gt; the debate is incredibly skewed\u000a\u000aIt's not, really.
p3648
aVPeople are just as concerned with immigration from outside the EU.
p3649
aVWe have just been hearing a great deal about the EU because of the recent election results and the prominence of Ukip.
p3650
aV&gt; pay for their use of public services and then some\u000a\u000aThe issue is not the payment for, but availability of such services.
p3651
aV&gt; don't affect salary levels a whole lot for British people\u000a\u000aThat depends on your profession.
p3652
aV&gt; create as many or more jobs as they take\u000a\u000aCitation please.
p3653
aV&gt; And why aren't we talking about fixing those things instead of clouding everything with wrong information?
p3654
aVI thought you said they aren't problems, so why would they need fixing?
p3655
aV&gt; not the fault of migrants\u000a\u000aNo one is blaming the migrants themselves.
p3656
aV&gt; The growth in migrants from Europe is flattening\u000a\u000a[What?
p3657
aV](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/28/statistically-significant-increase-net-migration-uk-key-charts)\u000a\u000a*The net migration for the year ending March 2014 was 243,000, a year-on-year increase of 38% that seems to end Coalition government hopes of a significant drop before the end of the parliament*
p3658
aVThe jobs argument doesn't hold up for me.
p3659
aVPeople paying less than minimum wage should be prosecuted, as they are breaking the law.
p3660
aVThe problem is that a lot of immigrants from the EU have better skills than a lot of the UK population.
p3661
aVAre businesses suppose to hire worse people?
p3662
aVIs it worse for a country to have the best skilled people in each job?
p3663
aVThe issue isn't with immigrants.
p3664
aVIt's that a huge number of British people don't have the skills required to get a job, and that's a mixture of the government's fault and theirs. 
p3665
aVAh, my old chum Doug.
p3666
aVStill waiting on you to take back your sweeping generalisations.
p3667
aV&gt; The issue is not the payment for, but availability of such services.
p3668
aVWhich migrants use less of than native Britons, and are also hired to provide.
p3669
aVIs government just static?
p3670
aVIsn't it supposed to adapt to the population?
p3671
aVEspecially when the population in question is paying the bill and then some?
p3672
aV&gt; That depends on your profession.
p3673
aVYes, EU migrant workers negatively affect salary levels [very slightly for some people](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/labour-market-effects-immigration\u000a), and more positively for others.
p3674
aV&gt; &gt; create as many or more jobs as they take\u000a\u000a&gt; Citation please.
p3675
aVSame source as above: "Research does not find a significant impact of overall immigration on unemployment in the UK"\u000a\u000a&gt; I thought you said they aren't problems, so why would they need fixing?
p3676
aVI never said there were NO problems with migration.
p3677
aVThat would be delusional.
p3678
aVI believe they can be handled, however, and that the problems people mostly talk about are nonexistent.
p3679
aV&gt; What?
p3680
aVOkay, I ignored latest quarterlies for that statement.
p3681
aVConsidering the new August report, I'll have to retune that to a "we'll see" after 2013/2014 yearlies are ready.
p3682
aVThere's a new report in two days that'll make it easier to see if the recent increase is seasonal or not.
p3683
aV&gt; Is government just static?
p3684
aVIsn't it supposed to adapt to the population?
p3685
aV[Seems not to be coping too well at all](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/20/nhs-hospitals-failing-meet-targets-waiting-times-treatment).
p3686
aV&gt; &gt; create as many or more jobs as they take\u000a&gt; &gt; Citation please.
p3687
aV&gt; &gt; &gt; Same source as above:\u000a\u000aThat doesn't tell you that they are the ones creating as many jobs as they take, and especially doesn't mention anything about creating *more* jobs.
p3688
aVGovernments around the world have those kinds of problems, immigration or not.
p3689
aVAgeing native populations are a much bigger issue for the NHS.
p3690
aVThat should be obvious.
p3691
aVIt's impossible to blame NHS capacity issues on EEA immigrants primarily, because EEA immigrants consume much less of those services than natives, and are generally young and healthy, so you won't see many of them in a cancer ward.
p3692
aVAlso, the figures fluctuate wildly over a period of immigration.
p3693
aVGiven that EEA migrants are a [net positive](http://www.itv.com/news/story/2014-11-05/research-shows-eu-migrants-positive-tax-contribution/) to government funds, feel free to spend some of that money on improving the NHS.
p3694
aVYou're welcome.
p3695
aVApparently to be good enough for you immigrants have to come here, consume very few services whatsoever, but pay for them still, and not have any impact on anything a Briton ever does but preferably create *more* jobs for those who live here... anything I missed?
p3696
aV&gt; Governments around the world have those kinds of problems, immigration or not.
p3697
aVThe problem is exacerbated by mass immigration.
p3698
aVThe article mentions nothing about Britain's ageing population as a cause, but does state that hospitals as a whole breached the requirement to treat 95% of A&amp;E patients within four hours during both December and January, [as does this one about a new report which found that waiting times for A&amp;E patients have hit a nine-year high and that the number of people waiting more than four hours to see a doctor has almost doubled since last year](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10097888/Migrants-partly-to-blame-for-AandE-waiting-times-Tory-MP-says.html).
p3699
aV&gt; anything I missed?
p3700
aVJust a limit on the numbers.
p3701
aVAnd you were the one going on about them creating more jobs.
p3702
aVI said that there was no proof whatsoever in your claims.
p3703
aVGive me some data, not what some MP just pulls out of his ass.
p3704
aVThe actual scientist quoted in the article says it may account for a small part but isn't a significant factor \u2013 and apparently the problems can be solved by teaching immigrants how to register with a GP.
p3705
aVAgain, feel free to spend some of the extra money we bring on that.
p3706
aVI said "as many or more", which the research and supporting documents I linked to agrees with \u2013 immigration does not have a negative impact on employment, and in some sectors there may be an increase, but more uncertain.
p3707
aVI can rephrase that to "as many" if it makes you happier.
p3708
aV&gt; Some 313,000 patients spent four hours or longer in A&amp;E between January and March, or six per cent of all people attending emergency units during that period, according to ***official figures***.
p3709
aVThat is some arse.
p3710
aV&gt; rephrase that to "as many" if it makes you happier\u000a\u000aSo you are going to drop half of your argument for the sake of accuracy?
p3711
aVGreat.
p3712
aVYeah, the point was that the waiting can't be attributed primarily to migrants in any way.
p3713
aVThat is not supported by any figures, and as is said in the article, the small factor that may be attributable to migrants is apparently because they don't have a GP \u2013 that's fixable.
p3714
aVI wasn't dropping my argument, I never meant for it to be interpreted as immigrants themselves contribute wildly to job creation, just that there might be a small positive factor.
p3715
aV(The FDI that comes with an open economy, however, [does](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/220966/foi_eumembership_fdi.pdf).
p3716
aV)
aVlearn to take a joke mate.
p3717
aVI thought UKIP were all about this stuff
p3718
aVThey only like jokes that punch down and belittle people who are different.
p3719
aVYou know, like on Top Gear!
p3720
aVJust a joke, like on Top Gear!
p3721
aV&gt; Just a joke, like on Top Gear!
p3722
aVGuys I found a Stu fan!
p3723
aVWe are many.
p3724
aVWe are Legion.
p3725
aVYou will not hear us\u000a\u000a\u000aAt first.
p3726
aVStew 
p3727
aVAnd it's the lefties with the victim complex now is it?
p3728
aVPerhaps the cover should strive to be more PC.
p3729
aVThat's not actually what they are saying, there is no reasoned debate 
p3730
aVActually there was a recent YouGov poll in which something like 60-70% of UKIP voters said they wanted to turn the clock back a couple of decades.
p3731
aVVoters from the other parties all delivered a majority in favour of preferring things as they are now. 
p3732
aVThe bright orange ad for '#epicfail a losers guide to social media' draws away the gravitas.
p3733
aVI know what you mean.
p3734
aVIf you're  going for this kind of impactful visual statement a full page is pretty much necessary. 
p3735
aV"Here is the news, not the propaganda" is not the news.
p3736
aVIn fact, it's arguably the propaganda.
p3737
aVDevoting your front page to the fact that you're not devoting your front page to a story is devoting your front page to that story.
p3738
aVThis is not rocket science.
p3739
aVThey clearly made this because of their desire to be seen as above covering the story, not because they're *actually* being above covering the story.
p3740
aVThat dove of peace really doesn't gel with the implied criticism of their competitors, nor the punchy wording and the self righteous tone.
p3741
aVPrinting a black page with a dove and talking up the event in this way presents one unfair death as a significant blow.
p3742
aVThe only way out of this is to downplay the beheading, not put your newspaper into full-on grieving mode.
p3743
aVI think this is cynical, disingenuous, harmful drivel.
p3744
aVBy the way, that isn't a dove, it's the logo of "The Independent": an eagle with a rolled-up newspaper in its talons.
p3745
aVAha!
p3746
aVMy mistake.
p3747
aVI should have looked more carefully.
p3748
aVIn that case, why are they associating their logo with this?
p3749
aVVery strange.
p3750
aV&gt; They clearly made this because of their desire to be seen as above covering the story, not because they're actually being above covering the story.
p3751
aVAbsolutely spot on.\u000a
p3752
aVAnd it would have used loads of ink...
p3753
aVBut seriously well said, reports on killings and other terrible things only makes the whole situation worse.
p3754
aVBut there is no way that it could ever stop; the public want news so the papers give them the news.
p3755
aVThe different sources of media will always try to sneak their view in, and the worse it is, the more we hear about it.
p3756
aVI like this.
p3757
aVI don't.
p3758
aVIt gives a Lord Voldemort vibe to Daash, that they're so scary we shouldn't report their names nor their crimes.
p3759
aVThis is a ideological success for a death cult against liberalism and free speech.
p3760
aVIt's also not effective counter-propaganda - they're skilled at using the internet and social media to recruit misfits and losers.\u000a\u000a
p3761
aVSo are we doing the whole "Daash" thing then?
p3762
aVI like it as it's both accurate and liberal.
p3763
aVInhabitants of the region, including many Muslims, refer to them as Daash - that they themselves hate it is an extra plus.
p3764
aVMore importantly, it denies any legitimacy to their claim to being *The* Islamic State, the Caliphate.
p3765
aVThis is far more important than not letting Daash's crimes be known - The West and its Muslim allies (as well as Assad, I suppose) are not at war in the Levant with God's State on Earth, they are containing a gang of cutthroats who are using Islamist conspiracy theories as an excuse to murder and rape their way across the Middle East.
p3766
aVDaesh (\u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634) is simply an abbreviation of 'Islamic State', it doesn't afford them any less 'Islamic' legitimacy.
p3767
aVDaash is an abbreviation of their former title, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and is the equivalent of ISIS, not IS.
p3768
aVIt does afford them less legitimacy because IS refers to their unique claim to be *the* Islamic State, rather than simply *a* Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
p3769
aVThis is why the cultists hate the term - they use the phrase in Arabic for "The State" because of the differences in theological-political legitimacy compared to Daash.
p3770
aVUse of such a term in English language publications is pointless, especially when considering that it includes a letter that native English speakers largely cannot pronounce correctly and is a term that many English speakers will not understand.
p3771
aV'Islamic State' or 'Islamic state of Iraq and Syria/Sham/Levant' are perfectly valid descriptions and titles in English language publications, abbreviated to IS or ISIS if an abbreviation is necessary. 
p3772
aVI agree, I was happy using ISIS after they had officially changed their name to IS.
p3773
aVHowever, IS as a term has become more common on the basis of accuracy, and it's a propaganda coup for them.
p3774
aV&gt;it includes a letter that native English speakers largely cannot pronounce correctly and is a term that many English speakers will not understand.
p3775
aVThis never stopped the usage of Al-Qaeda, the [Pakistanj] Taliban and other similar terms. 
p3776
aVFair point, however those were the groups' actual titles.
p3777
aVDaesh is an abbreviation of the groups' actual title/former-title.
p3778
aVAt this point they're known as the Islamic State/ISIS.
p3779
aVIt just seems pointless to start giving them this 'politically neutral' title now.
p3780
aVIf it's really so important to deny them their propaganda then we could simply go the way of the always politically correct BBC and refer to them as 'so-called Islamic State' so as not to offend anyone. 
p3781
aVIf it stops even one loser from going off to Syria, I think it's worth it. \u000a
p3782
aVBut Daash is an acronym for the Islamic State in Arabic. 
p3783
aVNo, it's an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and (Greater) Syria.
p3784
aVYes I know but that is not my point.
p3785
aVUsing Daash seems no different from using Isis. 
p3786
aVI mentioned above I was fine with ISIS until the media and people started using "Islamic State" because they think it is accurate.
p3787
aVNobody calls Taiwan the "Republic of China" even if that's their official name.
p3788
aVNot usually, but we do use the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and the United States (of America), which I believe is the same principle as using the Islamic State (of Iran and Syria).
p3789
aVThere are other Islamic States (states which are Islamic) though - Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and maybe a few others I've forgotten.
p3790
aVDaash is different in that they claim to be **The** Islamic State, as in, the only religiously legitimate state on Earth.
p3791
aV*(of Great Britain and Northern Ireland)* and *(of Iran and Syria)* are not equivalent here because Daash dropped *(of Iran and Syria)* so that they could claim to be the Global Caliphate. 
p3792
aV"Daesh" surely. 
p3793
aV&gt;Da\u02bfesh, Da-ish, D\u0101\u02bbish, Daesh, Daish, Daash, Da'ash, Daas, Da'ish, D\u0101'ash, Daiish: various latinisations of the (\u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634) acronym formed from al-Dawlah al-Isl\u0101m\u012byah f\u012b al-\u02bbIr\u0101q wa-al-Sh\u0101m\u000a\u000aFrom Wikipedia
p3794
aVIt is all very Judean People's Front.
p3795
aVI think I will refer to them as those naughty people. 
p3796
aVSplitters!
p3797
aVNo.
p3798
aVIt is lame.
p3799
aVDid we call the USSR by CCCP?\u000a\u000a
p3800
aVYes.
p3801
aVIt's this week's new name for Al Qaeda in Iraq 
p3802
aVThey think it's going to upset all the IS members on here lol
p3803
aVWhat are you talking about?
p3804
aVWhy do you think they video the murders in the first place?
p3805
aVDo you honestly think they're some sort of recruitment ploy?
p3806
aVDo you think it's just misguided PR or that they accidentally leave the camera on?
p3807
aVIdiot.
p3808
aVThey do it on purpose to provoke a response.
p3809
aVThey do it on purpose to make us look like we're anti-Islam.
p3810
aVThey want us to go to War again.
p3811
aVThey want us to kill innocent people again.
p3812
aVThey do it to make us say or do something stupid so they can turn to the Muslim world, from Algeria to Indonesia and say that we are the evil ones.
p3813
aVIt's so they can say we're the bloodthirsty, the Satanic, the warmongers.
p3814
aVThe videos have a purely propaganda purpose.
p3815
aVThe reason they dress the victims in orange is to represent the torture victims in Guantanamo Bay, enraging Muslims.
p3816
aVThe reason there's an English guy talking, is to purposely get us angry.
p3817
aVAnd every media outlet that says that we should respond, go to war and start dropping (by unanimously forgetting that we already tried that approach) is falling to this trap.
p3818
aVThey're not "skilled at using the internet and social media", we are.
p3819
aVEverytime one of these videos comes up, we're the ones who use social media to hate them, to demand our governments drop bombs and start killing.
p3820
aVThere's no great skill in provoking a response.
p3821
aVIf you show enough beheadings, you're going to get scared and you're going to get the mob angry.
p3822
aVThe trick's as old as politics itself.
p3823
aVThat's why what the Independent's doing is admirable.
p3824
aVIt's not the Daily Prophet and Voldemort, it's cutting through the bullshit.
p3825
aVThere's nothing to fear because they're just a bunch of shits living in shit scarred piece of the World who (rightly or wrongly) blame us for everything.
p3826
aVPerhaps we should stop giving them an excuse to.
p3827
aVPerhaps we should stop torturing people.
p3828
aVPerhaps we shouldn't start wars for oil.
p3829
aVPerhaps we shouldn't threaten escalate the fuck out of every region that happens to piss us off at that time.
p3830
aVI'm not an apologist.
p3831
aVI just think we should stop pretending we need to save them with bombs.
p3832
aVWe should leave them the fuck alone.
p3833
aVThis kind of radical jihadism is a conspiracy theory.
p3834
aVThere's no way the West can win.
p3835
aVWhen we were doing nothing in Bosnia, Chechnya, Syria and Aceh, Islamists screeched "Look at the evil West!
p3836
aVThey are not helping poor Muslims!
p3837
aVThey hate us and want us to die because they are unpious, hedonistic kuffar!".
p3838
aVWhen we do do something which involves killing some Muslims, the traditional script plays.
p3839
aVWhen we intervene to *help* Muslims which involves killing non-Muslims (e.g.
p3840
aVKosovo) radical Islamists are completely silent, because it doesn't fit in with their narrative.
p3841
aVThese guys have no gratitude for us.

aVFrance is as much an enemy to them as the US is, despite the Chirac government's refusal to fight in 2003 and diplomatic action in the UN.
p3843
aVNothing we do to impress them or convince them that we are actually Nice Guys will work.
p3844
aVThey will always find some way to blame the West, because their narrative demands they must.
p3845
aV&gt;Perhaps we shouldn't threaten War everytime they do something we don't approve of.
p3846
aVImagine you are a Daash commander, hanging out in Raqqa with your sex slaves and barely literate grunts.
p3847
aVWhich option would you prefer?
p3848
aVA.
p3849
aVA conventional and full war in the short term with a grand coalition of all the West and its local Muslim allies in the region, which inevitably entails the West immediately and completely kicking your ass.
p3850
aVB.
p3851
aVTime to consolidate your rule, collect taxes, establish yourself as *The* Islamic State and continuously make it more and more costly for opponents of your death cult to stop you.
p3852
aVThat you feel a need to clarify an anti-war position with the statement that you are not an apologist for Daash somehow manages to make it more obvious than it already is that B is the strategy Daash is pursuing.
p3853
aVContrary to what you say, there are risks and there are costs to not intervening.
p3854
aVThe longer we wait, the stronger they'll get - and they'll hate us just the same.
p3855
aVYour completely overstating how powerful this ragtag group is.
p3856
aVThey aren't a threat to us.
p3857
aVWe are playing into the narrative by attacking them, its ludicrous to suggest ISIL would be able to claim that the west is evil for not helping people they themselves are hurting.
p3858
aVDon't you think they know how people here would react to hearing about these videos?
p3859
aVIntervention for those in the group who actually care about this caliphate crap (which isn't all of them) is worst case scenario they die a martyr, best case they force us to bomb them for years wasting ludicrous sums of money, killing innocent people along the way, giving them the juice to keep themselves in power.
p3860
aVIt could be an indictment of how tenuous their position is that they feel the need to exacerbate a war to keep themselves together because they know the group will disintegrate as people who are using the it to achieve other aims peel off once those are achieved.
p3861
aVThey aren't stupid, they know full well that that a propaganda video that shows enough to get us to intervene to a degree, but not enough to intervene completely would make us do just that - which under some circumstances would be beneficial to their aims.
p3862
aVWe should be undercutting them diplomatically, doing the opposite of what they expect - actually empowering the people in the region.
p3863
aVYou can talk about showing the photos and videos or not, and call them what you want - but bombing them and calling them evil and overstating the threat and the power they have gives them all the credibility they need.   
p3864
aV&gt;its ludicrous to suggest ISIL would be able to claim that the west is evil for not helping people they themselves are hurting.
p3865
aVOf course it is, but they do it and the scary thing is, it works.
p3866
aVIf you can stomach it, watch [this video of theirs](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/06/17/jihad-2-0/) - note the children injured in Daash's war who are presented as objects in need of rescue.
p3867
aV&gt;They aren't a threat to us.
p3868
aVThey aren't a threat to us as they have more immediate concerns.
p3869
aVThe whole point of Daash, why they exist, is they turned Al-Qaeda's strategy on its head.
p3870
aVRather than fighting the West first then establishing the caliphate, Daash have established the caliphate so they can fight the West.
p3871
aVThis is a big part of why Al-Qaeda has disowned them.
p3872
aV&gt;Don't you think they know how people here would react to hearing about these videos?
p3873
aVDon't *you* think they know how people here would react exactly like you are doing when hearing about these videos?
p3874
aVThe entire point of these videos is to buy time through intimidating us pitiful cowardly Westerners for Daash to consolidate and make future attempts to destroy them more costly for us.
p3875
aV&gt;We should be undercutting them diplomatically, doing the opposite of what they expect - actually empowering the people in the region.
p3876
aVWe are also doing this.
p3877
aVIt's not incompatible with war with Daash - it's actually a pre-requisite - but it might not be enough.
p3878
aVThe Kurds are struggling, the Shia militias are thugs, the Free Syrian Army is a paper wildcat and Assad is as a monster.
p3879
aV&gt;but bombing them and calling them evil and overstating the threat and the power they have gives them all the credibility they need.
p3880
aVAnd understating their threat makes them somehow *less* dangerous?
p3881
aVWe didn't intervene in Syria because we were worried that bombing Assad would create a power vacuum which would allow Islamists to become powerful.
p3882
aVSo, we sat and watched a power vacuum form and an Islamist army become the most powerful force in Syria.
p3883
aVNot once have I see an anti-war argument concerning Daash contain "OK, there are risks to not going to war, but I think the trade-off is worth it".
p3884
aVIt is always assumed that doing nothing entails either minimal or no risk, in contrast to dangers intervention would produce which are apparently clearly greater than the current existence of Daash.
p3885
aVAnd this isn't to say it is obvious we should go to war, but it seems that as soon as you take the risks of inaction into account the case for non-intervention suddenly becomes a lot weaker, and I've yet to see an anti-war argument which considers those risks.
p3886
aVI think one of the issues can very clearly be seen in your post.
p3887
aVYou present the choice as "go to war or do nothing".
p3888
aVHowever that's a false dichotomy.
p3889
aVCruise missiles cost $1.4m each.
p3890
aVEvery bomb we drop costs tens of thousands of dollars.
p3891
aVWar is tremendously expensive and, whilst the human costs (death) are clear, the political results are uncertain.
p3892
aVTo me, the choice should instead be "go to war or, spend a small fraction of the amount we'd have spent on bullets and bombs, on making friends within the Islamic world, and making sure our point of view is heard".
p3893
aVThat's not doing nothing.
p3894
aVYou can't do foreign policy on the cheap.
p3895
aVIf you're going to talk about the financial costs of our security policy then you need to argue that defence is such a burden it's severely affecting our quality of life at home and that the ramifications of any cutbacks or withdrawal from the area in question are acceptable.
p3896
aVCounting cruise missiles is penny pinching.
p3897
aVWe're already doing what you've suggested we do actually, it's a key plank of Western foreign policy.
p3898
aVWe're friends with the Kurds, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Oman, the Gulf States, the Iraqi Government and Turkey.
p3899
aVWe've even reached out to Iran we're that desperate.
p3900
aVThe only people we have not tried to co-operate with are Assad and Daash themselves.
p3901
aVAnd it's shocking, but what we're doing isn't it enough.
p3902
aVIt's why Daash now control half of Syria and and Iraq each.
p3903
aVIt's why the Kurds are begging the air strikes intensify.
p3904
aVIt's why the FSA is desperate for arms and recognition.
p3905
aVAnd you are right, there are more choices than go to war or do nothing.
p3906
aVBut if we are going to do this, we can't fuck around.
p3907
aVWe are either in it to stop Daash at any cost, or we cut our losses and leave it to resolve itself.
p3908
aVSpending a little bit of money to try to stop Daash if we're lucky is not a good option.
p3909
aVWhen our friends are asking for more intervention and we refuse we isolate ourselves and make our diplomatic position harder.
p3910
aVIf more moderate strategies have failed and are continuing to fail it is madness to say that we should continue to pursue that failed strategy on the basis that the risks in escalating or withdrawal are greater than failure. 
p3911
aVYou speak of relationships with arab governments.
p3912
aVHowever that's not what I'm suggesting at all.
p3913
aVWe need to more actively compete for the opinion of the arab public, not just their governments.
p3914
aVdisagree the same way the responsible media don't publish the names of  killers who crave the attention this takes away what they want.
p3915
aVBut they don't want attention, they want deterrence.
p3916
aVThe executions are an attempt to make the price of intervention so high for the West that we stop the airstrikes or any future intervention.
p3917
aVThis isn't just taking what they are saying at face value in the videos, it's the same strategy the same group attempted unsuccessfully during the Iraq War.
p3918
aVThey don't have any other means of stopping the US from attempting airstrikes as they don't have AA weapons, and they're not bright enough to realize that despite their caricatures of us as soft and decadent stuff like this turns public opinion away from indifference and towards war.
p3919
aVdon't be silly, they are there to get ransoms from the french and other eu nations who negotiate  paid they aren't naive enough to think killing a few captives will stop nations readily willing to sacrifice thousands  of troops.
p3920
aV[I'm not being silly.
p3921
aV](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141987/robin-simcox/isis-worst-nightmare)\u000a\u000aISIS aren't interested in ransoms at this point.
p3922
aVThat's pocket change, suitable for start-up jihadist groups such as in the Maghreb and Boko Haram.
p3923
aVThey are making far more from selling oil, tax collection and financing by idiot fat cats in the Gulf.
p3924
aVOne reason might be deterrence but the slick production values and messages contained within the execution and other videos rather point to other reasons: that they are trying to demonstrate an ability to kill with impunity to a predominantly western audience and they want to inspire others to join their cause.
p3925
aVIt is also a big fuck you to the west.
p3926
aVMore than that, the executions have galvanised support for intervention as demonstrated by opinion polls pre and post execution.
p3927
aVISIS have demonstrated an understanding of media war and I find it difficult to believe these videos are meant to be a deterrent against western intervention.
p3928
aVMoreover al qaeda tried that with nick berg and that did not work.
p3929
aVLastly, if there is any deterrent effect, given that the victims have so far been almost exclusively civilians, I think the only people deterred will be journalists and aid workers.
p3930
aVI think it is quite clear these videos are not purely for deterrence.
p3931
aVThey have been chosen because they are obviously westerners and so will generate greatest publicity.
p3932
aVTo say the ransom is nothing also goes against the evidence; the french managed to secure release via payment. 
p3933
aVI agree, I think there are other reasons.
p3934
aVRansoms probably do play a secondary role, and it will have effects on recruitment and domestic morale too.
p3935
aVHowever, the options of provocation and deterrence are mutually exclusive.
p3936
aVEither Daash wants a war with the West, or it doesn't.
p3937
aV&gt;ISIS have demonstrated an understanding of media war and I find it difficult to believe these videos are meant to be a deterrent against western intervention.
p3938
aV[I mentioned elsewhere in the thread how Daash is likely to view the desirability of a full-out war with the West](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2iazyq/front_page_of_this_weeks_independent_on_sunday/cl0k9ew).
p3939
aVThe immediate problem Daash has concerning the West are the air strikes being conducted in Iraq and now Syria, and due to their lack of anti-air weaponry or planes they can't do anything militarily against these strikes.
p3940
aVTheir main concern at this point is that the USA will bleed them white with drones and planes, whilst the US' Muslim allies do the dirty work on the ground and take and hold territory.
p3941
aVDaash has to stop these strikes if they want their campaigns to succeed and the only option they to even try to make the strikes too costly for the West to continue is to hurt the hostages which they held for months before the air strikes began.
p3942
aV&gt;More than that, the executions have galvanised support for intervention as demonstrated by opinion polls pre and post execution.
p3943
aVRight, but it was also the only strategy available to them, and it probably seemed more viable to them then it does to us.
p3944
aVIf you're a radical Islamist fanatic who left the West to join Daash, you have to accept as a premise that the West is degenerate and godless, and it follows from this that in comparison to the Lions of Allah we are soft and cowardly.
p3945
aVThis kind of assumption on their part makes intimidation through the execution of hostages more appealing to them then it would do for us.
p3946
aVAnd to an extent they've been successful - the Independent front page and some of the comments in this thread are proof enough that Daash is through its own mythology getting across the narrative that it's too dangerous to provoke Daash.
p3947
aVThat public opinion as a whole is changing in favour of war is just their own assumptions about the willingness of the West to go to war in response to aggression being completely wrong.
p3948
aV\u000a&gt; They're skilled at using the internet and social media to recruit misfits and losers.
p3949
aVLet's hope they don't start up a /r/Isis then
p3950
aV&gt; against liberalism \u000a\u000aDon't see a problem with this.
p3951
aVSure, "daesh" are reactionary and an aberration but it is your "liberalism" that has created this group in the first place.
p3952
aVYou Bolshies just can't resist a dig at the West, can you?
p3953
aVlol.
p3954
aVI'm not even a Leninist, let alone "Bolshevist".
p3955
aVIf I was around in the 20s I probably would've been with the Blacks, not the Bolsheviks.
p3956
aVBut nice try.
p3957
aVOh I *see*, you're not a member of an arcane political cult, you're a member of some *other* arcane political cult!
p3958
aVCarry on then.
p3959
aVIf only there was some middle ground between righteous self censorship and pandering to terrorists...
p3960
aVJust looks like self-aggrandisement to me.
p3961
aVIf they wanted to do this properly, they should've just printed a normal story with no pictures.
p3962
aVIf I was a family member, I'd be pissed off.
p3963
aVReminds me of one newspaper's front page post 7/7. 
p3964
aVWar propaganda generally would.
p3965
aVMost papers, as far as I recall, did something similar to this after the 2004 tsunami in Asia that killed at least a quarter of a million people.
p3966
aVI'm not so sure about this one.
p3967
aVI don't like the implication of "here's the news, not the propaganda.
p3968
aV" I feel like the Independent are being snooty and trying to take the moral high ground by not having a picture of a murdered man in an orange jumpsuit on their front page. 
p3969
aVThe problem I have with this, though it sets the right tone, is that it uses this event to legitimise the message "we are real news" by comparing itself to the worst form of propaganda\u000a\u000aThis is still propaganda
p3970
aVA refreshing change.
p3971
aVTo have more bloody murder?
p3972
aVYes yes, that's exactly what I meant.
p3973
aVWow that's pretty powerful.
p3974
aVThe #EpicFail guide to social media and the promise to sort my Sunday for just £2.20 all over the top of the paper detracts from the message just a tad.
p3975
aVThe Independent giving a lecture on propaganda?
p3976
aV*Scoff*
p3977
aVI support this.
p3978
aVI don't think we should be giving airtime to bloodsoaked murderers attempting to wield hate and fear and death as weapons against the innocent.
p3979
aVI don't think we should be broadcasting their crimes on their terms, via the videos and photographs they have provided, with the speeches and announcements they have written.
p3980
aVI think our various news outlets should report on these people, by all means.
p3981
aVBut for every death, a joke at their expense.
p3982
aVFor every bomb dropped, a running tally of towns and cities under their control so that we might have a visual aid as to the progress of the battle with them.
p3983
aVFor every beheading, a thousand leaflets dropped over their desert strongholds announcing plans for bacon-tipped bullets to be provided to their enemies and the women being trained to fight them, getting killed by a woman equals no heaven for you, motherfucker.
p3984
aVThis propaganda requires an answer.
p3985
aVI think we, the people of Britain, are in a unique place given our sense of humour to provide such an answer.
p3986
aVThis is a terrible idea.
p3987
aVI'm not even sure where to begin, but I don't think a story of a man being beheaded warrants a joke at anyone's expense.
p3988
aVAnd the bacon-tipped bullets idea was just uncalled for; there are plenty of decent Muslims who don't need that sort of islamophobic content being put out there.
p3989
aVISIS aren't true Muslims, and we should treat them for their radicalism and extremism, not for the fact that they claim to be followers of Islam.
p3990
aVIt's not Islamophobic to suggest that shooting at the people who are running a perversion of Islam with bullets tipped with something that Islam states you can't get into heaven if you in any way consume or touch.
p3991
aVIf anything, is it not simply beating ISIS at their own game?
p3992
aVThey wanna attract young, angry Muslims to do their fighting for them.
p3993
aVOkay, we'll fight them with a weapon that no Muslim, no matter how young and angry, can possibly expect to be killed with and still get to heaven.
p3994
aVIt's called morale.
p3995
aVWe can spend all day and all night bombing these guys and not accomplish a fucking thing as long as they have a suitably fortified cave and enough sets of dominos.
p3996
aVLeave just one of these dudes with a bacon-tipped bullet in his chest and watch the fear grow.
p3997
aVThey want to use fear as a weapon, I suggest we give them a reason to be a little fearful of us.
p3998
aVA waste of black ink.
p3999
aVThat's still reporting it, and making a big thing out of it, which is exactly what the killers want.
p4000
aVAs long as it's getting reported, it's going to keep happening.
p4001
aVI don't like it, they are making a show out of it.
p4002
aVThis draws more and not less attention to it.
p4003
aVThey could have reported about it in a discrete way but they went for 'everyone look how we are not mentioning IS'.
p4004
aVIt creates more attention (the fact that this is on reddit kind of proofs that), it's clearly marketing for the newspaper.
p4005
aVSo they are using the death of a person for marketing... wtf, IS certainly likes it...
p4006
aVThe headline is untrue.
p4007
aVFor some reason they picked *one* name out of a very long list.
p4008
aVLook here for the reverse DNS: http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=ptr%3a195.234.240.212&amp;run=toolpage\u000a\u000aIt resolves to many different journalists at the rag, about 30-40 total addresses.
p4009
aVThis whole affair seems a trifle fishy.
p4010
aVIP is a pretty shitty way of identification.
p4011
aVI'm pretty sure it's not even admissible in court.
p4012
aVGreat point.
p4013
aVThat's why I'm baffled how they make filesharing charges stick.  
p4014
aVThey get a confession.
p4015
aVAs far as I know no one has been found liable for, or guilty of normal filesharing without some kind of confession.
p4016
aVIP addresses are used in criminal investigations, but usually (if the police are doing their job properly) as a starting point, not as definite proof.
p4017
aVRecently a judge in Florida overturned an RIAA lawsuit on the grounds that just because someone lives at the house where an IP address is, doesn't mean they are the one who downloaded the pirated material.
p4018
aVIt's shitty but this does prove (to some extent) that the post came from the Daily Mail's internal network.
p4019
aVI'd presume a big organization like that has a static, dedicated connection, so the host information is a little more reliable than if it were a person on an ADSL or cable connection (dynamic IPs vs. Static IPs).
p4020
aVEven then IP spoofing is a thing.
p4021
aVIt's easy to fake your IP to a website.
p4022
aVIt could easily have been David Williams given his recent article history for the Mail.
p4023
aVNot saying it was him of course, but given Ferrer left the Mail then unlikely to have been him.
p4024
aVhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?authornamef=David+Williams
p4025
aVIf we knew the exact time of the original post, we could work out which domain had the IP at the time from your link.
p4026
aV[deleted]
p4027
aVwhy not?
p4028
aVa dynamic IP address is assigned to various recipients and it looks like that link details the time that IP address was assigned to a particular domain.
p4029
aVThe objective being finding out who owned that IP when that message was posted.
p4030
aVIt's not a dynamic IP address.
p4031
aVIt's just that several domains have the same IP address.
p4032
aVThat makes no sense.
p4033
aVAlso since it's a big organisation they tend to buy entire IP ranges so to a company level (maybe office) they can be "static".
p4034
aVLooks dynamic to me, with all those different domains assigned to it over time.
p4035
aVNo, all those domains are assigned to that IP address *simultaneously*.
p4036
aVyeah but not all the domains are for the daily mail.
p4037
aVSure, all the DM entries are the same domain, but there are others.
p4038
aVYou can assign any domain to any IP address.
p4039
aVThey all look like parts of the DMG which was my point.
p4040
aVThey're static in the sense it will always come from within the organisation but not from the same user.
p4041
aV[Richard Ferrer](https://twitter.com/richferrer)?
p4042
aV- Editor, Jewish News.
p4043
aVColumnist, Independent, Ex Daily Mail and Daily Mirror
p4044
aVYeah so he's editor of "Jewish News" and happens to try and fake violent muslim anger for the Daily Mail in the most ridiculously stupid, obvious way ever?
p4045
aVThis can't just sound a little fishy to me. 
p4046
aV&gt;This can't just sound a little fishy to me.
p4047
aVYes.
p4048
aVYou are not alone.
p4049
aVShut it down.
p4050
aVOy vey.
p4051
aVA new low for the Daily Mail if this is true.
p4052
aVI hope it gets picked-up by the press and they get a kicking. 
p4053
aV&gt;A new low for the Daily Mail\u000a\u000aWhat about the time they published a personal attack on a transsexual woman for working in a school that triggered a media circus and led to her committing suicide?
p4054
aVI am not trans, but that is something that still make my blood boil when I hear it mentioned.
p4055
aVAnd I don't normally give a crap about that kinda stuff.
p4056
aVTo bully someone to death, which is all I can see it as because it isn't reporting, especially when they had already been mostly accepted by the local community, is just absolutely wrong and disgusting.
p4057
aVThere have been many daily mail lows before, but that to me is one of the deepest.
p4058
aVI'm trans, and it's always lovely to know that popular media outlets like to make it out like it's a choice and so chastise you like you're a freak of nature.
p4059
aVIt's a demanding life at best, and these doomsayer media outlets claim it's for attention or that being transgender has anything to do with LGB.
p4060
aVSo after being unrepresented in pretty much all walks of life, they have the audacity to claim that my life is less than a straight/cis person because I happened to be born with gender dysphoria.
p4061
aVRant aside, I feel like while LGB people are going to get their rights almost world wide within the next 10 years or so, it'll be a long time before being transgender is accepted.
p4062
aVI get that people have gender identity issues and I've seen some life-altering body modifications, however, as someone who has little experience around real-life trans people, can you please explain to me a bit about how you feel and what makes you tick?
p4063
aVeg.
p4064
aVAt what point did you say, "I'd rather be a &amp;amp;amp;lt;current gender&gt; looking &amp;amp;amp;lt;opposite gender&gt; than accept the body/role I grew up in?
p4065
aVHow successful would you describe your self-created outward appearance as, at enhancing your inner sense of self-acceptance?
p4066
aVFor me personally (Gender dysphoria is different for each person) it's the fact that everything that I do, act, associate with is naturally more feminine.
p4067
aVThe reason why many transgender persons suffer greatly is because when you are born, society goes "Okay, you have this genitalia, therefore certain social responsibilities are given to you".
p4068
aV*The clash happens when you want to act the way you are, to be yourself, but that is not what is expected from society.
p4069
aV*\u000a\u000aFor me personally, I was sent to an all male school, during this time, I felt really awkward.
p4070
aVI couldn't fit in with my classmates, at least not anything past a superficial level.
p4071
aVOn the other hand, hanging out with female friends outside of school just clicked.
p4072
aVSo in order not to be outcasted my friends, family and people in general, I had to put on this masculine act.
p4073
aVDoing so 24/7 for over a decade really, really breaks you mentally.
p4074
aVYou can't be your true self to anyone.
p4075
aVSo me, being the already mentally crippled and depressed person, realised that I'm basically lying to everyone I meet and converse with because I'm forcing myself to mentally act the way I am physically.
p4076
aVI kept this up until about 16, until I had a huge breakdown, six attempted suicides within one month, etc.
p4077
aVI told my parents at the time that it was just vanilla depression, and I'd get over it.
p4078
aVI'm 19 now, and I'm still living with my folks, but only my mother knows I'm transgender.
p4079
aVI'm currently looking to move out (if I can ever find work again) and finally start my life the way it was intended.
p4080
aVIt goes up another level too.
p4081
aVI refuse to use male public bathrooms, refuse to allow anyone to know my birth name or to be called by it (if I can help it) for example.
p4082
aVSo when society expects me, as a man, to act accordingly, the clash happens again and I'd rather prefer to either ignore it (and face transbashing, etc) or I have to abide by the expectations and the mental battle rages on.
p4083
aVI'm pretty lucky for the most part.
p4084
aVI didn't grow up in a religious place, and I live in a country where coming out as trans doesn't lead to execution.
p4085
aVBut people who end up caving in fully end up mutilating their genitalia, or committing suicide.
p4086
aVThe media doesn't help either, when they objectify transgender people and treat it as an oddity.
p4087
aVThe porn industry doesn't help either, but I won't open that can of worms.
p4088
aVTL;DR: Gender Dysphoria is a real thing, it's bloody awful and very few people take it seriously.
p4089
aVEdit: Just to add, sorry for being so dark and macabre about it, but I didn't want to make it seem farcical or less serious.
p4090
aVHey, I really appreciate the open and direct answer.
p4091
aV:)\u000a\u000aTell me, do you think it's possible for a person in your area with male genitalia to be accepted as non-masculine?
p4092
aV&gt;Tell me, do you think it's possible for a person in your area with male genitalia to be accepted as non-masculine?
p4093
aVSure, I guess.
p4094
aVI live in London so usually people don't bat an eye at much
p4095
aVOK, so do you think it's possible to define yourself as male and and not behave with typical masculine traits?
p4096
aVWell yes, but I do not define myself as male, although I could.
p4097
aVWell, you'd accept that you were born with male genitalia and can reproduce as the male partner of sexual intercourse, so you'd have to accept that your body is physically male, regardless of how you feel about that inside.
p4098
aVIn the same way that I may have blonde hair but want to eg.
p4099
aVbe a brunette.
p4100
aVNo matter how good the hair dye is, I'm still a blonde that is wearing brown hair dye..
p4101
aVIn which case, I ask, is it difficult to accept your physical body and behave however makes you happy?
p4102
aVI recommend you look at some of my previous comments to understand why a person with Gender Dysphoria finds it extremely difficult to function in their physical gender.
p4103
aVThanks, sorry for the hard questions - just trying to understand something I can't intimately relate to.
p4104
aVIt's fine, don't worry.
p4105
aVIf you want to get a wider perspective you could check out /r/transgender and associated subs :) 
p4106
aV&gt; Rant aside, I feel like while LGB people are going to get their rights almost world wide within the next 10 years or so, it'll be a long time before being transgender is accepted.
p4107
aVIf it makes you feel any better we are at least a century off in some places from the beginnings of that happening... shit innit.
p4108
aVProtip: don't use the term 'cis' if you want wider society to accept you.
p4109
aVTo many people its not unlike calling someone a kaffir or infidel.
p4110
aVBut "cis" is the exact correct term to use.
p4111
aVDo you personally get offended by it?
p4112
aVWhat's your alternative?
p4113
aVI personally dislike 'cis' too.
p4114
aVIts just less clunky than something like 'born as identified gender'
p4115
aVTry 'normal' or 'regular'.
p4116
aVI don't think there is much will in society to adopt another term like 'straight' to describe the normal state at this point, and using the term 'cis' means you'll have lost half of the audience before you've started.
p4117
aVIs this really a thing?
p4118
aVI'm as fine with cis as I am with being called straight.
p4119
aVI don't know many people who would be seen as being called cis a bad thing.
p4120
aVI hope you can see how negative it would be to call someone normal as opposed to cis.
p4121
aVhttp://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concern_troll
p4122
aVOh look you can copy paste.
p4123
aVHave fun continuing to alienate audiences and failing to get any points across.
p4124
aVDude people have been asking you why you feel this way and you haven't responded.
p4125
aVThe only person here alienating people and failing to get a point across is you.
p4126
aVNo they haven't.
p4127
aVWell, I know I for one did elsewhere in this thread.
p4128
aVNo you didn't.
p4129
aVNeither did anyone else.
p4130
aVYou do realise how insulting it is to imply that trans people are 'not normal'?
p4131
aVHe's a troll.
p4132
aVThey aren't.
p4133
aVJust like a chimeric cat isn't normal.
p4134
aVI don't think it implies anything else.
p4135
aVIt's quite amazing how a solid piece of advice is being down voted.
p4136
aVI think the thing is, is that most people don't have a problem being called cis.
p4137
aVMuch like they don't have a problem being called straight.
p4138
aVDo you view being called straight as a slur too?
p4139
aVMeh.
p4140
aVI'm not the one who has to communicate important things to another group without making them hate me by the mere terminology I unnecessarily invented to describe them.
p4141
aVDoesn't affect me :)
p4142
aVI'm *really* right wing, i believe in free markets, i think socialists are wrong about *everything* and i support the tory's \u000a\u000a*that being said*\u000a\u000ai can't imagine how hard it must be for someone to be born in the wrong body to be male but to *know* you were meant to be female an vice versa \u000a\u000ato me it's only common sense, that you're *born* trans just like you're *born* gay an i salute you're courage to become what you were meant to be.
p4143
aV(bear in mind the left will *never* know how to run an economy, even if our lot are 10 years behind the social issues :P) 
p4144
aVJust 10 years?
p4145
aVeh i'd rather be a decade behind the social issues and *actually* know how to run a country's finances then the alternative:\u000a\u000a"t-t-theres NO SUCH THING AS DEBT WE CAN SPEND OUR WAY OUT OF EVERYTHING" \u000a\u000ai made my choice \u000a\u000awe conservatives are necessary to counter the sheer pie in the sky fucking delusion of the left, even if we do get some things wrong.
p4146
aV&gt; we conservatives are necessary to counter the sheer pie in the sky fucking delusion of the left, even if we do get some things wrong.
p4147
aVToo much socialism = bust economy\u000a\u000aToo much capitalism = bust planet
p4148
aVWhat is the necessity of cutting budget deficits when GDP is significantly below trend in a country where all government borrowing is done in the currency entirely controlled by that country's central bank?
p4149
aVMeh, some lefties are stupid, some righties are stupid.
p4150
aVI'd call myself left-wing if forced into a decision, but, frankly both capitalism and socialism don't work because human nature corrupts.
p4151
aVIf anything capitalism may well be the slightly better system because at least it accepts human beings are inherently selfish bastards.
p4152
aVAlthough I may not agree with your political leanings towards the Right of the political spectrum, especially the mainstream political groups and the Tories, I do applaud your standing up in support of the rights of ignored minorities.
p4153
aVIt is sad that you are getting down-voted for what I read as a positive post.
p4154
aVit's because i said the left doesn't know how to run a successful economy \u000a\u000ait's fine though.  
p4155
aVOh don't get me wrong, there is a stereotype that lots of LGBT people are left wing (I've been to pride marches, and often you do see socialist/S.W.P support and flags), but I'm right leaning in many aspects (Libertarianism, for example plus I'm fairly right wing when it comes to fiscal issues).
p4156
aVOne thing that really grinds my gears is when people assume I'm left wing due to being trans, or that all right wingers are associated with homophobia, transphobia, etc.
p4157
aVMy political leanings tend to clash in conversation unfortunately :/
p4158
aVexactly the same here\u000a\u000ai'm as right wing as they come, but it seems to me gay people and trans people were *born* how they are, therefore we must logically conclude that they need support and help, not hatred and derision\u000a\u000abecause you literally cannot help how you are born \u000a\u000abut you are right, there is a massive stereotype of gay and trans individuals being left wing \u000a\u000ai wish it wasn't so, because even though the right are hopelessly wrong about gay and trans people we *really* do know how to run an economy and get more people with more money in their pockets.
p4159
aVcan you be socially left wing but financially right wing?
p4160
aVif you can, that's me
p4161
aV&gt;can you be socially left wing but financially right wing?
p4162
aVMe too, I'd consider myself 'Left-Libertarian' but people who are black and white minded would see that as a clash of ideologies. 
p4163
aV[I don't know if you are familiar with Bleeding Heart Libertarians](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/about-us/) but keep in mind that early libertarians split with Nixon over things like his imposition of wage-and-price controls and were generally dismissed as dope-smoking, free-love hippies because they early on favored legalizing drugs and were pro-gay rights. 
p4164
aVYou can certainly separate out the social and fiscal "leanings": see the [Political Compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org), a wordy but interesting system on a 2d instead of a 1d plane that let's you take a test and figure out roughly where you lie.
p4165
aVI'm certainly in the bottom left quadrant, which is very much the " social libertarian" style category.\u000a
p4166
aVI know the Daily Mail is awful, but this is the first time I'm hearing about this. 
p4167
aVFortunately the multifaceted nature of human existence provides enough dimensions in the hyperspace that all kinds of lows are achievable by the DM in different ways.
p4168
aVHoly crap do you have a link to that?

p4171
aVWhat a dastardly cunt that man is; and yet my mother still reads that paper.
p4172
aVThere is not new low for the daily mail to reach.
p4173
aVIt's fucking terrifying to me that they have a large and genuine audience.
p4174
aVHas anyone got the that online list of horrible Daily Mail actions over the years?
p4175
aVIt'll be a "rogue employee" again...
p4176
aVThis is a hate crime, would anyone actually accept individual responsibility for this with the likelihood of going to prison?
p4177
aVI bet they'd give up the editors quickly enough if they were charged.
p4178
aVDon't worry!
p4179
aVJournalists are above the law, particularly Daily Mail ones.
p4180
aVAlso, he's not brown.
p4181
aVTherefore, no offence.
p4182
aVJust because one person posted this does not mean the Daily Mail condones it or ordered it.
p4183
aVCompanies are made up of individuals.
p4184
aVCompanies do not (and should not) know everything there is to know about their employees.
p4185
aVSo you don't post it from work, especially given the types of stories the Daily Fail is well known for posting
p4186
aVPeople are idiots.
p4187
aVNice try Richard.. 
p4188
aVSure, but when similar behaviour is commonplace, there is a problem with the company. 
p4189
aVYou'd think but look at what idiotic UKIPers believe every time one of their members does something ghastly.
p4190
aVBasically if your organisation attracts people like that then you have to question the motives of your organisation.
p4191
aVCompanies are people
p4192
aVAye, the same bullshit excuse they made for the phone hacking.
p4193
aVThey create an environment which pressures and encourages their employees to break they law, then later act oblivious.
p4194
aVIf this is true, the Daily Mail really needs to be held to account. 
p4195
aVNo, the Daily Mail (and other news outlets) do not pressure their employees to break the law.
p4196
aVthey pressure them to succeed and get a scoop or face punishment.
p4197
aVIt is the Individual or group *inside* the company that *chooses* to break the law.
p4198
aV&gt;No, the Daily Mail (and other news outlets) do not pressure their employees to break the law.
p4199
aVthey pressure them to succeed and get a scoop or face punishment.
p4200
aVThis, as evinced by the phone hacking scandal, amounts to the same thing. 
p4201
aVNo, it doesnt.
p4202
aVThe employees choose to break the law.
p4203
aVThe company does not tell them to.

aVThat wasn't that bad to be honest, I mean it was his job to encourage a violent revolution against capitalism everywhere in the world including Britain so...
p4206
aVI think this, if its true is worse.
p4207
aVThe letter was forged. 
p4208
aVI understood that.
p4209
aVDon't you think the publication of a forged letter to sabotage an election is a little worse than posting something on an obscure forum?
p4210
aVWell, it didn't work by your own source.
p4211
aVWhat didn't work?
p4212
aVI apologise, I meant /u/madtambo's source.
p4213
aVIt didn't 'sabotage the election'.
p4214
aVThese far-right racists have been lying for generations.

p4218
aVNever judge morality by subsequent "success" or "failure" of the intended action.
p4219
aVMorality is about intent, rather than consequences.
p4220
aV&gt;Morality is about intent, rather than consequences.
p4221
aVThis doesn't work at all though.
p4222
aVIn the first instance, intent is only truly knowable to the individual performing some action.
p4223
aVIn the second, intent itself can be deeply flawed ("He meant well, but...").
p4224
aVGiven both those things, attempting to judge an outcome purely upon the motives of those responsible, without reference to what was actually *done* can lead you into some sort of moral wasteland.
p4225
aVIt's the precise reasoning which permits burning heretics at the stake because the *intent* is to save their eternal souls from mortal peril.
p4226
aVI guess I should qualify my statement, and the difference between a more absolutist intent and relativistic intent.
p4227
aVAbsolutist intent is "I intend to set this heretic on fire" - the direct thing you are trying to accomplish.
p4228
aVRelativistic intent is "I intend to nobly save this heretic by performing a service".
p4229
aVMy definition of intent in this circumstance is the absolutist one: the baseline thing you were trying to accomplish.
p4230
aVThe lines blur between the two but there's a distinction I think can be made there.
p4231
aV195.234.240.212 resolves as their web server.
p4232
aVThat seems like someone is deliberately trying to make it look like it was posted by a daily mail journalist.
p4233
aVIf it were really someone in the office it would come from whatever address staff have as their own web proxy.
p4234
aVThis would almost certainly be a different address to the one serving out web pages for their fairly large readership.
p4235
aVAgreed, faked by someone who doesn't build networks
p4236
aVYeah very unlikely the webserver and the offices have the same outbound IP. 
p4237
aVI just posted the same on Facebook, in response to a conspiracy-theorist friend.
p4238
aVThen I remembered that the Mail once stalked my website in an attempt to write about me, and the whole IP setup was *exactly* as they've described here.
p4239
aVThe full story:\u000a\u000aAt the tail end of 2011, I answered the phone at work.
p4240
aV"Hi it's Christopher Hastings from the Mail on Sunday".
p4241
aVHe'd got hold of some documents that named me and wanted to make me the subject of a story.
p4242
aVIt was all quite tedious but I had no wish to be in the papers so quietly rang round friends and got various photos of me taken down to make things more difficult for them.
p4243
aVOver the next five days, I noticed several visits to my website from the Daily Mail's nameserver, as did several friends who mention me on their websites.
p4244
aVStrangely, they also seem to use an enterprise search setup so their (many) searches on me showed up in my analytics as coming from the Mail.
p4245
aVIn this instance I am absolutely, 100% sure it was a Mail journalist behind it, and the nameserver/IP setup was *exactly* as the forum featured here have described.
p4246
aVtl;dr version: actually they do have the same outbound IP and their webserver (weird through that is), based on my own experience of being stalked by the Mail.
p4247
aVI'll concede that it's possible - seems to be an unorthodox setup but fair enough, you have the first hand experience I lack.
p4248
aVSo sorry to hear you had to deal with these dirtbags, by the way.
p4249
aVThat sounds pretty nasty; did the story ever get published?\u000a
p4250
aVNope - they spiked it in the end, but for a good few weeks my Saturday evenings were spent refreshing the Mail website to check.
p4251
aVIt wasn't a particularly interesting story, but that doesn't usually stop them.
p4252
aVThis was three years ago, though - the Mail's website traffic has gone through the roof since then, so it might have changed.\u000a
p4253
aVIf they host their own web server it's not very unlikely at all.
p4254
aVYou don't put your datcentre through the same connection as your employees.
p4255
aVThey aren't even normally the same city, let alone building.
p4256
aVAnd not only that, such a thing is a massive risk since you've put critical infrastructure on the same internal networks that hundreds of spearphishable employees are sat on.
p4257
aVThe daily mail are a huge traffic website, and their servers are most likely located at colocation sites nearer the internet backbone.
p4258
aV&gt; You don't put your datacenter through the same connection as your employees.
p4259
aVWelcome to corporate IT.
p4260
aVYou don't put it on the same network as everything else, you sit world facing stuff in a DMZ.
p4261
aVYeah well OK I should have clarified: you *can*, but making it safe requires extra effort and complexity as you describe.
p4262
aVI know that corporations would do this stuff in house and have their servers at HQ, but I highly doubt that's the case for such an online behemoth: you're talking about a web property that will be cached and CDN'd up the wazoo just to make it scalable.\u000a
p4263
aVI'm no IT guy but surely there's no way the staff's outbound web traffic comes from the same IP as their web server.
p4264
aVIf they host the website themselves on the same site as where their employees work, it's not unusual.
p4265
aVIn a pretty typical small setup like that, the world-facing IP is the public interface on a hardware firewall like a Cisco ASA.
p4266
aVWhen a request hits it the firewall rules dictate where it goes on the LAN (or if it just gets dropped) while the other stuff on the same network that needs to talk outward just goes out via the same firewall (with a proxy in the middle, or the firewall configured to check outbound requests with something more transparent like websense which instructs the firewall as to whether the request should be honoured or rejected)\u000a\u000aWebservers hosted in a configuration like that don't even know what the external IP is, the ASA just passes requests along to it based on its ruleset, and the webserver serves up the site requested based on the host header in the request.
p4267
aVIt's not the only way of doing it, but it's not at all surprising to come across companies doing it like this.
p4268
aVThe Daily Mail has 100 million visits to its site a month.
p4269
aVIt is the second largest paper in the UK.
p4270
aVI really can't imagine such a massive organisation having a setup like this.
p4271
aVMaybe I'm wrong, but I just can't see them hosting the site from the same IP as the one their employees use to check Facebook and browse Reddit.
p4272
aVI haven't checked but isn't it possible that the DNS entries for the web site point to a cdn which acts as a reverse proxy for the real site, which could indeed be hosted on the office network.
p4273
aVMaybe they want us to think they've been framed by a leftist hacker?
p4274
aV*dramatic music*
p4275
aV**MISDIRECTION ALL THE WAY DOWN**
p4276
aVWhy would a former DM employee still have subdomains in his name?
p4277
aVPeople are jumping to the conclusion that having his name in means the address was his personal computer.
p4278
aVIn fact the subdomain was for his blog.
p4279
aVThe subdomain remains active so that any old links to the blog can be redirected to the Daily Mail website rather than just becoming broken.
p4280
aVIT tech from a big company here.
p4281
aVWe name the host for each machine in a naming scheme that includes the name of that person but if a person leaves and a new person gets their PC then the host name may not get changed until the PC is replaced.
p4282
aVThat could easily have happened here if the DM have a similar system.
p4283
aVI think you're confusing internal dns (as with Active Directory) with external DNS.
p4284
aVI doubt every machine in your company has an externally resolvable address.
p4285
aVNetworking isn't my speciality (more of a hardware guy) but while I'm pretty sure that the address isn't resolvable from outside it's still visible on connections.
p4286
aVI.e.
p4287
aVWhen I vnc into my home machine it tells me that myname.mycompany.net is controlling this machine rather than just the ip.
p4288
aVEach machine does have a static ip.
p4289
aVYou're probably using a VPN though, where the internally addressable network becomes visible once the network is up
p4290
aVyes, but a publicly-resolveable name?
p4291
aVBut the IP resolves to their WEB server, as an IT tech from a big company do you think that outbound traffic from the DM offices will share the same IP as the main website?
p4292
aVYeah, totally not.
p4293
aVSomething isn't right.
p4294
aVIt's not my area so I'm not the best one to figure out what. 
p4295
aVWhy would a post allegedly made from the Daily Mail offices appear to come from their web server, as this does?
p4296
aVI assume that their site has enough traffic to justify dedicated servers, and is not being served from a box in the corner of the office which also acts as a proxy server for their staff.
p4297
aVI strongly suspect that the forum software blindly accepts the X-Forwarded-For header as containing the user's IP address, in which case you can spoof any address you like.
p4298
aVIt's probably not completely unfeasible that they have one server for web services and proxy.
p4299
aVYou should do some more digging.
p4300
aVWhat would be the point?
p4301
aVIP alone proves nothing.
p4302
aVLet's try it :)
p4303
aVI originally posted it on /r/unitedkingdom [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/29wzmo/a_post_on_ummahcom_calling_for_muslims_to_wage/), but it was removed because of the rule against screenshots.
p4304
aVYou should also post it to /r/conspiracy, those guys would be interested in something like this.
p4305
aVI'd advise against that place.
p4306
aVIt's a cesspit.
p4307
aVthat's just what the man wants you to think!
p4308
aVx post it to /r/lizardmen instead
p4309
aVDunno what you mean.
p4310
aVThose guys have 100% convinced me that the Jews are behind everything! 
p4311
aVThat's what they want you to think. 
p4312
aVI'm sure they'll find a way to make it about the jews.
p4313
aVThe guy who posted it: https://twitter.com/richferrer\u000a\u000a&gt;Editor, Jewish News.
p4314
aV/pol/ is always right.
p4315
aV*grabs popcorn*
p4316
aVHe hasn't worked there for 5 years.
p4317
aVI'm pretty sure that nothing specifically anti-jewish has ever been up voted there.
p4318
aVAnti-zionist, yeah, but there's a big difference.
p4319
aVStill, the place is a mess.
p4320
aVThere's been plenty of outright anti-Semitic stuff posted there, unfortunately.
p4321
aVCheck /r/conspiratard for the list. 
p4322
aVPeople post stupid shit everywhere, doesn't get up voted though.
p4323
aVThey're not racist, just some are nutjobs and tend to convince the majority about stupid theories.
p4324
aVIn my couple years of being subscribed half for the lols, I haven't seen anything anti-semetic.
p4325
aVThe funny thing is that Semite actually means Arab by definition haha.
p4326
aVI've had the same experience as you.
p4327
aVMostly people believing outlandish plots from the same governments that they think are incompetent.
p4328
aVOh, [come on](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/search?q=anti-semitic&amp;restrict_sr=on).
p4329
aVIt's hardly uncommon. 
p4330
aVLike when bipolarbear put fake anti-semitic posts on conspiracy under an alt and then tried to get people to upvote it on IRC so he could call conspiracy anti-semitic?
p4331
aVYeah, real classy.
p4332
aVThere's lots of nonsense on conspiracy, but most of the most egregious stuff is trolls.
p4333
aVSadly, there are usually some "jewish banker" posts lurking around.
p4334
aVYou can make it a self post and link to the images in the comments. 
p4335
aVCan we not get this investigated?
p4336
aVForwarded to the media? 
p4337
aV'We'?
p4338
aVEvery journalist I know uses Reddit.
p4339
aVI don't doubt that DM would stoop to false flags but I do struggle to believe that they would make it so obvious.
p4340
aVThis screenshot obviously doesn't provide any evidence and indeed only proper access to their servers would.
p4341
aVEven then it might simply be that they are not configured properly and someone figured that out.
p4342
aVsomeone pretending to be someone they're not to stir up animosity, say it ain't so /r/ukpolitics 
p4343
aVNothing new.
p4344
aVMI5 and various special police units have been pulling this honeypot crap for years and I am sure the newspapers have too.
p4345
aVPass it to the police
p4346
aVI'd suggest part of the problem is that it's just so easily believable that someone at the Mail would do this, just to stir up some more trouble.
p4347
aVI dont know enough about the web to know if this is true but i do know enough about the daily mail to suspect that it could be.
p4348
aVId like to see some concrete evidence or an explanation from someone in the know before i go on a witch hunt however im close to making an exception for a newspaper as disgusting and hateful as this. 
p4349
aVI like how many are going out of their way to explain away that DM is trying to start up trouble.
p4350
aVArguing about IP's and domains etc.
p4351
aVThe fact of the matter is that DM, someone who has access to their system, made a honeypot post.
p4352
aVThe entire debate around this event is totally trivial- there is so much damage control being attempted here it's not even funny.
p4353
aVBloody converts. 
p4354
aVWhat the actual fuck?
p4355
aVSo he hasn't worked there for 6 years and the daily mail has confirmed that it wasn't him who posted it, but don't lets let facts stand in the way of the witch hunt.
p4356
aVFucking disgusting, inciting racist hatred so they can sell newspapers.
p4357
aVA scumbag newspaper.
p4358
aVMuslims aren't a race.
p4359
aVIt's religious discrimination as a token for ethnic discrimination.
p4360
aVThere's plenty of white Muslims in the UK (e.g.
p4361
aVmy sister-in-law and her husband), but I'd be surprised if that was the picture in your head when someone says "Muslim".
p4362
aVRacism can be defined as discrimination based on cultural practices rather than an ethnic or racial grouping.
p4363
aVAnything can be defined as anything, it doesn't make it correct.
p4364
aVThis leftist attempt to redefine racism to include whatever they want is ill advised at best.
p4365
aVRacism, as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary\u000a\u000ahttp://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/racism\u000a\u000a1.
p4366
aVThe belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races\u000a\u000a2.
p4367
aVPrejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one\u2019s own race is superior\u000a\u000a
p4368
aVThere is the argument that language is fluid and definitions and meanings change over time and the meaning of the term 'racism' depends upon the context in which it is used.
p4369
aVA fuzzy definition doesn't make it incorrect either.\u000a\u000a 
p4370
aVSaying that "Racism" can mean discrimination based on anything other than race is quite frankly stupid.
p4371
aVIt has the word "race" in it, it can't get much more obvious than that.
p4372
aVThis is why context is important.
p4373
aVRace as a social construction expands the definition beyond biological racial differences to include social, political and cultural differences that overlap and intersect.
p4374
aVUse defines meaning.
p4375
aVI'll take the legal definition over the OED.
p4376
aVSo since the legal definition of rape means women cannot rape men, you accept that's the "real" definition?
p4377
aVYou have confused the signifier for the signified.
p4378
aVI'm not taking the legal definition _just because_ it's the legal definition, but because the legal definition happens to line up with what people commonly mean when they talk about racist acts, racist speech and racially aggravated crimes.
p4379
aVThe amount of things that are called "racist" these days doesn't help your idea that just because something is what people "commonly mean" that makes it the right definition.
p4380
aVThis is just SO FALSE.
p4381
aVThere is no legal definition of rape that actually excludes females from being convicted of rape.
p4382
aVI'm guessing you've never heard of statutory rape?
p4383
aVOr maybe you never even bothered to think of female child predators.
p4384
aVI suggest you do a simple google search for the demographics of rape convicts in America and realize that women do receive rape convictions.
p4385
aVhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1\u000a\u000a&gt;(1)A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014\u000a\u000a&gt;(a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,\u000a\u000a&gt;(b)B does not consent to the penetration, and\u000a\u000a&gt;(c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.
p4386
aVAccording to UK law, only a man can rape, and it's only rape if done with a penis.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4387
aV&gt; This leftist attempt to redefine racism to include whatever they want is ill advised at best.
p4388
aVAnd the rightists attempt to distract from the actual point by pointing out someone incorrectly using of the word *'racism'* instead of *'bigotry'* is even more pathetic and serves only to make a further mockery of yourselves.\u000a\u000a
p4389
aVIt's hardly "distracting" from the point, it's clearing up what the point is.
p4390
aVAnd what it most definitely isn't.\u000a
p4391
aVIn the same way that if two policemen hunting for a missing child find a mysterious pool of blood, and one asks the other, "Is that pool of blood from the missing child?
p4392
aV" and the other replies "no, thank God.
p4393
aVIt's from some other child.
p4394
aVShall we call it a day?
p4395
aV"\u000a\u000a
p4396
aVThe difference is that by calling things racist that clearly aren't racist, you're watering down the term and making it meaningless, thus damaging the integrity of the word.
p4397
aVAll this means that the next time something genuinely racist is called it, nobody will believe it or care about it.
p4398
aVHardly the same as your analogy.
p4399
aVAre you saying that crimes committed against people because of the colour of their skin are worse than those committed against people of a particular religious, social or cultural group?
p4400
aVNo, I'm saying they're notably different.
p4401
aVHilarious.
p4402
aVDM literally creating stories.

p4404
aVIf there were any regulars posting things like that, the daily mail wouldn't need to make an account to invent it.
p4405
aVObviously they couldn't find any existing posts to screenshot 
p4406
aVThing is, it probably wouldn't be hard for the Daily Mail or anyone to find some questionable comments on there.
p4407
aVIt is a fairly right-wing forum.
p4408
aVSource: I'm banned from there.
p4409
aVWas there several years ago.
p4410
aVI don't know whether or not it has changed but there really are (were?

p4418
aVWhat I don't understand is how these people really believe these ideas.

aVI think you need to take another look mate.
p4420
aVAt the post, not the west.
p4421
aVThere you go OP's Image fixed http://imgur.com/lmqWohi
p4422
aVThat's just depressing.
p4423
aVHow can we call this a democracy when these are our options?
p4424
aVI know there's other parties like greens and pirates but they get a fraction of the campaign funding these guys do, and campaign funding = votes unfortunately.
p4425
aVStand for election.
p4426
aVYou'll soon find out it's a lot harder having to come up with answers than sitting on the sidelines and calling someone out for not having an answer.
p4427
aVThe European elections re held under PR so smaller parties have a much better chance than in Westminster elections.
p4428
aVPeople who don't like what the big parties have on offer should vote for the small party that's closest to their own views.
p4429
aVLeftUnity!
p4430
aVIndependence.

p4435
aVYep a crucifiction gets its followers!
p4436
aVIt's really true - the choice of leaders pushes you towards apathy.
p4437
aVI suppose you have to look at the policies and not the leaders, yet the inspiration still needs to be there and is sorely lacking.
p4438
aVIn terms of lying motherfuckers, sadly I'd trust Farage the most to tell the truth (not that this is saying much), and he's an extremely charismatic leader, just of the wrong party for me.
p4439
aV+1 Fantastic
p4440
aVPoliticians.
p4441
aVBleedin' obvious.....
p4442
aV2edgy4me
p4443
aVUKIP are in such a clever position.
p4444
aVAlmost any opposition to them and they can spin in as the 'establishment' running scared.
p4445
aVIt works well now but it's clearly unsustainable, I think they actually need to distance themselves from the Europe issue soon and make something else their focal point, otherwise what will they do after 2015 if we get a referendum?
p4446
aVJust slowly die out like every other reactionary, one issue, party. 
p4447
aVThe problem is that the other parties have been criminally negligent in their framing of the current MEP election debate.
p4448
aVUKIP have tried to make it about whether we or not we are in Europe and stupidly every other party has fallen in to their frame by trying to defend Europe.
p4449
aVNow it's UKIP (with a unique selling point) vs every other party.
p4450
aVOne party on one side of the argument vs many parties splitting their votes on the other.
p4451
aVThe argument should never have been about whether we are in Europe!
p4452
aVIt's about what our MEP's do in Europe for the next 3-5 years!
p4453
aVCommon energy policy, reform, financial development etc.
p4454
aVThat's what the other parties should have talked about, UKIP should have been laughed out the door and not even engaged with over these elections.
p4455
aVHasn't Farage already said he is quitting one way or another after 2017 (referendum win, loss or none at all)?
p4456
aVThat is pretty much the end of the party.
p4457
aVDemographics are against a long term UKIP.
p4458
aVThis is their day in the sun and either their victory or their eternal defeat.
p4459
aVThey won't get another chance at a vote for another decade at which point there'll be no real chance of a win.
p4460
aVI think Nigel Farage has even admitted that the most popular attraction to UKIP is not its political stance on Europe, but rather its policies towards immigration.
p4461
aVThat's what draws in the punters.
p4462
aVAll I desire is a referendum on the EU.
p4463
aVI abhor political parties and I won't be voting for UKIP, simply because many points on their manifesto are so disagreeable to me and a large proportion of the British public.
p4464
aV&gt; simply because many points on their manifesto are so disagreeable to me and a large proportion of the British public\u000a\u000aLike what?
p4465
aVOne of the main sticking points for me, concerning their policies, is that UKIP have an unabashed agenda to heavily invest support and money into fracking and nuclear power projects.
p4466
aVIn comparison to other political groups, they are diametrically opposed bringing future benefits to this country in terms of renewable energy.
p4467
aVSecondly, their suggestion for a flat tax rate, wealthy or poor, might be fair, but I don't think it's popular or applicable.
p4468
aVUKIP make claims, like the Tories, that Britain is still a Christian nation, and they allude and insinuate that legislation should not always be secular in its implementation.
p4469
aVThe homosexual marriage debate recently brought this matter to focus.
p4470
aVThere are many other points, and whilst I'm not sure whether UKIP has a formal, defined manifesto yet, this is what Nigel Farage and other UKIP members state to be largely representative of the party line.
p4471
aVI agree, I'm 100% pro-Europe, practically a European Federalist but we need a referendum and let Britain decide.
p4472
aVInterestingly, whilst I'm no UKIP supporter, I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum and will certainly vote in favour of secession.
p4473
aVCentralisation and the gradual destruction of national sovereignty is a factor that I cannot lend my hand to aid.
p4474
aVI agree with you that Britain should be given the chance to decide.
p4475
aVI was not born when such decisions were made, yet it was a measure that is still affecting our lives in numerous ways.
p4476
aVIt's been around 40 years since the last popular decision on the matter.
p4477
aVEven those who voted then were deceitfully entangled in a political union when they only wanted a limited, economic one.
p4478
aVDon't get me wrong the current EU is not what I want the European Union to be but hopefully this may change for the better.
p4479
aVI wasn't born to, we're allowed to vote for our politicians so why can't we vote to leave a Union we had no say in.
p4480
aVIf we ever get a referendum on the issue I'll vote yes, and in the event we as a country decide to leave I'll accept that 
p4481
aVSounds similar to what Fox News do.
p4482
aVAnti establishment my arse... rich folks on tv all the time, how is that anti establishment?
p4483
aVThey are all over our screens... pretending they stand for the common man but want to raise our taxes and lower the rich's... pro-fracking and anti global warming racist homophobic cunts.
p4484
aVThey are the establishment, followed by blind voters who know nothing of their other policies.
p4485
aVHow can the working class vote for UKIP is beyond me.
p4486
aVFuck UKIP to hell.
p4487
aVWhere?
p4488
aVI was on the way to Islington Mill.
p4489
aVIt might even be considered Salford.
p4490
aVI don't know the area to well
p4491
aVI wonder who's looked at this NOT thought 'why is he singled out?
p4492
aV' I'm no fan, but I don't rate the other three much better, tho they could all use a gag at times.
p4493
aVYou get this sort of abuse towards Farage because some people just do not want to take the time to evaluate the political situation.
p4494
aVIt's fun to call someone racist or whatever because it means you get to write funny messages or send shit in a box to someone free of charge.
p4495
aVIf someone disagrees with UKIP's policies, there is nothing wrong with that at all and it is understandable, but slander and abuse is just ridiculous.
p4496
aVYou get this sort of abuse towards Nigel Farage - and more importantly, UKIP - because the vast majority of this country will stand up to fascism.
p4497
aVIt isn't just a case of calling the racism card for fun, because there have been too many cases from the UKIP party those standing for election have broadcast views with clearly racist, or homophobic, overtones.
p4498
aVSerious question: how long do we continue to ignore \u000a\u000aAnd "evaluate the political decision"?
p4499
aVI think you'll find that anyone who has bothered to "evaluate the political decision" can quite clearly see that Europe really is not the issue. 
p4500
aVIf the country is willing to "stand up to fascism"  then shouldn't that give UKIP a better chance?
p4501
aVSeriously ridiculous how so many people on a politics based Reddit have such a poor knowledge or delusion with politics itself.
p4502
aVTo me, I'd suggest it's a combination of him being 'the new boy', him rising too fast, 'tall dandelion syndrome' I think it's called, that if anyone is too successful too quickly, people want to knock them down, and just the fact that people high up in politics get called called names daily, it's part of the job.
p4503
aVThat and 'Europe and immigrants are bad' seems to be his entire platform.
p4504
aVThey're all lying motherfuckers
p4505
aVSurprised Clegg didn't get one of his own. 
p4506
aVIntolerance. 
p4507
aVYou saw it in Salford, actually.
p4508
aVEdit: Possibly.
p4509
aVI'm sure they've done a good job plastering this over most of the bill boards in Manchester.
p4510
aVEdit II: were you at Sounds from the Other City, perchance?
p4511
aVThese kinds of childish stunts, like sending poo in the post, don't really do the liberal leftists any favours though... just makes people want to distance themselves from them
p4512
aVThe poo in the post was stupid, and I kind of hope they find who sent it and arrest them.
p4513
aVBut this?
p4514
aVGraffiti on a campaign poster.
p4515
aVThis is par for the course.
p4516
aVDo you remember the David Cameron shiny forehead poster?
p4517
aVWhy should UKIP be special and **not** get treated like this?
p4518
aVIf you can't stand the heat etc etc
p4519
aVDo you reckon they leaned over the envelope or put the poo in with their hands?
p4520
aVWas it a human poo?
p4521
aVI would have asked a friend with a cat.
p4522
aVWho says it was a leftist?
p4523
aVUKIP are probably taking more share of the Tory vote than anyone else's
p4524
aVIt's not very Conservative to send shit in the post. 
p4525
aVSays who?
p4526
aVI didn't realise your political views decide whether or not you like to send shit in the post.
p4527
aVI mean, it's not conservative.
p4528
aVa throwaway little pun.
p4529
aVBut seriously, who's more likely to send shit in the post to a right wing political party, the right or the left? 
p4530
aVHonestly, petty minded cruelty/petty evil is pretty common at both sides of the spectrum.
p4531
aVYeah, but if it was the British communist party which was sent shit in the post, no one on this sub would be saying it was a labour supporter who sent it. 
p4532
aVSure, but that's primarily because the split between the socialists and Labour is done and gone.
p4533
aVThere is no controversy, socialists/communists simply are not represented in any UK party at this time.
p4534
aV(Trade unionists still are, of course, sorta)\u000a\u000aUKIP are new and are still tightly associated with the BNP and other racist groups and people.
p4535
aVIf they keep up their attempts to distance themselves from the racists (and do a better job of screening them out) that should end eventually.
p4536
aVFor now the zeitgeist is that UKIP are racists trying to wear a veneer of respectability.
p4537
aVPutting shit in the post is less about political leaning and more about mental health.
p4538
aVIf I was to define it as anything, I'd argue it is Anarchism.
p4539
aVDo you regard anarchism as left wing or right? 
p4540
aVFar left.
p4541
aVAre you claiming anarchists are all mentally ill?
p4542
aVPeople with mental health issues come in all political colours, but, although there might be more amongst our ranks than in the general population (I've no idea, I've met a number of people with problems, but the vast majority exhibit nothing out of the ordinary range), that probably says much more about ableism and the impact of poverty and work stress on mental health than it does about my particular political philosophy.
p4543
aVTheoretically, not on the spectrum.
p4544
aVIn practice, they are the far left. 
p4545
aVI think with the resurgence of free market rhetoric in modern anarchism (such as Anarcho-Capitalism) things are changing, although I get the point you're trying to make.
p4546
aVCertainly things like black bloc are far left.
p4547
aV'Anarcho'-capitalism isn't anarchist, and I've never met one in real life in decades of activism.
p4548
aVWell, obviously not.
p4549
aVThey don't have any friends.
p4550
aVNow that's just mean!
p4551
aVliberal leftist is a bit of an oxymoron really
p4552
aVi'm being downvoted for this but i think it's worth pointing out the difference, because it's quite crucial: the people that inhabit the centre ground and parade as 'left' are anything but, of course those actually on the left uphold identity rights but actually also understand big picture thinking, are in support of nationalisations, public works programmes, basic income, a living wage, and broader public ownership not just in sectors like transport but wider economics, culture, etc.
p4553
aVthe idea that it is your fellow worker but with a different shade of skin that's at fault is contemptible and rejected.
p4554
aVfarage and ukip are demagogues who try to cloak themselves in some anachronistic image of being for the common man but are actually very much on the other side of the line, and fighting against the majority interest.
p4555
aVthey like to portray "the left" - as in some of the commentariat writing in the papers in a milquetoast manner, or this or that dr weakling of the labour party - as the same as economically and politically left principles but they really are not the same at all
p4556
aVYeah, I don't sense that Farage has any real urge to help 'the working man' as such, they seem to be very much a one policy party, and I'd be concerned to be voting that in.
p4557
aVThey could have a policy that states anyone over 60 will be recycled and broken down for parts for the NHS, and no-one would know because it seems no-one's looking for a manifesto, they just like the 'get out of Europe and chuck out the immigrants' rhetoric.
p4558
aVExactly, the more detailed they are on wider policy the more they can only lose votes.
p4559
aVEg.
p4560
aVsame-sex marriage, lots of current UKIP supporters who probably don't care but also lots who hate the idea.
p4561
aVOf course, all of that applies to every political party, which is why we're getting very few actual policies out of the Libs/Labour at moment.
p4562
aVI support your distinction between liberals and leftists - they tend to get conflated in the US as the US has had much less of a left since McCarthyism and after, so the right needed a new group to disparage.
p4563
aVHowever, to say leftists 'are in support of nationalisations', for example, is to ignore a whole tradition on the left, albeit the historically-smeared one since Baukunin had his spat with Marx and formed his own International, leaving the rest to screw up in the Soviet Union just as predicted... ;-)
p4564
aVwho's the guy on the end?
p4565
aV[deleted]
p4566
aVHow is there no topic?
p4567
aVSomeone has gone through the trouble to print the sticker and place the graffiti.
p4568
aVThe person doing it is obviously voicing their opinion.
p4569
aVMany people feel the same.
p4570
aVCrap comments will appear in any post.
p4571
aVWould you value the post more if it was a propaganda photo?
p4572
aVOr a link to an article in the guardian?  \u000a\u000a
p4573
aVIt seems very organised, so definitely politics....
p4574
aVIt has very little to do with real UK politics though and image posts are generally discouraged in this sub.
p4575
aVIf I were you I'd post it to /r/unitedkingdom - anyone who posts anything even vaguely anti-UKIP over there is getting gifted with Reddit Gold at the moment.
p4576
aV"real politics" - appears to just be what you agree with kipper. 
p4577
aVNot really, twat.\u000a\u000a
p4578
aVYour only backup to the idea it wasn't real politics is that some people don't like UKIP and a little moan about how UKIP only control one subreddit.
p4579
aVYou sure convinced me with your hot opinions. 
p4580
aVExcept I've said neither of those things, you cock.
p4581
aVYou've either confused me for someone else or you've constructed an elaborate straw man. 
p4582
aVRead your own comment hotshot.
p4583
aV&gt;not real politics\u000a\u000a&gt;post it in /r/uk\u000a\u000a&gt;they're anti ukip waaahhh
p4584
aVA picture of a defaced poster is not in any way real politics.
p4585
aVAnd picture posts are also discouraged here.
p4586
aVBitch all you like, I am correct on both points.
p4587
aVAnd he took my advice, by the way, since it has been widely observed that someone is rewarding anti-UKIP posts with gold.
p4588
aVMaybe if you weren't so busy trying to suck your own cock, you'd have noticed too.
p4589
aVIf it was worthless it wouldn't have got upvoted.
p4590
aVThe beauty of reddit :)
p4591
aVYou must be joking
p4592
aVJust because it is worthless to you doesn't make it worthless to other people. 
p4593
aVAgreed, no one wants stupid meme shit or 'oh look how political this dumb graffiti is im so progressive in society'
p4594
aVYou know it's not illegal to freepost UKIP a brick or three. 
p4595
aVThey (Royal Mail specifically) cancelled their free post and even before sending bricks didn't cost them money, freepost doesn't apply to anything bigger than an envelope so they were just undelivered.
p4596
aVCongratulations on trying though, really mature.
p4597
aVThanks for letting me know before I headed down to my local Post Office with a wheelbarrow full of bricks.
p4598
aVMy, there would have been egg on my face then, wouldn't there?
p4599
aVI couldn't possibly have been making a throwaway comment based on the online 'what did you send to UKIP?
p4600
aV' trending I've been seeing on social media.
p4601
aVI'm glad you didn't just think that and leave me to waste my time.
p4602
aVGood save!
p4603
aVThat's not only vandalism, but also potentially exposing small children to inappropriate language.
p4604
aVJust because he doesn't agree with UKIP doesn't mean he's allowed to act in such a despicable manner.
p4605
aVNow I'm going to get downvoted by the anti-UKIP brigade.
p4606
aVI'm not even showing support for UKIP.
p4607
aVIf this was done to any party's poster I would take offence.
p4608
aVEDIT: For fuck's sake, downvote means *irrelevant to the topic*, not *I disagree*.
p4609
aVDo you remember when you were 7?
p4610
aVI do.
p4611
aVWe were the most foulmouthed motherfuckers on the planet when adults weren't around. 
p4612
aV[deleted]
p4613
aVYou lived a very sheltered life.
p4614
aVI don't live a sheltered life at all.
p4615
aVHowever, I feel it isn't appropriate to use profanity in public, as to some, it is offensive, and I respect their opinions.
p4616
aVKids don't know what to look out for.
p4617
aVIn the event that they can work out how to pronounce this they aren't going to notice/remember it any more than they are the name "Clear Channel".
p4618
aVThey don't know it's rude until you tell them.
p4619
aVI discovered earlier the village where I work has a UKIP billboard up.
p4620
aVIt's the one about border controls with a picture of an escalator.
p4621
aVAny thoughts on how I can deface it?
p4622
aVIf in doubt, Hitler moustache on Farage.
p4623
aVOr modifying the UKIP logo to look like Hitler (fringe, moustache, black spraypaint).
p4624
aVIt's probably the easiest way of doing it.
p4625
aV...Or, y'know- you could go and campaign for a party other than those tits.
p4626
aVThey're all *begging* for people to go and volunteer at the moment- go ahead and try it!
p4627
aVIt's a nice experience, if nothing else.
p4628
aVPaint your name in bright letters across Farage.
p4629
aVThat'll teach those working class UKIP swine for wanting to control immigration or return democracy to us.
p4630
aVFascist scum!
p4631
aVSlow down a second.
p4632
aVAlthough I feel like we're on the same boat politically, this kind of response only really hinders the lefty cause.
p4633
aVDefacing political billboards, no matter how wretched they are, is a step back from democracy, and your comment generalising the supporters as "working class swines" is pretty extraneous, and really shouldn't be the view to adopt as a libertarian.
p4634
aVBranding them as "fascist scum" , isn't a good way to go about it either, as although many of the policies on the UKIP agenda are unquestionably radical and backwards, throwing the "f" bomb around  only incites unrest among the bastards.
p4635
aVThe kippers love to play the "I'm a lefty, and therefore I am morally superior" jape, and your frankly irrational response only contributes to that stereotype.
p4636
aVLets fight off the kippers together as liberals, and not become them along the way.
p4637
aV&gt; or return democracy to us.
p4638
aV*eye roll*
p4639
aVAs a word of notice, after looking through this prick's recent comments you can see that he himself is in fact a kipper.
p4640
aVI pointed out that he was hindering the lefty cause, but I think I failed to realise that he's doing it on purpose.
p4641
aVThis is guy is the worst manipulative scumbag I've ever fucking seen.
p4642
aVShame on you, you complete and utter cunt.
p4643
aVSome of you commenters really enjoy being swayed by baseless vandalism like this.
p4644
aVBeing against UKIP seems to be the trendy, progressive thing right now.
p4645
aVNo one my age seems to know or care what they stand for, It's sickening.
p4646
aVOf course being against UKIP is the progressive thing because UKIP are an antiquated, out of date party who belong in the isolationist and imperialist pre-war era.
p4647
aVNationalism is never a good thing.
p4648
aVEver. 
p4649
aVWanting to trade with the whole world is not isolationist.
p4650
aVThe EU is the imperial power expanding into places like Ukraine here, not UKIP.
p4651
aVSome old concepts, such as sovereignty and self determination are good and worthwhile.
p4652
aV&gt; No one my age seems to know or care what they stand for, It's sickening.
p4653
aVI'm 22, poor, unemployed.
p4654
aVI'd rather vote Conservative than UKIP, and I loath the Tories.
p4655
aVI'm gay as well - no fucking chance UKIP are getting my vote.
p4656
aVThey are even more homophobic than the Tories which is quite the achievement.
p4657
aVUKIP are simply a primitive and predictable reaction to economic and social unrest.
p4658
aVThat's all they stand for.
p4659
aVThey're nothing new, they're a tale as old as time.
p4660
aVEvery time the economy collapses no matter when or where, some right wing nationalist party swoops in saying they're going to save the day by appealing to emotional issues, established prejudices and easy scape goats that people can latch onto without providing any actual policies or economic plans, just trumpet some empty patriotic rhetoric about "returning the country to its former glory" and all sorts of devious crap.
p4661
aV"Can't find work?
p4662
aVBlame the immigrants!
p4663
aV"\u000a\u000a"Business on the verge of banktrupcy?
p4664
aVBlame the EU!
p4665
aV" \u000a\u000a"Getting old and disillusioned?
p4666
aVBlame the Muslims!
p4667
aV" \u000a\u000aEasy scape goats you can point your finger at to blame for your crappy life, despite being a total distraction.
p4668
aVIt's just the UK's version of Golden Dawn, a party full of right wing psychopaths tricking the people into thinking they're "of the people, for the people" when in fact all they care about is satisfying their meglomaniacal desires and cleansing their society of [insert hated group here].
p4669
aVDon't be fooled - they don't give a single shit about you.
p4670
aVYou only need to look at the glassy eyed Farage and his insidious smile to see that this man is a snake who you simply cannot trust, he is your classic "charming psychopath"; a grinning cheshire cat that says what you want to hear until he's earned your trust and then cuts your throat from behind.
p4671
aVDo you honestly think UKIP will do *any* good?
p4672
aVYou really think putting a cap on immigration will make ANY difference to your life at all?
p4673
aVYou honestly think leaving the EU will make ANY difference to your life at all?
p4674
aVNo.
p4675
aVNothing will change except we'll have no more human rights inspectors and that insideous snake Farage will be left in charge to wreak 4 years of absolute incompetent havoc which is the LAST thing the country needs during a recession.
p4676
aVHe'll be our very own Tony Abbot.
p4677
aVSeriously if you want the country to go *completely* down the shitter - vote UKIP.
p4678
aVIn fact I kind of hope UKIP get in power, because I know for a fact after 6 months have passed and none of their promises have been delivered and people realize that immigrants and the EU actually have fuck all to do with their problems they will very quickly sober up and realize what a horrific mistake they made in their hysterical episode of temporary psychosis.
p4679
aVUKIP will bring nothing but disaster, incompetence, embarassment and further social unrest.
p4680
aVFarage will sell this country down the river in every way possible and once he's lined his pockets he'll piss off and you will never hear from him again. \u000a
p4681
aVYou seem to enjoy talking a lot, but in actual fact you are saying nothing.
p4682
aVThe sad thing is that you've probably acquired a lot of upvotes just for using dramatic buzzwords and throwing in a load of rhetorical yet loaded questions.
p4683
aVYou're just presenting ideas which you obviously care about, but ultimately letting them fall short:\u000a\u000a&gt;"Getting old and disillusioned?
p4684
aVBlame the Muslims!
p4685
aV"\u000a\u000aPlease direct me as to where in the UKIP manifesto Muslims, and specifically Muslims, are singled out - Oh no wait, you can't.
p4686
aVFind the UKIP manifesto, ctrl+f 'racism'.
p4687
aVYou won't find it.
p4688
aVIn fact I don't believe there is anything alluding to it (only say that because I think the manifesto is getting an overhaul BECAUSE of the 'devilish snakes' or whatever you were spouting).
p4689
aVPlease refer to the fact that UKIP and BNP are different parties.
p4690
aV&gt;bring nothing but disaster, incompetence, embarassment\u000a\u000a&gt;Farage will sell this country down the river\u000a\u000a&gt;and all sorts of devious crap\u000a\u000a&gt;[Using obviously fake quotes]\u000a\u000a&gt;Fascism\u000a\u000aAll lovely melodrama, but no substance.
p4691
aVIf you really wanted to make a real point you could've said, for example: "Throughout modern history, from The National Front to BNP and their continued failure, racism has never been popular in this country and will always be frowned upon.
p4692
aVTherefore UKIP's focus on immigration upsets a lot of people and their tightening on the border leads me to believe that they are against foreign people".
p4693
aVThis is a fair statement when observing a party, however can you deny that mass immigration has been a highly talked about issue?
p4694
aVIn a democratic country, can you deny the voice of a lot of people who at least want some kind of closure on the subject?
p4695
aVNo matter what someone is saying they deserve fair debate and understanding to what they want to say.
p4696
aVWhether you agree or disagree, using buzzwords, vandalism, blood and feces fundamentally goes against what this country stands for.
p4697
aVFreedom of speech goes both ways.
p4698
aVPeople are worried about the country, they have a *right* to vote for who they want.
p4699
aVYou can calmly and maturely present facts as to how they may be wrong, or you can draw up a caricature about how Farage is the devil and how he is obviously burning immigrants at the stake.
p4700
aVThat is your choice, but I think we all know which is fair.
p4701
aVBy the way, I respect your political views completely.
p4702
aVHowever I don't like ignorance.
p4703
aV"I do not agree" is all that needs to be said sometimes.
p4704
aVLooks like a spur of the moment bit of graffiti.
p4705
aV/s
p4706
aVA speech bubble with a choice quote would've been better.
p4707
aVAs it stands, it's more than a little trite.
p4708
aVIs that Farage on the right?
p4709
aV[Higher resolution image](http://blog.solopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ukip-election-poster-your-daily-grind.jpg) (It isn't Farage)\u000a\u000a\u000aMay I ask someone who is more knowledgeable on the subject, isn't Farage a MEP too?
p4710
aVI'm not implying that he shouldn't be one if he wants to leave the EU, as it can help him achieve his goal I suppose, but doesn't he also get a portion of that 55 million a day'?
p4711
aVYes, he's been an MEP since 1999.
p4712
aVHis expenses are the subject of an ongoing scandal.
p4713
aVHis response is basically that he doesn't give a shit, and he'll milk the EU for all it's worth and remain as unaccountable as legally possible.
p4714
aVSo... by the standards of his own campaign ad, he is a 'eurocrat'.
p4715
aVYes, and he has no qualms that he wants himself fired, he just wants the rest of the MEPs to be fired along with him.
p4716
aVFarage behaves exactly as every other MEP behaves, except he and a few others (not all UKIP) are honest about it and call the others out on it.
p4717
aVThat sounds very hypocritical; Farage behaves like those he is against, but he's just honest about it.
p4718
aVThis doesn't really make him a better person does it?
p4719
aVIt's not hypocritical.
p4720
aVHe actively says that his actions are bad, but he's allowed to do them because the rules are bad - rules which he spends every waking hour trying to abolish.
p4721
aVFarage is a man who wants his own job cut, but in the mean time he's willing to milk it for all he can whilst showing everyone what he - and by extension everyone else - is able to do within such a corrupt organisation.
p4722
aVThat's not a very moral way of doing it.
p4723
aVThat would be the same as an MP avoiding taxes using offshore bank accounts, to raise awareness of how bad the law is and that the loop holes exist.
p4724
aVHe would be allowed to do it, it's legal, it just isn't right of him to do so, especially in his position.
p4725
aVTbf, he tried raising awareness of it from outside the system and nobody listened.
p4726
aVNow he's doing it from within the system and all you can say is "well how immoral of him".
p4727
aVThe fact you now care it's happening at all is probably a success as far as he's concerned.
p4728
aVIf you don't like the way the EU parliament works, start voting UKIP cos they're the only ones campaigning to do anything about it.
p4729
aV&gt;and all you can say is "well how immoral of him"\u000a\u000aWell, speaking solely on my behalf, I am young and haven't been following politics for very long yet.
p4730
aVFarage has been leader of UKIP since 2006, that's 8 years.
p4731
aVMost people under 25 would not have really followed politics 8 years ago, so it's unfair to say that I only care about what he is doing now.
p4732
aVHowever it is true that he is raising awareness, obviously.
p4733
aVYet I still don't think it is the right way to go about it.
p4734
aVIt may be an easier way to get heard, but not necessarily the better way. \u000a
p4735
aVWell, at the end of the day there's nothing anyone can really do to stop him lol.
p4736
aVIf he's within the rules, he's within the rules.
p4737
aVAny attempt to change the rules would be a huge breakthrough for him, so really he can't lose.
p4738
aVSo you're fine with corporations like Starbucks avoiding tax, because they're technically within the rules?
p4739
aVThis would only make sense as an argument against Farage if Starbucks where trying to raise awareness of tax avoidence in large corporations and would like to change laws to have it stopped.
p4740
aVGood point.
p4741
aVYet I still find it hard to believe that Farage is doing the right thing by exploiting a system which he is meant to be working for.
p4742
aVWhat's hypocritical?
p4743
aVAre you asking for the definition of the word...?
p4744
aVIf not then I don't understand your question.
p4745
aVHe is criticizing other MEPs for the same thing he does, as far as I am aware.
p4746
aVThat's hypocritical.
p4747
aVIt would be hypocritical if he said "it's fine when I do it, just not anybody else".
p4748
aVIn reality he's saying "look how much I'm able to screw this corrupt system and stay within the rules, isn't it awful?".
p4749
aVHe spends most of the money he gets from it on campaigning to make it so you can't do it anymore. 
p4750
aVI find it hard to believe that he enjoys the luxuries of 66 thousand euros or however much it is per year that MEPs receive whilst thinking to himself, 'gosh, isn't it awful how I can receive all this money?
p4751
aVI sure am showing Westminster how bad the EU is'.
p4752
aVI'm sure he rationalises it by thinking that if it wasn't him, it would be somebody else.
p4753
aVPaying his German wife to work for him and then complaining that Europeans are stealing British jobs.
p4754
aVHe never really claims to be a good person
p4755
aVThis doesn't mean he suddenly has a free pass to do bad things.
p4756
aVYou shouldn't have to claim to be a good person, you should just do good things, it is expected.
p4757
aVEspecially if you intend to lead a country.
p4758
aVI think in terms of being prime minister I would prefer somebody who was right, instead of somebody who was good.
p4759
aVAdmitting to doing the same thing as others who don't admit it doesn't mean he is doing anything right though. \u000a\u000a
p4760
aVDownvotes for speaking the truth.
p4761
aVI suspect Nigel can not wait for the elections.
p4762
aVThe parliament is going to be full with anti EU MEP's from a host of nations soon.
p4763
aVThere is no scandal.
p4764
aVHe does not get paid anymore than anyone else or receive an allowance greater than anyone else.
p4765
aVIt is comical that people criticize him for taking the EU's money.
p4766
aVThe EU's money?
p4767
aVThe money comes from the UK government and from their people. 
p4768
aVYeah, I got downvoted so hard in this thread that I'm stuck on a 10 minute cooldown between comments now...\u000a\u000a*sigh*
p4769
aVPeople don't seem to understand.
p4770
aVUKIP are currently polling at 30 percent.
p4771
aVThat means at least 30 percent of people don't want to be in the EU.
p4772
aVBut the UK does not get a 30 percent discount towards their EU bill.
p4773
aVThey still have to pay the same amount.
p4774
aVWhere is the representation of that 30 percent?
p4775
aVThey have to pay to be a member of a club they don't want to be a part of.
p4776
aVQuite rightly Nigel and UKIP spend the money that also comes from this 30 percent on giving them representation. 
p4777
aVTerrible argument.
p4778
aVThere are groups of people who don't want welfare, taxes, a military, nationalised services, etc.
p4779
aVand they don't have a choice either.
p4780
aVIt's not possible for everyone to have exactly what they want unless we split the UK in 70 million different countries.
p4781
aVNo it isn't.
p4782
aVWelfare, taxes, military and nationalized services are necessary.
p4783
aVThe EU is not.
p4784
aVYou are confusing yourself.
p4785
aVThe portion of money used by anti EU MEP's is tiny.
p4786
aVTiny in comparison to total spend and the percentage of people they represent. 
p4787
aVThat doesn't make any sense.
p4788
aVI could just as easily say that the EU is necessary, or that welfare or taxes or the military or anything else are not necessary. 
p4789
aV&gt; Welfare, taxes, military and nationalized services are necessary.
p4790
aVThe EU is not.
p4791
aVThat's ... an opinion.
p4792
aVYou can state it as if it were fact, of course, but it isn't.
p4793
aVWhether the EU is necessary is in the eye of the beholder - much like whether nationalized services are necessary is in the eye of the beholder (ask any libertarian).\u000a\u000a
p4794
aVIn the current economic, societal and global climate they are necessary for the UK.
p4795
aVThe EU is not.
p4796
aVIt isn't a matter of opinion. 
p4797
aVHis response is that the money he's being given is an allowance - it's essentially his pay for being an MEP, and that he's entitled to do as he wishes with it, which he's already stated is funding of political activity.
p4798
aVI'm sure there's plenty of other MEP's that use their allowance for giant TV's and all that crap.
p4799
aVIt's ridiculous that this is even a 'scandal'.  
p4800
aVWhich seems acceptable enough to me The part that doesn't really make sense is how he criticizes the other MEPs for the same thing.
p4801
aVMate I think you've stumbled onto the wrong board, only UKIP bashing is allowed here.
p4802
aVTIL entire threads of 'can't barrage the Farage' is 'UKIP bashing'.
p4803
aVThat was a /pol/ raid.
p4804
aVA few of them have stuck around, but overall anything positive to say about UKIP is met with negativity on this board.
p4805
aVAlso look at all the top threads right now, all of them are negative spin/opinion articles from the Guardian...
p4806
aVI would say UKIP supporters are a loud minority on here.
p4807
aV&gt;anything positive to say about UKIP is met with negativity on this board\u000a\u000aThat is because people have differing opinions!
p4808
aVI can't stress this enough.
p4809
aVYou cannot moan about someone having a different opinion than you.
p4810
aVThere is also negativity against labour and conservative supporters.
p4811
aVThis board is made up of a LOT of people, isn't it obvious that they have opposing views from eachother?
p4812
aVI wouldn't even call UKIP a minority on this board.
p4813
aVEvery thread has vocal posters, who all support different parties.
p4814
aVThere is nothing wrong with someone supporting UKIP or Labour, or whoever else they want to.
p4815
aVThere is also nothing wrong with people debating a point and disagreeing.
p4816
aVStop acting like your an oppressed minority, you're not.
p4817
aV&gt; I would say UKIP supporters are a loud minority on here.
p4818
aVThen again, they're a loud minority in the country overall as well.\u000a\u000a
p4819
aVStop acting like a victim.
p4820
aVAlmost every thread on this sub has UKIP supporters bashing others, and others bashing UKIP.
p4821
aVSome people on this subreddit hate UKIP - this doesn't suddenly make it a circlejerk.
p4822
aVSome hate Labour, some hate Conservatives.
p4823
aVThe same thing happens everywhere in the real world.
p4824
aVHis post is upvoted to the top which kinda disproves your point...
p4825
aVHow does this disprove any part of my point about you, specifically you as an individual, not a ukip supporter, moaning about something that isn't true.
p4826
aVThe fact that someone has a different view from someone, even if that view is more popular than the others, does not mean they are bashing eachother.
p4827
aVIt is how any argument or debate works.
p4828
aVWell I guess he's counting downvotes among the bashing.
p4829
aVAnd I kind of agree: if all opinions of one side are downvoted into invisibility, that's a form of bashing.
p4830
aVPoint is, it's not always that way.
p4831
aVPlenty of UKIP supporters here, who upvote each other, and in many other discussions their comments remain well visible.
p4832
aVIt's just that this argument about Farage comfortably cashing in on the same expenses his party is decrying on campaign posters and claiming that he's doing so just to show how the EU lets you get away with really bad stuff, is particularly laughable, and that's why they're getting downvoted much more here than normally.
p4833
aVIdiot racists have feelings too you know.
p4834
aVBoo hoo!
p4835
aVI didn't realise there were still people that thought UKIP were racist.
p4836
aVOh well.
p4837
aVHow's 2010?
p4838
aVYeah.
p4839
aVNow we *know* they're racist.
p4840
aVAll voters for UKIP are racist?
p4841
aVAgainst what race?
p4842
aVgood question, I'd like to see it answered.
p4843
aVwhich race do I hate again?
p4844
aVmight have to call up UKIP to ask.
p4845
aV&gt; His expenses are the subject of an ongoing scandal.
p4846
aVThey really aren't if we are being honest.
p4847
aV&gt; His expenses are the subject of an ongoing scandal.
p4848
aVNot really m8\u000a\u000aThey don't even have a system of 'expenses' with MEPs.
p4849
aVWell, the £60,000 he claimed for his (rent-free!
p4850
aV) office seems to tell a different story.
p4851
aVNo it doesn't!
p4852
aVIt's an allowence, not an expense.
p4853
aVHe gets no more or less than any other MEP.
p4854
aVThe whole system is a fucking disgrace and Farage is one of only a handful of MEP's who are open about how much of a financial piss take the EU is.
p4855
aVYou don't 'claim' money in as an MEP.
p4856
aVYou get an allowance, the same as every other MEP, and you get a daily bonus when you clock in to the parliament.
p4857
aVHe is indeed an MEP and so does indeed receive a portion of the £55m.
p4858
aVWhich was kind of the whole point of the joke...*whoosh*
p4859
aVMost people only consider the eurocrats to be bureaucrats within the administration of the European Union and not the MEPs themselves.\u000a
p4860
aVThe ones that sign in every day are the ones that maximise their pay.
p4861
aVUKIP MEPs use the money for the campaign to get out of EU.
p4862
aVexactly, and he's saying that it's wrong
p4863
aVBy enjoying the luxuries of 84,000 euros.
p4864
aV"I'm the turkey voting for Christmas"\u000a\u000aAnd enjoying it by spending it campaigning to leave the EU.
p4865
aVWhich his voters want him to do, and it is public money.
p4866
aVIsn't that the point of democracy.
p4867
aVi really don't see the problem 
p4868
aVThe far right?
p4869
aVTitle would be accurate attached to a picture of any ukip advert. 
p4870
aVAha
p4871
aVLooks forunate.
p4872
aV2 for the price of 1. 
p4873
aV...plus added free publicity.
p4874
aVwhat one is the UKIP ad?
p4875
aV*Which one is the UKIP ad?
p4876
aVHowever these tents are fantastic, really sturdy and seem really durable considering there blow up.
p4877
aVHaha this hilarious.
p4878
aVHa ha that's brilliant.
p4879
aVIt's the wrong ad.
p4880
aVIt'd work if it was the one warning about immigration.
p4881
aVAn associative joke, between "Poles" (short for Polish) and UKIP, right?
p4882
aVThe association of what?
p4883
aVThat UKIP are against Polish people?
p4884
aVWhich would be absurd and I would like it pointed out where exactly it's stated.
p4885
aVOh, wait...
p4886
aVIt isn't.
p4887
aVBut y'know, "I get the joke, it's so funny.
p4888
aVUKIP are w-w-wacist.
p4889
aV" And yes, oh look it's on the right, I best make jokes to a political spectrum which states that all UKIP voters are on the right.
p4890
aVWell, har-dee-dar.
p4891
aVI think whoever did laugh at it just asserted their bias and ignorance, that is that UKIP are "racist and right wing".
p4892
aVIsn't one of the primary reasons UKIP are anti EU the massive influx of economic migrants from countries such as Poland?
p4893
aVSo in other words "no need for poles (taking our jobs!)?
p4894
aVIt's hardly an absurd joke when it's associated with one of their main arguments.
p4895
aVPrimary, yes probably the anti-EU sentiment.
p4896
aVMass immigration coupled with limitless borders (with little influence or control by your own government), yes probably.
p4897
aVI said the association that, some people could take from it, that UKIP are against Polish people, is absurd.
p4898
aVNo need for Poles, taking our jobs?
p4899
aVThat does not sound like UKIP.
p4900
aVSo, in others words - no.
p4901
aV&gt; No need for Poles, taking our jobs?
p4902
aVThat does not sound like UKIP.
p4903
aVThat sounds *exactly* like UKIP.
p4904
aVThen prove it if you see the association so clearly.
p4905
aVI'm not arguing against differing opinion.
p4906
aVThe same old rhetoric does not get anywhere.
p4907
aVAt least the other poster, almodozo, was so thoughtful as to quote specifically where they found this association.
p4908
aVI have better things to spend my Sunday on and I'm only on my phone, but [here]( http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26376026) are quite a few statements that could easily be summed up with the above. 
p4909
aVThanks.
p4910
aVAn article primarily discussing mass immigration.
p4911
aVSo, 'Poles taking our jobs'...\u000a\u000a"While UKIP supported migrants coming to the UK to fill specific jobs - where there were skills shortages..."\u000a\u000a"...he said economic problems in the eurozone meant the influx of low-skilled labour to the UK was likely to accelerate and questioned the social and cultural impact it had had..."\u000a\u000a"...He also said UKIP would not work with the Front National, the French far-right party, saying its politics was based on "race and religion" and that it was "unreformable".
p4912
aV"\u000a\u000aThis is not against Polish people, it advocates away from race in relation to immigration policy change (because it has nothing to do with race) and it discusses supporting immigration towards specific industries with skill shortages (this does not discriminate to races or nationalities).
p4913
aV'Poles taking out jobs' does not sound like UKIP in the presented article, in my opinion.
p4914
aVGosh a Ukip supporter acting all offended by that harmless joke!
p4915
aVIt's political correctness gone mad!
p4916
aVI'm not offended by the joke, I'm offended by the associations.
p4917
aVI didn't say you didn't have a right to the joke, nothing PC about it.
p4918
aVOh, people can have opposing opinions to jokes?
p4919
aVYes.
p4920
aVOffended or harmless?
p4921
aVBoth perceptual, like many political jokes.
p4922
aVI laugh at some of the Farage photos taking the piss out of him, I actually find that funny.
p4923
aVYour writing style intrigues me.
p4924
aVIt forces me to read what you write in a really weird way such that I can barely understand what you are saying.
p4925
aVIt's almost like how a politician speaks.
p4926
aVIt's all the double negatives: "I **didn't** say you **didn't** have a right to the joke, **nothing** PC about it.
p4927
aV"
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuStsFW4EmQ
p4928
aVI did not say... [that you] did not have a right to [laugh at, support] the joke.
p4929
aVIn relation to: "acting all offended, political correctness gone mad".
p4930
aV[There is nothing] PC (Politically Correct) about [my statement].
p4931
aVThe poster implied that I was pushing political correctness and I stated I was not.
p4932
aVIt might be the way I communicate, I tend to skip "the" a lot too.
p4933
aVIf it's illegible, let me know.
p4934
aVWell, I'm not a politician.
p4935
aVI'm a Paramedic.
p4936
aVLookout everyone we've got a badass over here.
p4937
aVHey don't knock paramedics, paramedics are fantastic.
p4938
aV&gt; offended by the associations\u000a\u000aIf you don't want to be offended by UKIP being associated with racism, best not associate yourself with a racist party.
p4939
aVCircular logic, it requires the perception that UKIP is racist in the first place.
p4940
aVI do not know of any UKIP member or policy that is against Polish people.
p4941
aVMaybe you would like to propose a new party?
p4942
aVOr convince me?
p4943
aVOr, as I guess, you've just came along to nitpick.
p4944
aVEnjoy your upvotes.
p4945
aV&gt;The association of what?
p4946
aVThat UKIP are against Polish people?
p4947
aVWell, not against Polish people per se - I'm sure the UKIP is fine with Polish people as long as they live in Poland.
p4948
aVIt's rather the association between the tent ad's "No Poles Required" and the UKIP's stance [against mass immigration from Poland](https://www.facebook.com/TheUKIP/posts/331833046912623) and its criticism of Polish immigrants, which it [accuses of refusing to integrate](http://www.cambstimes.co.uk/news/ukip_leader_nigel_farage_speaks_out_about_immigration_in_peterborough_1_1995599).
p4949
aVSo not all that far-fetched really.
p4950
aVThanks for answering a couple of my questions.
p4951
aVI see the association there, from that standpoint.
p4952
aVI still disagree, though, on some key points.
p4953
aVUKIP have a general stance against mass immigration, and as expected that applies across the spectrum.
p4954
aVIt is not particular to a set group of people who belong to a certain nationality.
p4955
aVI think the second link associates Governmental problems with immigration the way it is currently designed and implemented.
p4956
aVFor instance, it is arguable that the points made were directed towards: isolation and solitude-like societies, rapid alteration in communities not accustomed to the change (which could bring divides within communities) and discrimination for not speaking Polish, in a British town for a British factory job (which some would say was not acceptable).
p4957
aVI do not fully agree with the last point, if that is the interpretation that the writer or Farage was trying to make.
p4958
aVThat said, it is a workplace, you would think there would be a general lean towards speaking English.
p4959
aVAnyhow, the association that UKIP are against Polish people, on that premise, therefore I still believe is far-fetched (as also, this applies to being racist and right wing).
p4960
aVFor example you could pick out a number of EU countries with limitless immigration to Britain and probably get similar answers, that does not show racism, it shows an argument against mass immigration.
p4961
aV&gt; For example you could pick out a number of EU countries with limitless immigration to Britain and probably get similar answers, that does not show racism, it shows an argument against mass immigration.
p4962
aVSure, it's just that Farage has singled out Polish immigration/immigrants for criticism - for obvious reasons, because Poles are one of the main new group of immigrants, and I assume the single largest one.
p4963
aVSo while the juxtaposition would have been funny if it had said "No Romanians required" too, it wouldn't work with "No Spanish required", even though quite a few Spanish people have gone to try their luck in Britain too in the face of the crisis there.
p4964
aVUnfortunately, tents don't have romanians to hold them up, just p/Poles.
p4965
aVI dare say you might be slightly overthinking the joke... All it really needs to work is that Farage has singled out Polish immigrants/immigration for criticism (regardless of whether that was for logical reasons or not), and that's obviously been true.
p4966
aVFair call.
p4967
aVWhen I worked for the BBC and we were first rolling out iPlayer, Anthony Rose (the was showing us various things about it, when a 500 error occurred.
p4968
aVThere, on the big screen, was a huge picture of the Queen with words to the effect "something has gone horribly wrong.
p4969
aV"\u000a\u000aAnthony was *not happy* and demanded that be removed immediately.
p4970
aVI don't know if it was an internal joke and was never supposed to be seen by the public (I don't think it was), but I thought it was pretty damned funny.
p4971
aVBeats their 'unofficial' election video, that's for sure. 
p4972
aVThey seem to have spelled 'second' incorrectly. 
p4973
aV2witty4me
p4974
aVWhat are they actually saying?
p4975
aVYou'd think they'd say second if they're asking you the voter to help them defeat Cameron.
p4976
aVBut they're not.
p4977
aVThey want a second term with him, or maybe Miliband, that's up to people who don't vote for them.
p4978
aVSo what is it saying then?
p4979
aVIt's a joke about Cameron ruling out a third term.
p4980
aVYou probably don't need to read too much into it.
p4981
aVCameron made the comment a while back that he would not run for a third term.
p4982
aVThis is just a joke in relation to that comment. 
p4983
aVCameron said the other week that he won't run a third time for the PM office. 
p4984
aVWhat an odd thing to pick them up on
p4985
aVHardly.
p4986
aVWell, they shouldn't be assuming he'll get a second term.
p4987
aVIt's their job to make sure he doesn't.
p4988
aVAlso, are they *against* him not wanting a third term?
p4989
aVI don't really get it.
p4990
aVThe message is regarding the fact Cameron recently revealed he would not serve a third term even if Conservatives were voted for office a third time in a row.
p4991
aVHe'd almost certainly leave just before the renewal date.
p4992
aVDoes anyone have a link for this?

aVTheir Labour economic policy one was better.
p5004
aVSome quality banter from the Liberal Democrats.
p5005
aVNow if only their policies were so good!
p5006
aVTheir policies are.
p5007
aVTheir PR, however, is non existent.
p5008
aVI'd say the policies are good, but actually following them is their weakpoint.
p5009
aVThen you need to learn more about politics, especially coalition politics.
p5010
aVI'm not talking about specifically the tuition fees.
p5011
aVTheir leaflets are full of promises that are clearly going to be empty.
p5012
aVI feel like since New Labour the whole idea of having a party with views somewhere between those of the Conservatives and of Labour is unnecessary.
p5013
aVI feel like all the Lib Dems serve to do now is make it harder for either of those parties to get a majority.  
p5014
aVGood.
p5015
aVThe last thing I want is either of them to have a free reign.  
p5016
aVTotally agree with you on the empty promises, that really turned me off them when they started talking about devolving Cornwall and Wales to the same degree as Scotland, and decriminalising most drugs.
p5017
aVIt's making promises about things that nobody really cares about changing.
p5018
aVYou mean things *you* don't care about?
p5019
aVI'm sure there are a lot of people who think *certain* drugs should be decriminalised.
p5020
aVVictimless crimes and all that.
p5021
aVGiven his flair, there doesn't seem to be much he *does* care about.
p5022
aVApathetic about politics, seeing as we're in a political subreddit, I thought it appropriate because I don't believe it really matters who's in power anymore.
p5023
aVI know it's a big reddit thing to believe that decriminilising drugs is the be all, end all, and including myself, I do believe that Cannabis and LSD should be decriminalised, however, ask the majority of the British population and they don't care for it, it's on the very bottom of their to do list about changing the countries laws.
p5024
aVWhere are you getting this from?
p5025
aVBecause these websites report differently.
p5026
aVhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/05/war-on-drugs-failed-decriminalise-illegal-use\u000a\u000ahttps://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3134/Public-attitudes-to-drugs-policy.aspx\u000a\u000ahttps://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/06/16/drugs-policies-dont-work/\u000a\u000aThey say more than half of the British pop are in favour of a drugs review.
p5027
aVThere are more sources but I think this makes my point.
p5028
aVAgain, who really cares that much that they really want government policy to change?
p5029
aVI'm sure people have for a good long time thought that drug policy is daft, there are only two people that I really know who are anti-drugs, I don't think I know of anyone who hasn't smoked Cannabis, but yet you don't see anyone saying it's important enough to change, **that's the point of what I'm saying**, **it's not important enough to change.
p5030
aV**
p5031
aVThe point I'm making is, that's your opinion and doesn't represent the views of everyone in the UK.
p5032
aVI'm not saying it is my opinion, please do give me the reason why you think it isn't decriminalised yet?
p5033
aVI really have no idea, I imagine it has a lot to do with the majority of voters being the elderly and the majority of drug reform supporters are younger who don't vote as much.
p5034
aVThey pander to the voters.
p5035
aVThere you go, that's exactly my point.
p5036
aVNobody cares that much to go out and vote for anyone who deals in drug decriminalisation, ergo, it's not that important.
p5037
aVBut that doesn't mean it's not an important issue with a lot of people.
p5038
aVThere are a lot of reasons young people don't vote and I don't think the reason is because they don't think there are stupid laws that need changing.
p5039
aVI think it's becuase they think even if they do vote, it won't change anything.
p5040
aVBut there are parties who do want decriminalise drugs, and one of them is the junior partner in coalition at the moment, surely if you care that much about drug decriminalisation, surely you would vote for a party that thinks the same, like the Lib Dems or Greens.
p5041
aVIf it's that much of an issue and you don't vote for those parties, then you clearly don't care that much about decriminalising drugs.
p5042
aVWell, seeing as a party who apparently wants to decriminalise drugs is already a part of the current government and drugs have yet to be decriminalised, it kind of proves my point.
p5043
aVVoting doesn't change anything or that's how it seems at least.
p5044
aVBut only the minor member.
p5045
aVAnd it so happens that it would the senior member's worst decision, *their* voters would never stand for it.
p5046
aVThey are not liberal enough.
p5047
aVJust a massive difference in status. 
p5048
aVThen you need to learn more about politics, especially not pissing off one's core demographic immediately after coming near power.
p5049
aVCompromise is compromise, but LD showed their hand that day.\u000a\u000a
p5050
aVYeah, they were always a "I like them because they talk sense" party in opposition and haven't quite lived up to it as a member of a ruling coalition.
p5051
aVIn all fairness, they are a junior partner.
p5052
aVTheir interventions with the worst of conservative policies (NHS reform, Snoopers Charter) has been very good, with only a couple of things which make it impossible for me to vote for them (secret trials, tuition fees)
p5053
aVWell, I think either position is a bad argument for voting for them.
p5054
aVThey've not done what they said they would because you can't trust them or they've not done what they said they would because they're a minor party.
p5055
aVWhat about the Conservatives?
p5056
aVThey've also broken their election promises - they haven't cut immigration, and they've also broken their no top down reorganisation of the NHS promise.
p5057
aVJunior coalition partners having less input is literally how coalitions are supposed to work - tactical voting is why we have such a screwed up political system in the first place
p5058
aVWell, yeah but you wouldn't be voting for them based on this parliament either.
p5059
aVI do think it's clearly unfair to blame the Lib Dems for being a bad coalition partner and vote Conservative.
p5060
aVThing is, I honestly feel that the lib dems actually punched above their weight this parliament.
p5061
aVThe only reason I'm not voting lib dem is a few things which they followed the Conservatives on which I feel violated their ideals as a party (secret trials, in particular)
p5062
aVI get where you are coming from, but don't forget how much negotiation had to be done, and the LD's still kept them in check - they prevented the Snooper's Charter and stopped them from pulling out of the ECHR.
p5063
aVThis is massive.
p5064
aVThese are my main causes for concern if we get a Tory majority.
p5065
aVhttp://www.libdems.org.uk/404 gives me a different error message, which is interesting.
p5066
aV(When I say interesting, I mean at best /r/mildlyinteresting , because it looks pretty bad)
p5067
aVThe Labour Party website takes a jab at the Tories too!
p5068
aVhttp://action.labour.org.uk/content/404
p5069
aVJust like Nick Cleggs integrity.
p5070
aVAh, the 'Nick Clegg's a liar!
p5071
aV' argument.
p5072
aVHow refreshing.
p5073
aVthing about being a liar is you only have to be a liar once and you're a liar forever, a mans word is his bond.
p5074
aVI'm not at all a fan of Nick Clegg, but why is he considered a liar?
p5075
aVHe got into bed with the Conservatives, surely people can't expect him to keep all of his pre-election promises if he's not actually the boss. 
p5076
aVI feel that most of the new Lib Dem voters of 2010 were really turned off about them enabling a Tory government (who, if you were voting Lib Dem, are probably the last party they thought theirs were going to sign a deal with) and not truly fighting for things like the AV referendum or Lords reform, it's only students who are very bitter about the tuition fees and who can blame them.
p5077
aVIt's not only students unfortunately.
p5078
aVAnecdotal I know, but my boyfriend and I were students at the time and it didn't bother us that much (especially as imo the new system is better), but my parents on the other hand...
p5079
aVThey've very much adopted the "What a betrayal, I'll never vote for them again"  line and now they're pushing for the Greens. 
p5080
aVIt's a shame really, if only he kept that one pledge, I reckon they would be on course to doing better this election that ever before.
p5081
aVIt's a shame, I agree.
p5082
aVI don't know why they decided to go back on their pre election pledge.
p5083
aVI'd like to believe it was for honourable reasons and that by giving that one to the Conservatives, they gained leverage to enact many more of their policies that have been overshadowed.
p5084
aVBut who knows.
p5085
aVCoalitions by their nature involve sacrifices and compromise on both sides.
p5086
aVI am disheartened to see so much support disappear from the Lib Dems because in my mind, I still trust they would be a strong liberal force in government.
p5087
aVBut we'll see what happens, I suppose. 
p5088
aVI'm a student myself and I'm not bitter about tuition fees.
p5089
aVI think it's selfish to be, why should my higher education be paid for through tax?
p5090
aVAll the students knew they would have to pay it back when they signed up for it, it's not like he said "Yeah take the loans, we'll write them off when we come into power". 
p5091
aV&gt; why should my higher education be paid for through tax?
p5092
aVBecause it benefits the country.
p5093
aVA more educated population is better for everyone.
p5094
aVIt's a hell of a lot better for the person with that education, though.
p5095
aVI don't see why a bin man should have to pay for a degree which gets someone else a well paid job in the city of London. 
p5096
aVOr gets his children a well paid job? 
p5097
aV&gt; It's a hell of a lot better for the person with that education, though.
p5098
aVSure.
p5099
aV&gt; I don't see why a bin man should have to pay for a degree which gets someone else a well paid job in the city of London.
p5100
aVI don't think they just fund degrees for well paid jobs in the city. 
p5101
aVAs does not having to pay as much tax.
p5102
aVIt's my choice to go to uni, and I shall reap the benefits of it.
p5103
aVI hardly think it's fair to ask my peers who didn't go to university and went straight to work to foot my uni bill, and then I'll leave uni and end up earning more than them too?
p5104
aVDoesn't sound better for everyone to me.
p5105
aVThere is a question mark in there but I'm not sure what question you're asking.
p5106
aVCan you try again?
p5107
aVIt is better for everyone because it is an investment.
p5108
aVWith that degree you will hopefully earn more and therefor pay more tax.
p5109
aVI'd earn more and pay more tax regardless of who funded my studies.
p5110
aVThe average person paying tax will not benefit from my degree, I will.
p5111
aVTherefore I should bare the brunt of the fees. 
p5112
aVAgain, the nation as a whole benefits from a better educated population.
p5113
aVhe drew a red line with tuition fee rises, the point is yes, politician should be held to any pledge they make, otherwise what is the point of making pledges?
p5114
aVIf he had said 'i would fight against any rise unless' or 'i wouldn't vote for it unless' then he wouldn't have broken a promise, he in fact released this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLR8R9JXz4 putting this promise front and centre of his campaign.
p5115
aVPart of the Coalition agreement liberal democrats could at least abstain from it (and remember every MP has the right to vote as they choose) he voted for it, despite promising not too, this make him in simple terms, a liar.
p5116
aV21 liberal democrat members of parliament aren't liars, 27 are.
p5117
aV8 are cowards.

aVThere isn't any connection between the two parties now, there barely has been for a year now, leading up to the vote.
p5124
aVParliament has pretty much closed, they are no longer a tag team.

aVBack to the individual scrap, and that's fine.
p5126
aVIn fact it shows how professional they have been over the past 5 years.
p5127
aVAlmost 0 spats, despite all the doom-mongers that were out at the beginning of the coalition.
p5128
aVIn fact, I will be really disappointed if we don't get another coalition, especially one involving the LD's. 
p5129
aVyou realize coalition is a temporary agreement between two DIFFERENT parties who form a government in the national interest right?
p5130
aVGranted its easier to sit in the background and snipe, but someone has to bring stability to government.

aVAccording to yougov sturgeon is the best egg
p5177
aVIf you can get hold of it, just read the little purple book \u2018WHY VOTE UKIP 2015\u2019, published by Biteback, one of a series on the main parties in the run-up to the GE.
p5178
aVHere\u2019s a sample,\u000a\u2018The EU is a staggeringly expensive club.
p5179
aVIt costs us £55m every day to stay in, yet it wastes billions on staffing costs, huge glitzy buildings, vanity projects, foreign junkets for MEPs, advertising, and moving the whole of the parliament to Strasbourg once a month, among other profligacies such as the 140 \u2018embassies\u2019 it has set up in non-EU countries (44 diplomats in Barbados alone).\u2019\u000a\u2018The EU controls immigration, business and employment, financial services, fishing, farming, law and order, energy and trade.
p5180
aVSo, whatever the precise figure is regarding how much British legislature is controlled by the EU, you can be sure it is too much.
p5181
aVOur voting power within the EU is also getting weaker and weaker.
p5182
aVThose who say if we left the EU we would be isolated and lose our influence are being ridiculous; we have very little influence anyway.
p5183
aVSince 1996, the UK has voted \u2018no\u2019 to a proposal 55 times at the Council of Ministers-where national ministers from each EU country meet to actually decide the EU\u2019s line on major issues- yet every single time the measure has gone on to become British law anyway.\u2019\u000aThis book details in painful, sleep ruining detail how the EU has damaged our fishing industry, our agriculture, our rights under our legal system, our small and medium sized businesses, our energy policy and costs, our clinical trials, our foreign trade, our patient care within the NHS, and so much else.
p5184
aVAs the EU expands further, our position within it is going to get weaker and much, much more vulnerable.
p5185
aVWe must leave while we still have the right to do so.\u000a
p5186
aVHere's a [chart](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/danmunro/files/2014/06/TCFchart.png) of how the NHS compares to other rich countries' health systems.
p5187
aVWhy anyone would want to drastically change this is beyond me... actually it's not, they're just under the impression that private businesses always manage things better, as demonstrated by rail and power companies.
p5188
aVOh, and they don't like paying for something that doesn't directly benefit them.
p5189
aVThe only issue I can see with the NHS is NHS directors carving services out to private companies and there just being too many people for the hospitals to cope\u000a\u000aI work in a hospital, in a department that used to be NHS, we were moved over to the private company, it's one of the leading hospitals in the country so, perhaps I have a biased view of how the NHS works....incredibly well as far as I can see
p5190
aVIt works incredibly well but the question is can we afford to pay for it without doing something incredibly drastic as our population ages.
p5191
aVCare has to be paid for somehow.
p5192
aVEither we all pay for our own care as private individuals, which is what happens in many countries, or we pay all our money into a big government pot to create and run a massive state owned system.
p5193
aVThe evidence from Forbes suggests the latter is cheapest, so even if costs go up, it'll still be cheaper than other options.
p5194
aVGood point, the question should be can we afford to go insurance based?
p5195
aVSome people could afford it but a hell of a lot couldn't, they would either just die or be bailed out by the state except now it costs the state a shed tonne more because the insurance industry needs to make a profit, the hospitals need to make a profit.
p5196
aVA bit like selling off all the council houses, not building any more and then renting them back again at extortionate market rates.
p5197
aVThe only reason this stuff ever seems cheaper is because they can afford to run at a loss for a few years, then when the NHS is no longer equipped to carry out the now privitised procedures in that area they raise the price.
p5198
aVIt would also further divide society and push an ever increasing number to the margins.
p5199
aVThings like that have a negative effect on everyone, more work days lost, more crime, more disease. 
p5200
aVAnd I would agree it is an issue - but it's a discussion that's hard to take seriously when you look at our expenditure on say, military.
p5201
aVFor a country that vowed to care for it's people from cradle to grave, it's priorities don't seem to allign.
p5202
aVThe argument might be that an exceptional healthcare service won't be necessary if we were destroyed by our enemies... but then some might argue that if that's the case, maybe we should stop funding and supporting the creation of new enemies so we can stop focusing on military spending.
p5203
aVThe real issue is priority.
p5204
aVThis discussion often gets misconstrued with capitalism vs socialism... but in reality it's more corruption vs the people.
p5205
aVBecause there's a massive, looming black hole in NHS spending and if we don't talk about ways to fix it, not meaning privatisation, then we will end up having to privatise!
p5206
aV&gt;Oh, and they don't like paying for something that doesn't directly benefit them.
p5207
aVIt benefits everybody.
p5208
aVThat's why they want to keep it free at the point of use, replace Monitor with public elected bodies to keep standards answerable to the public, and return to a clinician led management - because NHS clinicians generally would rather march on hell than oversee the privatisation of the NHS.
p5209
aVWe have a problem.
p5210
aVIf we don't discuss it and find a pragmatic  workaround your worst fears for the NHS will have to come true and not out of choice.
p5211
aVThe NHS is cheap compared to the international competition.
p5212
aVIf there is a funding gap, it is on the "money raised" side of the equation, not the "money spent" side.
p5213
aVI'm not saying that the NHS is perfect or that it cannot be improved.
p5214
aVI am saying that taking about any large scale change to the way the system works is completely uncalled for.
p5215
aVThe world offers us a smorgasbord of 100s of other systems to compare with, and none of them offer noteworthy improvements over what we already have.
p5216
aVTotally agree.
p5217
aVIt is being deliberately run into the ground, we always seem to have plenty of money for wars, nuclear weapons, Christ we even printed an absolute fortune and handed it to the banks to share among themselves.
p5218
aVMy wife works in a department in the NHS where this week they were told they were pretty much replacing 15 already overrun people with 3.
p5219
aVIf I give £5 and say you have to live off it for 2 weeks, are you the one who overspent when you ended up starving by the end of it or did I just pull a number out of my arse and call you a failure for not managing?
p5220
aVUntil you ask yourself the question, "how does Germany afford to spend over 1k more per person per year?
p5221
aV" The taxpayer is never gonna stump up a percentage increase in spending to cover that gap, so who is?
p5222
aV&gt;The NHS is cheap compared to the international competition.
p5223
aVIt is, but greater efficiency doesn't mean there isn't a looming funding gap.
p5224
aV&gt; If there is a funding gap, it is on the "money raised" side of the equation, not the "money spent" side.
p5225
aVIt's on both sides.
p5226
aVIt's a looming funding gap i.e.
p5227
aVwe're not spending nearly enough for the projected costs of increased medical technology and treatment, more of us, living to an older age.
p5228
aV&gt; I am saying that taking about any large scale change to the way the system works is completely uncalled for.
p5229
aVIF you ignore the oncoming storm that we're going to have to spend increasingly more to just tread water, and that we're going to have to be treating more people.
p5230
aV&gt; The world offers us a smorgasbord of 100s of other systems to compare with, and none of them offer noteworthy improvements over what we already have.
p5231
aVThen in part of this debate, which proves that Nigel is shown to be right that we need the debate, we need to find another new way if none of the other systems do fit once the debate is fleshed out.
p5232

p5233
aVFrench non-profits, and attracting more private insurance money into a public service is certainly a fresh revenue stream to consider.
p5234
aVThe solution to an NHS funding gap is not to change the NHS.
p5235
aVIt's to change something else in society to provide the funding shortfall.
p5236
aVTax loopholes, ridiculous banking subsidies etc.
p5237
aVThere are a million things we can tweak before we even consider touching the NHS with regards to privatization.
p5238
aVThere is no debate.
p5239
aVFarage is wrong.
p5240
aVHands off the NHS, fuckos.
p5241
aVGet the money elsewhere.\u000a
p5242
aVYou're still not listening.
p5243
aVI agree with you.
p5244
aVGet the money from elsewhere!
p5245
aVThe funding shortfall is perpetual.
p5246
aVYou will always have growing costs whilst we have developing technology and people living longer - right up to the point where you develop a generic cancer cure at a fraction of more and more expensive modern treatments.
p5247
aV**I agree.
p5248
aVClose the tax loopholes and ridiculous banking subsidies.
p5249
aV**\u000a\u000aThat doesn't fix the issue though.
p5250
aVIt buys it more time, even if you put everything extra you get from it into the NHS.
p5251
aV&gt;There is no debate.
p5252
aVFarage is wrong.
p5253
aVHands off the NHS, fuckos.
p5254
aVGet the money elsewhere.
p5255
aVThe course you are prescribing is going to make privatisation of the NHS inevitable.
p5256
aVNo debate and the problem doesn't go away.
p5257
aVYou're actually arguing for something that will temporarily put off the permanent: the privatisation of the NHS.
p5258
aVYou're buying some time, but the longer you ignore the issue the more likely the unpalatable becomes.
p5259
aVYou're putting off privatisation, like Labour did by punting it with PFI two decades away but making it more inevitable.
p5260
aVWe need to *prevent* it.      
p5261
aV[deleted]
p5262
aVGlad you're entering another part of the debate.
p5263
aVSo now part of the NHS debate is elephant#2 in the room that the national age of retirement *might* have to be pushed back....
p5264
aVBut that too is a short and easily extinguishable fuse that still doesn't tackle the real behemoth in the room in addressing the health issue.
p5265
aVWouldn't it be nice if somehow, without being bombed or starved by the US we could make our own drugs, conduct our own research and disregard foreign pharmaceutical patents.
p5266
aVI can't help feel that we're a bit of a scumbag species when we trust medicine, one of the most important things in a caring society to greedy companies who spend more on marketing, misinformation and bribing NHS doctors than they do on R&amp;D. If we did this, stopped playing world police and had a real tax evasion policy the NHS would be absolutely fine.

aVThe notion of endlessly growing costs is a fallacy not backed up by science.
p5270
aVTechnological improvements act to reduce costs of universal healthcare, by adopting more preventative measures and automating a lot of costly procedures.
p5271
aVWe are seeing a growth in costs right now because of an aging population and a growing population.
p5272
aVTwo things that are slowing down and will reach an equilibrium in the future.
p5273
aVSo yes, we are fine to delay changes to the NHS.
p5274
aVBecause by the time they are supposedly required, the system will have adapted to our changing society and corrected itself.
p5275
aVWhich is ignoring the core issue here, which is one of principle.
p5276
aVEven if the NHS was on the edges of a black hole, from which it would never escape.
p5277
aVI'd rather change almost everything else about our society first in an attempt to save it, rather than start day one with widespread changes to the NHS.
p5278
aVSo Farage is still talking out of his arse, just like most of the right wing who are desperate to turn the NHS into a cash grab.
p5279
aVI'd tolerate pretty much any change to society before I'd tolerate a change to the NHS on a fundamental level.
p5280
aVAnd yes, the slow erosion of services by the private section is a fundamental change.
p5281
aVAnd one I abhor.
p5282
aV&gt;The notion of endlessly growing costs is a fallacy not backed up by science.
p5283
aVTechnological improvements act to reduce costs of universal healthcare, by adopting more preventative measures and automating a lot of costly procedures.
p5284
aVNot if you want the latest up to date medical treatment.
p5285
aVWhich do you think costs more, an MRI at today's prices or 1980s X-ray at 1980s prices?
p5286
aVYou get better for less than what you could ever expect at 1980 levels in the modern age.
p5287
aVIn medicine you don't expect yesteryear treatment when there is better on the market today.
p5288
aVIf you're saying people on the NHS in 2030 should expect 2020 level of treatment on the NHS, which will still be better than what we have today, but shouldn't expect cutting edge medicine, then you're now entering a reasoned debate and one we should have.
p5289
aVThat would be one way of ensuring an NHS as we know it - but people should know what it means.
p5290
aV&gt;We are seeing a growth in costs right now because of an aging population and a growing population.
p5291
aVTwo things that are slowing down and will reach an equilibrium in the future.
p5292
aVTHIS.
p5293
aVTHIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED THE DEBATE BECAUSE IT IS DEMONSTRABLY UNTRUE.
p5294
aVThe UK population is exploding and is set to hit 70 million by 2027.
p5295
aVWe are seeing unprecedented growth, which is why UKIP are calling for controlled immigration to manageable levels.
p5296
aVhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15461579\u000a\u000a&gt;So yes, we are fine to delay changes to the NHS.
p5297
aVBecause by the time they are supposedly required, the system will have adapted to our changing society and corrected itself.
p5298
aVCorrected itself by a debate you don't want to have?
p5299
aVYou want to keep it the same.
p5300
aV&gt;Which is ignoring the core issue here, which is one of principle.
p5301
aVEven if the NHS was on the edges of a black hole, from which it would never escape.
p5302
aVI'd rather change almost everything else about our society first in an attempt to save it, rather than start day one with widespread changes to the NHS.
p5303
aVNow we really are talking....
p5304
aVSo even if the NHS engulfs the rest of the government spend you'd be okay with it.
p5305
aVReally?
p5306
aVThe other government spend includes welfare, job seeker allowance, policing, roads, industry, pensions, local government services, prisons, education,....\u000a\u000aAn ever increasing spend in one will have to eat into the rest to remain sustainable in the short term.
p5307
aVI don't think you've thought this one through.
p5308
aVTo put off the privatisation of one temporarily, in the interim you have advocated effectively the privatisation of all else!
p5309
aV&gt;So Farage is still talking out of his arse, just like most of the right wing who are desperate to turn the NHS into a cash grab.
p5310
aVHe doesn't want to privatise it.
p5311
aVAn insurance model doesn't mean privatisation, and it is actual UKIP policy to keep it free at the point of use and to return it to clinician led management - and I personally trust those clinicians in the NHS to want to keep it free and public.
p5312
aV&gt;I'd tolerate pretty much any change to society before I'd tolerate a change to the NHS on a fundamental level.
p5313
aVIgnoring that until we have this debate on how to keep the NHS true to NHS principles (UKIP's health policy was actually chaired and written by a doctor who had worked in the NHS for over 20 years) that the status quo is actually a slow track to privatisation with TTIP (which UKIP opposes applying to the NHS) wishes to put on a fast track.
p5314
aVWe are not seeing unprecedented growth.
p5315
aVGrowth was higher in the 60s and 70s, and considerably higher in the post war period.
p5316
aVIn fact, UK population growth has been slowing down since 2006.
p5317

p5342
aVTo fill this black hole in NHS spending, the money will be coming from the public either way.
p5343
aVIf it goes through the government (via taxes), the people who can afford most, pay most.
p5344
aVIf it goes through private companies (via insurance), the people who are most ill pay most and then a bit extra to cover company profits and marketing. 
p5345
aV&gt;To fill this black hole in NHS spending, the money will be coming from the public either way.
p5346
aVWhy do you say that?
p5347
aVThere's already models in place to accentuate NHS income from private streams without privatisation (by raising how much the NHS can charge private insurer patients whilst stipulating a minimum percentage of patients that must be on the NHS to stem shortage of service), but much more can be done - and is done in parts of the continent.
p5348
aV&gt; If it goes through private companies (via insurance), the people who are most ill pay most and then a bit extra to cover company profits and marketing.
p5349
aVYou seem to be only working on one insurance model when you can have a public insurance model, like in France, Germany, Spain,...\u000a\u000aYou also seem to be ignoring the potential for non-profits outside the government run hospitals.
p5350
aVThese exist on the continent too (around 15% of French hospitals, and more still I believe in Germany).
p5351
aVWhat you've just said illustrates perfectly why a mature national debate is needed, precisely what Labour and the Mirror, in this case, are trying to stem.

aVInterestingly an insurance model would be a means to keep the NHS public and to attract more private money without buying services.
p5372
aV*Which is precisely why Germany and France can spend more than the UK as a percentage on an insurance model without having to necessarily adopt the US model.
p5373
aV*\u000a\u000a.

aV**Kinda like what FARAGE was arguing in 2012....**              \u000a\u000a                                            [still not UKIP policy]
p5375
aVThe citizens of various countries  pay a varying proportion of GDP towards healthcare.
p5376
aVWhether this is via insurance, taxation, or some sort of single payer scheme, either it's affordable and sustainable or it's not.
p5377
aVThe huge advantage of paying for your healthcare out of taxation is that that more of the money can be extracted from people with higher incomes.
p5378
aVThe disadvantage is lack of choice: unless you go private and pay cash, there's no real market in healthcare.
p5379
aVBut that's the case in almost every healthcare system on the planet: the only partial exception is the Netherlands which has individual healthcare accounts.\u000a
p5380
aVLet's talk about ways to fix it then.
p5381
aVBailed out banker's bonuses, corporate tax dodges, offshore havens\u000a\u000aThere we go
p5382
aVI have to assume you're being sarcastic.
p5383
aVNone of those are long term large tax incomes.
p5384
aVWhy not?
p5385
aVThey're certainly long term earners
p5386
aVBecause rich people and companies will just move to other countries if you confiscate all their money.
p5387
aV"Taxing the rich more" seems to be the only answer lefties have.
p5388
aVAt some point pretty soon, rich people run out of money, or move away.
p5389
aVIt's not a sustainable option.
p5390
aVNever mind being a morally wrong policy to just raid rich people to pay for things.
p5391
aV"Bankers bonuses" is the worst though.
p5392
aVDo you really want to remove bankers bonuses so that the talented bankers who make money move to other countries, leaving behind all the rubbish bankers who lose money?
p5393
aV'Banker's bonuses' is an easy target.
p5394
aVWhat they should concentrate on is bankers being incentivised to take hideous risks with an easy get out when it fails (being bailed out).  
p5395
aVYeah this line of thinking always comes out.
p5396
aVTwo points defeat it easily.
p5397
aV1: the rich have nearly all of the pie already.
p5398
aVThey only want more and more and threaten to leave if they aren't allowed nearly all of it.
p5399
aVThis isn't reasonable, it isn't logical, it isn't fair, and there is no end to it.
p5400
aVEventually they will ask for 100% of all money, ans anyone who dares say no will get the same bs argument back, "give us it or we will leave".
p5401
aVFuck off then, scum\u000a\u000a2: holding ourselves ransom to morally bankrupt greed is no argument whatsoever.
p5402
aVThose with more money than they can spend don't want to pitch in, then let them go.
p5403
aVWe will build a poorer but better country without them and their malicious logic\u000a\u000a\u000aYou say morally wrong.
p5404
aVDo u know what moral means?
p5405
aVIt doesn't mean super corporations like google avoiding tax while posting record profits.
p5406
aVThat's not what it means AT ALL\u000a\u000aoh and don't forget, although the rich tell themselves they created their own wealth and deserve to horde it, the reality is the rich owe the state a massive debt for educating their employees, for upholding the society that their business operate in, and much more. 
p5407
aVWealth isn't a zero sum game.
p5408
aVI think you're missing that point.
p5409
aVWhat "the wealthy" have bears no relation to what you can have.
p5410
aVStop being jealous and create your own.
p5411
aVGoogle has a responsibility to its shareholders to maximise profits.
p5412
aVIf it doesn't do that, it would be doing them a disservice.
p5413
aVSo obviously it is going to minimise tax bills.
p5414
aVAnd if that requires them to route all online activity through some irish "office", that makes sense.
p5415
aVIf you think that should be made illegal, lobby your MP to make it illegal (They're actually closing a few of those schemes now).
p5416
aVBut don't suggest that Google is at fault here - it's not.
p5417
aVIt's being sane, and doing what you and I would do.\u000a
p5418
aV&gt; the rich have nearly all of the pie already.
p5419
aVThey only want more and more and threaten to leave if they aren't allowed nearly all of it.
p5420
aVThis isn't reasonable, it isn't logical, it isn't fair, and there is no end to it.
p5421
aVEventually they will ask for 100% of all money, ans anyone who dares say no will get the same bs argument back, "give us it or we will leave".
p5422
aVFuck off then, scum\u000a\u000aEconomics isn't a zero sum game... What you were saying may have been true (or rather, was seen to be true) in the 1600's when mercatilism was the dominant economic theory but times have changed.
p5423
aVThe average person is far better off than the average person was 30 years ago, who was far better off than their own parents, who were far better off than their own but it wasn't always that way.
p5424
aVBefore the industrial revolution most humans lived pretty much the same lives as their ancestors 10,000 years ago did when agriculture was first developed.
p5425
aVThe revolution (along with the enlightenment and the development of Capitalism, which all occurred within the same short timeframe) sparked a massive increase in living standards, economic productivity, scientific and cultural development which shows no signs of stopping (in the mid-long term at least).
p5426
aVEven if in a century the rich end up controlling 99.9999% of the worlds wealth i would bet the remaining 0.0001 will live like kings compared to you and me today.
p5427
aVUs Westerners like to pretend that we're hard done by but in reality the world's the best it's ever been and tomorrow will be even better.
p5428
aVI don't want to undermine the billions of people that still suffer or the cause of progress, i just hate it when people try to paint a picture of Earth as some sort of science-fiction dystopia.
p5429
aVGiven the progress we're making we have to be doing something right.
p5430
aVYou're right, but we'd be doing a hell of a lot better if we didn't have gaping holes in our laws on taxation.
p5431
aVWe could cut taxes that affect the poor and *still* have more tax income than we do now.
p5432
aV&gt; Given the progress we're making we have to be doing something right.
p5433
aVWe could do something even right-er (than what we're doing now) and make more progress more quickly.
p5434
aVOh yeah the £500 BILLION that Gordon Brown bailed them all out with doesn't count in this scenario then...
p5435
aVA single one off payment to buy shares in banks, which will be paid back to the public with profit shortly.
p5436
aVThe public actually did pretty well out of the banks bailout.
p5437
aVSo no - it doesn't count.
p5438
aVGreat!
p5439
aVThat's what Nigel said we'd have to do.
p5440
aVI certainly want to keep it free at the point of use, so let's do it.
p5441
aV&gt;Bailed out banker's bonuses\u000a\u000aThe bailouts shouldn't have happened, and Farage has talked favouably about a Glass-Seagall system so we don't have to do any more bailouts.
p5442
aVLet the bankers get whatever bonuses they want, but sell off the ownership of the banks we have when we can, and prevent any future bailouts.
p5443
aVNo more 'to big to fail'.
p5444
aVUKIP support a citizens initiative of Direct Democracy, but I'm sure there'll be quite a bit of cross party support to stop High Street banks speculating irresponsibly with not investor cash but with the public's savings.
p5445
aV&gt;corporate tax dodges, offshore havens\u000a\u000aThese are pretty much two sides of the same coin so I've taken them together.
p5446
aVOne proposal by UKIP is that corporates should be taxed on turnover not profit which would prevent them from externalising profits derived in the UK to more favourable tax havens.
p5447
aV----------------------\u000a\u000aThis hasn't as such solved the NHS issue so much as buys it more time.
p5448
aVThe issue still remains that whilst new medical technology and treatment will always cost increasingly more, and whilst we're having to treat more people as there are more of us and we live longer, then we can't indefinitely keep increasing the percentage NHS spend as a share of total government spend.
p5449
aVSomething eventually would have to give - even if we've now bought some more time.
p5450
aVWe still need a more sustainable model, which means testing those with more to give under an insurance model into contributing more into a public model may do - which is what some of the European models do.
p5451
aVIt doesn't mean privatisation, but it means providing more capacity whilst still improving the bar of those under a state provider.
p5452
aVWe should also look, I feel, at non-profit provision under a state insurance model.
p5453
aVA Glass-Steagall system wouldn't really prevent bailouts.
p5454
aVLehman Brothers was just an investment bank, but when it collapsed it nearly brought down the whole financial system.
p5455
aVJust separating retail and investment banks isn't enough.
p5456
aVTrue, but the Bank of England doesn't work along the same fractional reserve systems of the US.
p5457
aVThere is no fractional reserve of sorts for UK banks at the BoE, it's a matter of opening books once a year where the BoE establishes am individual lending rate...which leaves open the LIBOR controversy, which is another matter.
p5458
aVAnd of sorts that BoE rate too has been addressed by the UK introducing a bank levy on borrowing.
p5459
aVThe rush on banks in the UK was very much a rush on highstreet banks because highstreet banks had been behaving like investment banks.
p5460
aVIn the UK instance, had there been a Glass-Steagall system, then we wouldn't have had to bail out RBS.
p5461
aVTo take it to another level Canadian regulation meant Canadian banks were largely insulated when the global crisis hit in 2008.   \u000a
p5462
aVAnd then what happens when you run out of successful people to penalise?\u000a\u000a
p5463
aVWow, I am very surprised at Norway's ranking in that chart. 
p5464
aVThat is a chart released by a left-wing lobby group in the US that campaigns in favour of a public owned healthcare system.
p5465
aVSurprise, surprise, when they do an analysis of healthcare systems, they rate publicly owned ones best.
p5466
aVCuriously, the only metric that actually really matters, that of healthcare outcomes, the UK comes last. 
p5467
aV&gt; Curiously, the only metric that actually really matters, that of healthcare outcomes, the UK comes last.
p5468
aVCare to elaborate? 
p5469
aVGo to the Commonwealth Fund's website and look through the metrics involved in their rankings.
p5470
aVAll of them involve inputs (like spend on healthcare, number of follow up letters sent) etc, whereas only one ("healthy lives") includes actual health metrics.
p5471
aVThat's the one the UK comes second last on.
p5472
aV(I likely won't be able to have a back and forth about this as left-wingers tendency to downvote views they disagree with has limited my posting in this sub.
p5473
aV)
aVSeemed pretty self-explanatory to me.
p5474
aVAlmost all the other metrics are opinion based rather than fact based.
p5475
aVThat study was a joke so it's evidence of very little, the methodology was heavily based on patient opinions, which entirely fails to take into account cultural differences.
p5476
aVAs is well known Americans tend to demand much better service than British people do, especially when they have to pay, whereas British people are taught to be oh so grateful that they're getting anything for "free" at all, this obviously biases the results.
p5477
aVIt's similar to UK student satisfaction ratings for universities wherein universities with higher % of private school pupils tend to have lower satisfaction scores, not because they're worse but because from private school pupils tend to be much more demanding.
p5478
aVSo why do the OECD and WHO rank US healthcare so poorly against other developed nations whilst topping it for expenditure?
p5479
aVIt didn't say otherwise, I was just pointing out in particular that the methodology would be likely to give an unrealistic advantage to the UK.
p5480
aVAnyway why bother debating, "don't downvote simply because you don't agree" is a complete joke on this subreddit, especially when you commit the heresy of not treating the NHS as a sacred cow.
p5481
aVI don't like the downvoting either, people treat it like the daily mail thumbs up or down.
p5482
aVDid you miss the bit where we come second last in the section which ranks the NHS's ability to keep people alive, or where you willfully ignoring the bit that didn't fit your bias filled rubbish?
p5483
aVAlso, Nigel has one opinion.
p5484
aVHis party has another one.
p5485
aVHis party outvoted him.
p5486
aVUKIP does not want to get rid of the NHS.
p5487
aVJust did a quick search.
p5488
aV[This could be the clip that the article is referring to](https://www.youtube.com/v/dXBU68nTQj0?version=3&amp;start=2888&amp;end=2933).

aVThe 5 stages of UKIP a supporters reaction to a Nigel Farage soundbite:\u000a\u000a1.
p5492
aVHow do the hook, line and sinker taste?

aV1.
p5494
aVIt must get awful tiring, jumping to so many conclusions.
p5495
aV* What damage?
p5496
aVSome hyped up headlining from a rag that no one in their right mind takes seriously?
p5497
aV* You seem rather determined to take a quick glance at a Mirror headline and reach a decision.
p5498
aV* Noooooo, not a debate on the sacred cow that is the NHS!
p5499
aVAnything but an open conversation, please!
p5500
aVHe didnt mention scrapping the NHS or private insurance.
p5501
aVJust that we need to consider the ageing population. 
p5502
aVHe also specifically says he wants to avoid a US-style system.
p5503
aVSo the title of the article is factually incorrect.
p5504
aVHe only points to Danish and Dutch systems which outscore the UK NHS on every meaningful measure.
p5505
aV&gt;which outscore the UK NHS on every meaningful measure.
p5506
aVExcept for those two trifling measures on which we beat them- cost efficiency and adult deaths per million?
p5507
aVhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/07/nhs-among-most-efficient-health-services\u000a\u000aIt's insane to want to change the NHS on cost grounds.
p5508
aVWe already have by far and away one of the most cost efficient health services in the world.
p5509
aVEfficiency is what the NHS always clings to- a result of being based on the US target based system.
p5510
aVImpossible to compare that with the Australian based payment system like the German which pays hospitals for the duration that the patient stays rather than the speed at which they are processed.
p5511
aVThat is why I said meaningful.
p5512
aVOK then, which measures do they beat us on?
p5513
aVLet's see some of those sources.
p5514
aVAs per the comment by /u/mrtube, we beat the competition (Denmark not shown, unfortunately) on all measures of Quality of Care, on Access to Care, on Efficiency, second place on Equality, third place on Timeliness, and second cheapest on overall Cost Per Capita.
p5515
aVAnd as my link says, we're also way ahead on overall adult mortality.
p5516
aVThe only thing we're really bad at is Healthy Lifestyle- which is not really in the NHS's remit at the moment, rather the Department of Health.
p5517

p5518
aVCelebrating not spending as much on each person and how fast we process people is something only someone form the UK is capable of doing with a straight face I am afraid.
p5519
aVTry and get specialised care or be unlucky enough to be on a waiting list for cancer care- then you'll see what the health system is really like.
p5520
aVCheck the conditions next time you go to A and E, look around you at what is happening.
p5521
aVYou are treated as a burden in the NHS, in Germany I am treated with the dignity of a paying customer and enjoy conditions I have never observed in any UK hospital I have had the misfortune to end up in.
p5522
aVGerman remuneration is based on the length of stay- can you imagine how much the death rates in UK hospitals would increase if we had to do so, imagine how utterly inefficient the NHS would be then?
p5523
aVYou cannot compare systems based on the Australian and US remuneration programs- it makes no sense.
p5524
aVYou have one hell bent on keeping people in and one hell bent on kicking people out. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p5525
aVI don't think many people are celebrating the fact that we spend so little but rather using it to explain that if you're looking for further efficiencies and cuts then you're looking in the wrong place.
p5526
aVIt seems fairly obvious that if we're falling short on any measures then the likely reason is that we're simply not spending enough.
p5527
aVWe do amazingly with the pittance we do spend so stop trying to choke the service even further, rather spend a little more and watch it flourish.
p5528
aVI've not used the German system though I've no doubt it's great but I've never been treated with anything but great care and dignity on the NHS - no I'm not saying that this goes for everyone but I'm certainly not alone in this experience.
p5529
aVThe idea that medical staff would suddenly turn around and treat you differently because you're a paying customer is condescending and facile to the caring professionals involved.
p5530
aV&gt;n Germany I am treated with the dignity of a paying customer and enjoy conditions I have never observed in any UK hospital I have had the misfortune to end up in.
p5531
aVIn Germany, you are milked.
p5532
aVPrivate patient, well this way sir.
p5533
aVWon't you have another test, ka-ching, can't be too careful sir....\u000a\u000aPublic insurance patient - kick you out next day, private patient, stay another week.
p5534
aVIf switching over to a system that is insurance based, and still free at the point of use, means that we put more much needed money into the NHS then i'm all for it.
p5535
aVI think people really are blind to how dire the NHS can be for a lot of patients.
p5536
aVAlmost every interaction my family and I have had with it has been dire, and they've fucked up in numerous ways.
p5537
aVSimply getting to see consultants is an uphill battle and you have to fight and fight to get seen within months. 
p5538
aVAdd Insurance and you are adding  a ~10% overhead, add billing and that's another ~10%.
p5539
aVIf you want a better service that's not the way to get it. 
p5540
aVAnother real big problem for the NHS are their completely outdated, backwards, paper based admin systems.
p5541
aVWhen they do try to get a new system in it always seems to go completely wrong, cost 10 times more and ultimately fail.
p5542
aVConsidering pretty much every single outsourced government IT system goes to complete shit I really wish they'd just hire their own developers and write this software themselves in partnership with the people who actually use it instead of leaving it to some procurement types who don't have a clue.
p5543
aVWhat sometimes seems like the more expensive option really isn't in the long run when you count the ballooning costs and ultimate failures of outsourced government projects.
p5544
aV[Citation needed]
p5545
aVHis words in 2012 were, "I think we're going to have to move to an insurance based system of health care"
p5546
aVYou can have an insurance based system that is still free at the point of use.
p5547
aVIf it encourages more private money into the system it would be a good thing.
p5548
aVThen we could bridge the spending gap that exists with other countries.
p5549
aVIt is the private money that allows those countries to spend so much more.
p5550
aVA win win situation for the taxpayer.
p5551
aVno, this is a lie.
p5552
aVPrivate money wants profits.
p5553
aVThey will only invest if they expect to get more out of it then what they put in.
p5554
aVIn the end it would cost us much much more then if we just did it ourselves.
p5555
aVSo the only people who want it privatised either think they can profit from it or are ignorant of what it would really mean and have fallen for the spin.
p5556
aVYou can easily have a private system co existing with a public one- Look at Germany.
p5557
aVThe question I have is why should the poor of a nation pay the healthcare of the richest few in society?
p5558
aVIt makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
p5559
aVYou can have it free at the point of use, public for the least well off and private for the richest.
p5560
aVNot in tribal UK though, it's my way or no way.
p5561
aVyou seem to misunderstand how taxes work, the rich,[ i know its the daily mail, but you can interpret the graphs your self](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/13/article-0-1C40419800000578-16_634x383.jpg) and my interpretation is that the richer 50% pays ~88% of the tax burden, and the richer 75% pays ~100% of the tax burden.
p5562
aVSo its a bit of stretch to say the poor subsides the rich when its the exact opposite.
p5563
aVI know what you are saying, but my point stands- the poorest contribute to healthcare for the richest defacto
p5564
aVThat is not a reasonable view point, they may contribute, but their net contribution is extremely negative.
p5565
aVThey take far more in taxes than they contribute.
p5566
aVI dont blame them, thats why taxes are setup the way they are at the end of the day.
p5567
aVWe already have this - seen BUPA recently.
p5568
aVMere crumbs- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Europe\u000a\u000a96.9 % pubically funded- still massively underfunded- no hope to ask the taxpayer to pay much more- so who pays more to make up the difference?
p5569
aVRich people and employers?
p5570
aVSound fair?
p5571
aVYour original question doesn't make much sense actually:\u000a\u000a&gt; The question I have is why should the poor of a nation pay the healthcare of the richest few in society\u000a\u000aIsn't that the point of proportional taxation\u000a\u000a&gt; still massively underfunded- no hope to ask the taxpayer to pay much more- so who pays more to make up the difference?
p5572
aVRich people and employers?
p5573
aVSound fair?
p5574
aVIsn't this what income tax and corporate tax does?
p5575
aVThe systems in Germany are pretty broken.
p5576
aVEveryone is their own billing entity.
p5577
aVAll that administration has to be paid for.
p5578
aVEven if the person is in one of the public insurance systems, the big billing monstrosity has to exist behind it.
p5579
aVvery well refined argument
p5580
aVI'm glad you enjoy the German system.
p5581
aVThe insurance companies certainly do as do those who over treat you.
p5582
aVAh I see- it's just too good for the Uk is it?
p5583
aVToo much treatment?
p5584
aVLOL
p5585
aVIn the UK, the NHS exists to maximise the outcomes for the greatest number of people for the available budget.
p5586
aVThese are clearly defined goals which are not shared by the German system, which exists often just for profit maximisation.
p5587
aVGiven the differing goals, it is always a question of what is being prescribed and why.
p5588
aVThe public system is better controlled than the private system but even there it can be abused.
p5589
aVThe problem is that the end user ultimately pays the price tag.
p5590
aVPublic insurance contributions are related to income but private to risk class.
p5591
aVAs you get older, the price goes up.
p5592
aVDramatically.
p5593
aV&gt; which exists often just for profit maximisation.
p5594
aVPublic insurers are non profit organisations.
p5595
aVOf course in private healthcare the price goes up as you are likely to need more care...you talk aout these things with such ideological ignorance, it's enough to make you sick.
p5596
aV&gt;Given the differing goals, it is always a question of what is being prescribed and why.
p5597
aVWhat does this even mean?
p5598
aV&gt;The problem is that the end user ultimately pays the price tag.
p5599
aVThe tax payer pays less as a percentage of GDP and less as a percentage of all investment in healthcare yet on average the outlay is 1k more per person than the UK.
p5600
aVAll free at the point of use too, the end.
p5601
aV&gt; Public insurers are non profit organisations.
p5602
aVThis is not the case for everyone else in the value chain.
p5603
aVPharmacists are almost unique in being guaranteed by law a 20% profit margin on the retail of any drugs they sell on prescription.
p5604
aVThis is why you find a lot in Germany.
p5605
aV&gt;Of course in private healthcare the price goes up as you are likely to need more care\u000a\u000aIn the UK they spread the costs amongst everyone (one risk group).
p5606
aVIn Germany they cut the cost on first entry to make the system seem attractive.
p5607
aVThey used to differentiate as well based on sex, but that is no longer the case.
p5608
aV&gt;it's enough to make you sick.
p5609
aVCan't afford to be..... Until a little while ago, public patients had to pay quarterly if they wanted to see the doctore.
p5610
aV&gt;The tax payer pays less as a percentage of GDP and less as a percentage of all investment in healthcare yet on average the outlay is 1k more per person than the UK.
p5611
aVNope.
p5612
aVThis has just moved a lot of the costs from the state to the insurance companies, whether public or private.
p5613
aVIn the end it is still a cost to the employer and the employee.
p5614
aV&gt;All free at the point of use too, the end.
p5615
aVAgain, only true for some.
p5616
aV&gt; This is not the case for everyone else in the value chain.
p5617
aVPharmacists are almost unique in being guaranteed by law a 20% profit margin on the retail of any drugs they sell on prescription.
p5618
aVThis is why you find a lot in Germany.
p5619
aVYou mean retailers want to make profits!!!!!!!
p5620
aVMy god quick arrest them!
p5621
aV&gt;In the UK they spread the costs amongst everyone (one risk group).
p5622
aVIn Germany they cut the cost on first entry to make the system seem attractive.
p5623
aVThey used to differentiate as well based on sex, but that is no longer the case.
p5624
aVYes this is exactly what is wrong with the UK system.
p5625
aVIt means overall spending falls down as such a high portion comes directly from taxation (National insurance), poor people funding healthcare for rich people- in other words.
p5626
aVCan you explain why it should not be the case that rich people are obliged to pay for their own healthcare?
p5627
aVCan you tell me how it is less fair?
p5628
aVRich people paying for their own care leaves more national money to spread over fewer individuals and thus overall spending goes up per head and down as a percentage of tax outlay, up as a percentage of GDP- more nurses and doctors (obviously) as a result and all the trickle down outcomes of having more money in the system.
p5629
aVHow else do you think Germany can spend so much more per person than the UK?
p5630
aVFor the UK to increase spending the only option is political suicide ie ask the taxpayer to spend more.
p5631
aVShift the burden is better IMO- shift it onto the rich and their employers through private insurance.
p5632
aVI remember those quarterly payments - I think it was 10 euro every 3 months?\u000a\u000a
p5633
aV&gt; You mean retailers want to make profits!!!!!!!
p5634
aVMy god quick arrest them!
p5635
aVThis is protected by law.
p5636
aVHow many industries in the UK have a state guaranteed profit?
p5637
aV&gt;It means overall spending falls down as such a high portion comes directly from taxation (National insurance), poor people funding healthcare for rich people- in other words.
p5638
aVNope.
p5639
aVBoth private and public are supported through their own (mandatory) insurance contributions.
p5640
aVDifferent Krankenkasse have their own features.
p5641
aVThere is no fair or unfair tax, both are the same.
p5642
aVIndeed those with higher incomes pay rather less as a percentage of their income into a Privatkasse than those with lower incomes (which is why they are so popular).
p5643
aV&gt;Rich people paying for their own care leaves more national money to spread over fewer individuals and thus overall spending goes up per head and down as a percentage of tax outlay, up as a percentage of GDP\u000a\u000aNot really as neither is supporting the other.
p5644
aVThe insurance system takes the risk either way, it is just in Germany there are many more entities and bureaucrats that have to be paid for.
p5645
aVThere is also nobody with an overview of what is effective and what isn't so we get to pay for such things as homeopathy.
p5646
aVYou talk about doctors and nurses.
p5647
aVHowever, Germany does have issues, it has a surfeit of junior doctors but far fewer skilled technicians and an issue with enough nurses.
p5648
aVWhat is paid for are the multiple layers of bureaucrats who administer the system.
p5649
aVThe NHS and the DSS behind it have a lot of bureacrats too but nothing like the numbers in Germany where we have "per aspirin" accounting.
p5650
aVYes, in the UK, increasing spending means asking the taxpayer to pay more.
p5651
aVSame in Germany as the public insurance schemes are not permitted to compete on cost so if they run short, all must increase their cut.
p5652
aVSo both rich and poor pay for the system but the private system allows for gold plating.
p5653
aV&gt;I remember those quarterly payments - I think it was 10 euro every 3 months?
p5654
aVYes.
p5655
aVBut it was no longer free at the point of use.
p5656
aVNow there are many things that are not covered or have to be argued with an insurance company, particularly with the public system.
p5657
aVThe final problem is what the insurance companies do with that cash they take.
p5658
aVIn earlier times, they would make long term investments in the markets.
p5659
aVUnfortunately these opportunities have gone and some insurance companies even lost money there.
p5660
aVHow could it cost much more than 97% of the funding coming from taxes?
p5661
aVYou could drop that to 87% tax funded and 10% private funding, half of which is paid by the employer.....\u000a\u000aCan you tell em what is less desirable about that?
p5662
aVOne tax big business COULD NOT avoid.
p5663
aVHo ho ho, I admire your dedication.
p5664
aVHere are the three stages of most others ITT:\u000a\u000a1.

p5678
aVNoooooo, not a debate on the sacred cow that is the NHS!
p5679
aVAnything but an open conversation, please! 
p5680
aVWe can have one now; It's a stupid, stupid idea.
p5681
aVThere is nothing about the US's heathcare system that is remotely desirable.
p5682
aVUnless you are wealthy and a shareholder.
p5683
aVThen its clearly superior.
p5684
aVEveryone can be a shareholder!
p5685
aVJust so long as we can find someone to buy MRI machines for £500k in India, and sell them here for £250k at a profit.
p5686
aVPlease point me in the direction of an actual quote from Farage's actual mouth about how he wants a system just like the United States.
p5687
aVI'll wait for that one.
p5688
aVWhich Farage was not referring too.
p5689
aV&gt;remember the commonwealth\u000a\u000aOh boy
p5690
aVDo you have an issue with regaining strengthened ties with the Commonwealth?
p5691
aVI have an issue with regaining ties with nations simply based on the fact we used to rule over them, yes. 
p5692
aVIt is open.

aVYou're just going to lose.

aVSweet Jesus, how many worshippers  at the  altar  can there be in one thread?

aVUh oh, that's torn it.
p5697
aVThey're all out now. 
p5698
aVYeah mate, you're outnumbered.
p5699
aVDeal with it instead of going "hurr durr altar" \u000a\u000aStart the debate. 
p5700
aVI'm having a laugh about the "Ageing population" one from the Telegraph.
p5701
aVThe NHS does very nicely out of non-earning OAPs retiring to Spain with younger workers coming to the country, paying in and then going back home before they claim much in the way of benefits.
p5702
aVAh, yes, the EU.
p5703
aVUKIP will do something about the British benefits tourists.
p5704
aVHow dare the evil lefty smearers criticise someone who actually thinks we should sell off the NHS and replace it with American Insurance system.
p5705
aVBut no, just another case of the left smearing you as usual, it's okay we won't have to wait another week until someone in UKIP says something racist.
p5706
aVBut no that's fine as well, because we should all stop trying to be politically correct.
p5707
aVBritain is doomed.

aVIt's ok, he will change his mind next week again.

aVHonest.
p5710
aV[deleted]
p5711
aVHow come?
p5712
aVPerhaps you should wait to see the video before jumping to conclusions?
p5713
aVI'd hate to see another scenario like the one in which several anti UKIP posters fell for the troll Twitter account impersonating a UKIP MEP, only to have egg on their face when the deception was revealed.
p5714
aVYou have to admit there's a problem when troll accounts are so easily mistaken for genuine UKIP MPs however.
p5715
aVTho to a lesser extent, there's little shock at the stupidity falling from MP's mouths on all sides.
p5716
aVI swear some of them still don't understand that they're likely being recorded whenever they speak and that the internet is a thing.
p5717
aVI seem to remember some UKIP posters fell for it too...\u000a\u000aMuh us and them!
p5718
aVIn fact, I was the one who posted it here - I got it from the UKIP subreddit!
p5719
aVIt wasn't a UKIP supporter who posted it there.
p5720
aVI didn't check who posted it at the time, but it was upvoted and all the Kippers posting at the time believed it as well.
p5721
aVWith several of them even defending the fake post, both there and here.
p5722
aVSo...
p5723
aV&gt;Perhaps you should wait to see the video before jumping to conclusions?
p5724
aVWhich conclusions?
p5725
aVIt's unlikely he'll be in charge of the party this time next week.
p5726
aVIt must get awful tiring, jumping to so many conclusions.
p5727
aVIt must be very tiring being in constant damage control
p5728
aVWhat damage?
p5729
aVThis is good for UKIP.
p5730
aVWhat damage?
p5731
aVSome hyped up headlining from a rag that no one in their right mind takes seriously?
p5732
aVWhich, by the way, speaks volumes about the kind of character you are. 
p5733
aVDo you take any of these articles or headlines seriously?
p5734
aV[Nigel Farage: NHS might have to be replaced by private health insurance](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-nhs-might-have-to-be-replaced-by-private-health-insurance-9988904.html)\u000a\u000a[Nigel Farage: NHS debate 'will be needed' on insurance system](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30877758)\u000a\u000a[Nigel Farage says 'ageing population' requires new debate on NHS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11356057/Nigel-Farage-says-ageing-population-requires-new-debate-on-NHS.html)
p5735
aVWanting a decent debate is one hell of a leap from the Mirror headline, is it not? 
p5736
aVYou're the only one here who's intent on discussing just the mirror's headline but you seem convinced that's what everyone's focusing on.
p5737
aVGoolags for you sir!
p5738
aV&gt;It must get awful tiring, jumping to so many conclusions.
p5739
aVdude, the guys got a fucking jet pack.
p5740
aVThis will be used against him in the Tv debates if they go ahead and will probably be very damaging.
p5741
aVUKIP was rapidly expanding from its libertarian capitalist roots but any mention of the NHS and privatisation will deter a lot of voters from voting UKIP.
p5742
aVIf these debates go ahead I hope the public, many of whom have one policy tunnel vision when it comes to UKIP get to see them for the hard right, ex-tories that they are.
p5743
aVThey'll do nothing but attack working and poor people and divide society if they ever get any real power.
p5744
aVI agree.
p5745
aVThough at the moment, UKIP may well cost the Tories the next general election, so they're not all bad.
p5746
aV:)
p5747
aVIt could go the other way with a tory / ukip coalition, I'm not sure I could actually handle that, makes me think of that Children of Men film.
p5748
aVSorry to be pessimistic!
p5749
aVThe Tories are bound to lose seats.
p5750
aVThey got 36% of the vote last time, they won't reach that in May.
p5751
aVUKIP won't get more than 10 seats at the very most.
p5752
aVIt won't happen.
p5753
aVStop panicking me!
p5754
aVWell if that doesn't lose him a metric fuckton of votes, nothing will.
p5755
aVAs long as he keeps the focus on immigration and a vague notion that the government aren't listening to "the people" then he'll be completely fine.
p5756
aVIt seems UKIPvoters are pretty determined to fuck up the good stuff we still have left.
p5757
aVLike an experiment, let's see what happens if we put a comedian in charge, with a party we've only first heard about a year ago. 
p5758
aVYou seem rather determined to take a quick glance at a Mirror headline and reach a decision.
p5759
aVI hope you don't work as a detective, or in any capacity which requires a modicum of critical thinking. 
p5760
aVIn fairness it's a leading story in many of the UK newspapers, left and right.
p5761
aVIn fairness, some of them have objectively dishonest headlines;\u000a\u000aIndependent; "Nigel Farage: NHS might have to be replaced by private health insurance"\u000a\u000aWhat he actually said;\u000a\u000a"As time goes on, this is a debate that we\u2019re all going to have to return to.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe's saying there will have to be a national debate (frankly he's right, LibLabCon aren't doing voters any favours by pretending there won't have to be some very hard decisions made.
p5762
aV&gt; LibLabCon aren't doing voters any favours by pretending there won't have to be some very hard decisions made.
p5763
aVWhy do you say that?
p5764
aVPretty simple really, it's the same old pre-election dishonesty.
p5765
aVThe parties all promise they won't do something before the election, then once they've won they turn around and say they will actually have to do it (and because they've put off the decision it's now worse).
p5766
aVWhichever party is in power there will have to be some painful decisions; either a massive shift in the structure of the NHS, or a very steep increase in the taxes required to pay for it.
p5767
aVCompare it to energy policy, Labour spent thirteen years being too cowardly to make a hard decision, and now the UK is likely to be on the verge of rolling blackouts in a couple of years.
p5768
aVIf Labour had been willing to make a hard decision (nuclear, renewables, coal, whatever), things wouldn't be so tight now, instead they just tried to avoid the flak they'd have taken whatever decision they made and left the country in a dire position. 
p5769
aVIt would be hard to fuck things up more than the last Labour government, and the Labour voters that put them there.
p5770
aVHow about making it compulsory to smoke in pubs?
p5771
aVEdit: I dont think people are getting my refrence
p5772
aVVotes don't matter, it was decided in 1995 when the UK joined the WTO, remember?
p5773
aVOne way street to privatization!
p5774
aVHow do the hook, line and sinker taste?
p5775
aVI'm not sure they have any voters who aren't blind fanatics.
p5776
aVI guess you'll be voting for them then.
p5777
aVI'm not sure im reading the same story as everyone else.
p5778
aVI read "we will need to discuss how we run the NHS at some point in the future because we have an aging population and its only going to get more expensive" which seems pretty sensible?
p5779
aVAt some point we need to stop ignoring all of our problems and hope they go away.
p5780
aVTo get onto the road to recovery you first need to admit there is a problem, at least then we can have a healthy debate on solutions. 
p5781
aVYou can't have rational debates on the NHS, people are too emotionally attached to it.
p5782
aVWhen you talk about the possibility of paying for the NHS, people instantly assume American system and privatization, even though paying for something doesn't make it any of those things.
p5783
aVWhich is why Labour can weaponize it so effectively.
p5784
aVAnd FYI: I don't support Farage's opinion on this.
p5785
aVI think he NHS needs to remain free forever, no matter what is thrown at it.
p5786
aVJust in case anybody begins to say I'm coming to his defense, I aint, he's solemnly wrong on this issue and he should stay away from it.
p5787
aVYou're totally correct.
p5788
aVHowever, reading the political subtext, realistically this is an admission that Farage is ultimately in favour of privatising the NHS.
p5789
aVNot now, but maybe in the future.
p5790
aVThe question that will face the voters is how much of a premium do you put on a politician who is honest enough to admit what he stands for, even if it costs him votes?
p5791
aVHe at least gets respect from me for being straight about it, where as Milliband or Cameron would just avoid answering any questions that could vaguely cost them seats. 
p5792
aVUKIP Policy would also be to hold a referendum on any big government decisions - So something on this scale would go to the polls and likely be a big no
p5793
aVInsurance based does not mean privatisation.
p5794
aVThere is no 'realistic admission' in hidden subtext, other than the population is getting older and new medicines cost more so this debate isn't going away.
p5795
aVIronically one of the solutions Labour imposed through hospitals with PFI contracts is a direct way to privatisation; and the easiest way to prolong the NHS as it is is to redirect funds into front line services, return to clinician lead services, and put real limits on immigration so you can plan future services efficiently around accurate population predictions - which is all UKIP policy.
p5796
aV&gt; Insurance based does not mean privatisation.
p5797
aVThere is no 'realistic admission' in hidden subtext, other than the population is getting older and new medicines cost more so this debate isn't going away.
p5798
aVWhat else could insurance based mean?
p5799
aVBe realistic - In the current political climate anything short of absolute refusal to ever privatise the NHS is a statement of intent to the contrary. 
p5800
aVLook at some of the European insurance based models.
p5801
aVYou wouldn't say they were privatised.
p5802
aVThey tend to have non-profit operators, charity operators, private operators, as well as state providers, and a communal or public law enforced insurance (like National Insurance used to mean, but dedicated towards health) running in parallel to other systems.
p5803
aVI am being realistic.
p5804
aVI'm asking you to look at the alternatives.
p5805
aVThe point about saying we are going to have this debate in the future is the only way to stop privatisation of the NHS in this climate.
p5806
aVIt's Labour that rolled out PFI to hospitals.
p5807
aVUKIP says have the debate, talk about other revenue streams like they have in Europe, and put the NHS  clinicians back in charge rather than primarily bringing private managers in!
p5808
aVBut if you want to *CHANGE* the political climate you are worried about you have to have the debate at some point, because it is a fact that new medicine and technology is more and more expensive, old technology needs replacing, there are more of us and we are living longer, so at some point in the future we will have to have the debate of alternative systems because the current system is ultimately unsustainable unless we make some changes - but that needn't mean privatisation.
p5809
aVIt will mean privatisation if you don't have the debate and come up with a solution because it'll bankrupt us.
p5810
aVA lot of the European insurance base models really work as a sickness fund kind of thing where contributions from employers/employees go into those instead.
p5811
aVThis is really just another way of allocating the money, it boils down to an extra tax very similar to National Insuarance - people and employers are still paying for it and it costs more per capita.
p5812
aVThe rate of growth of costs per capita for the health service will be on trend with other countries so this isn't really forcing us to move to a different insurance based system at all.
p5813
aVIt's just the fact that there is an aging population and insurance based health care would need to cost more as well, not saving us any money or increasing investment beyond what is being put in.
p5814
aVIf you accept the fact that costs will increase regardless of what system you use, raising tax/national insurance by a few % points to cover it is effectively the same as paying privately into an insurance pot.
p5815
aVGiven that our system is already one of the most cost effective it's hard to imagine a reason to change.
p5816
aVObviously it is still worth analyzing options, but in this situation there is a lot of evidence already available and all of it points to the quality of the NHS versus other systems.

aVMy fiancée is American, I've heard first-hand how terrible the American system is for everyone not running the hospitals.

p5821
aV&gt;Would you be fine with the German system though?
p5822
aVThe NHS gives better outcomes for lower percent-GDP cost.
p5823
aVWhat the NHS needs is for politicians to stop sabotaging it, not a root-and-branch change to a completely different health-care delivery system like the German model.
p5824
aVThe overall structure of the NHS is not the underlying problem; resourcing and priorities are the problems.
p5825
aVThe main problem is that the Tories are hell-bent on depriving it of resources and mismanaging it so that they can have an excuse for more privatisation at 10p to the pound to their cronies.
p5826
aVAnd they have form: look at the Royal Mail for an illustrative example. \u000a\u000a

p5830
aVI'm going to play devil's advocate and ask for more about this, too.
p5831
aVWe all hear the horror stories about the US, but I don't know much about other countries private systems.
p5832
aVI'm currently in Finland and tbh really hope we don't get a similar system.
p5833
aVI have health insurance with my employer but it covers SO little, and private treatment is incredibly expensive, and private health is dominated by one very large provider - and mine and other expats experience with them has definitely been worse than the NHS.
p5834
aVPublic health treatment appears to have very limited availability indeed. 
p5835
aVI'm in the Netherlands and I see a lot of parallels with your experience.
p5836
aVIts certainly not a lot better than the UK and there is a lot more bureaucracy on the patient/customer side of things.
p5837
aVIf I want a certain treatment or have a particular condition then you always have to check what is covered and what is not.
p5838
aVYou also have to check regularly whether you are getting a good deal and then for each treatment there is generally a bit of paperwork (depending on what you are having done).
p5839
aVThere are small things that are better here but on the whole the simplicity of the NHS model is a big plus for me.
p5840
aVCHOICE!
p5841
aVThats big in the US too, **its important that the natural segentation of the market not be distorted by subsidies of any kind.

aV**\u000a\u000a***Otherwise people wont have skin in the game***.
p5843
aVWhy would somebody pay $75,000 a year for good health insurance if they could get perfectly adequate health insurance for $20,000?

p5851
aVThink small, very small. 
p5852
aVPeople would still buy private insurance although fewer would.

aVWell its all a moot point, its forbidden for the governments to have monopolies that compete unfairly with investors.
p5856
aVIts a question of priorities.
p5857
aVInternational capital is very fickle.
p5858
aVMany governments are basically Ponzi schemes.
p5859
aVIf they were to trample on investors rights as they did back in the 80s and earlier, stocks might fall. 
p5860
aV&gt;  its forbidden for the governments to have monopolies that compete unfairly with investors.
p5861
aVMaybe we should change that law, then?
p5862
aVIn this specific instance a nationalised healthcare system with the option of going private is preferable.
p5863
aV"Freedom Isn't Free"\u000a\u000aYou would have to BUY that freedom back, and wait many years, paying them back for their projected future profits and their market value.
p5864
aVAs you know, health care is worth a lot of money.
p5865
aVSo, get ready to pay trillions, (or maybe just hundreds of billions since you are a small country.
p5866
aVProperty rights are a matter of principle.
p5867
aVYou should read up on the Achmea v. Slovak Republic case .. \u000a\u000ahttp://italaw.com/cases/417\u000a\u000ahttp://italaw.com/cases/2564\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, Antigua v. US WTO online gambling case
p5868
aV&gt; Property rights are a matter of principle.
p5869
aVIf that principle harms society then I'd rather it was disregarded in this case.
p5870
aVThe better society is preferable to the most highly principled society.
p5871
aVNobody asked you.
p5872
aVYou dont even exist.
p5873
aVThe agreements don't say anything about that.
p5874
aV[POLITCIANS] should have thought about that before they signed the British equivalent of the Uruguay Round Authorization Act - perhaps the most important document in history up to that point, the US signed it in 1995.
p5875
aVAnd the UK did too.
p5876
aV[Read this for some deeper understanding](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf) of this issue.

aV-----\u000a\u000aUnfortunately [its brilliant young author, who you can see in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWBZz070m-k), unexpectedly died a few weeks later.
p5878
aV&gt; Nobody asked you.
p5879
aVYou dont even exist.
p5880
aVRight.
p5881
aVWell that's your opinion and not one I agree with.
p5882
aVIf this GATS thing is really so terrible we should just leave it.\u000a
p5883
aVSee the GATS Article 21 procedure.
p5884
aVIt'll cost you.
p5885
aVSome huge sum of money.
p5886
aVThey are designed to be impossible to leave.
p5887
aVDo you understand what I am saying?
p5888
aVThe UK isnt about to leave the WTO.
p5889
aVNor is the US.
p5890
aVIts not some little thing, its a global coup they are successfully enacting without anybody's knowledge, in back rooms.
p5891
aVWell then obviously we need to do something about it.
p5892
aVEveryone is doing their part to ***prevent deflation*** in this important period.
p5893
aVI am just joking.
p5894
aVYou do exist to me.
p5895
aVBut I dont matter either.
p5896
aVAs I am not either multinational or incorporated.
p5897
aVNor do i have 6000 lobbyists.
p5898
aV&gt; I wouldn't like to live in a country without socialised healthcare, nor would I like to live in pods rented by the hour.
p5899
aVWell, public services are going away everywhere.
p5900
aVNo profit, its a theft.
p5901
aVAs is public education.
p5902
aVThe future is established education brands.
p5903
aVValue added.
p5904
aV"Why give people unrealistic expectations" I heard someone say recently.
p5905
aVThere is not the need there used to be for them because fewer and fewer people are working and they are less and less important all the time.
p5906
aVYes, crowd out is a problem, and will become much more serious, but basically what that means is that capital will cluster in the firms and countries that have established their rights most effectively.
p5907
aVInvestors will move with their feet.
p5908
aV&gt; Well, public services are going away everywhere.
p5909
aVNo profit, its a theft.
p5910
aVI prefer this "theft" to a ruthless pursuit of profit.
p5911
aVProfiteering damages public services.\u000a
p5912
aVNo nonconforming monopolies damage profiteering.
p5913
aVAlso, politicians have to be given something to do.
p5914
aVISDS takes away their ability to do racticall anything except churn.
p5915
aVOtherwise they adversely effect profits and that creates a uge potential liability.
p5916
aVSo they can churn\u000a\u000a\u000aUnless you are you an international corporation or a nation-state you have no standing, BTW.
p5917
aVAs Frank Zapa once said.
p5918
aV**The rights to you have already been sold.
p5919
aV**
p5920
aVWell, I'm still going to do my best to campaign to protect the NHS.
p5921
aVI think the NHS is an incredibly important public service and the alternative will prevent poor people getting access to the medical care they need.
p5922
aVAllyson Pollock has a lot to say about this.
p5923
aVWatch out for TISA, \u000a\u000aHint:That'- not TTIP so much, is the services one..\u000a\u000aServices as in *health insurance*.. \u000a\u000aBritain cannot stand in the way if you sign.

aVPoliticians have absolutely NO say so whatever they say is useless chatter to shut people up for now.
p5925
aVMillion euro jobs waiting for them soon.

aVThat's the drill.
p5927
aVThat's what they do in your neighbor to the west.
p5928
aVPretend to disagree to conceal their capitulations.
p5929
aVAnd often they outright lie too.
p5930
aVThey have to, otherwise people would catch on.
p5931
aV&gt;Profiteering damages *"public services"*.
p5932
aVStrike that word from your vocabulary.
p5933
aVThe new word is MONOPOLY.
p5934
aVAnd its a theft from the owners, the mega-corporations that develop it.
p5935
aVpublic healthcare is a [moral hazard](http://kaiserpapers.org) the way things are going.
p5936
aVAlso, people have to have skin in the game so they know the value of money.
p5937
aVWe will have suspended animation soon, people could be put into it until their families can come up with the money.
p5938
aV(assuming its before their use by date)\u000a\u000aHows that for market in-elasticity?
p5939
aV;)  The name of the big profit game is market inelasticity.
p5940
aVBuy or die.
p5941
aVAlso, another aspect of trade in SERVICES - is the trade in services..labor mobility- "mode four" "the fourth mode of supply" \u000a\u000athink about this, how would UK corporate players get access to emergent markets if their golfing buddies on the government side of the revolving door could not trade those millions of teaching and nursing and the biggest prize of all, rapidly growing prison industries, contracts in those newly privatized entities for them?
p5942
aVHow else to attract countries like Burma and North Korea into the FTA system than to let them *do what they do best?
p5943
aV* Kind of like baby farming!
p5944
aV*I know NOTHING* nudge nudge wink wink.
p5945
aVTrade newly privatized contracts for access to them.
p5946
aVWith at least a decade or two of growth ahead of them.

aVthose new bargaining chips you're not in the game!
p5949
aVEmergent markets will *still be growing* for at least another ten years, maybe fifteen.
p5950
aV&gt; Strike that word from your vocabulary.
p5951
aVThe new word is MONOPOLY.
p5952
aVUhhh... no.
p5953
aVI'm not going to support a society that deconstructs public services in favour of ruthless capitalism.
p5954
aV"Buy or die" is a morally reprehensible idea and so clearly laws need to be brought in to oppose developments that could lead to that situation.
p5955
aVI couldn't give a fig about "getting in the game" if the price is poor people being unable to get healthcare.
p5956
aVThat's not a bug it's a feature.
p5957
aV&gt;Uhhh... no.
p5958
aVI'm not going to support a society that deconstructs public services in favour of ruthless capitalism.
p5959
aVThe whole idea of the FTAs is to ensure stability, so they planned ahead, they dont need votes.
p5960
aVIt takes these important things out of the hands of fickle politicians.
p5961
aVGo ahead, vote all you want.
p5962
aV***Even South Africa with a revolution was still bound by the pre revolution FTA.
p5963
aV***\u000a\u000a&gt;"Buy or die" is a morally reprehensible idea\u000a\u000awhat do you mean by "morally reprehensible"?
p5964
aVI don't see a word about that in my dictionary.
p5965
aV&gt;and so clearly laws need to be brought in to oppose developments \u000a\u000aSee above, "laws" make no difference.
p5966
aVIf these "laws" are enacted, a country can not be sued until they actually IMPLEMENT it.
p5967
aVSo you still have freedom to ENACT laws, just not to IMPLEMENT them.
p5968
aVThats important because it lets politicians promise things so they can get elected.. ;) wink  \u000a\u000aAnd look like they are doing someting, arguing!
p5969
aVFor some reason they never agree!
p5970
aV*Shhhhh!
p5971
aV*\u000a\u000a&gt;that could lead to that situation.
p5972
aVI couldn't give a fig about "getting in the game" if the price is poor people being unable to get healthcare.
p5973
aVAs I said earlier, thats not a bug, its a feature.
p5974
aVOtherwise, there would be social unrest of the politicians couldn't blame one another.
p5975
aVYou have to understand the industrial era is ending.
p5976
aVWorkers are no longer needed to man the machines of industry.
p5977
aVJust to consume the products of it.
p5978
aV&gt;what do you mean by "morally reprehensible"?
p5979
aVI don't see a word about that in my dictionary.
p5980
aV"If you can't afford to pay this large sum of money, then we're not going to treat you for cancer and you'll die.

aV"\u000a\u000aDo you not see any issue with this?
p5982
aVIf it wasn't for the NHS, both my parents would be dead.
p5983
aVIt all has to do with value.
p5984
aVThe market determines the value.
p5985
aVHow could the rights to a market that didn't have any concept of value be sold profitably?
p5986
aVCountries who gang up on the poor corporations to extort a service for less than its cost are stealing.

aVThe 20 century was about human rights.

aV***But corporations are people*** too, so the 21st century is about corporate rights.
p6002
aVWell, they will have to, you cannot have both public and private.
p6003
aVRead the fine print.
p6004
aVWell if we can't have public AND private, we should do away with private healthcare.

aV**GATS Article 21 procedure?

aVFreedom isn't free.
p6008
aV&gt;GATS Article 21 procedure?
p6009
aVI don't know what that is, but if it means we can't have public healthcare then it should be disregarded.
p6010
aVHow?
p6011
aVDon't you know what ***"indirect expropriation"*** is?
p6012
aV&gt;I don't know what that is, \u000a\u000aLearn!
p6013
aV&gt;but if it means we can't have public healthcare \u000a\u000aYou mean MONOPOLIES.
p6014
aVYou should have thought about that before you signed it in 1995.
p6015
aVRead this for some background about [GATS and health care](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf).
p6016
aV&gt;then it should be disregarded.
p6017
aVImpossible, [the UK will get hauled into court](http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National_Office_Pubs/putting_health_first.pdf) and the UK will lose.
p6018
aVHold on for a second, Finland?
p6019
aVThat sounds more like US Mengeled care.
p6020
aVLess is more.
p6021
aVOpen up wide for the Doctor. 
p6022
aV&gt; I don't know why people have this mentality of "it's either the NHS or america"\u000a\u000aPerhaps because the private healthcare providers lobby so hard in this country?
p6023
aVFor example, consider [this article](http://socialinvestigations.blogspot.nl/2014/03/compilation-of-parliamentary-financial.html).
p6024
aVMake sure to scroll down, past the names of the members of the House of Lords, until you can see the huge number of MPs with health care links.
p6025
aVI counted 81.
p6026
aVIf we abandoned the single payer system, then I, and I'm sure some others on this sub-reddit, have very little confidence that the government of the day wouldn't follow the bribes.
p6027
aVUnless we first get proper reform of lobbying, I am very worried that we'd up with Obamacare Mark 2.
p6028
aVI'd rather stick with the NHS we currently have than take that sort of risk.
p6029
aVBecause the NHS is perfect and look how bad the only other system in the world is - bad 'Mericans.
p6030
aVSo, guys, it's NHS or Yankee style failure.
p6031
aVtake your pick!
p6032
aVLiterally nobody would say the NHS is perfect.
p6033
aVI'd defend it to my last breath but I'd never ever say it's perfect.
p6034
aVIts ranked as the best in the world, but its still far from perfect.
p6035
aVneeds more money and less privatisation of services.
p6036
aVWell, we will watch the video of what he actually said and find out.
p6037
aVWell, Insurance systems does not equal American system.
p6038
aVEeeeasy, it's another misleading pile of tosh.
p6039
aV&gt;"But in a new BBC interview to be aired this morning, Mr Farage says ditching the NHS is \u201ca debate we\u2019re going to have to return to"  \u000a\u000aThe rest of it is from 2012.
p6040
aVDirect democracy, debating is a key ukip policy.
p6041
aVCare to explain why an article that starts by emotively guiding with "Slippery nigel" should be taken seriously by anyone old enough to write?
p6042
aV"Thatcher - loving Nigel" was also pretty laughable.
p6043
aV[deleted]
p6044
aVProbably.
p6045
aVBut the average mirror reader doesn't.
p6046
aVIt's pretty blatantly manipulative, and I'm saying that as someone who doesn't like Farage. 
p6047
aV\u000a&gt;Care to explain why an article that starts by emotively guiding with "Slippery nigel" should be taken seriously by anyone old enough to write?
p6048
aVThe Mirror is left wing so it's OK 
p6049
aVHaving not seen the video I can't comment on it, but to play Devils advocate, why do you assume an insurance based healthcare system must be USA style?
p6050
aVFrance has insurance based healthcare too after all.
p6051
aVFrance's national healthcare system is incomparable to the US.
p6052
aVIt's universal for starters and "insurance" is taken at source - it's a tax in all but name.
p6053
aVThey also pay *much* less per head out of GDP than the US, yet more than the UK, funnily enough.
p6054
aVBut I suspect you already knew that.
p6055
aVGood thing Farage didn't actually say he wanted a US style system then, he's said a dutch and French style one.
p6056
aVMost of France's healthcare is covered by government funding, similar to the NHS. 
p6057
aVYes, and Farage supports a publicly-funded insurance model.
p6058
aVThe criticism Farage makes is about public operation, not its financing. 
p6059
aVYou can have insurance based healthcare that is predominantly government funded, like Germany now has.
p6060
aVYou have a public insurance model, or a communal insurance pot.
p6061
aVPlease excuse my ad hominem, but my presumption is that Farage doesn't want to copy anything from Europe.
p6062
aVThat's not true.
p6063
aVThey talk about Swiss style Direct Democracy, German style education (especially around trades and apprenticeships which they wish to emulate).
p6064
aVThey even advocate an EU style immigration policy as endorsed by Juncker for those outside the EU coming in, but only applied  to those outside the UK coming in.
p6065
aVWhy would you say something like that?
p6066
aVYou don't believe they're anti-European, surely?
p6067
aVThey're opposed to being part of an EU political union.
p6068
aVThat's a presumption that you would only get if you only get your news from biased left-wing sources.
p6069
aVFarage is a fan of many things about Europe, including its women, if you consider who he married.
p6070
aVHe just dislikes the EU, as every rational person should.
p6071
aVThat's just silly.
p6072
aVThat's childish in the extreme (and hopefully just a rather weak joke), lots of anti-EU politicians are very pro-European, it's just the childish "leave EU = xenophobe" argument we see over and over.
p6073
aVYou can see something positively without wishing to be subsumed into it.
p6074
aVHe's married to a German for God's sake!
p6075
aVAny western European style of funding healthcare is fine; most are at least partly insurance based.
p6076
aVA U.S. style is not.
p6077
aVVery high costs per person despite a low standard of care and illness is the cause of 80% of bankruptcies and of those 80% half did have insurance.
p6078
aVI think wanting to create a system that resembles it in any way is madness.
p6079
aVIf I recall correctly, Farage is also a big fan of the U.S. justice system which is without a doubt the worst in any developed country.  
p6080
aVYou realise that when talking about it Farage has always talked in future terms of the Dutch or French systems, and it's the papers that are hearing 'insurance' and making it synonymous with the US, do you?
p6081
aVA French or Dutch based system?
p6082
aVBoth those countries have a higher public expenditure on healthcare than the U.K.
p6083
aVIsn't that the opposite of what Farage wants?
p6084
aVWestern European system ***are not*** insurance based.
p6085
aVThe vast majority is paid for by the government with a token amount paid by citizens.
p6086
aVInsurance based system are basically confined to the U.S. and the third world.
p6087
aVFarage is going to have to make himself very, very clear here.
p6088
aVAnd if they had NICE they'd have cheaper systems too.
p6089
aVOf course doing away with NICE isn't a prerequisite of either the French or Dutch systems - but you only have to step outside your own bubble to see why any French system will always cost more than the UKs - for the same reason France has no real bus services outside the cities and why you see big, expensive paramedic saloons driving everywhere outside the cities and not ambulances.
p6090
aVThere's a geographic aspect.
p6091
aVHaving said that the French standard of care, speaking from experience, is excellent, and I say that as a big supporter of the average NHS level of care.
p6092
aVThey spend more, providing a service over less dense population, but boy what a service!
p6093
aV&gt;Isn't that the opposite of what Farage wants?
p6094
aVWestern European system are not insurance based.
p6095
aVFrance, Germany, Holland, Spain?
p6096
aVSpain has a regional Convenio Especial, France has its Carte Vitale where the state insurance  reimburses 70% of a GP visit costs if they aren't waived, and Germany has Gesetzliche and Private Krankenversicherung or mandatory public insurance with voluntary private insurance.
p6097
aV&gt;Insurance based system are basically confined to the U.S. and the third world.
p6098
aVThat's nonsense.
p6099
aVIf you don't know what you're talking about don't make assertions.
p6100
aVIt sounds like you're getting insurance confused with privatisation and again with necessarily non-universal coverage.
p6101
aVEdit:\u000a\u000aYou even contradicted your previous comment,     \u000a\u000a       "Any western European style of funding healthcare is fine; \u000a        most are at least partly insurance based.
p6102
aV"\u000a\u000aHow you can go from saying *"most are at least partly insurance based"* to *"insurance based system are basically confined to the U.S. and the third world"* to suit your argument boggles the mind.
p6103
aVI had to check that you were the same commenter!
p6104
aVPlease don't say mistruths to avoid the inconvenient, it's not conducive.
p6105
aVHigher expenditure =/= worse system.
p6106
aVIf we spent more on the NHS it wouldn't be worse after all.
p6107
aVMost of Europe does in fact use an insurance based system of sorts; insurance-based =/= privatised, it just happens that the US system is both. 
p6108
aVWhen did Nigel Farage ever say "American style"?
p6109
aVThe insurance scheme Farage supports is along the French, Canadian or German models.
p6110
aVThe "American style" description is made up crap from the Daily Mirror to scare people.
p6111
aVWe generally don't accept the Mail as a valid source on here, so why are we accepting the Mirror's bullshit?
p6112
aVGermany has a pretty similar system to America.
p6113
aVWhat are the issues with that?
p6114
aVExcept this is never UKIP policy, and never was.
p6115
aVIt was Farage's ideas about how things could be done at a party.
p6116
aVFarage isn't saying it will be UKIP policy.
p6117
aVHe is saying that UKIP needs a policy to deal with changes in the UK population.
p6118
aVPersonally, I think the NHS as it is will be fine, but I get a little tired of these articles trashing and misrepresenting UKIP.
p6119
aVHow about attacking their actual policies.
p6120
aVThey're available from UKIP's home page.
p6121
aVYou don't *need* to invent new ones to attack. 
p6122
aV&gt; Germany has a pretty similar system to America.
p6123
aVWhat are the issues with that?
p6124
aVYou have *got* to be kidding.
p6125
aVAbout what?
p6126
aVAbout the fact that a Germany's multi-payer, insurance based system is fairly similar to that of the US, or that Germany doesn't have any fundamental issues with its health care system?\u000a\u000a
p6127
aVThe German system is not comparable.
p6128
aVThe US system has a number of differences (although slightly less than with the US).
p6129
aVThis ranges from things like the 'basic package' of care through to regulations regarding pre-existing conditions etc.
p6130
aVWhen it comes to insurance markets, there are millions of potential differences in the legislative framework that can be implemented which fundamentally change the nature, quantity and quality of care. 
p6131
aVGermany has a universal healthcare system.
p6132
aVThat, from the very outset, is a *fundamental* difference.
p6133
aVThey have a slightly convoluted scheme for paying for the healthcare - some of from taxes, some of it from **non-profit** insurance "funds".
p6134
aVInsurance costs for the employed are shared 50/50 with the employer.
p6135
aVIt may as well be a tax.
p6136
aVOur "National Insurance" isn't insurance, after all.
p6137
aVAlso, Germany spends almost 50% per capita *less* than the US on healthcare, but 30% more than the UK.
p6138
aVI don't know where you got this idea from, but you've been sold a pup.
p6139
aV&gt; some of from taxes, some of it from non-profit insurance "funds".
p6140
aVVery little from taxes.
p6141
aVThe split is usually 50/50 employer/employee.
p6142
aVAnd the funding from the insurance goes directly to the insurance scheme, and then to hospitals.
p6143
aVNone of it goes into the general taxation pool.
p6144
aVThe British government could raise NI and reduce NHS funding or vice versa as they choose because the two are not linked.
p6145
aVGermany could not do that.
p6146
aV&gt; It may as well be a tax.
p6147
aVCan say the same for the US, post Obamacare.
p6148
aV&gt; Also, Germany spends almost 50% per capita less than the US on healthcare, but 30% more than the UK.
p6149
aVYes.
p6150
aVSo they have a better funding model.
p6151
aVIt's still an insurance based private healthcare scheme rather than a government based public scheme.
p6152
aVThe point here is that Germany can run the type of system that Farage was talking about and make it a success.
p6153
aVNeither.
p6154
aVThe German system very tightly regulates insurance companies, and if they tried some of the sinister practises that are so common among US insurance companies, the regulators would shut them down.
p6155
aVThe US system is dominated by a health-insurance oligopoly and there is little to no accountability.
p6156
aVThis isn't just a theoretical concern: denial of care by insurers kills Americans.
p6157
aVAlso, the US does not have universal coverage, though Obamacare was a timid and poorly-implemented move in that direction.
p6158
aVIt would make a certain amount of sense for the US to move to a system more like that in Germany.
p6159
aVBut there is absolutely no reason to abandon the NHS for a private-insurance system.
p6160
aVIt would raise costs and is unlikely to impove outcomes.
p6161
aVAlso, the funding model is entirely different than the UK now has, and the roll-out would be hugely disruptive.
p6162
aVSo what reason would you have to do that to yourself?
p6163
aVAn ideological conviction that private provision is better than public provision, despite well-documented evidence of it being more costly and less effective?
p6164
aVThe fact that he doesn't want an American Style health care service is one.
p6165
aVWhen he has suggested it he has suggested versions like that in France and Holland.
p6166
aVIts just the Mirror being the Mirror.
p6167
aVHe explicitly says he doesn't want an American-style system.
p6168
aVWill that do?
p6169
aVI'm not a ukip supporter, but my objections to the nhs is the same objection I have for every government programme; if I can't opt out of it, it's essentially extortion.
p6170
aVExtortion with the best of intent, but extortion all the same.
p6171
aVAt least the American system (in theory, anyway) gives you a choice.
p6172
aVThat said I don't think ukip have any idea what they are doing and will almost certainly cause far more problems trying to remove the nhs than if it were just left alone.
p6173
aVI may be an idealist in the abstract, but I'm not completely separated from reality.
p6174
aVThe US system doesn't give you a choice in most cases.
p6175
aVYou have to have health insurance.
p6176
aVThe reason being that given free choices, the system effectively collapses.
p6177
aVThis is what Obama care has been about.
p6178
aVI agree that 'liberty' and free choice is important but in some instances it shits on everything else.
p6179
aVYou can try a nice middle ground where you have to have insurance but you get to choose which policy but grandstanding on principles of freedom just drags the debate away from the reality of creating a sustainable market/system for health care.
p6180
aVHence why I noted "in theory".
p6181
aVThere are problems with the US system, yes, but it's a failure of implementation and external economic issues, primarily due to corporatisation thats verging on oligarchy.
p6182
aVRegardless I'm not arguing for the removal of the nhs or any programme.
p6183
aVI'd ideally like it to be voluntary with alternatives, but there would need to be extensive reforms and safety nets put in place before such a transition even got passed the planning stages.
p6184
aVThe problem with healthcare though, is that when you need it most, very few of us would be in the position to be able to pay for it on our own.
p6185
aVThe idea with a national Health service like the NHS is that we all put in and then when one of us needs it, its there.
p6186
aVand you can opt out.
p6187
aVYou can leave the country, but while you live here, you are benefiting from our society, you are eligible to benefit from the infrastructure our society supplies and so its only fair that you also contribute in a fair way towards it upkeep.
p6188
aVSo then how do you feel about being forced to pay for roads, water utilities, and schools?
p6189
aVI'm not being flippant, I'm genuinely curious - would you opt out of paying for these sort of things?
p6190
aVIt's just that roads allow other business and people to travel, water allows people to live, and schools can provide an educated workforce.
p6191
aVIf you had the chance to opt out, would you no longer be able to benefit from these?
p6192
aVWell if given the opportunity to opt out, others would presumably offer competing services you could choose to use instead.
p6193
aVMost water services are actually handled by private companies already, and there are private schools.
p6194
aVWhether I'd opt out or not would depend on the alternative.
p6195
aVThe ability to choose is the important point.
p6196
aVIf I choose not to pay now, I get arrested, fined, have all my property repossessed and imprisoned if I resist.
p6197
aVI wonder why the clip wasn't posted in the article.
p6198
aVModerately pro-EU centre-leftist here.
p6199
aVIt is astonishing how different accounts of what he says in newspapers are to videos of him saying it.
p6200
aVPolitical PR these days is that you release details of speeches and interviews before they've aired, so that they are in the morning news, not yesterday's news.
p6201
aVHave you not noticed the plethora of articles where it says "to be aired later today..." Or "in a speech X will give this afternoon..."  Or the most common one: "In next week's budget..."
p6202
aVWhat's shady about this practice is that what is actually spoken doesn't always match the text that was pre-released
p6203
aVJournalists can't very well let reality ruin their professional spin now can they?
p6204
aVWhen has Farage called for US style healthcare?
p6205
aVHe's explained his previous comments were about more of a European set up which people may or not agree with but they work far better than the US system.
p6206
aVIs this just mirror propaganda? 
p6207
aVWhat's the difference between US and European style insurance, if you don't mind my asking?
p6208
aVI genuinely don't know.
p6209
aVI've never seen it satisfactorily explained in the press.
p6210
aVI have European style health coverage.
p6211
aVI have what is called a Carte Vitale (everyone in the French system does).
p6212
aVTo see a GP I have to pay \u20ac24 per visit but individual doctors may charge more, of which 70% of the \u20ac24 is refundable via your carte vitale.
p6213
aVYou will then be expected to pay more for prescribed medicines.
p6214
aVThe cost is offset if you're a student or on low income, and you're not eligible for costs if it is a long term condition or the more serious it is.
p6215
aVThe offset of this is that waiting times to get an appointment for a GP are non-existent.
p6216
aVIt's all same morning or same afternoon.
p6217
aVIt also means a higher percentage of the public spend goes on serious conditions, the elderly, or the poor.
p6218
aVOnly two thirds of French hospitals are publicly owned.
p6219
aVMany people then elect to have top up insurance to cover any surprise prescription costs or dental costs.
p6220
aVWhat the state does seem able to do is deliver a more thorough system by priortising free at the point of use for emergencies and long term conditions, or only for those on low incomes.
p6221
aVI don't spend much time at the doctors but I had people from the UK visiting in the summer when there was a wine &amp; barbecue related injury, and for an anecdote they'd already said how frustrating they found it to get an appointment in the UK so it was with some deep seated suspicion they got in the car to see our French doctor - largely expecting a bit of a run around.
p6222
aVEven though they didn't have the French paperwork or carte vitale he offered to print off the relevant docs so he could claim \u20ac17 back from the NHS, but at \u20ac24 he was throwing his money at him and saying don't bother - all because he'd been able to walk into the doctors around 4:30 and be out for around 5:30 on the same day.
p6223
aVThey were blown away at how much sense and efficiency it made, that it was more means tested, especially when comparing the paperwork they'd filled out for him and how it would have all gone through a carte vitale if set up.
p6224
aVFarage has specified he was talking particularly about the dutch and french systems.
p6225
aVAs far as I know the dutch arrangement has a state operated insurance system which covers the most serious stuff.
p6226
aVIn the US they don't have this public option which many wanted in the recent reforms so you're forced to used private insurance companies which often don't pay up and leave people indebted for life.
p6227
aVJust read the reams of horror stories about the US system on reddit alone, people getting billed insane amounts for the most trivial problems.
p6228
aVI've not heard these kind of complaints about European health care. 
p6229
aVYou don't go bankrupt because you can't pay for treatment in the European model but you still get less access to care if you are poor.
p6230
aVMental health is a good example - I know a couple of people in the Netherlands who haven't gone for mental health treatment because it isn't covered by their insurance and they can't afford to pay.
p6231
aVIt's a vast amount better than the US system, and hasn't created the sort of glimpse into a libertarian dystopia that the US has, but it does have flaws.
p6232
aVAs does the NHS model, I might add.
p6233
aVEdit: Oh, I should also note that it works far better in a more egalitarian society.
p6234
aVThe European model only works because they have strong unemployment support, and everyone has access to a decent standard of living.
p6235
aVInsurance costs about 120 euros per month even at the cheapest end, and you are legally required to have it if you work.
p6236
aVSo people working minimum wage jobs part time really struggle, and a lot of people in the UK would too.
p6237
aVOur system ensures that the richest pay a LOT more, which is much fairer in such an unequal economy. 
p6238
aVThe Europeans regulate their private markets.
p6239
aVThe US barely does.
p6240
aVMight be better to find out what the quote is before commenting, after all\u000a\u000aBut in a new BBC interview to be aired this morning, Mr Farage says ditching the NHS is \u201ca debate we\u2019re going to have to return to\u201d.
p6241
aV!=\u000aBut in a new BBC interview to be aired this morning, Mr Farage says "ditching the NHS is a debate we\u2019re going to have to return to\u201d.\u000a
p6242
aVNot surprised really.
p6243
aVRoger Helmer also wants a US Healthcare system instilled in the UK, in fact he stated that 80% of Americans receive better care than the NHS provides us.
p6244
aVUKIP are modern Thatcherites, dropping the NHS into the hands of the private market would be a dream come true for them.
p6245
aVBut they know its too toxic with the public to say it outright so they have to go about it discussing 'alternatives like insurance systems' and hiding behind political speak instead.
p6246
aVI think the real problem is that parties on the right have different interpretations of what a "free market" is.
p6247
aVUKIP and the Tories generally mean that the market is minimally regulated.
p6248
aVThey don't mean that the market is regulated to enforce competition among providers (as happens in the German health-insurance market).
p6249
aVThis is a common problem in English-speaking countries.
p6250
aVThe result is oligopoly and rent-seeking.
p6251
aVYou want to see what a private-provider health-care system will look like in the UK?
p6252
aVLook at the energy or rail markets, not at the German health system.
p6253
aVWhen you have a major party that objects in principle to enforcing competition, that's what will happen when they get into office.
p6254
aVIf you want your health-care system to be held ransom by large corporations that have no accountability to anyone but their shareholders, go right ahead and pretend you are adopting the German model.
p6255
aVWhat you'll really get is the health-care equivalent of the privatised rail network. 
p6256
aVI love how the papers today are smearing.
p6257
aVFarage said there will need to be a debate on the current arrangements of the NHS\u000a\u000aEvery paper: FARAGE WANTS TO REPLACE NHS!!!!!!
p6258
aVThe reason why the system is failing us is simply because we don't allow debate on the health system.
p6259
aVIt's like some sort of kingdom of heaven to lefties. 
p6260
aVI think it's failing because it's being deliberately dismantled with the aim of full privatisation.
p6261
aVWhich is, let's be honest, what both Cameron and Farage would like to see happen.
p6262
aVAnyone with two braincells can translate his politician speak to privatisation. 
p6263
aVSurely this will lose him a load of those working class votes he seems to want so bad.
p6264
aVThe NHS is brilliant. 
p6265
aVYet, American media would lead their viewers to believe that most Britons are unhappy with their healthcare system.
p6266
aVI wouldn't mind that if they offered free insurance to those who need it and regulated the price and lowered taxes due to the savings made.
p6267
aVSo no £1000 for a doctors visit, but paying for what you use instead of paying all the time.
p6268
aVYeah because insurance companies in America in no way have a history of jacking up insurance premium prices over tiny indiscrepancies or illnesses, have in no way treated the people of the US like fucking cattle to such an extent that the US Government had to enshrine in law that practices such as unjustified rate hikes, dropping insurance claimants when they actually became ill or denying you coverage based on your health status purely to stop them from doing it.
p6269
aVNo, this hasn't happened at all.
p6270
aVNot even fucking once to any US citizen ever.
p6271
aVOk, I'm saying don't have those bad things
p6272
aVNo, what you're saying is "Let's have our cake and eat it.
p6273
aV" and what I'm saying is "Dude that cake is like three weeks old and I'm pretty sure someone jizzed in it"
p6274
aVNope, I'm saying lets have low tax and cheap healthcare rather than high tax and free cosmetic surgery
p6275
aVDo you really plan to reject reality and substitute your own, in the process risking the health of millions of people including yourself for the sake of the modicum of pride that comes from a frankly kind of featherweight debate online?
p6276
aVIf we go with the US Model, we will have the US Model's problems.
p6277
aVIt is that simple. 
p6278
aVYou don't have to exactly copy someone if using the same idea, you can improve on it you know
p6279
aVWould you trust our Government, or any Government for that matter, to forsee the issues I stated and nip them in the bud?
p6280
aVAfter all it's not like the Insurance Companies will lobby to advise Government on insurance.
p6281
aVYou know, like Health Care Service Providors do in regards to NHS Privatisation or like transport companies do in regard to what is quickly becoming a revolving door of privatisation and nationalisation in that department or like accountancy firms do in regards to financial matters like selling off the Royal Mail in which the accountaincy firms themselves undervalued it, bought a shit-ton of shares and made millions on top of their contract, or like Babcock International now running the Defence Support Group which provides and repairs equipment for our armed forces.
p6282
aVThis is the same Babcock, by the way, that seems to perform with stellar efficiency and quality when under private sector contracts but has repeatedly fucked its' standard services up when on the Government's money.
p6283
aVSo yeah, sure.
p6284
aVI bet our Government will in no way bring a person or company with an Insurance background to advise them on the legislation of any such Insurance-based provision of medical services and I'm sure that person or company will make the risks of Insurance Companies screwing people over for the sake of profit (like they already do and have a long history of doing in the US) because on this occasion I'm sure they'll just want to be so fucking NICE to us won't they?
p6285
aVI can't tell what's worse, the fact that you honestly think that the current system wherein everyone automatically gets insurance (It's called "National Insurance" by the way, look at your paycheck) at a fixed rate that costs almost nothing, will never be revoked as long as you are a citizen of this country, pays for medical treatment regardless of your employment or social status, doesn't discriminate based on past or present health issues or family medical history and is not only completely organised and recorded and processed by the Government so you can focus on getting better rather than trying to remember the exact date you were first admitted to hospital as a child because a long-ass pile of forms in front of you demands to know...with this, a system wherein companies will bid with one another to fuck you over as much as possible while calmly telling you that they'll fuck you over the least with a shit eating grin on their face.
p6286
aVI can tell you now, there's no way any Insurance Premium would cost less per month per person than NI does, and until it does, with the same written-in-law guarantees, no US-style system will ever be able to compare itself to the NHS.
p6287
aVAnd frankly mate if you love it so much then I dare you to head out to the US for a year or so next time you get seriously ill and try and get your shit insured and see how that works out for you.
p6288
aVThere's a reason the US went from that system towards Universal Health Care rather than away from it.
p6289
aVOH GOD.
p6290
aVAmerican here.
p6291
aVFOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T LET HIM!
p6292
aV
aVI dont really care as this will never happen, but it does make me question his grip on reality.
p6293
aVI thought being down to earth and sensible and not ideologically obsessed was meant to be a UKIP strength!
p6294
aV?
aV&gt; it does make me question his grip on reality\u000a\u000aYou don't seem to have a grip on how democracy works.
p6295
aVIt's unlikely to happen because most people don't want it to, but if that changes at any point in the future...
p6296
aVAt this point, I'm really more worried about Mr Farages mental health.
p6297
aVClearly he has been overdoing it...
p6298
aVNow you're equating Farage to the whole of UKIP.
p6299
aVIt's already stated in the article and other articles that it isn't a UKIP policy because UKIP members are against Farage's stance.
p6300
aVWhile he may be the figurehead, he is by no means the policymaker there.
p6301
aVI do however commend him on his chops in saying that the way the NHS is funded and operates needs to be debated, because it does, the NHS is going to become more and more expensive as the generations age, the current way of operating and funding isn't working as it is, yet alone in 10 years time.
p6302
aVThat's a fair comment, I should not equate the two.
p6303
aVI'm not convinced we do need to debate how the NHS is funded.
p6304
aVThe government already take pretty much everything they can get away with from me (income tax, NI, SLC, 20% VAT, road tax, "sin" taxes, stamp duty, council tax etc).
p6305
aVAll I ask or want in return is a properly funded NHS.
p6306
aVIf they can't afford that, they can cut their vote buying programs for pensioners or their invading-sandy-places-budget or this nonsense about keeping people in school forever.
p6307
aVSorry to go all stern on you!
p6308
aVComing back to Mr. Farage, I guess I am caught:  On one hand I wish politicians would speak their minds more and I've always liked that he does.
p6309
aVOn the other hand, when someone says something this barmy, it makes me doubt their mind.
p6310
aVSo I will just have to take the rough with the smooth.
p6311
aVThat crazy stupid motherfucker
p6312
aVWhy the fuck would anyone in their right minds want a healthcare system modeled after the US's??
p6313
aVI live here and I despise it.
p6314
aVIf I ever get seriously ill I am so royally fucked for my finances.
p6315
aVThey overcharge for everything.
p6316
aVIt doesn't work on any level except the insurance company's. 
p6317
aV&gt;Why the fuck would anyone in their right minds want a healthcare system modeled after the US's??

aVFive 'new' policies in the manifesto (note that not all are necessarily new):\u000a\u000a&gt; * Raising the minimum wage to more than £8 by October 2019 \u2013 accelerating increases to guarantee they reach this level before the end of the next Parliament\u000a&gt; * Helping train passengers and commuters with a fully-funded fare freeze\u000a&gt; * Supporting the squeezed middle with a firm commitment not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.
p6453
aV&gt; * Protecting tax credits in the next parliament, to back working families\u000a&gt; * Introducing a new National Primary Childcare Service to help working parents.\u000a
p6454
aV&gt; Supporting the squeezed middle with a firm commitment not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.
p6455
aVSerious question - that doesn't rule out any below-inflation rises in the thresholds to stealthily raise taxes by dragging more people into the net, does it?
p6456
aVNo it certainly doesn't.
p6457
aVIt was Gordon Brown's preferred method of tax rises as well.
p6458
aVExactly, no commitment at all to keep the thresholds in line with inflation.

aVYou mean...

aVNow if the income tax personal allowance would be pinned to the minimum wage we would be getting somewhere.
p6464
aVThis is ukip policy, FYI
p6465
aV&gt;Supporting the squeezed middle with a firm commitment not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.
p6466
aVDoes this mean that they will not raise top rate to 50p or they will not raise beyond 50p?
p6467
aVBecause I was under the impression Balls had promised to raise back to 50p.
p6468
aVThe Basic rate is the 20% rate, the higher rate is the 40% rate.
p6469
aVThe (current) 45% rate is the additional rate (which they'll knock back up to 50%).
p6470
aVThere will also be a 10% rate added in somewhere which used to be called the 'starting rate' (not sure where or how yet).
p6471
aVWhere did £8 come from?
p6472
aVPlease don't tell me they just plucked it out of the air.
p6473
aVLiving Wage is [currently £7.85/h](http://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-living-wage), so presumably it's that with a bit chucked on to cover inflation between now and 2019.
p6474
aVSo presumably the living wage will rise too because of inflation, because they also say that they will 'promote the Living Wage' on page 10?
p6475
aVSo is this supposed to be the living wage or not?
p6476
aV&gt; So presumably the living wage will rise too because of inflation\u000a\u000aI'd guess so - that's basically what I was saying.
p6477
aVI speculated that the £8 figure is intended to account for a likely raise in the Living Wage by 2019.
p6478
aVIsn't it funny that we're all having to speculate though, especially seeing as labour are today focussed on restoring their financial credibility, yet I can't find their full reasoning for concluding that £8 will be the optimum minimum wage in 5 years time.
p6479
aV£7.85 is the current living wage (outside London).
p6480
aVUnless we have catastrophic deflation, it will rise past £8.
p6481
aVNote it says 'more than £8', because we cannot predict what the rate of inflation will be in 2019.
p6482
aVWont the 'living wage' cause inflation?
p6483
aVNo unless they print money to pay it.
p6484
aVI don't think you understand how inflation works.
p6485
aVI agree, we shouldn't have to speculate.
p6486
aVTo be clear I'm not defending it; just offering commentary. 
p6487
aVThis game has been going on a while now.
p6488
aVThe glaringly obvious solution is to peg the minimum wage to some price index or other at a particular level of purchasing power, thus avoiding having to raise it every government.
p6489
aVBut that would mean the they couldn't promise to raise it every damn election without actually raising it in the long term, so neither party wants that.
p6490
aVJust you wait, labour will promise to raise it from 8  in 2020 to somewhere just ahead of inflation (which will catch up in the course of the next parliament). 
p6491
aVCuriously, Living Wage isn't wedded to inflation.
p6492
aVFor a start, instead of being related to a standard inflation measure, it is instead calculated against a number of primary metrics (rent, council tax and child care costs).
p6493
aVSecondly, in order to make it more palatable to businesses (bless 'em, they tried), each yearly increase is capped to 2% above general wage inflation.
p6494
aVThis second point is a bit of a kicker, by the way.
p6495
aVWithout the cap, the current UK living wage would be £9.20.
p6496
aVInstead it is capped to £7.85.
p6497
aVAnyway, all that uncertainty is a pain in the ass for producing "costed manifestos", seeing as you don't have a foggiest how it is going to change over time.
p6498
aVIf you want to "cost" it, it helps an awful lot if you pick a solid figure.
p6499
aVFor obvious reasons, Labour don't actually have to limit themselves to £8 if they don't want to- that's just the minimum they'll have to do to say they've fulfilled their pledge.
p6500
aVIf everything turns out rosier than their current guesses, they can always raise it higher.
p6501
aVThanks for that explanation.
p6502
aVEven if the living wage did stay as it was, £8/hour wouldn't cover the London living wage.
p6503
aVI think that's why they've included it.
p6504
aVThis is not the living wage.
p6505
aVThe living Wage is £7.85 right now and has gone up by about 20p each November so (assuming that continues) by the end of 2019 it will be £8.85 or possibly higher and the gap will likely increase in 2020 and beyond.
p6506
aVThat's before we even consider the London living Wage which is currently £9.15. 
p6507
aVIt's approximately a continuation of the average minimum wage growth from 1999 to 2014\u000a\u000aIt's not that big a pledge, even the Tories might meet it by accident.
p6508
aVAnd employers can circumvent it by calling their jobs apprenticeships.
p6509
aVThere is still a logic to paying less to apprentices - they aren't expected to be running a home, and they do get a qualification at the end of it.
p6510
aVBut on the other hand, a lot of employers try to pay below minimum wage to apprentices.
p6511
aVI thought the point of the low pay commission was that we wouldn't turn the minimum wage into a political football.
p6512
aVit should be noted that whilst the low pay commission give advice, the government isn't bound to accept it, and more importantly the minimum wage has risen faster than average wages or rpi/cpi and so it is feasible that the rate of increase might well be curtailed in future.
p6513
aVLabour are basically committing to continuing a rise in minimum wage at a similar rate to the average til now, which would  make minimum wage workers relatively better off.
p6514
aVAssuming inflation stays low, of course.
p6515
aVStill, I'd love to see their full working out of how they came to the conclusion that £8 is optimal, wouldn't you? 
p6516
aVI doubt it'd be enlightening, because it'd be something like "£8 is a nice round figure for the end of next parliament, and it's broadly in line with the trend", written in the margin on a briefing note to one of the Eds.
p6517
aVMy experience with finely calculated figures and complex economic models is that they do not survive contact with politics intact.
p6518
aVIt's better to use the calculations as a guide and do the reckoning of the politics in a human head to my mind.\u000a\u000a
p6519
aVConsidering it's already due to be at £6.70 by October it's not a huge ask to raise it to 8 over a 5 year parliament, I hope they stick to this if they get in power.
p6520
aVI wonder if they will also increase the rate at which you pay tax like the Lib dems were promising, 11400 wasn't it?
p6521
aVI wonder over the course of 5 years which would make you better off?
p6522
aVI actually think that raising the level at which you pay tax is as important and fair way of getting the lowest paid more money, but it needs to go hand in hand with minimum wage rises.
p6523
aVI actually think this is one area the Liberals deserve massive credit for achieving in, whatever your thoughts on the rest of their time in government.
p6524
aVMy guess is they looked at the living wage, looked at their likely tax revenue, decided they couldn't afford the bump all the way up there in one parliament and compromised at more than £8.
p6525
aVhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20204594\u000a\u000aLiving wage perhaps?
p6526
aVits £7.85 at the moment apparently.
p6527
aVSo at 2% inflation 7.85*(1.02^4)= £8.50\u000a\u000aSo... umm, I guess that's more than £8.
p6528
aVinflation is currently 0, hard to see it rising too
p6529
aVThat's true, and there's a certain amount of bias when pegging these sorts of things directly to inflation, so I suppose £8 will be fairly close to the living wage in 2019.
p6530
aVAs I've pointed out in another post, the living wage isn't actually tied to CPI (or RPI).
p6531
aV&gt;For a start, instead of being related to a standard inflation measure, it is instead calculated against a number of primary metrics (rent, council tax and child care costs).
p6532
aVSecondly, in order to make it more palatable to businesses (bless 'em, they tried), each yearly increase is capped to 2% above general wage inflation.
p6533
aV&gt;This second point is a bit of a kicker, by the way.
p6534
aVWithout the cap, the current UK living wage would be £9.20.
p6535
aVInstead it is capped to £7.85.
p6536
aV&gt;Anyway, all that uncertainty is a pain in the ass for producing "costed manifestos", seeing as you don't have a foggiest how it is going to change over time.
p6537
aVIf you want to "cost" it, it helps an awful lot if you pick a solid figure.
p6538
aVFor obvious reasons, Labour don't actually have to limit themselves to £8 if they don't want to- that's just the minimum they'll have to do to say they've fulfilled their pledge.
p6539
aVIf everything turns out rosier than their current guesses, they can always raise it higher.
p6540
aVOk so, some highlights for me:  \u000a  \u000a&gt; We will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019, banning exploitative zero-hours contracts and promoting the Living Wage.
p6541
aVSo: the minimum wage pedge seems sensible but if you are raising the minimum wage to the living wage (as they seem to be doing) how you can you promote a living wage?
p6542
aVAs for banning zero-hour contracts: I was on one for years and it was fine for me.
p6543
aVI don't like this kind of knee jerk reaction because it implies a distinct lack of either creativity or understanding.
p6544
aV&gt; We will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds, while doubling paid paternity leave for fathers.
p6545
aVThis is going to cost a lot.
p6546
aV&gt; We will help with household bills freezing energy prices until 2017, while reforming the broken energy market.
p6547
aVThis is dangerous.
p6548
aVParticularly when you make a considerable chunk of change off selling energy (oil).
p6549
aV&gt; We will build up our NHS so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance.
p6550
aVI get the Mansion Tax maybe raising some money (but I'm not sure there are enough over £2m properties for this to work) and more levies on tobacco isn't a bad thing but "tackling tax avoidance" never brings in as much as polticians like to think.
p6551
aV&gt; With a Labour Government, migrants from the EU will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years  \u000a  \u000aSeems reasonable to me but a bit odd to see it here.
p6552
aVI get that they are trying to shore up against UKIP though - which is a tragic reason to do anything.
p6553
aV&gt;  work to strengthen integration within our communities.
p6554
aVWhat does this even mean?
p6555
aV&gt; We will work to reform the European Union, and we will retain our membership of it.
p6556
aVreform = good.
p6557
aV&gt; We will not make promises we cannot keep  \u000a  \u000aSigh.  
p6558
aV'I don't like this kind of knee jerk reaction because it implies a distinct lack of either creativity or understanding.
p6559
aV'\u000a\u000aThis means nothing if they think it can win votes.
p6560
aVPopulism and opportunism.
p6561
aVThey want to raise the minimum wage to slightly above the current living wage in 4.5 years time.
p6562
aVThe living wage is updated yearly, so it's quite possible it will have surpassed their £8 figure by October 2019.
p6563
aVFrom 2011-2014 the UK living wage went from £7.20-£7.85.
p6564
aVI'll admit its worded quite unclearly though.
p6565
aV&gt; So: the minimum wage pedge seems sensible but if you are raising the minimum wage to the living wage (as they seem to be doing) how you can you promote a living wage?
p6566
aVWell the commitment is to £8 by the end of the next parliament as I understand it, and by that point due to inflation the living wage will still be higher.
p6567
aVThey're really only raising it in line with inflation.
p6568
aVLabour policy seems to be to offer as-of-yet unspecified tax rebates to companies that pay their workers the living wage.
p6569

p6608
aV](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21814039)\u000a
p6609
aVWhat they aren't telling you is that councils are massive hoarders of empty property, and local councils combined with central government are some of the biggest hoarders of unused land in this country.
p6610
aVWell they also hold the most land in the country.
p6611
aVIt stands to reason that they would also hold the most unused or vacant properties.
p6612
aVUnless they hold a significantly higher percentage, in which case I'll eat a small section of my hat.
p6613
aVAlso thinking about it, the councils hold a lot of buildings built, or upgraded in the post war period.
p6614
aVThese tend to be problematic to demolish or refurbish due to the shitty nature of the buildings, and the presence of asbestos and other nasties.
p6615
aVSometimes it's just not worth the money to redo it all/
p6616
aVYep this is a huge issue.
p6617
aVIf you imagine that your council holds the largest amount of property in the area then it stands to reason they also hold the largest amount of damaged / dated / problem properties that cost a significant amount to fix.
p6618
aVThat means it takes allot longer under their budget constraints to get around to fixing them.
p6619
aVThe counter argument however is that if these were sold to provate owners the work would be done allot faster. 
p6620
aVAren't council housing stocks notoriously low though, so selling them off will just lead the even more council money going to private landlords.
p6621
aVI mean I see the benefit of your point, but the only way I'd think it's a good idea is if the council is forced the reinvest the money in council housing stock (e.g Westminster council can't just sell all of it's stock and give everybody tax breaks)
p6622

aVNo mention of immigration. 
p6637
aVPage 49.
p6638
aVCheers.
p6639
aVI have been going by the Guardians breakdown.
p6640
aVBut unsurprisingly it is just more meaningless rhetoric. 
p6641
aVTrue.
p6642
aVThe only measure on there is in the number of border staff they would employ.
p6643
aVWhat do you imagine the Liberal Democrats are going to say about immigration?
p6644
aVI suppose we'll find out soon enough.
p6645
aVFuck knows, to be honest.
p6646
aVI'm still trying to gauge if it's a 'thing' for them if not.
p6647
aVWhatever they decide, I hope it's as rational and unemotional as possible.
p6648
aVIf I were Clegg I'd leave it alone.
p6649
aVHe's at the head of the only block of seats that could conceivably deal with a coalition or the left or right, he's not going to impress the kippers anyway and the backbench Tories already blame him for everything they have brought on themselves.
p6650
aVNo sense punching himself in the face.
p6651
aVI think they'll have to argue for some reductions.
p6652
aVIndeed before their policy was taken down before the manifesto goes up they described how they were very proud of increasing border checks etc and rather disparaging of labour for the amount of immigration let in.
p6653
aVWell we have a points system for non EEAs in place and freedom of movement for EEAs so there's not much you can do apart from enforcement and leaving the EU.
p6654
aVYour better using oposong media.

p6656
aV[From the "Build your Manifesto"](http://www.labour.org.uk/manifesto/immigration). 
p6657
aVThat's much easier to read than their actual manifesto.
p6658
aVThanks.
p6659
aVThey said that they want to control immigration more than the conservatives; citing the conservatives and their failed goals of lowering immigration.\u000a\u000a
p6660
aVThere is so much content which promises nothing and means nothing... \u000a\u000a&gt;The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing.
p6661
aVHundreds of British citizens\u000ahave joined Islamic State \u2013 a movement that has engaged in savage violence,\u000aand racial and religious hatred.
p6662
aVThe British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so\u000aagain, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.
p6663
aVI mean, there's not much to disagree with there, and they *do* say what they're doing to tackle it (extremism) further down the page, but there's fluff like this all over it - feels like it's been written by a student trying to hit a minimum word count, haha.
p6664
aVI'm slightly scepitcal as to how they can say everything is 'fully costed'.
p6665
aVAlthough I have never read a manifesto before.
p6666
aVWhat I would expect is say a table (perhaps as an appendix) of policies and changes detailing the expected costs and expected increased revenue from tax raises and then balancing them off, or in this case leaving a surplus since they have pledged to reduce the deficit year on year?
p6667
aVAll I can see is 'we will fund x by increasing the bank levy' or 'we will fund y by implementing a mansion tax on homes over £2m' included in the narrative occasionally.
p6668
aVSome of this reads well, how much of it is actually practical and not populism I guess we will have to wait and see.
p6669
aVNot a fan of the house of lords reform idea at all.\u000a
p6670
aVThe IFS will comb through this over the afternoon.
p6671
aVTables and figures aren't as fun or appealing to the general public.
p6672
aVThe information will be out soon enough.
p6673
aVIndeed, the IFS (and co.) are my favourite bit about manifesto launch week.
p6674
aVI'm particularly hoping for a "Labour's manifesto is solid"/"Conservative's manifesto is short a few billion" combo (as indeed I'm sure other people are hoping for the reverse).
p6675
aVMakes for some spectacular headlines and interviews if there's a mismatch like that.
p6676
aV&gt; Not a fan of the house of lords reform idea at all.
p6677
aVCan I ask why not?
p6678
aVPolitics and politicians are what destroys the HoC.
p6679
aVThe partisan nature and clashes of egos means that often people are more interested in trying to 'beat' other people than to try and pass any decent legislation or debate anything properly.
p6680
aVThe House of Lords, although is full of many party apointees seems to be a lot less like this.
p6681
aVI guess because they know that they have the job for life and don't have to worry so much about whips and elections.
p6682
aVIt allows for the input of professionals and experts who are not politicans and ultimately I think the democratic principle is mostly intact since the HoC ultimately can pass legislation without the lord's approval.
p6683
aVLet's not ruin it by putting in more elected members who are essentially just shiny PR people and keep it as a centre of expertise and wisdom that can judge in the interest of the country over a long period of time, rather than until the next general election.
p6684
aVOne of the proposals that was floating around last time it was discussed was for a house of 300 members who were elected 100 at a time every 4 years, for total term lengths of 12 years, with a term limit of 1 term.
p6685
aVThat would make it a very different house from the Commons.
p6686
aVWhat is your opinion on proposals like this?
p6687
aVThe key is the language.
p6688
aVThey say they will reduce the deficit every year.
p6689
aVThat isn't hard to do.
p6690
aVReducing the deficit by £1bn a year is reducing the deficit.
p6691
aVWhile saying they will balance the books is meaningless.
p6692
aVIt is a term they use so they can cop out.

p6708
aVThey're going for the Blackpool vote.
p6709
aVNo mention of electoral reform.
p6710
aVWho the bloody hell am I meant to be voting for if none of them will commit to sorting out the damn voting system?
p6711
aVI thought exactly the same thing.
p6712
aVIf Labour had committed to voting reform then I'd possibly vote for them.
p6713
aVAs they haven't, I expect I will vote LibDem (it will definitely be in their manifesto - it always is).
p6714
aVToday - 'On voting reform.
p6715
aVUKIP believes that the dated First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system is no longer relevant in the four/five/six/ party politics of the 21st century.
p6716
aVWe want a new electoral system in which every vote counts.
p6717
aV' Albeit they don't explicitly state which system they would prefer, every vote counts assumes a system not too dissimilar to PR.
p6718
aVHopefully the manifesto will go into more detail.
p6719
aVI've heard that from a few UKIP candidates but none of them want to tell me what system is appropriate.
p6720
aVGiven their archaic ways I'll assume it's an electoral college system :D\u000a\u000aWill be eyeing up their manifesto though.
p6721
aVGiven FPTP however, voting for them where I live would be a complete waste of time.
p6722
aVOur candidate is insane and not even from the UK.
p6723
aVI hope they don't pledge to a certain system.
p6724
aVThere's dozens of systems of PR and I'd much rather they commission a report investigating the efficacy of different systems than say "we will institute AV+!
p6725
aV" 
p6726
aVThere was a comprehensive report done back in the late 90s under Blair - they could just rely on that.
p6727
aVNo need for a new one.
p6728
aVit wasn't a comprehensive report.
p6729
aVPart of the criteria was to preserve a strong link between geographical constituencies and an MP; something that is not unanimously agreed to be worthwhile to preserve.
p6730
aVAs a result, proper proportional representation was not properly considered.
p6731
aVSTV, while investigated, was dismissed because constituencies would be so large as to burden the voter with too many choices, for being too complicated, and for being different to the systems in the London Assembly, devolved governments and the European Parliament.
p6732
aVThe report explains the method behind a couple of properly proportional systems, but did not investigate them properly at all because they do not preserve the constituency-MP link. 
p6733
aVFunny how when they say "every vote counts" my immediate thought would be "but who gets to vote?
p6734
aV"\u000a\u000aProbably paranoid, but given their election anthem could be "turn back time", I do wonder...
p6735
aVThey only find it outdated because it doesn't suit them.
p6736
aVTry dragging their sorry moral position into the 21st century and you'll soon find out that outdated is not really a problem for them.
p6737
aV &gt;With Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18\u000a\u000aWhat does this actually mean?
p6738
aVThat science and humanities students will still have to take English and maths classes in the sixth form?
p6739
aVThis just seems like a waste of time to compensate for poor maths and English teaching in Primary and Secondry.
p6740
aVBring back the Grammars Milliband.
p6741
aV&gt;guarantee all teachers in state schools will be qualified\u000a\u000aHas there ever been any evidence produced that teachers with these so-called qualifications are any better than those without?

p6745
aV&gt;We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities.
p6746
aVOur aim is to make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary, civil service, and the **boardrooms of our companies**, are more representative of our diverse country.
p6747
aVHe exactly is this to be achieved?
p6748
aVAre companies going to have to appoint 'token' ethnic minority executives now?
p6749
aVWith Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18.
p6750
aVSo under 18's are well informed enough to vote but not pick their A levels?

aVI am still puzzling over what this could mean.
p6755
aVSurely it doesn't mean they have to do English and Maths to A-Level, I would very much doubt it.
p6756
aVNah, I wouldn't think so.
p6757
aVI'm guessing there will be a lesser version of that.
p6758
aVHonestly, I don't see a point in doing maths beyond GCSEs unless you wanna do a mathsy course at uni. 
p6759
aV&gt;Has there ever been any evidence produced that teachers with these so-called qualifications are any better than those without?
p6760
aVOne of the primary schools I went to was full of unqualified teachers until it was taken over by Cognita and qualified ones were installed, and it's performance has since fallen.
p6761
aVThe countries with the best education systems (Finland etc.
p6762
aV) have extremely highly-qualified teachers with very stringent requirements.
p6763
aV&gt;No no no please don't call it the 'Senate'.
p6764
aVIf you insist in destroying the workings of the British constitution at least preserve its poetry.
p6765
aVOn the one hand, it does sound very America.
p6766

aVIt was about as democratic as it got back then.
p6769
aV&gt; On the one hand, it does sound very America.
p6770
aVOn the other, it could be rather Roman, which I like.
p6771
aVIt won't end well: \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwRjc2vH4Uw
p6772
aV&gt; Has there ever been any evidence produced that teachers with these so-called qualifications are any better than those without?
p6773
aVThey aren't, necessarily.
p6774
aVBut all good teachers should be able to get the qualifications, and at least some of the bad unqualified ones would presumably fail them.
p6775
aVGood unqualified teachers won't suddenly stop being good teachers just because they've been forced to take a teaching qualification.
p6776
aVThe idea that every teacher is bad unless they have a PGCE is being pushed by the trade unions massively.
p6777
aVCan anyone explain what they teach in a PGCE course that makes people automatically better teachers, and why trade unions are so insistent on it?
p6778
aVIt just seems to be a part of a 'closed-shop' mentality.
p6779
aVTeaching courses like PGCEs often cover theories of learning, educational psychology, teaching children with learning and physical difficulties, and the study of pedagogical literature and practice.
p6780
aVWhilst I wouldn't say that taking one of these courses automatically makes one person a better teacher than someone who hasn't, I'd say its preferable.
p6781
aVIn my opinion trade unions are for them because they feel that teaching doesn't seem to be valued as highly as other professions which require qualifications by this government, and that they are necessary to do the best job.
p6782
aVThats just my viewpoint on things though. 
p6783
aVmore importantly, why do you think removing the already limited training availalbe would increase the quality of teachers? 
p6784
aVWhere did you get the idea that I'm in favour of removing training?
p6785
aVI'm just saying, nobody buys the idea that teachers need a piece of paper in order to be good teachers.
p6786
aVPrivate schools are proof of this.
p6787
aVWhy exactly are the trade unions and labour so insistent on it?
p6788
aVIs it just to keep the supply of teachers low?
p6789
aVwell the piece of paper is a recognition of completing training to be a teacher.
p6790
aVso the piece of paper isn't important, the training received in order to obtain the paper is.
p6791
aVmuch like any other qualification.
p6792
aVprivate schools are not proof of this at all, the better results they get are down to better resources/lower pupil numbers/differences in attitudes of pupils and parents amongst other things and most private school teachers have QTS(qualified teacher status i.e.
p6793
aVa pgce or equivalent).\u000a
p6794
aV&gt; well the piece of paper is a recognition of completing training to be a teacher.
p6795
aVso the piece of paper isn't important, the training received in order to obtain the paper is.
p6796
aVIt's a figure of speech.
p6797
aVWhat does the training entail and why is it wanted so very badly by unions and labour, and what exactly do they teach you that makes you into a good teacher?
p6798
aVYou've missed my point about private schools- private schools wouldn't hire bad teachers, so the idea that a PGCE makes one a good teacher is irrelevant if they thrive despite not having many teachers who have a PGCE.
p6799
aVMy very best teachers in life did not have any teaching qualification whatsoever, and they were the ones who taught me in my undergrad.
p6800
aVI agree with you on this.
p6801
aVI don't think doing the PGCE makes you a good teacher, it's just seems like an effort to elevate the profession. 
p6802
aVmany things, it's a year long course and i can't be bothered to go into specifics, but it's not so much what they teach you as an examination of weather you're able to teach or not.
p6803
aVa good question to ask is why would anybody want to remove teacher training when the countries with the best education systems have a 4 year training course to become a teacher.
p6804
aVit isn't to keep the supply low, there's a shortage of qualified teachers both nationally and globally, the profession also has a high drop out rate.
p6805
aVMany undergraduate lecturers have a PGCE equivalent the PGCHE, admittedly not all do but universities are hiring more and more, mainly because they're better. \u000a
p6806
aV&gt;  it's a year long course and i can't be bothered to go into specific\u000a\u000aSo what you're saying is that you have no idea whatsoever.
p6807
aV&gt;  a good question to ask is why would anybody want to remove teacher training when the countries with the best education systems have a 4 year training course to become a teacher\u000a\u000aThe implication there being that we teach or would teach exactly the same things that those other educational systems do.
p6808
aVYou've yet to actually explain what they teach you that makes you into a good teacher that current non-qualified teachers with 20 years experience don't have.
p6809
aV&gt;  Many undergraduate lecturers have a PGCE equivalent the PGCHE, admittedly not all do but universities are hiring more and more, mainly because they're better\u000a\u000aWhy do you think it's OK to just make stuff up?
p6810
aVAre you a trade unionist, or are you just an unquestioning labour supporter?
p6811
aV"Why do you think it's OK to just make stuff up?
p6812
aV" -\u000ait is the truth whether you believe it or not, look up the Dearing report 1997.
p6813
aV"So what you're saying is that you have no idea whatsoever.
p6814
aV"\u000aI have a degree in education, I know what the course entails, as i said its more of a test than a course that teaches you things, it tests you to see if you are able to teach before setting you free on the classroom, why is that a bad thing?
p6815
aVif anything we need to expand the PGCE as 1 year isn't enough time imo.
p6816
aV"The implication there being that we teach or would teach exactly the same things that those other educational systems do.
p6817
aV" - no it doesn't , there are international recognized markers we use to compare education systems internationally.
p6818
aVa key one set is by the OECD look it up.
p6819
aVIm nether a trade unionist nor a labour supporter, just someone with an interest and understanding of the subject. \u000a
p6820
aV&gt;I know what the course entails\u000a\u000a&gt;says nothing about what it entails\u000a\u000aSure mate, although with a degree in education (lmao) I'm sure you haven't got any biases in proving to us that the academic study of education is a prerequisite to being a good teacher.
p6821
aV&gt;  it is the truth whether you believe it or not,\u000a\u000aIt is not true that taking a one year course makes one a better teacher.
p6822
aVdo you you really have no argument other that?
p6823
aVtypical kipper 
p6824
aVYou quite obviously haven't worked in HE if you think that taking a one year course makes you a better lecturer.
p6825
aVPGCHE is a two year course.
p6826
aVI don't need to believe it, the fact uni's are hiring them over others speaks for itself
p6827
aV&gt; the fact uni's are hiring them over others speaks for itself\u000a\u000aMaybe wherever you went to uni, but this is not the case for any university of worth.
p6828
aVAgain, you haven't explained how a course makes you a better lecturer.
p6829
aVI don't need too.
p6830
aVa one year examination of whether you're a good teach or not before letting you teach ensures a better quality of teacher.
p6831
aVim also not a teacher...
p6832
aVI have a 3 year degree in Education studies, and i'm going into my MA in Educational policy next year at the institute of education. \u000a
p6833
aVHow does one teach the ability to inspire and motivate?
p6834

p6836
aVOne of the primary schools I went to was full of unqualified teachers until it was taken over by Cognita and qualified ones were installed, and it's performance has since fallen.
p6837
aVNope.
p6838
aVI went to a public school and most were not PGCE qualifified, they were doctors or engineers or lawyers who were A: older B: family orientated \u000a\u000aAnd we and every other school we played rugby against did pretty well

p6841
aVThe idea of old grammar schools being a massive boon to social mobility is a bit misleading.
p6842
aVIf they can figure out a way to bring in state run selective schools as general education policy without massively defunding the schools that most people go to that would be great but that's not what happened in the 60s.
p6843
aVAs it is, more and more are going to independent school, many of which are fully capable of doling out bursaries to poor kids.
p6844
aV&gt;Nations and Regions\u000a\u000aOh so England isn't allowed to exist any more? 
p6845
aVI would guess it is just trying to get representatives to represent similar sizes.
p6846
aVSo rather than 5m for Scotland, 5m for Wales, 5m for Ireland and 40m for England, England will be broken into 8 sections each for 5m.
p6847
aVOf course, this is of the top of my head so who knows. 
p6848
aVMuch too sensible an idea :)
p6849
aVSo we'll destroy England to get around a problem federalism exists to prevent?
p6850
aVMakes sense.
p6851
aVI'd rather see the end of the Union than the end of the country I call home, what gives Scotland and Wales the right to nationhood while England is deemed unworthy?
p6852
aVThis is nothing but shameful gerrymandering, Labour would rather literally Balkanise and destroy my country rather than compete on an even playing field.
p6853
aVIf Labour wanted to slice up Scotland or Wales like a joint of beef there would be outcry yet the Labour party won't even recognise England as a nation.
p6854
aVThey wouldn't give the English people a vote on the matter either, being a party of authoritarianism.
p6855
aVIt wouldn't be  fair devolution, it would be an act of vandalism. 
p6856
aVLol, you've totally misinterpreted and you're embarrassing yourself with your hysteria.
p6857
aVEngland will continue to exist.
p6858
aVI am not sure how it "destroys" England.
p6859
aVRepresenting Yorkshire (or any other region) individually doesn't make England "less real" or anything - especially compared to now where it basically gets zero representation in the same sense as Scotland/Wales/Ireland does (or 100% depending on how you interpret Westminster I guess).
p6860
aVEither way, we already have local regions holding power (London, greater Manchester) that includes budgets etc.
p6861
aVGiving them a bit more say on some devolved issues (local policing, house building policies, transport maybe) via regional blocks is hardly "slicing up England like a joint of beef".
p6862
aVI mean, what does that even really mean?
p6863
aVDo you think England is a monolithic homogenous block or something?
p6864
aVAs if divides do not already exist.
p6865
aVThe idea it just taking "localism" to the next level - closer to how it was pre-Thatcher before she consolidated power in Westminster. 
p6866
aVYeah, remember when England was divided into administrative counties and the country fell apart?
p6867
aVEngland was never divided into counties, most of them are older than England itself.
p6868
aVIn any case devolution by county wouldn't actually be a terrible idea.
p6869
aVWhat I object to is England being sliced up like a joint of beef while the other Home Nations are permitted an identity, a voice and an existence.
p6870
aVFair devolution is regional devolution.
p6871
aVPopulations matter more than "Scotland/Wales/NI each get 1 widget, England gets 1 widget, that is fair".
p6872
aVThe established English regions all have similar populations to Scotland/Wales/NI.
p6873
aVThe established English regions are universally disliked or ignored because they are meaningless, arbitrary boundaries designed for the sole purpose of ending England as a distinct political and cultural area.
p6874
aVIt's Labour's gerrymandering at it's absolute worst, they point-blank refuse to accept England as a nation in it's own right.
p6875
aVI don't like nationalists of any description one bit but I can understand the grievances of English nationalists when the Labour party who are supposed to represent them do the opposite and deny their collective existence!
p6876
aVThis party wants to slice up a country which has already refused regional devolution in a referendum because it's a horrible idea, they have no democratic mandate to destroy England and yet they'll push ahead in classic Labour fashion.
p6877
aVIf Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland have an issue with England they are at perfect liberty to hold a referendum and leave the Union.
p6878
aVEngland has a right to exist just as much as Scotland or Wales, what do you not get about English people being a group just as valid as the Scots or Welsh who have the right to a nation of their own?\u000a\u000a
p6879
aV&gt; England as a distinct political and cultural area.
p6880
aVEngland is actually many different distinct political and cultural areas.
p6881
aVThat is why England needs regional devolution, not some one-size-fits-all bodge.
p6882
aVThe counties within the south west, for example, have little in common with Surrey or Manchester but share more in common with each other (similar issues and problems, similar demographics, similar party allegiances)\u000a\u000aA single English parliament would do nothing for most of the country, would cost more than what we have today, and solve very little.
p6883
aVRegional devolution brings us truly up to par with the other countries within the UK.
p6884
aV&gt;  It's Labour's gerrymandering at it's absolute worst, they point-blank refuse to accept England as a nation in it's own right.
p6885
aVYes, the manifesto is chock full of statements describing how they plan to abolish England.
p6886
aV&gt; This party wants to slice up a country which has already refused regional devolution in a referendum because it's a horrible idea, they have no democratic mandate to destroy England and yet they'll push ahead in classic Labour fashion.
p6887
aVThat wasn't proper devolution, it was a half-assed talking shop, and it was a decade ago.
p6888
aVDon't try and use it as some sound basis for your argument.
p6889
aV&gt; what do you not get about English people being a group just as valid as the Scots or Welsh who have the right to a nation of their own?
p6890
aVand what do you not get about England not being a unified bloc and where trying to run it as such is impractical and useless?
p6891
aVI live in England, I want regional devolution.
p6892
aVYou might not.
p6893
aVThen do the same for Scotland and Wales, carving up one while the others remain whole is an insult.
p6894
aVThat's an issue for Scotland/Wales/NI to explore - but I doubt that they'd go for it, just as devolving to individual counties in England would make no sense - populations are too small and it'd cost a shitload, and some counties are much larger than others
p6895
aV[We have had this arguement before.

p6897
aV&gt; If you insist in destroying the workings of the British constitution\u000a\u000aYou can't destroy that which doesn't exist.
p6898
aVOf course it exists.
p6899
aVIt doesn't have to be codified.
p6900
aVUncodified doesn't really mean anything when it comes to our country.
p6901
aVWe have no concept of a constitution at all, we just have a collective unwillingness to accept that things don't have to remain as they are.
p6902
aVOr rather, those of us who do recognise that changing stuff is alright are left powerless because we're stuck with FPTP.
p6903
aVWe do have a constitution, it's just unwritten.
p6904
aVThis does not mean it doesn't exist; have a skim over http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom for example.
p6905
aVJust because it's not codified into a single document doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\u000a\u000a
p6906
aVI'm big on reforming the Lords, implementing Leveson and the economic policies presented here.
p6907
aVSome stuff like simultaneously trusting 16/17 year olds to vote but forcing them to study maths and english is questionable, though.
p6908
aVOn Europe they've made promises that they can't keep, but I'm not one who is advocating for removal from Europe anyway.
p6909
aVOverall I give it 8/10, likely to vote.
p6910
aVReminder that Labour included democratic reform to the House of Lords in their 2001 and 2005 manifestos.
p6911
aVI'm still waiting for them to adhere to their 2001 promise for no top-up tuition fees, or the 2005 promise on a referendum for the EU constitution
p6912
aVReminder that the commons passed a bill for a wholly elected lords in 2007, and could have pushed past the Lords block, but chose not to. 
p6913
aVReminder that the Lords is full of lobbyists, Labour are a neoliberal party now and are more influenced by lobbying and donations that voters or public opinion.
p6914
aVCommons don't want an elected Lords in practise, since it would challenge the supremacy of the house of commons.
p6915
aVAt the moment they can push anything like they through the Lords eventually, and the Lords won't block a manifesto commitment.
p6916
aVIf the Lords were elected though, they would have a "mandate" too, and would use that to block things from the house of commons they didn't like.
p6917
aVWould result in stalemates and reduced power of the house of commons.
p6918
aVPersonally I am all for some form of reform, but I don't think fully-elected is the way to go.
p6919
aVYou would result in party politics a lot more, which the Lords is less influenced by currently than the commons.
p6920
aVThe purpose of the house of Lords recently has been to scrutinise and amend badly written legislation, and block terrible things like detention without trial.
p6921
aVAn elected Lords would likely mimic the makup of the house of commons, and just rubber-stamp the government\u2019s bills.
p6922
aVI would like a combination of: appointed Lords who have proven themselves capable in a diverse set of roles such as Law, Academia, Charity and Business; jury service style Lords, who are picked at random to serve for 5 years on the house of Lords, adding diversity to the chamber; elected lords from some form of elections which are quite different to the current House of Commons election system, preferably banned from being members of parties and all running as independents.
p6923
aVI'm solely making a point about Labour's track record in pledging and failing to deliver HoL reform at every election.
p6924
aVAs it happens, I'm not in favour of an elected Lords either. \u000a
p6925
aVlottery appointed lords from the General Public?
p6926
aVoh yes please.
p6927
aVI can't wait to see Cardine the council house queen debate the Head of Classics at Oxford University.\u000a
p6928
aVVery unlikely that major Lords reform would happen without a big Labour majority and sizeable Conservative support.
p6929
aVI'm pretty much okay with that because I wouldn't want such major constitutional change to be pushed through without a big majority of MPs in favour of it.
p6930
aVOtherwise we'd just have the prospect of any reforms being undone or halted in the next Parliament.
p6931
aVAlso, I think the name 'Senate' is cheesy, because it's so obviously meant to ape the American system.
p6932
aVI'm largely in favour of making the upper house more accountable and representative, but I don't see why we shouldn't keep the name 'Lords' it just sounds better and it's part of our history. 
p6933
aVThe SNP, Plaid, Lib Dems, UKIP and Greens would all vote for Lords reform if the package was right.
p6934
aVOnly the DUP (from among the small parties) oppose it.
p6935
aVIf Labour and the above listed parties have more than 50% of the seats between them (and if Labour are implementing any of the policies in this manifesto, we have to assume that's the case), it would have no problem blowing past Tory and DUP opposition.
p6936
aVOn the subject of the name, I don't particularly mind the word Senate, and I don't think it should still be called Lords if the entire function of the place is different.
p6937
aVI'd prefer something in the format of "House of thingy" though.
p6938
aVMaybe "House of the Regions", or something, I don't know.
p6939
aVThe American system was so obviously meant to ape the Roman system
p6940
aV[The SNP want to abolish the lords.
p6941
aV](http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2015/jan/snp-debate-end-absurd-house-lords)
p6942
aV..and replace it with an elected house, so exactly like Labours proposals.
p6943
aVSince the Lib Dems agree too, I can't see any reason why we wouldn't get the HoL replaced in the next parliament.
p6944
aVLast time the HOL voted against it, and then Labour backed down.
p6945
aVThe NHS section was very light on detail.
p6946
aVThey appreciated that a&amp;e is heading for disaster, but you can't just guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours, for that to happen you need more GPs and we're not training enough doctors to cope.
p6947
aVManifesto seems OK but where are the details of the cuts?
p6948
aVCan't balance the books without huge cuts , 13b I believe is the figure Lab would need to make\u000a\u000aMin wage to 8.00 by October 2019.
p6949
aVThis isn't really much of an increase, by then the living wage will probably be in the region of 10.00-11.00\u000a\u000aTuition fee cuts good but paying for it by clobbering pensions is bad.
p6950
aVSeems like raids on pensions are becoming a bi-annual thing from both the main parties\u000a\u000aFreeze energy bills until 2017 WUT?
p6951
aVHasn't Labour spent the last few months claiming they never actually intended to 'freeze'\u000a\u000aInoffensive manifesto light on details
p6952
aV&gt; This isn't really much of an increase, by then the living wage will probably be in the region of 10.00-11.00\u000a\u000aNice unsubstantiated assertion.
p6953
aV&gt;raids on pensions\u000a\u000aGod forbid the biggest benefits expenditure in the country gets used to stop the young getting fucked over until they retire. \u000a\u000a
p6954
aVThe style of pension that just fell out of fashion was terrible anyway, final salary is not a fair system. 
p6955
aV| Manifesto seems OK but where are the details of the cuts?
p6956
aVCan't balance the books without huge cuts \u000a\u000aI imagine you can balance a budget in two ways, increasing revenues and decreasing spending.
p6957
aVIncreasing taxes is also not the only method to increase revenue.
p6958
aVDecreasing unemployment has the double benefit of reducing program payments and increasing revenue.
p6959
aVAusterity during contractions rarely works because you are pulling money out of the economy leading to further contractions.
p6960
aVIf you stop cutting and start investing then your revenue could grow.
p6961
aVYou'd have to have a very careful look at such a plan to ensure that your investment would get return.
p6962
aVAnd there is a question on the time frame of the return.
p6963
aVBut the fallacy that cuts are the only method to balance a budget is misleading and has been very harmful in many parts of the world during the Great Recession. 
p6964
aV&gt; Can't balance the books without huge cuts\u000a\u000aThen don't.
p6965
aVI just love the vulgarity of the unbalanced budget advocates
p6966
aVThink the UK's going to run out of pounds?
p6967
aVAs if they're gold or something?
p6968
aVNah, Greece is what happens.
p6969
aV"run out of pounds"?
p6970
aVWhat kind of economics class did you take in college?
p6971
aVThere are a number of HUGE negative consequences to running consecutive deficits and increasing the debt.
p6972
aVInflation, interest rates, credibility...
p6973
aVThe poor and immigrants like myself are the ones who end up suffering the most with a fiscally irresponsible government.
p6974
aVAlso, the national debt is a form of redistribution of wealth - from the future generations to the current generation.
p6975
aVFuck the children, right?
p6976
aVLet's just leave a massive debt so they can't enjoy the same public services that we enjoy today. 
p6977
aV&gt; What kind of economics class did you take in college?
p6978
aVI'd recommend reading up on [Modern Monetary Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory).
p6979
aVIn short: countries that issue their own free floating currency, and have all debt denominated in that currency, do not run out of that currency.
p6980
aVWhilst *all* nations have to ensure that demand in the economy doesn't exceed what the economy can produce, monetary sovereigns are not ever forced to run their economies *below* capacity due to a shortage of the currency they choose to use, as Greece might be.
p6981
aVParable introduction [here](http://heteconomist.com/parable-of-a-monetary-economy/).
p6982
aV&gt; Inflation,\u000a\u000aImmaculate inflation?
p6983
aVInflation without a supply side constraint?
p6984
aVHow's that supposed to work?
p6985
aV&gt; interest rates\u000a\u000aSet by the Bank of England.
p6986
aVJust look at Japan - world's lowest interest rates (because the BoJ wants them to be) despite world leading debt.
p6987
aVThe two just aren't connected if you're a monetary sovereign.
p6988
aVAlso very low inflation, so I really don't know where you're drawing either of those from.
p6989
aV&gt; credibility\u000a\u000aHeh.
p6990
aVGov't gets denied pounds due to not being "credible"... all whilst you can get a mortgage on your house?
p6991
aVHow's that supposed to work?
p6992
aVOr what, we're forcing people out of work today just to impress bankers?
p6993
aVSound logic that.
p6994
aV&gt;fiscally irresponsible government\u000a\u000aThe government has long been fiscally irresponsible, and it's caused [huge amounts of damage](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-per-capita-ppp) to the economy and made many poorer for it.
p6995
aVProblem is, like so many, you've come to believe that the damage they've been inflicting to the economy is somehow good for it.
p6996
aVIt's not, and the government has a lot to answer for w/ this lost half-decade or so.
p6997
aVQuick question on this, I am by no means an economic scholar I understand the MMT theory (I think) but whilst it is saying this is something that can be done, I don't get the impression that it would be at all desirable.
p6998
aV1) Does this not assume that there is a near infinite demand for UK debt?
p6999
aVSurely as the interest we pay on the gilts increases exponentially the eventual supply of the gilts we have to issue has to outstrip demand (a bit like a pyramid scheme??)?
p7000
aV2) Also surely this and the presumed increased inflation would then have huge effects on the value of GBP relative to other currencies as well?
p7001
aVIf this is repeated ad infinitum and the resulting huge inflation results in a worthless pound how are we to import the goods that we would not be able to source or make in our own country, if say the rates of inflation result in the inability to trade internationally with our currency?
p7002
aV3) It also says that the government has to issue the currency?
p7003
aVSo surely this can't even apply in this country since I thought the bank of england, which is independent, controls the supply of money by setting interest rates and deposit ratios etc?
p7004
aVAgain I'm not too hot on economics so if I'm wrong please let me know.
p7005
aVEDIT: I see there's a large section criticising the fundamentals of this theory as well........
p7006
aV&gt; 1.
p7007
aVDoes this not assume that there is a near infinite demand for UK debt?
p7008
aVFirstly, understand that UK government debt = UK non-government savings (due to [sectoral balances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectoral_balances)).
p7009
aVThis is important just from the phrasing of your question - you're implying (correct me if I'm wrong), that the government is *choosing* to run a deficit, and so has to find buyers for its debt.
p7010
aVThing is, it's the other way around today.
p7011
aVPeople *want* to save, and have wanted to for years thanks to the GFC, and hence why every year the government's found that the tax man's collected fewer pounds than the government spent that year.
p7012
aV*Because people have saved the difference*.
p7013
aVEvery year the average person puts aside a pound of after-tax savings, *by definition*, the government has ended up with an after-tax deficit.
p7014
aVThe government then identifies that as "bad" and tries to make it harder for us to save.
p7015
aVIt raises taxes, lowers spending... but the next year rolls around and another deficit has occurred.
p7016
aVWhy?
p7017
aVBecause we've saved despite how difficult the government's made it for us.
p7018
aVOne thing that *does* happen as the government makes it harder for us to save is that some people will inevitably fail in their goal.
p7019
aVThis is unemployment, etc.
p7020
aVPeople that have ended up losing their source of income, their savings, so that other people with tighter controls over their budgets succeed at theirs.
p7021
aV(Basically another way of looking at the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift)).
p7022
aVYou'll know that the public doesn't want more savings when the government tries to push through a pork barrelling budget and yet the deficit doesn't increase.
p7023
aVThink of boom times.
p7024
aVThink of Clinton's surpluses in the US, Howard's in Australia.
p7025
aVWhen the private sector wants to indebt itself, the government's not going to be able to stop it.. just as when the private sector wants to save, the government can't stop it (at least not without damaging the economy).
p7026
aVNow if the government *really* forced the budget to be more deficit, you'd end up with inflationary pressures in much the same way as today trying to *force* the deficit down has lead to an underemployed economy.
p7027
aVEssentially for the currency issuer, if it hurts when it does that, *it should stop doing that*.
p7028
aVBut it'd be inflationary pressures, or, assuming an inflation targeting Bank of England, slightly higher interest rates for *all* in the economy.
p7029
aVIt wouldn't be anything like what you see in Greece/Spain, for what the UK's charged on sterling denominated debt just cannot be divorced from the risk-free rate.
p7030
aV&gt;Also surely this and the presumed increased inflation would then have huge effects on the value of GBP relative to other currencies as well?
p7031
aVIf it hurts when you do that, stop doing that.
p7032
aVThe important thing to do as a currency-issuer is ensure that a shortage of spending of the currency isn't leading to real resources going idle.
p7033
aVIt's mad to force people into involuntary unemployment due to a shortage of spending of pounds.
p7034
aVBut if you've gone beyond that point, if the currency's no longer the constraining factor, feel free to back off.
p7035
aVInflation just costs us all, so there's no point to pushing into it.
p7036
aV&gt; So surely this can't even apply in this country since I thought the bank of england, which is independent,\u000a\u000aUnderstand that a UK sovereign default would wipe out the entire financial sector.
p7037
aVIt'd wipe out all pensions, knock billions off the balance sheets of UK banks, basically everything would go under.
p7038
aVWiping *trillions* off private sector balance sheets would just be catastrophic.
p7039
aVAll lenders have to do is reason that the UK gov't would sooner print than default and it'll never be forced to do either.
p7040
aVThis can easily be shown.
p7041
aVNow the gov't granted the BoE control over the pound, it gave it its charter, it can change these things, and if it came down to changing the charter or having the economy collapse, it absolutely would.
p7042
aVAnd because it *can*, it doesn't actually have to, for lenders will never deny it pounds in the first place.
p7043
aV&gt; I see there's a large section criticising the fundamentals of this theory as well\u000a\u000aAll are very flawed.
p7044
aVIf you'd like me to address any, feel free.
p7045
aVHoly shit what the fuck did I just read.
p7046
aV&gt;"Just print more money, it worked for Rome!
p7047
aV"\u000a\u000aThanks Marx
p7048
aVThat is a really poor response to a detailed post - if it's so ridiculous, tear apart a few of the examples.
p7049
aVyou know thats exactly what we're doing atm right?
p7050
aVread up on quantiative easing. 
p7051
aVQE is over tho.
p7052
aVIf you have the ability to print, you never actually have to.
p7053
aVThink about it.
p7054
aVFor the government to *have* to print, it'd first have to be denied pounds by lenders.
p7055
aVCan you *imagine* a situation where you can borrow pounds but the gov't can't?
p7056
aVWhere a bank can borrow pounds, but won't onsell them to the gov't for risk-free nominal interest to them?
p7057
aVIt can't happen.
p7058
aVIt'd be like Japan running out of yen.
p7059
aVInflation (through printing money) is a stealth tax on the poor, as those with wealth keep it in assets, not cash (and are therefore unaffected by inflation).
p7060
aVWe're facing record low levels of inflation, even deflation for the next few quarters.
p7061
aVWhere is this fear of inflation coming from?
p7062
aVWe're over 2% away from hitting our upper bound of the inflation target.
p7063
aV&gt;Can't balance the books without huge cuts , 13b I believe is the figure Lab would need to make\u000a\u000aI'll just reply with this:  \u000ahttp://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/labour-could-end-cuts-next-year-and-still-meet-deficit-targets-says-ifs

p7066
aV&gt; Min wage to 8.00 by October 2019.
p7067
aVThis isn't really much of an increase, by then the living wage will probably be in the region of 10.00-11.00\u000a\u000aPlease remember that atm inflation is literally 0.\u000a
p7068
aVYou're never going to like everything in a party's manifesto, there's always going to be some bits that make you go "eeeeh..."\u000a\u000aI'm pleasantly surprised by the number of things in this manifesto that are big wins for me.
p7069
aVI was going to vote Labour anyway, but I'll do so with considerably more enthusiasm than expected.
p7070
aVWe'll see what the Conservative manifesto bring, but I think nobody will be able to accuse the two main parties of being the same.
p7071
aVThere are people who'll accuse UKIP and the Green Party of being the same, never mind Labour and the Tories. 
p7072
aVWasn't planning on voting Labour this time but, I must admit, this is ticking a lot of my boxes.
p7073
aVQuite the late resurgence for Labour.
p7074
aVTories must be shitting it.
p7075
aVSame, I'm a natural Lib Dem but in a con/lab swing seat, until about 2 weeks ago I would have given token support to the Libs as I disliked both main parties equally, but I think Labour have won me over enough to vote tactically. 
p7076
aVSee if you can find a Labour supporter in a Lib/Con marginal who will swap their vote with you
p7077
aVI think in this election there is an identifiable major philosophical difference between the parties, Miliband has gone a little more left than most people were expecting him to while still remaining pretty centrist.
p7078
aVTory manifesto soon.
p7079
aVJust you wait.
p7080
aVWait for the IFS costing before deciding. 
p7081
aV&gt;We will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on\u000athe current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the\u000anext Parliament.
p7082
aVWhat do they mean by "a surplus on the current budget"?
p7083
aV'The current budget generally refers to day-to-day government spending but excludes the capital budget, which covers investment in infrastructure projects'
p7084
aVThanks.
p7085
aVSo this could mean extra borrowing for infrastructure projects early in their term, then they'd start paying off the debt after that.
p7086
aV&gt;Raising the minimum wage to more than £8 by the end of 2019\u000a\u000aI agree that the minimum wage does need to increase but I think that would be too steep an increase too fast.
p7087
aVIt would be difficult for some businesses to be able to pay.
p7088
aVI think going up to £7 by the end of 2016, £7.20 by 2017, £7.30 by 2018 and £7.50 by the end of 2019.
p7089
aV&gt;A one-year freeze in rail fares, costing £200m, paid for by delaying upgrades to the A27 and A358 trunk roads.
p7090
aVWhy should people in Sussex and the South West be punished?
p7091
aVAlso, no party seems to be getting the message about rail and travel fares.
p7092
aVKeeping them in line with inflation is no good when people's wages aren't increasing.
p7093
aVRail fares in this country are a joke and they should be making them **FALL**, nothing else.
p7094
aV&gt;Twenty-five hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year olds and a new right to pre and after-school help, paid for by rise in bank levy\u000a\u000aDon't have any children or experience in any of this so can't really comment but if it gives people more quality care for their children then that will be good.
p7095
aV&gt;Freezing gas and electricity bills until 2017, so they can only fall not rise.
p7096
aVSo, he can do this for electricity and gas but not travel?
p7097
aVNot to mention that this won't work.
p7098
aVHow will you freeze them?
p7099
aVWhat level?
p7100
aVHow will you regulate it?
p7101
aVI wouldn't be surprised if companies just up their prices before they frozen and then we're stuck with high prices.
p7102
aVI don't trust Miliband to be someone to be able to tell businesses what to do.
p7103
aV&gt;A £2.5bn fund for the NHS paid for largely by a mansion tax on properties valued at over £2m\u000a\u000aSure, but we should target health tourism as well\u000a\u000a&gt;Scrapping winter fuel payments for the richest pensioners, capping child benefit rises and protecting tax credits.
p7104
aVI agree with this.
p7105
aVIf you have a certain amount and get a certain amount in your pension each month/year then you shouldn't get the benefits that are for people who are hard up.
p7106
aVThey should be entitled for certain things but there has a limit.
p7107
aV&gt;A 50p tax rate on incomes over £150,000 a year and abolishing non-dom status.
p7108
aVRises in VAT and national insurance ruled out.
p7109
aVI don't agree with this.
p7110
aVCorporations should pay more I believe.
p7111
aVIf someone has worked hard to earn their crust to the above amount what would be the incentive if they were to lose 50% of it?
p7112
aVNot to mention that I don't think it will work as they'll find loopholes and ways around it which will take time to chase.
p7113
aV&gt;A cut in university tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000\u000a\u000aI think there should be a reduction - perhaps removal of the cost of accommodation.
p7114
aVI think the £9000 should include that rather than have another cost for that.
p7115
aVMy $0.02
p7116
aV&gt; If someone has worked hard to earn their crust to the above amount what would be the incentive if they were to lose 50% of it?
p7117
aVThey don't; they lose 50% of everything *above* £150k.
p7118
aVBut I don't agree with the policy either. 
p7119
aVYeah, it's 20% to 31,865, 40% to 150,000 and I think 45% on another above that.
p7120
aVI still don't understand why they are so angry about zero hours contracts.
p7121
aVSome people want them, so surely they should be making laws to help people who don't want them get out?
p7122
aVAlso not sure why they haven't backed off the lowering tuition fees when everyone slammed them for it.
p7123
aV&gt; Ensure all young people study English and maths to age 18\u000a\u000aWhy?
p7124
aVMaths post GCSE is very specialised.
p7125
aVEnglish is rather pointless to continue aswell.
p7126
aVOn the whole though I do like most of it.
p7127
aVEspecially the government reforms.
p7128
aVA little too economically authoritarian for me, but thats to be expected.
p7129
aV&gt; I still don't understand why they are so angry about zero hours contracts.
p7130
aVSome people want them, so surely they should be making laws to help people who don't want them get out?
p7131
aVThe plan is to make it so that if you have regular hours in your ZHC then you can have it written into your contract after 12 weeks if you want.
p7132
aVI'm not convinced it will have a huge impact (but obviously for those who want it, it will do).\u000a\u000a
p7133
aVIn practice this means  employers changing your hours every 11 weeks so they don't count as "regular".
p7134
aVOr fuck you off completely.
p7135
aVI've been on one, and it really was shit.
p7136
aVWhen I joined I told them I categorically could not do Tuesdays and Fridays because of uni.
p7137
aVOnly a few weeks there and I'm working a Friday and being told that if I can't find my own cover for it, I have to work it.
p7138
aVI was underworked some weeks and overworked others.
p7139
aVI could make no plans because of fears I'd be working.
p7140
aVThere really was nothing good about it. 
p7141
aVIf you are on a Zero-hours contract they can't make you work any particular shift, since you aren't contracted to do that.
p7142
aVYou should be able to simply refuse.
p7143
aVOf course, if you need to the money then it's not so simple :(
p7144
aVIt could be that the people studying mandatory maths and english are studying different things from the people that selected them, like a literacy/numeracy safety net sort of thing
p7145
aVIt doesn't state if they plan to make English and Maths A-level compulsory or to run new courses alongside A-levels.
p7146
aVI think it's pointless and unfair to force all students to take 2 A-levels and reduce their choice from four to two.
p7147
aVThe second makes more sense, but the extra workload could negatively affect A-level results.
p7148
aVStudents will hate it.
p7149
aVThe simpler solution to me would be to improve Maths and English at secondary level.
p7150
aVIf they're the most essential subjects, why not devote more hours to them and give the students a qualification on a slightly higher level to a GCSE?
p7151
aVIf only it was as simple as some people wanting zero hours contracts.
p7152
aVI was unemployed a couple of years ago and almost every single entry level position I could apply for was zero hours, which was very much not what I wanted at all.
p7153
aV&gt; Also not sure why they haven't backed off the lowering tuition fees when everyone slammed them for it.
p7154
aVPresumably they calculate students will love them for it, and others will be too busy loving/criticising the rest of their policies to complain about it.
p7155
aVI agree with you on the maths front.
p7156
aVI think everyone has a natural level of maths ability they can reach, and for some people this is GCSE level.
p7157
aVSome of my friends found maths really easy, and could whizz through higher problems, whereas others (even pretty intelligent people) took several attempts to pass GCSE.
p7158
aVAdded to the fact that a lot of A and AS level maths is esoteric for most people, I think forcing people to do maths until 18 isn't particularly beneficial, unless they make this compulsory course a lot more applied than the A level maths I took (e.g.
p7159
aVperhaps frame it in the context of the economy and budget management).
p7160
aVHowever, I think English language should be studied to 18, since everyone can make use of improved writing skills later in life, and I don't think there is such a sharp ceiling to English language ability as there is to mathematical ability.
p7161
aVI'd say an A/A* English Language GCSE student has a comfortable grasp of English, not least because it requires a good understanding of grammar and text structure.
p7162
aVTo be honest, there are certain students in my school who aren't able to achieve a C grade in English after, I'm guessing, 7 attempts starting from year 10 to year 12.
p7163
aVIt's embarrassing but I guess some people have different peaks.
p7164
aVForcing them to choose English beyond GCSE is laughable.
p7165
aVI think a better approach to fixing the problem is having a stricter mark scheme and making the C harder to achieve, and then making them retake it if they fail to achieve that grade. 
p7166
aVIn my experience, you'd be surprised at how poor the writing is of some very intelligent people, even those who did well at GCSE.
p7167
aVExamples: one of my friends did really poorly in his literature review project (for chemistry) principally because of poor writing.
p7168
aVHe will have been one of those people who were told that English wasn't important after GCSE because he was going on to do science.
p7169
aVAnother wrote a beautifully emotive and persuasive introduction to a project, but which was totally inappropriate for a scientific text.
p7170
aVAgain, I'd make the English classes focus on more applied work, such as developing writing styles, and understanding how to write in different contexts (this is versus in-depth analysis of literature, although students would be encouraged to read more).
p7171
aVI really don't believe a student can peak at English the same way as in maths, since there are fewer (if any) abstract concepts that may represent an insurmountable conceptual boundary.
p7172
aVA lot of English seems to me to be progressive learning, e.g.
p7173
aVwidening your vocabulary, or picking up different writing motifs (for want of a better word).
p7174
aVIn Scotland, the curriculum says that literacy and numeracy are the responsibility of all teachers, even out with those subjects.
p7175
aVSo, for example, things that you study in Biology should still aim to improve or maintain your numeracy skills.
p7176
aVIt could be a similar idea, which makes more sense than actually forcing students to take the subjects as part of/on top of their A-Levels
p7177
aVI'm not sure about the new laws on domestic and sexual violence.
p7178
aVI'd like to think that these things are already very illegal and that what needs to be done is investment in police training and deployment so that more cases reach the courts in a state where the CPS can do something with them.
p7179
aVI think there could also be squads of detectives trained and managed by the National Crime Agency that could be sent into trouble spots so that they could investigate where the local police don't have the experience (or frankly the tact) to police the situation properly.
p7180
aVBut all that would cost serious money.
p7181
aV&gt; As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional\u000aConvention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.
p7182
aVLabour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions, to represent every part of the United Kingdom, and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber.
p7183
aVI would vote for left-wing parties if they didn't keep trying to push some elected Senate.
p7184
aVI'm not sure where the support for this has come from, the primary benefit the House of Lords gets from being appointed is that they can focus on governing and not party politics or elections.
p7185
aVMore Tory economics and faux progressive social and taxation policies.
p7186
aVSame shit, different guy.
p7187
aVIf Labour were truly progressive they'd end austerity.
p7188
aV&gt; We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto \u000acommitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility at each general election.
p7189
aVThis I like.
p7190
aV&gt;No ethnic minorities shown on their Ed Miliband foreward picture.
p7191
aVLabour have become racist, I cannot vote for them.
p7192
aVHe is an ethnic minority tho.
p7193
aVActually, he's two. \u000a\u000a
p7194
aVA nerd and someone from North London?
p7195
aVThat's what some of the papers are saying, anyway...
p7196
aVSeriously?
p7197
aVIn 2013 UKIP were slated by Channel 4 for not having any ethnic minorities on the front page of their conference brochure.
p7198
aVWhat a racist comment is that!
p7199
aV?
aV*bashes you over the head with it*
p7200
aVWhich was fucking stupid, just as actually expecting having a minority on your manifesto actually means shit.
p7201
aVSure, and that's a bit pants.
p7202
aVI'm more surprised that Spudgunn has seen that, and has said that Labour is racist and will not vote for them.
p7203
aVI mean, there's far better reasons not to vote for a party.
p7204
aVwhoosh
p7205
aVThe Conservative response [seems pretty weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNpiO9onZk).
p7206
aVI assume these are just [driving round and round](https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/587538840405028864) outside.
p7207
aVNice to see Gove's plan to be more unlikable than his wife is going well.
p7208
aVWow, that was surreal. 
p7209
aVGiven Sturgeon's popularity after the leader's debates I think this may well be a way of losing the election for the Tories.
p7210
aVPeople protest manifesto launches now?
p7211
aVChrist that video is terrifying.
p7212
aVLike an episode of Doctor Who...

p7215
aVMeh\u000a\u000a*Ok there's some good stuff in there.
p7216
aVI don't want the rich to be paying a smaller share of their income in tax than the poor, that needs to be addressed if we're going to pretend to have a fair society.
p7217
aVI'm always wary of the old bait-and-switch or whatever with both parties.
p7218
aVFor example "raising" the minimum wage to £8 by 2019?
p7219
aVHmm\u000a\u000aIt looks like they want to move to a baccalaureate system, that's a pretty major tinkering.
p7220
aVI'm of the opinion that we need more consistency in state education, but that's probably a pipe dream.
p7221
aVAccording to the telegraph version:\u000a\u000a&gt; The £200 million cost will be funded by delaying road projects in Somerset and Portsmouth.
p7222
aVand from the manifesto: \u000a\u000a&gt; We will continue to support the construction of High Speed Two, but keep costs \u000adown, and take action to improve and expand rail links across the North to \u000aboost its regional economies.
p7223
aVfor fucks sake.
p7224
aVLet's screw over the south west and its crumbling infrastructure some more because they don't vote Labour, while ploughing ahead with projects for the Labour-leaning north\u000a\u000aStill not voting for those tossers.
p7225
aVThanks OP, was having trouble locating the actual document
p7226
aV[Nick Robinson: "Labour\u2019s manifesto: Is he ready?

aVAre they responsible?

aV"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32288498)
p7229
aV&gt;Even under the triple lock Labour could borrow much more than the Tories (up to £39bn by 2020) and they are not committed to eliminating the deficit by the end of the next Parliament.
p7230
aVSterling work for your Conservative masters, Nicky boy.
p7231
aVI'm sure they'll reward you with a safe seat when your time's up at the beeb.
p7232
aVHow dare he analyse Labour proposals. 
p7233
aVHas he analysed them?
p7234
aVOr has he just said more borrowing is possible by the backdoor?
p7235
aVIs that not analysis?
p7236
aVI mean take the full quote:\u000a\u000a&gt; Even under the triple lock Labour could borrow much more than the Tories (up to £39bn by 2020) and they are not committed to eliminating the deficit by the end of the next Parliament.
p7237
aV&gt; This is because Ed Balls treats investment spending different from day to day spending.
p7238
aVMany economists would say this is very sensible but it is a lot less tough than George Osborne would be and, even, than the Liberal Democrats.
p7239
aVHe's taken the policy (the 'triple-lock'), explained the effect (allows up to £39bn in borrowing by 2020), explained why that's the case (investment spending isn't included) and compared it to other parties' proposals.
p7240
aVThat's exactly what I'd want him to do as the political editor for the BBC.
p7241
aVHe even said "many economists would say this is very sensible" like the Tory bastard he is. 
p7242
aV&gt; explained the effect (allows up to £39bn in borrowing by 2020)\u000a\u000aThat isn't the effect though is it?
p7243
aVThat's a loophole which he says exists, not sourcing it anywhere.
p7244
aVIf you're bandying around a figure of £39bn you need to say where you get that figure from.
p7245
aVEdit: I think I just found the origin of the £39Billion figure from a [ThisIsMoney news story](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-3029102/Who-spend-Labour-Conservative-economic-plans-hold-key-Number-Ten.html) dated 8 April 2015\u000a\u000a&gt;According to analysis of Labour plans by the Treasury, this could mean nearly £140bn of extra borrowing over the course of the next Parliament under Labour, including a deficit of almost £39bn in 2019-20 as opposed to a surplus.
p7246
aVSo the Treasury i.e.
p7247
aVGeorge Osborne has had this £39Billion line that it's been pushing for a week now and Nick has picked it up and run with it.
p7248
aVIf the IFS say *exactly* the same thing with no proviso I promise I'll retract and apologise.
p7249
aVSo he shouldn't scrutinise?
p7250
aVHe's doing his job, the tories will get the same treatment when theirs is out
p7251
aVHe's attacked the single novel innovation and the thing they'll try to sell the whole thing on.
p7252
aVHe's spreading FUD here.
p7253
aV"freeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter"\u000a\u000aThis makes them a no for me.
p7254
aVThis policy is just too economically illiterate.
p7255
aVI assume you feel the same about the Tories promising to freeze train fares? 
p7256
aVFor me that's just a kick in the teeth.
p7257
aVAfter spending the last 5 years hiking them up above inflation, only to now promise that they'll keep them frozen at this high they've created.
p7258
aVI do feel the same way about the Tories promising to freeze train fares... in pretty much exactly the same way Labour are also planning to freeze train fares.
p7259
aVThankfully, rail shortages are less severe than energy shortages.
p7260
aVhttp://labourlist.org/2015/04/labour-announce-a-fully-funded-fare-freeze-in-their-manifesto/\u000a\u000aThe general population seems to believe that you can make everyone have more of everything simply by legislating prices to be low.
p7261
aVThat's why politicians suggest stuff like this; it wins votes.
p7262
aVFinally I have found someone else who agrees that getting involved in free markets is a terrible idea.
p7263
aVWhat's worse is their intention to get involved in private rental agreements, why do they feel they can affect those?
p7264
aV? 
p7265
aVEnergy companies do make ludicrous profits.
p7266
aVAnd any savings they make via oil prices dropping etc are rarely passed onto the consumer.
p7267
aVI was under the impression it was an industry with pretty low margins? 
p7268
aVAnd this means price controls will magically work this time (as opposed to the hundreds of times they have made the problem worse) because...?
p7269
aVPrice controls are already in existence.
p7270
aVBig six energy cartel has a natural monopoly and can set prices at whatever they want.
p7271
aVEnergy is a resource too important to be in private control.
p7272
aV&gt;Price controls are already in existence.
p7273
aVBig six energy cartel has a natural monopoly \u000a\u000aYou got any evidence for this?
p7274
aV&gt;and can set prices at whatever they want.
p7275
aVWhich is the opposite of a price control.
p7276
aVYou contradicted yourself.
p7277
aV[Read this](http://www.standard.co.uk/business/an-electricity-and-gas-price-cartel-why-ofgem-cant-tell-6794661.html)\u000a\u000a[Read this for the solution] (http://reidfoundation.org/portfolio/repossessing-the-future-a-common-weal-strategy-for-community-and-democratic-ownership-of-scotland%E2%80%99s-energy-resources/).
p7278
aV**Article 1**\u000a\u000a&gt;Just because Ofgem says it has found no evidence does not mean a cartel does not exist.
p7279
aVIt also doesn't mean that a cartel does exist.
p7280
aVThere is no evidence in this article to back the idea that a cartel exists.
p7281
aVThe author simply has assumed it is a cartel because feels, and hinted that Ofgem is wrong because he feels it's wrong.
p7282
aVWhere's the fucking evidence of price collusion?
p7283
aV**Article 2**\u000a\u000aThis is irrelevant to the question of whether there is an energy generation cartel.
p7284
aVIt doesn't even mention such a thing.
p7285
aVI like you.
p7286
aVI think it's terrible that labour are going to stand a chance in this election by spouting policies and slogans that appeal to those without an understanding.
p7287
aVFreeze energy prices resonates well with someone who is struggling, I understand that, but they don't see the bigger picture.
p7288
aVScrew the rich is definitely something that resonates well, but you can't just tax the hell out of them either.
p7289
aVIncrease the minimum wage certainly appeals to them, not against an increase but it has to be done very carefully so as not to negatively affect smaller companies and more importantly inflation. 
p7290
aVI wish people would remember that they would have frozen bills at an all time high if they were in power.
p7291
aVThey dont have  a scoobie
p7292
aVGood summary: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/13/labour-election-manifesto-key-points
p7293
aVSeems very solid.
p7294
aVNothing exactly *revolutionary*, but if the IFS can confirm that this is fully costed (and even if it requires a little borrowing I'm okay with that) then I'm very likely to vote Labour.
p7295
aVPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, commenting on Labour\u2019s manifesto launch:\u000a\u000a\u201cLiterally we would not know what we were voting for if we were going to vote for Labour.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IFS says the plans would leave Labour making between £18bn worth of cuts or none at all.
p7296
aVThe electorate may question Labour's Damascene conversion to fiscal prudence if they leave the door open to making no cuts in public spending.
p7297
aV&gt; \u201cLiterally we would not know what we were voting for if we were going to vote for Labour.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo wonder.
p7298
aVIt is typical pre-election pie in the sky nonsense.
p7299
aVWe need change.
p7300
aVNothing will ever be costed if the EU is involved, they haven't signed off their accounts in 19 years with at least £100 billion unaccounted for.
p7301
aVNicely done, bringing in Europe on an unrelated topic.
p7302
aVUKIP's Law: 'All problems can ultimately be reduced down to Brussels and immigration.
p7303
aV'
aV&gt; *UKIP's Law: '~~All~~ Most problems can ultimately be reduced down to ~~Brussels and immigration~~ the EU.
p7304
aV'*\u000a\u000aThe truth hurts.\u000a
p7305
aVNo I'm not really hurting.
p7306
aVYou're not very good at verbal jousting or arguing your point.
p7307
aVIt only hurts if you accept it, clearly you are consciously ignorant of such things.
p7308
aVThat's because I didn't argue my point.
p7309
aVWhen you see through the facade things become significantly clarified and I often forget that a lot of people are blissfully unaware of reality.
p7310
aVMy point is that all these 'pledges' are categorically irrelevant as over the course of the next parliament we will be paying over £260bn in *interest* of our National Debt which will no doubt he heading towards £2trillion.
p7311
aVThis is of course on top of our annual contributions which is increasing rapidly every year and was over £11bn in 2013.
p7312
aVThe fact is this, we will never pay of this debt whilst we are in the EU (or ever to be honest).
p7313
aVThe main parties are pro-EU (they are their paymasters after all) so anything they say is most likely a lie and on the off chance it isn't, it won't make the slightest difference in terms of paying off our debt.
p7314
aVFull stop.
p7315
aVUnrelated?
p7316
aVOur national debt interest is over £1bn a week.
p7317
aVEven if this manifesto *was* costed, over the course of the next parliament we would be paying over £260bn in *interest* of our ND which will be heading towards £2trillion.
p7318
aVWe are in an economic black hole thanks to the EU.
p7319
aVAnything economic in Labour's manifesto is an irrelevance.
p7320
aVI'd like their commitments to balanced budgets and properly costing their spending plans to be bound by legislation.
p7321
aVI dislike their intentions to replace the Lords with a senate (the name is just awful).
p7322
aVTheir devolution plans are a bit to vague at this moment in time.
p7323
aVThe wording doesn't strike me as universal devolution but devolution to a few key (labour loyal) cities.\u000a\u000a
p7324
aV&gt; I dislike their intentions to replace the Lords with a senate (the name is just awful).
p7325
aVIs it just the name that you oppose?
p7326
aVPersonally I think Lords reform is desperately needed, but I would take any commitment with a pinch of salt.
p7327
aVIf you've read Robin Cook's *The Point of Departure* you can see how difficult it is to get Parliament to agree on change that momentous
p7328
aVLargely because the MPs all secretly hope to get a peerage when they leave the Commons
p7329
aVI'd prefer our current system to an elected rubber stamp echo chamber with a daft name.
p7330
aVThe Lords may not work in theory but it does in practice.
p7331
aVI don't see why we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to Lords reform.
p7332
aVAnd the monarchy for that matter.
p7333
aVWhy can't we elect officials called Lords that sit in the House of Lords?
p7334
aVWhy can't we elect a King instead of a president?
p7335
aV&gt; Why can't we elect a King instead of a president?
p7336
aVGod would cry that he doesn't get to pick any more.
p7337
aVGod can get a vote just like everyone else.
p7338
aVThat's how it works already in the current one-man one-vote system.
p7339
aVGod's the man, and he has the vote...
p7340
aV&gt;And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape\u000asuspects have their DNA recorded and stored - Page 53\u000a\u000aSuspects in rape cases now to be treated as criminals.

aVReads like a mills and boon novel.
p7342
aVI'm studying science, where is important to get good at delivering condensed information that's readable so people know what you're on about.
p7343
aVThis manifesto, manifestly fails at that, and I feel sorry for the journalists who are going to have to trawl through this for headlines.
p7344
aVIt's laid out in bullet points.
p7345
aVHow much easier could they make it?
p7346
aVPretty pictures. 
p7347
aVLook again.
p7348
aVBits of it are in bullets.
p7349
aVNot every policy, which makes it a pain to actually get the full picture.
p7350
aVI stand by what I said
p7351
aVFollow the Guardians breakdown with the link I posted. 
p7352
aVIt looks like every section is summarised in bullet points.
p7353
aVCan you give me an example of what policies are not included in the summary?
p7354
aVThe guys just lazy at reading more than a page!
p7355
aVThe key difference is rhetoric.
p7356
aVUsing emotive language is bad writing in science, but parr for the course in a lot of other contexts, particularly persuasive writing.
p7357
aV"delivering condensed information that's readable so people know what you're on about"\u000a\u000aI think a lot of scientific texts fail at this as well, though. 
p7358
aVQuite liking the space they've given to constitutional reform, in particular doing something with the HoL.
p7359
aVI've always though that the HoL was just best abolished and we use a uni-cameral system, but I'd like to hear more about how they'd fill the Senate (PR?
p7360
aV) and what its powers would be.
p7361
aVPage 15 looks like a really shit boy band. 
p7362
aVis it just me or is this littered with punctuation mistakes? 
p7363
aValso:\u000a&gt;Labour will:\u000a\u000a&gt;Invest £2.5 billion more that the Conservatives to recruit 8,000 more GPs,\u000a20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives
p7364
aVIt sounds no different to any other major party manifesto to be honest.
p7365
aVI guess now we have lost control over big important things like law and employment regulations our government is left bickering over small boring issues trying to make them sound big and exciting wile coming up with new buzz words.
p7366
aVAll very safe and "tinkering around the edges".
p7367
aVVery little of actual vision or principle to be found in this document.
p7368
aVDisappointing.
p7369
aVlol what exactly where you expecting?
p7370
aVnationalise the means of production and seize privately owned land?
p7371
aVWouldn't mind a strong program of nationalisation.
p7372
aVI like labour, but this is a 'business as usual' manifesto.
p7373
aVVAT should go down and income taxes need to go up. 
p7374
aV[The Guardians breakdown.
p7375
aV] (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/13/labour-election-manifesto-key-points) Far too many generic policies that they have no hope of successfully implementing.
p7376
aVOf course they want to give 16 year old's the vote.
p7377
aVTheir economic polices are a shambles. 
p7378
aVShambles in what sense?
p7379
aVI see them as helping the workers of Britain get more money n their pockets, helping SMEs grow and building real growth on all levels.
p7380
aVI have to admit I don't like the 50p tax rate and I'm not sure about non-doms.
p7381
aVInsignificant points in the grand scheme of things aren't they though.
p7382
aVThe deficit is £90bn.
p7383
aVThey plan spending increases but their proposals to raise money will raise nothing extra.
p7384
aVSuch as the 50p tax rate and abolishing non-domicile tax status. 
p7385
aVYou're taking a lot for granted in saying neither of those proposals will raise any money.
p7386
aVIt's true that nobody knows how much they will bring in.
p7387
aVNon-dom status could bring in up to 4 billion.
p7388
aV(source: http://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2015/apr/08/how-much-would-ending-non-dom-tax-status-raise-britain).
p7389
aVAs for the 50p tax rate, we still don't know how much money that will raise because it wasn't in place long enough to have an effect (everyone was allowed to defer for 1 year, by which time the Tories had reversed the change).
p7390
aVThe institute for fiscal studies said that restoring the 50p rate would bring in £100m a year.
p7391
aVThat estimate could be incorrect by orders of magnitude and /u/naturalredditor would still be correct to say that it's an ineffective policy.
p7392
aVWait and see.
p7393
aVYou will hear a lot of independent organisations say the exact same thing. 
p7394
aVIFS said non-dom *might* not raise any money.
p7395
aV*Might* not.
p7396
aVThey don't say "won't" or "probably won't".
p7397
aVJust *might*.
p7398
aVAnd when you read it in context, the headline is snipped from a lengthy conversation in which an analyst speculates freely about possible effects, including a dichotomy of worst case and best case scenarios.
p7399
aVAlongside *might* not, he also says *might* raise 1 billion or more.
p7400
aVSource: http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2015/04/ifs-labours-non-dom-policy-might-not-raise-more-revenue/
p7401
aVOh get a grip.
p7402
aVYou say could bring in up to 4 billion.
p7403
aVYeah, but in reality it will be around zero.
p7404
aVThis is meant to be one of their big policies to generate more revenue.
p7405
aVThe other being the top rate of tax.
p7406
aVEven if they do generate revenue, it won't be anywhere near enough. 
p7407
aV&gt; Yeah, but in reality it will be around zero.
p7408
aVHere in reality, we don't like to make claims about things without evidence for them.
p7409
aVDo you have any, or have you just made that up?
p7410
aV*I* don't say it.
p7411
aVI'm providing sources.
p7412
aVAre you saying the Institute for Fiscal Studies should get a grip?
p7413
aVSaying that at the most it could raise that much.
p7414
aVBut in reality it doesn't work out like that.
p7415
aVJust like how France raising income tax didn't work out in such a manor. 
p7416
aVIt's also about direction of travel - If loopholes are being removed, and higher rate of taxation is raised, it sets the stage for more aggressive moves to tackle issues such as abuse of corporation taxation or capital gains vs income taxation, or even genuinely looking to simplify taxation to remove loopholes.
p7417
aVI don't it is  insignificant to cut the starting point of tax to 10p, instead of 20p.
p7418
aVOr building new homes so people can get on the property ladder.
p7419
aVThe economics of the manifesto is to help the working class and provide stability for them.
p7420
aVThe deficit reduction plan is left wanting however, which is a concern.
p7421
aVUseful link.
p7422
aVThanks.
p7423
aV&gt;The next Labour Government will balance the books.
p7424
aVI'm sceptical to say the least.
p7425
aVThe [IFS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11341489/Top-economist-warns-Labour-will-borrow-extra-170-billion.html) doesn't have much faith in Labour's proclamations, and neither does [Lucy Powell](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11502751/We-will-borrow-more-if-we-win-the-election-Labour-admits.html) by the looks of it.
p7426
aV&gt;so that the highest one per cent of earners, with an income of over £150,000, contribute a little more to help get the deficit down\u000a\u000aFor a party committed to generating a strong economy, they sure do like to ignore the [deadweight loss](http://www.nber.org/papers/w5055) of income taxation.
p7427
aVThey'd be much better off progressively raising VAT *if they had to*.
p7428
aV&gt; For example, we will introduce a tax on properties worth over £2 million to help raise the £2.5 billion a year for an NHS Time to Care Fund \u2013 part of our plan to save and improve the health service.
p7429
aVSlapping a tax on something doesn't raise revenue in such a straightforward manner.
p7430
aVThe [CPS](http://www.cps.org.uk/files/factsheets/original/120924143301-somequestionsonthemansiontax.pdf) notes that 33pc of all properties over £2m have been in the same ownership for a decade, meaning the tax could disproportionately harm pensioners.
p7431
aVAnd the nature of the tax--being a wealth tax--makes it incredibly difficult to accurately value and burdens the economy with a deadweight loss significantly higher than other forms of taxation.
p7432
aV&gt;We will not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax or National Insurance.
p7433
aVAm I misunderstanding?
p7434
aVWhat happened to reversing the top-rate cut?
p7435
aV&gt;increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019 \u000a\u000aNo doubt a popular policy, but nonetheless [economically dubious](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663).
p7436
aV&gt;ban exploitative zero-hours contracts\u000a\u000aPointless populist policy.
p7437
aV&gt;guarantee an apprenticeship\u000a\u000aBullshit.
p7438
aV&gt;reduce tuition fees to £6,000 a year\u000a\u000aBad idea.
p7439
aVThe way that repayments are structured means reducing the overall debt burden would disproportionately help the wealthy, not the poor. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p7440
aV&gt; &gt; We will not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax or National Insurance.
p7441
aV&gt; Am I misunderstanding?
p7442
aVWhat happened to reversing the top-rate cut?
p7443
aVThe basic and higher rate refer to the 20% level and the 40% level.
p7444
aVThe current 45% level which they are going to up to 50% is the additional rate.
p7445
aVIt's a bit of a mess of nomenclature (especially if they add the 10% rate back in as well).
p7446
aV&gt;For a party committed to generating a strong economy, they sure do like to ignore the deadweight loss[3] of income taxation.
p7447
aVThey'd be much better off progressively raising VAT if they had to.
p7448
aVI think a progressive consumption tax is unelectable as a policy for any party because explaining the benefits of such an action is too obtuse for the majority of voters (and it will be misinterpreted as an attempt to screw over the poor regardless of how you try and sell it), even though complete removal of income tax and it's replacement with a progressive consumption tax would be a massive improvement.
p7449
aV&gt; Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more\u000amidwives\u000a\u000aYay!
p7450
aV&gt; We will guarantee people a GP appointment within 48 hours\u000a\u000aYay!
p7451
aV&gt; By 2020, patients will\u000await no longer than one week for vital cancer tests\u000a\u000aYay!
p7452
aV&gt; we will ensure the NHS is protected from the TTIP treaty\u000a\u000aYay!
p7453
aV---\u000a\u000aToo bad it's riddled with other expensive false promises, some of which go too far, some of which fall drastically short.
p7454
aVNot awful though. 
p7455
aV&gt;&gt; Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more\u000amidwives\u000a\u000a&gt;Yay!
p7456
aVI've always wondered laps up this shit.
p7457
aVwhy do you support national  level politicians making recruitment decisions for  specific operational staff in the nhs?
p7458
aVIf some hospitals want more nurses, then great..
p7459
aVBut there is no point in ed sending them a dozen extra nurses if the hospital actually needs a new xray machine.
p7460
aVI'd respect a simple funding pledge far more than this patronising headline-baiting bollocks. 
p7461
aVThey don't literally assign them hospitals to work at.
p7462
aVThey are making them available for those hospitals that do need them (and there are many of those).
p7463
aVAnd of course the hospitals spend their money on what they want - say a new X ray machine - but Labour are simply pledging more staff which *are* definitely required in case you didn't know. 
p7464
aVPeople seem to forget that downvotes are meant for posts that add nothing to conversation.
p7465
aVFor the most part, the sub has a mentality of "Downvote anything that I disagree with, and visa versa.".
p7466
aVOn the contrary, upvotes should be given to posts that bring up new arguments, or engage in the discussion. 
p7467
aVI agree.
p7468
aVI think a lot of debate subs would be better if they had the downvote removed.
p7469
aVIt creates less of a circle jerk for what ever is popular at the time.
p7470
aVI think I've seen some pretty good discussions on this sub, and it's nice that it's only really bigotry that gets notably downvoted. 
p7471
aVtheres a policy on r/syriancivilwar of no cheerleading thay I think would work very well on this sub.
p7472
aVE.g people saying "fucking tories", "Cant barrage the farage" or "labour = paedophile party" etc.
p7473
aVThis wastes everyones time and lowers the tone of discussion.
p7474
aVThere is also a strictly enforced rule against personal attacks as well.
p7475
aVAgain a lot of the time people come on here and call everything to the left of hitler "leftist scum" etc.
p7476
aVThis would also raise the tone with deletion of time wasters.
p7477
aVOther than that I think its a good thing that UKIP supporters are as vocal as others.
p7478
aVBut I remember a guy saying I should be executed for treason for being not anti-EU which is a classic example of internet craziness one wouldnt say that in real life to a family member or friend who held a different opinion.
p7479
aVSure, I'd be in favour of those suggestions, definitely.
p7480
aVSo long as we arn't policing explicit language, or tone?
p7481
aVI'm all for coming down on those that waste our time by using the examples you've given.
p7482
aVI think people should have a right to call me a cunt, or tell me that my views are abhorrent.
p7483
aVOr use snidey jabs and a condescending attitude.
p7484
aV(I fucking haaaaate this).
p7485
aVIt's just a waste of time, but I feel that people should be free to express that view.
p7486
aVIf the post doesn't go on to explain WHY, or give reasons?
p7487
aVShoot the fucker down.
p7488
aVI'd be happy to see all 1-liner "I love your views" and "I hate your views" comment downvoted to oblivion.
p7489
aVThey add nothing to the conversation, either way.
p7490
aVI think you touched on a broader and bigger problem with the whole "leftist scum" and "tory pricks" etc.
p7491
aVJust tribal in-group out-group bullshit.
p7492
aVS'why I don't understand tying myself to any group.
p7493
aVI'll vote for a party, sure.
p7494
aVBut each one has it's flaws.
p7495
aVAttaching a sense of identity to one will only increase biases and cloud judgement.
p7496
aVYeah I dont care about rude words or tone etc but its when people just blindly shout their sides line and clearly arent discussing that it becomes a waste of time.
p7497
aVWhile its obvious that people who start insulting personally have lost any argument they still waste time and lower the tone.
p7498
aVThere are a lot of Kippers *and* a lot of anti-kippers that do a lot of downvoting here.
p7499
aVI've made very similar comments in two different threads, been downvoted in one, and upvote in the other.
p7500
aVNo point moaning about it.
p7501
aVJust sort by New, and you can largely negate the effect. 
p7502
aVYup, me too.
p7503
aVI've said similar things and been voted up or down dependant on time of day, who saw it first, etc, just like a lot of Reddit.
p7504
aVI actually think we're fairly balanced around here and though I don't always agree with everyone (nor should I), I'm proud that we have a 'safe space' (!
p7505
aV) where all can air their views and be responded to.\u000a\u000a
p7506
aVIf it was a safe space then people would not be getting down voted for a different view, it should be used for people not contributing to the conversation. 
p7507
aV&gt; it should be used for people not contributing to the conversation.
p7508
aVYeah except barely anyone follows reddiquete and they won't follow it so just get on with it, shall we?
p7509
aVThat's a fair point, I've wondered if reddit should change the up voting rules or just remove the downvote button altogether. 
p7510
aVI know /r/casualconversation did something like this where they removed the downvote button, something like that would be nice here but I can imagine there would be issues.
p7511
aVYea as far as I'm aware the best you can do is hide it, and whenever a sub I frequent does this I just unhide it.
p7512
aVI think it would definitely be a good idea for Reddit 
p7513
aVI get the gist of what you're saying, but I meant that you won't get banned for it or consistently downvoted every time (unless you really are just a racist or something)
p7514
aV&gt;I don't always agree with everyone\u000a\u000aThat's how you know it's balanced.
p7515
aVI swear the point where I'm surrounded by people that only agree with me I start to get a little worried.
p7516
aVA shame how so many on the UK subs would see that as the perfect scenario
p7517
aVExactly.
p7518
aVDiscussions amongst people who choose to debate politics over the internet will inevitably centre on the 'extremes'.
p7519
aVMost people are relatively centrist, and don't particularly care to debate politics online.
p7520
aVTherefore, we see Reddit skew itself towards the "far right" (r/Libertarian and r/Conservative) and the "far left" (r/socialism and r/communism).
p7521
aVTo a lesser extent on UK focused subreddits, we have both a lot of Greens and a lot of UKIP supporters.
p7522
aVBy contrast, we have a disproportionately small number of Labourites/Tories.
p7523
aVPersonally, I'm fine with this sub skewing *very slightly* right wing, because r/UnitedKingdom is horrendously left wing to the extent that almost anyone conservative or pro-capitalist or religious is shouted down by the hivemind.  
p7524
aVI feel I can agree here.
p7525
aVThis sub does get a lot of extreme views and UKIP articles, but you make one comment that isn't "punish rich people" on the UK sub and you will get a lot of incoming hate.
p7526
aVMassive hyperbole right here.
p7527
aVHe's got a point though, many on /r/unitedkingdom would make the poor were poorer as long as the rich were less rich.
p7528
aVThe politics of envy are strong there.
p7529
aVI know what you mean on the small number of labourites/Tories.
p7530
aVAs somebody who actually quite likes Cameron and Osborne I regularly read the comments in this sub and just despair.
p7531
aVOn the flip side I've read the transcripts of Natalie Bennett's and Nigel Farage's speeches from the past week and I find myself wondering how people end up disliking other sections of the same society so much that they would throw their lot in with these half formed ideas.
p7532
aVIt's concerning to say the least.
p7533
aVNatalie Bennett and the greens hardly attack LibLabCon to the degree that UKIP do...
p7534
aVI wasn't talking about them attacking LibLabCon, I was thinking more of the actual policies and ideas they have been discussing.
p7535
aVCan you elaborate?
p7536
aVI'm not sure what you mean.
p7537
aV&gt; Personally, I'm fine with this sub skewing very slightly right wing, because r/UnitedKingdom is horrendously left wing to the extent that almost anyone conservative or pro-capitalist or religious is shouted down by the hivemind.
p7538
aVI agree.
p7539
aVA few weeks ago I submitted an AMA thread on /r/unitedkingdom as someone who is quite liberal and a slightly left-leaning member of UKIP, and who disagrees with several of their policies.
p7540
aVI thought it would be an interesting discussion to have but it turned into abuse within minutes.
p7541
aVIt got so bad that I had no choice but to delete the entire thread.
p7542
aVPeople see UKIP and they instantly think "racist", thanks to a small number of former UKIP idiots who talk nonsense on Twitter.
p7543
aVShame.
p7544
aVIt isn't downvotes that make somewhere 'hostile to debate'.
p7545
aVThis sub has a strong UKIP presence, but it's still much more open to debate than most political places on the net, which are all too often just circle-jerks.
p7546
aVI agree.
p7547
aVAnd actually a lot of Green posts *are* upvoted here.
p7548
aVI find bigotry is generally downvoted regardless of political slant, whereas r/uk is much more partisan.  
p7549
aVAt certain times of the year /r/unitedkingdom may as well be a RSS feed from the Grauniad.
p7550
aVI find bigotry is quite often heartily upvoted on this sub, but then downvoted at other times.
p7551
aV&gt;I find bigotry is quite often heartily upvoted on this sub\u000a\u000aI'd like to see what your definition of bigotry is.
p7552
aVA lot of people have a really loose definition that can encompass almost anything.
p7553
aV*My* definition would be broadly the same as most people, though it's not always clear cut, it's often veiled, and we could argue all day about what counts as islamophobia, racism, sexism...
p7554
aVIn a sense it can simply mean intolerance of different views.
p7555
aVSometimes there is no mistaking it though.
p7556
aV&gt;could argue all day about what counts as islamophobia, racism, sexism\u000a\u000aExactly, so it's often not constructive to suggest someone is a bigot unless you can actually prove it. \u000a
p7557
aVI tend to see it as the sorts of views that are symptomatic of people that have a fear or dislike of the usually targeted groups
p7558
aVSure.
p7559
aVI tried to write a reply about the types and levels of bigotry we see around here, but it was turning into an essay.
p7560
aVThe word has changed (probably due to the filter bubble that is Twitter) to mean anybody deemed "not wholeheartedly committed to the progressive SJ agenda". 
p7561
aVI feel the problem here is the massive support for radical parties, UKIP and the Greens are both on the far side of the political spectrum in opposite directions, so it makes for hostile debating because both sides couldn't be more different.
p7562
aVActually you know a lot of the time all you need to do (actual policies aside) is switch around the words "racist" and "immigrant" and they're pretty similar.
p7563
aVHa, yeah, they say the same thing about fascists and communists being pretty similar aswell, I guess that's why people say the political spectrum is like a cylinder than a square.
p7564
aVAt the end of the day, if you take your idea of what is right, ignore everyone else's wants, needs and opinions.
p7565
aVRun with it and try force everyone else to go along with it because it's what you want, you're always going to be a certain type of person.
p7566
aVEventually the details i.e Muslims should have less of X, or men should have more of Y and so on are actually pretty arbitrary and insignificant.
p7567
aVThe methods and mindset are almost totally identical. 
p7568
aV18 months ago this sub may as well have been called "r/Left-Labour" and in 18 months it'll probably be "r/Green" or something.
p7569
aVIt's the ebb and flow of political life and there is no reason to get butt hurt about it.
p7570
aVJust keep fighting for what you believe in. 
p7571
aV&gt;butt hurt\u000a\u000a\u0ca0_\u0ca0\u000a\u000aThe worst of all Americanisms.
p7572
aVYou do the math\u000a
p7573
aVArsesore
p7574
aVOndbrifo
p7575
aVYes.
p7576
aVSomebody has been offended or hurt so let's use a homophobic slur to characterise them as weak.
p7577
aVHow is that now part of adult discourse on a political discussion board?
p7578
aV&gt; homophobic slur\u000a\u000aIt's a childish insult but lets not resort to shrill pearl clutching.
p7579
aVSit back down in your chair and relax.
p7580
aVThanks for giving such a great example of the petulant 14-year-old /pol/ bullshit that's so prevalent on here.
p7581
aV"Shrill pearl clutching" FFS.
p7582
aV*sigh*\u000a\u000aYou are literally getting upset over someone(possibly a child like you said) using the word "butthurt".
p7583
aVGet a grip on reality man.
p7584
aVOr switch off the computer and go outside, because you're not ready for the internet yet.
p7585
aVAnd now the "no, you're upset" line.
p7586
aVSuch utter bullshit, take it back to 4chan.
p7587
aVWords fail me.
p7588
aVCome on, I'm all for tackling bigotry but the biggest problem facing the social justice movement is muppets who see bigotry where there is none and go apeshit at the drop of a hat.
p7589
aVUsing the term butthurt does not make someone a homophobe, hating gay people makes somebody a homophobe.

aVYou can try and implement a real-life version of Newspeak but that's not going to tackle the cause of bigotry, just the symptom.
p7591
aVYea, in hindsight, sorry for that.
p7592
aVThe original rationale for the choice was a function of the OPs username and my also wanting to imply it was a slightly petulant internet first world problem. 
p7593
aVYo dude, like, whatever man.
p7594
aVPeace out, fam.
p7595
aV&gt;The worst of all Americanisms\u000a\u000aAmericanaphobe racist pig.
p7596
aVI hate porkist's like you.
p7597
aVSwine.
p7598
aVProbably the answer I like the most.
p7599
aVI'm new to this sub and just wanted to start a conversation and maybe get people to think before downvoting someone just because they disagree with them. 
p7600
aV[deleted]
p7601
aVI'll be honest here, if downvotes aren't your thing, this probably isn't going to be a sub you enjoy.
p7602
aVPolitics is divisive, subjectively, pretty much everyone else is wrong in our opinions.
p7603
aVPersonally I just say what I think and let the hate rain down, at least I made people think.
p7604
aVYour thread currently has over 150 upvotes, and you're still pretending to be opressed?
p7605
aVHahaha I wasn't 'pretending'.
p7606
aVI just gave my opinion with a snappy title and it's got a lot of attention.
p7607
aVIt's also sparked debate and hopefully encouraged people to be downvote others less :). 
p7608
aVAlso, how can you honestly think this sub might as well be called "UKIP politics" when none of the top rated threads for the month are about UKIP?
p7609
aVhttp://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/top/\u000a\u000aThe first one that even appears on the page is anti-UKIP.
p7610
aVBecause some days half the submissions are about UKIP.
p7611
aVYou should know that, you submit a good chunk of them.
p7612
aV:P 
p7613
aVIt's an unwritten law of Reddit those who complain about downvotes are downvoted into oblivion.
p7614
aVGet a grip mate, it's only fake Internet points.
p7615
aV &gt;it's largely pointless to post unless you are pro-UKIP as you get downvoted into oblivion.
p7616
aVWhat an absolute load of bollocks.
p7617
aV[Look at the top posts of this month.
p7618
aV](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/top/?sort=top&amp;t=month) Nothing is specifically 'pro-UKIP' and the fifth highest post is some picture making fun of something an obscure UKIP candiate said.
p7619
aVYou're just imagining things.
p7620
aVThe UKIP presence in this sub is larger than in others, but they don't by any measure dominate the place.
p7621
aVThis is the strongest evidence, the only people who think this subreddit is a "ukip circlejerk" are those who just hate UKIP having any amount of support whatsoever.
p7622
aVNo, but you're one of the biggest UKIP shills on here.
p7623
aVYou're not helping the subreddit be fair and representative when you flood it with Farage daily.
p7624
aVThere's a big difference between posting useful content, and endlessly spamming one viewpoint.
p7625
aVThere have been days when I've looked at the sub's front page and near half of the threads have been in some way related to either Nigel Farage, UKIP, or anti-immigration topics.
p7626
aVIt's tedious and boring.
p7627
aVYou're more than welcome to post other things that interest you.
p7628
aVWhat I post is well within the rules of the subreddit.
p7629
aVAbsolutely.
p7630
aVI'm not saying you can't do what you do.
p7631
aVBut there's a difference between posting within the rules and posting with good practice for the health of the sub.
p7632
aVIt sometimes seems like you take advantage of the fact that non-UKIP users tend to be less vocal on this subreddit lately.
p7633
aVIn an ideal world, everybody would post constantly from all aspects of the political spectrum.
p7634
aVBut they don't.
p7635
aVSo I feel like it's worth cutting back on UKIP posts to better reflect how UK politics actually are.
p7636
aVThat's just my opinion of course; you're obviously free to post how you like.
p7637
aVI don't think the mods should take extra steps to do anything about this.
p7638
aVIt's just my feelings about your posting style.
p7639
aVWhat a silly opinion.
p7640
aVIf you're unhappy that /u/ProfessorZ00M is posting stuff about UKIP a bit more frequently than about other parties and it gets you so butthurt that you have to request to him to cut back on his UKIP posts then post some of your own articles!
p7641
aVAlternatively, don't come on the sub!
p7642
aVSimple :)
p7643
aVI do post some of my own articles.
p7644
aVAnd I'm perfectly entitled to be unhappy about over-posting of certain political views that distorts the subreddit from that of an accurate representation of the wider userbase belief demographics.
p7645
aV&gt;Alternatively, don't come on the sub!
p7646
aVYes, everyone unhappy about the overabundance of UKIP content should just leave.
p7647
aVThat *definitely* wouldn't turn this into a massive UKIP circlejerk.
p7648
aVWe all want happy times on the subreddit - or at least as happy as a politics subreddit can be.
p7649
aVI'm just not so sure some of the UKIP brigading we've seen lately will get us there.
p7650
aVBut then this is the internet, so we can all do as we please!
p7651
aV&gt; Yes, everyone unhappy about the overabundance of UKIP content should just leave\u000a\u000aI did not suggest you should leave.
p7652
aVI suggested that if you don't want to post your own articles but you are going to complain about there being too many UKIP articles or that there is a UKIP circlejerk, which quite frankly I completely disagree on, then you should leave.
p7653
aVPlease don't twist my words.
p7654
aVYou think that anybody who doesn't post on a subreddit but is unhappy with the state of a subreddit should leave?
p7655
aVThat's similar to making the argument that anybody that doesn't vote in the elections but is unhappy with the state of politics shouldn't be able to have an opinion on the state of politics.
p7656
aV&gt; You think that anybody who doesn't post on a subreddit but is unhappy with the state of a subreddit should leave?
p7657
aVNo, I am saying that anybody who is unhappy with the state of a subreddit but does nothing to try and change it besides complain about circlejerk and bias should shut up or leave.
p7658
aVBut many users read Reddit but don't post.
p7659
aVPassively interacting with Reddit is a perfectly legitimate usage of the site.
p7660
aVWhy can't they have an opinion?
p7661
aVThat's akin to saying 'if you don't like what's happening in government, do more politically.
p7662
aVBecome a campaigner etc.
p7663
aV' But that's not always what people want to do, and that's okay.
p7664
aVSome people just want to view a balanced subreddit.
p7665
aVThat's all I'm getting at here.
p7666
aV&gt; Why can't they have an opinion?
p7667
aVThey of course can!
p7668
aVBut no-one will know about it if they don't post it, and so nothing would change!
p7669
aV&gt; That's akin to saying 'if you don't like what's happening in government, do more politically\u000a\u000aYes, it is, because that's exactly what I am trying to say! 
p7670
aVCalm your tits Adolf.
p7671
aVWho are you to tell this guy he can't express his displeasure about something on this subreddit?
p7672
aVHmm... sounds a bit like bloody political correctness gone mad it does.
p7673
aVCan't even complain anymore or the Ukip PC Brigade will get you!
p7674
aVThat's a strawman.
p7675
aVI didn't say he can't complain about the subreddit.
p7676
aVI said if he is *only* going to complain without actively trying to change things then he should leave.
p7677
aVAgain, don't twist my words.
p7678
aVOr compare me to Hitler.
p7679
aVOr claim I am in a Ukip PC Brigade when I do not support UKIP nor did anything I said have to do with political correctness.
p7680
aV&gt;I said if he is only going to complain without actively trying to change things then he should leave.
p7681
aVWhy would you say that when, literally, the comment you were replying to he demonstrated he does actively try to change things.
p7682
aVAnd you've got the front to say I'm making a strawman?
p7683
aVHis comment certainly demonstrated that, yes.
p7684
aVHis post history however did not because he has only made 2 posts here all year.
p7685
aVIt was not a strawman. 
p7686
aVSpeaking of post history.
p7687
aVIs it not strange that you've you've made nearly 90 comments all in defence or support of Ukip in the last thirty days yet... you don't support Ukip?
p7688
aVWhy not just be honest.
p7689
aVNope, I do not support UKIP, I am just against the mass immigration and they are the only proper party that wants to properly control immigration.
p7690
aVMainly I find myself defending them if someone is being ignorant and claiming they are racist, etc.
p7691
aVYou don't like UKIP, fine, I disagree with them on many things.
p7692
aVBut don't write them off as racist when they are not, that is very silly in my opinion.
p7693
aVWhy is immigration such a big issue for you though?
p7694
aVYou know, just stepping back and taking some perspective on all the things that need fixing socially economically and politically, immigration is such a non-issue.
p7695
aVSo it's really difficult not to wonder where these people are coming from when their main political thrust is hinged on this one issue and blaming immigrants for the vast majority of societies woes.
p7696
aVIt's like, you know how there's a problem in some places with Grey Squirrels?
p7697
aVWell imagine if there was a guy who ran on a platform of curtailing Grey Squirrels, but he *always* talked about Grey Squirrel; seemingly disproportionately to the impact they were actually having on society.
p7698
aVPeople would question him on the economy and he would respond with examples of how the Grey Squirrels are having a negative impact.
p7699
aVThey'd ask him about healthcare and he'd talk about how the Grey Squirrels are a burden.
p7700
aVPeople would ask about crime and it would elicit a response about Grey Squirrels in some way.
p7701
aVIt's always the Grey Squirrels.
p7702
aVPeople would rightly, I think, assume that this guy has some serious issues with Grey Squirrels. 
p7703
aV&gt; Why is immigration such a big issue for you though?
p7704
aVWhy are you assuming I think it is such a big issue?
p7705
aVIt is not the biggest issue in my eyes whatsoever, but it *is* an issue.
p7706
aVYou cannot claim it is a non-issue when Lib-Lab-Con all agree net migration must come down and it causes or aggravates issues.
p7707
aV&gt; It's like, you know how there's a problem in some places with Grey Squirrels?
p7708
aV...... People would rightly, I think, assume that this guy has some serious issues with Grey Squirrels.
p7709
aVOK, that was a really stupid and biased allegory for starters.
p7710
aVBut to say that people who think mass-immigration is an issue all have issues with immigrants themselves is not only massively stupid but also quite dangerous as it allows the opinion that mass-immigration is an issue to simply be dismissed as racist and as bigotry and stops for any proper debate over an actual issue to be had, censorship almost.
p7711
aVWith regard to the suggestion that *all* people who think immigration is a problem are racist I would disagree.
p7712
aVAnd from the fact that you think that's the argument I'm making I don't think you've quite grasped the point I'm trying to make.
p7713
aVFirstly let's be frank here.
p7714
aVUkip supporters *do* think immigration is a big issue and it's clearly the *most important* issue to them.
p7715
aVI mean right or wrong do we at least agree on that?
p7716
aV&gt; I don't think you've quite grasped the point I'm trying to make.
p7717
aVWell I do apologise for that but maybe next time you are trying to drive a point across, don't do it in an allegory about grey squirrels.
p7718
aV&gt; it's clearly the most important issue to them.
p7719
aVI mean right or wrong do we at least agree on that?
p7720
aVA big issue to them, yes.
p7721
aVIt's all you hear Farage talk about most of the time which I think is quite a shame.
p7722
aVBut it's not the most important.
p7723
aVWe'll say 2nd most important, after leaving the EU.
p7724
aVUKIP is after all a euroskeptic party that was founded as a party whose main goal was to leave the EU.
p7725
aVWhen it was first founded they didn't have an immigration policy as far as I know because it wasn't an issue then. 
p7726
aVCan anyone make a pie chart or something?
p7727
aVI set the homepage to 'sort by new' and in the most recent 50 posts only about 7 were UKIP/Farage.
p7728
aVThere are lots of UKIPers here but then it suits reddits demographics, there are a lot of greens too.
p7729
aVFor what its worth I am strongly left wing and anti-ukip and I don't see this sub as being particularly biased.
p7730
aVIf anything the bias on this sub is anti-establishment, but again reddit is mostly made up of young white men so that isn't surprising. 
p7731
aVI've just been to /r/unitedkingdom,  I don't tend to bother, just to check-up, and what did I find?
p7732
aVA pro-Labour circle-jerk, you may be comfortable there.
p7733
aVYou may not like ukpolitics having a Tory/UKIP presence, but they're welcome here.
p7734
aVUKIP are so frequently attacked, supporters where hard hats and are constantly ready for attacks, hence the voting battles have become partisan.
p7735
aVThe attacks will become less frequent after the election, this'll allow things to settle down a bit.
p7736
aVThis place is way better than /r/uk.
p7737
aVBlame the r/unitedkingdom mods.
p7738
aVThey banned all UKIP supporters to here. 
p7739
aVReally?
p7740
aVDo you have proof?
p7741
aVI don't mean to sound contradictory, I'm just trying to be objective.
p7742
aVAnyway, perhaps this subreddit might benefit from the lack of a downvote button.
p7743
aVGive it a week, maybe, see what happens.
p7744
aVThere was a period a while ago where the mods thought they had a brigading problem centered around UKIP and other "right wing" political views, and went very heavy handed on the moderation, resulting in a temporary swing in the other direction.
p7745
aVThe problem was that temporary swing became partly ingrained and now the uk subs have quite different makeups, UK being mostly center left and UKpol being polarised between right and left.
p7746
aVThe ukip supporters could help fix the problem by visiting both subs, but quite often things just end up breaking down into arguments and each side gets more firmly entrenched.
p7747
aVIt kind of came because /pol/ did actually start brigading this sub and UK.
p7748
aVEveryone in the brigade supported UKIP and were extremely racist to boot.
p7749
aVThe mods were a little heavy handed in their response, but the brigade did exist. 
p7750
aVI'm a bit careful about saying what was and was not brigading.
p7751
aVIt definitely existed to a point, but not all the stuff that was hit was.
p7752
aVThis isn't true.
p7753
aVThe subs used to be extremely left wing before the brigading.
p7754
aVIf anything it's got better.
p7755
aVI got downvoted for suggesting that no one was forcing us to be monarchists.
p7756
aVAs if yes, someone is...jeez...
p7757
aVIt's widely known and has been discussed in various threads which are usually deleted.
p7758
aVThere certainly were a few posters who banged the UKIP drum night and day.
p7759
aVThey reflected poorly on both themselves and the rest of UKIP.
p7760
aVBeing a UKIP supporter does not in itself get you banned, other than in the minds of such people. 
p7761
aVWhat happened was the mods of r/uk are not UKIP supporters and were worried about the increase of UKIP support on the sub.
p7762
aVThey then decided to ban UKIP supporters but allow them to post on the much smaller r/ukpolitics sub as they also controlled it and didn't want to enable the creation of an alternative UK sub which wasn't hostile to UKIP supporters. 
p7763
aVNo it wasn't that's not what happened at all.
p7764
aVWhat happened was /pol/ started brigading the shit out of /r/uk and /r/ukpolitics and a bunch of them got banned for doing it, not only from the mods but also from the Reddit admins who can see things like IP's and know when people are brigading or using alt accounts.
p7765
aVThen /pol/ went to shit so a bunch of people stayed here but don't like to admit it and make up this lie about 'hurr baned 4 suprting ukip'.
p7766
aVThat Bulldog user himself even admitted before that he got banned for using alts when he used to complain that he was 'banned for supporting UKIP' also.
p7767
aVNo one buys that story other than UKIPpers and the horde of 'new users who just stumbled on /r/ukpoltics innocently'.
p7768
aVbulldog got banned because he had to keep creating alts in order to post on r/uk as they kept banning him for making UKIP related posts.
p7769
aVIts a sly tactic isn't it?
p7770
aVBan someone for making UKIP related posts and then get the admins to perma-ban them when they create a new account to get around the ban.
p7771
aVThe whole 4chan raid excuse was mostly a ruse to enable them to ban UKIP supporters.
p7772
aVAnyone who expressed support for UKIP they put a lock on.
p7773
aVThey banned people for using the phrase "cultural enrichment" and crap like that. 
p7774
aVYeah, we also banned a load of people.
p7775
aVUntil May 2014 the automoderator list was largely centered around banning one mad Scottish guy.
p7776
aVIn August 2014 we were pushing over 100 bans and 100 names in auto-moderator. 
p7777
aVThat mad Scottish guy **really** hates me.
p7778
aVI'm way beyond hating him back and I'm now concerned for his mental health :/
p7779
aVWho is this mad Scottish guy?
p7780
aVWhy would Bulldog be banned though?
p7781
aVIn my experience, he was never abusive and seemed pretty polite, though I conceded I might have missed something as I am not here every day.
p7782
aVThere are people who behave appallingly on here that are tolerated, I have just PMd you with an example of the kind of harassment that continues unabated on here.
p7783
aVWhy would you shadowban with Auto mod instead of just banning them?
p7784
aVIf you ban someone they know they are banned, so they just register another account.
p7785
aVIf you shadow ban someone and occasionally downvote them, they can literally spend months posting away to no one. 
p7786
aVThe /pol/ raid wasn't a ruse at all.
p7787
aVThere's whole archives full of brigading posts on /pol/ along with tons of screenshots that were took when they were raiding.
p7788
aVThere's 0 point in even trying to deny it, like I said literally no one buys your story about "Admins and Mods trying to destroy UKIP" other than UKIPPers and the people who are brigading anyway. 
p7789
aVYep, documented by people who are just as bad as them who set up shit like badukpolitics. 
p7790
aVReddit admins don't allow vote brigading, though.
p7791
aVPosts on /r/badukpolitics and so on are always no-participation links.
p7792
aVIt's completely different to the /pol/ downvoting/"can't barrage the Farage"/etc.
p7793
aVspam.
p7794
aVWhy even bother to defend them?
p7795
aVThe admins aren't trying to destroy UKIP and I never said that.
p7796
aVI imagine they couldn't give a crap just like they don't give a crap why mods ban people from subs.
p7797
aVWhat they do care about is people trying to get around the bans.
p7798
aVMods can go cry to admins over users creating new accounts to get around their bans and admins will attempt to deal with it.
p7799
aVAnd yes, the mods on r/uk used a few throw-away posts on /britpol/ calling people to raid r/unitedkingdom (which had about as much weight as a call to raid somewhere on here) as a ruse to ban large numbers of people who expressed support for UKIP, so much so that a large increase in permanent UKIP support has been noticed on this sub. 
p7800
aVbrit/pol/*
p7801
aVBulldog got banned because he was using multiple alts to upvote posts that he created in attempt to push them up the page.
p7802
aVIt's exactly the sort of thing we don't want. 
p7803
aVNot true.
p7804
aVHe created alts to post in /r/uk after he was unjustly banned from there.
p7805
aV*he*?
p7806
aVCome on bulldog, stop pretending
p7807
aVWhat utter balls.
p7808
aVHe was banned for making a pain in the arse of himself.
p7809
aVI love this Victim mentality you all fall into when you get caught.
p7810
aVIts almost like you guys have a playbook..What you really dont like about r/uk is that people pull you up on your dodgy figures and complete lack of facts, your distortions and general nonsense.
p7811
aVLast time I looked that was being Pro Truth not Anti UKIP, although it seems to amount to the same thing.
p7812
aVThis is extremely disingenuous flappybored.
p7813
aVYou're better than this.
p7814
aV&gt; No one buys that story other than UKIPpers and the horde of 'new users who just stumbled on /r/ukpoltics innocently'.
p7815
aVYou say this often yet NEVER provide evidence.
p7816
aVI mean, how did *you* 'stumble' across ukpol?
p7817
aVWhy is it that you are here with good intentions but others (who coincidentally hold different opinions to yourself) aren't?
p7818
aVYou sound like a paranoid madman and utterly incapable of removing motive from any inquiry, if I am honest.
p7819
aVNot everything is a fucking conspiracy.
p7820
aVYou're already onto your third account?
p7821
aVJesus what happened to other 2?
p7822
aVI believe this is his 6th actually!
p7823
aV/u/SinghaleseTerrier received -90\u000a\u000a/u/SinghaleseTerrier2 recevied -65\u000a\u000aViews the left disagree with and who - with reactionary zeal - will downvote, gets you removed whilst the infamous Cybernats -who crop up on here - calling everybody 'cunts', are tolerated.
p7824
aVAsked Ivashkin to sort it out, lets see what he says.
p7825
aVWhat do you mean by 'sort it out'?
p7826
aVYour views aren't the main reason you get downvoted, I don't know any other person on here with similar views who has been downvoted so much they're on their 6th account.
p7827
aVYeah, even bulldog's on his 4th or 5th (not counting voting accounts.
p7828
aVHe should stand for Tower Hamlets)
p7829
aVplus bulldog was banned by mods/admins, not because he annoyed people to the point of getting downvoted so much that his accounts last less than a week\u000a\u000aedit: at this point this pretty much sums up terrier's attitude: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAuR5bkIlQ
p7830
aVBrilliant.
p7831
aVYeah, sometimes the common denominator is a little closer to home. 
p7832
aVBut when we call people cunts it's charming.
p7833
aVMake some posts supporting UKIP in /r/UK.
p7834
aVSee how long you last.
p7835
aVYou don't even need to go as far as UKIP, last time I mentioned I'm economically Tory I got called "Fucking Tory Scum" and downvoted into oblivion.
p7836
aVFucking Tory Scum.
p7837
aVHere, have an upvote.
p7838
aVMy favourite was being called conservashill.
p7839
aVLink?
p7840
aVI've heard it said that the right thinks the left is wrong, the left think the right are evil.
p7841
aVI don't think the left think the right are genuinely evil, just fearful and easily manipulated.
p7842
aVDid you post them day and night like you do here?
p7843
aVThis is meant to be a discussion forum, not a marketing channel
p7844
aVI had 2 accounts banned there, didn't even give a reason when I asked what rule I broke, also had an account banned here for no reason when this place was still far left, asked the mods and had no response. 
p7845
aVIt's on both sides, I had an account banned for arguing that the spikes outside selfridges were a lazy and ineffective solution to the homeless problem.
p7846
aV(The spikes were later removed and found out to be little to do with the homeless, so it's a moot point now anyway.
p7847
aV) Asked for a reason twice, they gave none.
p7848
aVI think they're just banning things on a whim really. 
p7849
aVMaybe you're being downvoted because that's a stupid thing to say.
p7850
aVThe EDL is extremely and openly anti Islam. 
p7851
aVWell it is now, it didn't used to be as bad honestly.
p7852
aVAnd thats not the point anyway, they banned me because they didn't agree with me.
p7853
aVEdited my comment too because it takes away from the point. 
p7854
aVI first heard about the EDL in 2010, guess who from?
p7855
aVYep, the openly racist guy at work.
p7856
aVThat doesn't matter, I still had no reason to be banned. 
p7857
aVI don't know about that all I was referring to was your claim that the EDL didn't used to be that bad.
p7858
aVI can say with certainty that at least as far back as 2010 they were mega-racists.
p7859
aVAye this.
p7860
aVr/unitedkingdom mods are the fourth reich and the sort of plebs who would happily donate to CAGE and pelt stones at grannies at UKIP meetings
p7861
aV"banned to" - not familiar with this expression.
p7862
aVYou mean you've all been forced to come here and can't leave?
p7863
aVI'm not a UKIP supporter - but compared to the sickening bias in /r/unitedkingdom this sub is extremely politically... not neutral, but bipartisan.
p7864
aV[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2semhu/al_murray_the_pub_landlord_is_going_to_stand/cnos116) received 25 downvotes.
p7865
aV&gt;UKIP isn't a protest party.
p7866
aVI suggest you read the research of Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford - it's the product of a serious value divide which has existed in the country for decades and hasn't been given significant political expression before.
p7867
aVEven if you disagree with it, it's a bizarre thing to have downvoted so many times and can only be attributed to a serious bias in existence there.
p7868
aVAs a vehement opponent of UKIP I actually agree with that post. 
p7869
aVIf you're wanting to discuss bias, I'd avoid throwing words like "sickening.
p7870
aV" It doesn't suggest a very non-biased viewpoint. 
p7871
aVYep, you can tell by how much people argue (;
p7872
aVno we don't!
p7873
aV*takes off shirt*\u000a\u000a#YES WE DO
p7874
aV/r/unitedkingdom appears to drifting right as well tbh, I'm starting to agree with a lot more posts there than I used to.
p7875
aVIt used to be on par with /r/shitredditsays.
p7876
aVAny examples of them "drifting right"?
p7877
aVI checked out the thread about the latest mass immigration stats on there, and the only response was that we need to build more houses... not control immigration!
p7878
aVIt seems like on most issues related to immigration in /r/unitedkingdom and /r/europe it's swinging to the right, but that can be ascribed a number of reasons: that immigration tends to be a hot topic for rightists so they'll naturally be drawn to the thread, that certain off-reddit and on-reddit groups brigade into it, and that slightly because of extraneous factors (grooming scandals, more terrorist attacks) general public opinion is moving further in an anti-migration tendency. 
p7879
aVyeah it sucks when people try to fix a problem rather than just cling on to their racism, fucking lefties!
p7880
aVWhat?
p7881
aVPeople who want controlled immigration are trying to 'cling on to their racism'?
p7882
aVIt's really crazy - most countries outside of the EU have a controlled immigration policy but when people mention it here it is deemed racist!
p7883
aVI really can't get my head around that.
p7884
aVJust ignore it.
p7885
aVIt's just mindless crap.
p7886
aV&gt; cling on to their racism\u000a\u000aI see you're one of the few who still pretends UKIP is a racist party.
p7887
aVExcept building endless houses isn't a fix, it's a band-aid.
p7888
aVPreventing people who are a net gain on the economy from coming here  isn't even a band-aid though, it's shooting off your foot because it needs scratching.
p7889
aVPlus our housing situation needs sorting anyway so it's far from a band aid.
p7890
aVWhat economic benefit do non-EU migrants bring to the UK?
p7891
aVWhy not increase the benefit of EU migrants by being more selective about which ones get here?
p7892
aVA bit of TLDR history.
p7893
aVThis sub used to extremely anti-UKIP.
p7894
aVAdmitting you supported UKIP on this board used to be asking to be downvoted into oblivion automatically.
p7895
aVYes /pol brigaded the sub with UKIP supporters - but fuck me if I give a shit.
p7896
aVPeople are too quick to forget what it used to be like to have a UKIP opinion on this board before then.
p7897
aVThe mods have actually done a good job of looking after this sub - people like UKIP more than they used to.
p7898
aVTry to get used to it. \u000a
p7899
aV&gt; The mods have actually done a good job of looking after this sub\u000a\u000aThe mods have said they're fine with the sub being all about point-scoring while debate around the actual issues crashes and burns.
p7900
aVThis seems to be your opinion rather than actual facts.
p7901
aV&gt; This seems to be your opinion rather than actual facts.
p7902
aVTo quote /u/Ivashkin:\u000a\u000a&gt;I think that honestly this sub is a very good representation of British politics.
p7903
aVPeople screaming about their various identities and trying to score points while actual issues that desperately need addressing crash and burn around them.
p7904
aVMe:\u000a\u000a&gt;But *should* it be like that?
p7905
aVIvaskhin:\u000a\u000a&gt;No, but that train left the station a long time ago\u000a\u000aTranslation: We don't want to even try to do anything about it.
p7906
aV([source](/r/ukpolitics/comments/2xmd5b/im_done_with_rukpolitics_and_heres_why/cp22ci4?context=3))
p7907
aVI quite like free debate though, even if I sometimes hate what it results in.
p7908
aVThat is fair.
p7909
aVModerating when someone calls someone else a name is a bit limp.
p7910
aVIf the threads go off-topic thend so be it.
p7911
aV...I'll repeat.
p7912
aV&gt; This seems to be your opinion rather than actual facts\u000a\u000a
p7913
aVIvaskin said that's what happens in this sub.
p7914
aVHe also declined, elsewhere in that thread, to change moderation styles \u2234 the mods are fine with it \u220e
p7915
aVYour interpretation of a conversation that most likely had a slightly different context.
p7916
aVThings like this don't impress me.
p7917
aVI'm sorry.
p7918
aVIf anyone's interested in what it used to be like, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1ub093/nick_griffin_declared_bankrupt/ceg9vnh) was a typical discussion about UKIP and [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/18jctn/had_a_run_in_with_our_local_ukip_council/c8fayn0) what happened when someone revealed themselves as a UKIP supporter.
p7919
aVI don't think the problem was that he revealed he was a Ukip supporter, it was that he actually explained what Ukip stood for...   \u000a  \u000a&gt;Against windfarms *and* solar panels(?
p7920
aV)  \u000a  \u000a&gt;Against same-sex marriage  \u000a  \u000a&gt;Abolish asylum  \u000a  \u000a&gt;Ban further entry to the country by muslims  \u000a  \u000aThe difference now is they've slowly started to learn *not* to talk openly about what they really believe any more. 
p7921
aVAbsolutely, it's become acceptable to support UKIP without going into depth about your beliefs. 
p7922
aVI think you missed the point, that's not a good thing.
p7923
aVThe point is that Ukip have just gotten more media savvy and learned to obfuscate their bigotry and racism behind more inventive language.
p7924
aVOh no, it's definitely not a good thing.
p7925
aVIt just seems to have become acceptable in this sub. 
p7926
aVEven so, those are all just opinions and they actually *were* downvoted into oblivion.
p7927
aVIt's also the comments made towards him: \u000a\u000a &gt;Because he's a shameless bigot who, in any civilised community, would be ostracised.
p7928
aV&gt;You're a horrible person and I despise you.
p7929
aV&gt;You're a bad person\u000a\u000a &gt;you are the lowest of the low.
p7930
aV&gt;What's it like in your small, out of the way village?
p7931
aVDo you still burn Wicker men to ensure a good harvest?
p7932
aVWhat was it like when you first saw a plane?
p7933
aVIt's like they're magic, aren't they?
p7934
aV&gt;a self-righteous bigot without the strength of character to look in a mirror.
p7935
aVDo you seriously condone this sort of abuse against people for holding opinions?
p7936
aVNone of these comments would draw positive scores here now - not because we've been overrun by UKIP supporters but because the variety of opinion here has meant that people now have to learn to put up with seeing things they disagree with, and the ones that can't handle that have gone to britishpolitics.
p7937
aVIf someone says bigoted things, I don't think it's 'abusive' to call them a bigot or a bad person.
p7938
aVI mean, are you serious?
p7939
aVWhat did he say that was bigoted?
p7940
aV'Bigotry' actually means something beyond just being a buzzword you can throw out to justify self-righteous abuse.
p7941
aV&gt;Bigotry is a state of mind where a person obstinately, irrationally, unfairly or intolerantly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.
p7942
aVSome examples include personal beliefs, race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or other group characteristics.
p7943
aVYou've got sexual orientation, religion and national origin.
p7944
aVTake your pick.
p7945
aVGive a quote which demonstrates bigotry.
p7946
aV&gt;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman, I don't want Parliament redefining it.
p7947
aVThis man wants to prevent people who's lifestyle he doesn't agree with having the same freedoms he has.
p7948
aVWhich clearly stems from his idea that homosexuality is wrong.  \u000a  \u000a
p7949
aVHa, of course it doesn't.
p7950
aVIt's a straightforward opinion on what the nature of marriage should be.
p7951
aVSome people disagree with you.
p7952
aVIt doesn't make them bigots or mean they have some sort of underlying prejudice.
p7953
aVGet over it.
p7954
aVAnd don't rush to people's defence just because they fall on your side of an argument.
p7955
aVIf the comments made in that thread were against someone with your opinions you'd agree with me.
p7956
aVNothing wrong with substantive comments from anyone of any political leaning but I downvote every comment which is just UKIP boilerplate.
p7957
aVThis isn't a place for people to simply constantly reiterate their parties core beliefs and repeat their idiosyncratic terminology ad nauseum. 
p7958
aVThis thread gets made every other week and it's always wrong.
p7959
aVThreads on this sub go left and right in opinions constantly, upvotes and downvotes are often split semi-evenly.
p7960
aVJust because the r/UnitedKingdom green party crowd bans everyone in here from that sub and then refuses to come here for any political discussion other than "this sub is too biased!!!
p7961
aV" doesn't mean this sub only allows opinions from UKIP voters.
p7962
aVAlso, just because the UKIP voters here make an effort to post political news from their alignment and Greens don't doesn't mean that Green political news isn't allowed.
p7963
aVI'm sick of this constant to and fro between the pro and anti-UKIP posters to be frank.
p7964
aVThere seem to be as many meta posts complaining about UKIP supporting users as there are pro-UKIP posts.
p7965
aVWORKERS OF THE UK UNITE!
p7966
aVDOWN WITH THE FASH!
p7967
aV(If you'd kindly sign your name after each downvote, that'd be great ;) )
p7968
aVYou are taking upvoting/downvoting too seriously.
p7969
aVIf you have made a valid point that is worth others reading then that should be enough - regardless of whether others agree with you or not.
p7970
aVIf your post us upvoted or downvoted then at least someone has read it and been moved to respond in some way.
p7971
aVThe worst possible option for me is where there is no response and the comment languishes with no votes at all.  
p7972
aVIf a comment gets downvoted enough it will be hidden or people will assume it is a bad comment due to the downvoting...
p7973
aVI always expand those to see what others olbject to and I don't base my opinions on what others think.
p7974
aVThere is /r/britishpolitics which is smaller and more heavily moderated.
p7975
aVIt also suffers from downvotes problems though (what sub doesn't?
p7976
aV). 
p7977
aVI think it's still got quite a bias.
p7978
aVIf you make a post about Nigel Farage for example people will just comment "what a wanker" with nothing else to add and they'll get upvoted a lot for it.
p7979
aVSame people who run that run r/badukpolitics, surprise surprise.
p7980
aVI don't know if there's much more you could do to establish you had an agenda.
p7981
aVMe or them? 
p7982
aVThem
p7983
aVIt's interesting that you mention the greens; people here don't let people get away with saying stupid stuff like on /r/unitedkingdom.
p7984
aVI expect that ironically your own biases are making you think like this.
p7985
aVI Will buy you a month of reddit gold if you find an example of someone being downvoted despite being diplomatic.
p7986
aVOf course I have my own biases, I am a human being after all!
p7987
aVI'm sure your comment about not letting people get away with saying stupid stuff is part of your bias too.
p7988
aVWell, what do you define as diplomatic?
p7989
aVDo you really think reddit and this sub downvotes people based on level of diplomacy? 
p7990
aVFor example, people who are used to r/uk will see blind criticism of the right wing as something to be upvoted.
p7991
aVHere, if you want to criticise UKIP it requires analysis that you wouldnt see on r/uk.
p7992
aVSo this makes this place seem biased.
p7993
aVI'd say it's more equal, but the new normal is against Ukip
p7994
aVhow about this?
p7995
aV: http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2w63fq/why_do_people_tolerate_unite_against_fascism/conylmu?context=3\u000a\u000a-5 points, nothing inflammatory about the post.
p7996
aVVery dismissive of the community, implies that everyone else is wrong.
p7997
aVI wouldn't count that.
p7998
aVIt's not dismissive though?
p7999
aVAnd it doesn't imply they're wrong for doing so?
p8000
aVIt just states the fact that /r/ukpolitics is very anti UAF.
p8001
aVI don't think anyone denies this.
p8002
aVJesus mate you came up with a really bad example.
p8003
aVAnd to be fair there is a lot to dislike about the UAF thugs.
p8004
aVNo name calling, insults, implications, smugness or value judgements in that post.
p8005
aVI don't even say that I'm a fan myself (I've yet to pass judgement on them).
p8006
aVA simple statement of UAF's unpopularity on here, and that defences of their tactics would be better found elsewhere.
p8007
aVHow does that deserve the downvoting?
p8008
aVYour opinions on the UAF don't have anything to do with it.
p8009
aVPeople downvote posts they don't like - nobody can stop that.
p8010
aVTry not to let it bother you.
p8011
aVThe UAF have proven time and time again that they are not nice people - that is why people don't like them.
p8012
aVIt's really as simple as that.
p8013
aVYeah, I don't really care about the downvotes personally, I was just using it as an example for the OP.
p8014
aVI think someone owes me a gold!
p8015
aVEr..
p8016
aVI've left my wallet in my car...\u000a\u000aAll I was saying is that you could have made a better example.
p8017
aVThis post got downvoted.
p8018
aVThere's an example right there! 
p8019
aV[deleted]
p8020
aVI don't ever say true though do I?
p8021
aVI say good answer, as in a rebuttal from someone who actually supports them (which is what the OP wanted).
p8022
aVYou're projecting a lot here.
p8023
aVYou see the problem with most people who cause trouble is that they are delusional and not self aware.
p8024
aVAre you implying something about me, or...?
p8025
aV&gt; Are you implying something about me, or...?
p8026
aVNo absolutely not, sorry for the confusion.
p8027
aVah cool, no worries!
p8028
aVI think a key difference here is that UKIP supporters don't really care about downvotes to the same degree as lefties.
p8029
aVLeft wing people, who tend to be more collectivist minded community-based people, are more susceptible to group shaming and ostracisation.
p8030
aVThey have more invested in the opinion and viewpoint of their peer group.
p8031
aVAll for one and one for all.
p8032
aVKippers are more individualist.
p8033
aVUnfazed by downvotes because they have courage in their convictions and have confidence to argue the UKIP view.
p8034
aVLefties are more likely to go with the flow, not go against the grain of a sub, and follow the hive.
p8035
aVAnother thing - I think lefties tend to be young.
p8036
aVYounger people, raised online, are only used to engaging with others online through a filter bubble and are unused to coming up against a group that hold deeply contrasting views to things they hold dear and they once thought were universally held.
p8037
aVYounger people, i.e under the age of 25, are totally used to using the web where internet-based peer group validation goes hand in hand with any discussion or debate.
p8038
aVIf it isn't upvotes, it's Facebook likes, Twitter retweets, instagram shares.
p8039
aVSocial media gives people the ability to curate their community/followers/friends to such a high degree which in turn means it has become  quite predictable to know how your post or content will be received by your community, so when A is confronted with a mix of up/downvotes and no clear hivemind, A is unable to predict with a strong degree of accuracy how their post will be taken by the sub which then leads to feelings of confusion, anger and possibly isolation.
p8040
aVThe fact that UKIP posters don't really mind downvotes to the same degree as others goes a long way to explaining why bans are being handed out for posting pro-UKIP views on other subs.
p8041
aVModerators, who tend to come from the community themselves, and are generally of a liberal/left bent, see people unfazed by downvotes as a danger to their community and a direct threat to their authority.
p8042
aVThey feel a sense of purpose and duty to protect "their" community from "incorrect" thinking.
p8043
aVThey feel a sense of justification in handing out bans based on negative peer-group validation, or angry people spamming the 'report' button.
p8044
aVNot all moderators, there are some good guys, but enough do.\u000a\u000a
p8045
aVI think his is a case of confirmation bias.
p8046
aVI get down voted here all the time for supportng UKIP, and criticising the Greens. 
p8047
aVAll other subs are hostile to UKIP supporters.
p8048
aVSo they have gathered here.
p8049
aVUKIP are over-represented here, 24% are UKIP supporters.
p8050
aVBut then 8% are SNP, 17% Lib Dem and Greens 21%.
p8051
aVSo if we compare to outside world support, UKIP are nowhere near as over-represented as these other parties.
p8052
aVIt is Labour and the Conservatives that are severely underrepresented.
p8053
aVUKIP are exciting and new.
p8054
aVLot's to discuss and talk about, so people post about them.
p8055
aVMostly because of the bullshit people have deployed to attack UKIP.
p8056
aVJust a bunch of fruitcake racists with no policies.
p8057
aVSo people post to inform.
p8058
aVThen the dickheads post more of the same bullshit.
p8059
aVUKIP represent all of the UK.
p8060
aVNot parts of it.
p8061
aVThey also have a stance that no other relevant party has, they are anti EU and want out.
p8062
aVAround half of people want out of the EU.
p8063
aVSo no surprise people want to hear what they have to say. \u000a
p8064
aVThe Greens are exciting and new.
p8065
aVLot's to discuss and talk about, so people post about them.
p8066
aVMostly because of the bullshit people have deployed to attack the Greens.
p8067
aVJust a bunch of fruitcake marxists with crazy policies.
p8068
aVSo people post to inform.
p8069
aVThen the dickheads post more of the same bullshit.
p8070
aVSee what I did there?
p8071
aVUKIPers complain that others misrepresent them, but then they post attack pieces from the Telegraph that lie about Green party policies and have a massive circle-jerk pretending those articles are accurate.
p8072
aVIt's hypocritical.
p8073
aVNo it isn't.
p8074
aVGreen supporters are welcome in other subs.
p8075
aVThey are also over-represented by around 400%.
p8076
aVTheir members don't post much about the party.
p8077
aVThere hasn't been any sort of campaign against them like there has been UKIP. 
p8078
aVWhat?
p8079
aVNatalie Bennett's 'car crash' interview coverage?
p8080
aVArticles attacking the most out there policies and leaving the popular ones out?
p8081
aVI'd say both parties have been unfairly attacked, it doesn't have to be one or the other. 
p8082
aV&gt;Natalie Bennett's 'car crash' interview coverage?
p8083
aVIt was an absolutely horrific interview and would have gotten coverage regardless of who it was.
p8084
aV&gt;Articles attacking the most out there policies and leaving the popular ones out?
p8085
aVScrutiny of insane policies are not attack pieces, and in many cases their popular ones such as citizens income also fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny.
p8086
aVThe Andrew Neil interview is a good example of that.
p8087
aVYou really can't compare the Greens (who were actually complaining that they didn't get the same level coverage that UKIP gets, and are now complaining that the coverage is negative) treatment in the media to UKIP's.
p8088
aVCome back when the remarks of a Green councillor nobody has ever heard of makes the ten O'clock news and the front pages of national newspapers and I might start to agree with you.
p8089
aVHaving some popular policies does not forgive the "most out there" ones.
p8090
aV[deleted]
p8091
aVSomeone's [just posted one](http://nopenothope.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/calls-to-burn-down-ukip-shop-by-members.html?m=1)
p8092
aV[deleted]
p8093
aVThe parliamentary candidate herself didn't do anything, she is apparently guilty by association because a member of that group posted a call for violence, that's a very tenuous link to the Green Party, it would be like calling the mods here racist because they allow racist ideas to be expressed here.
p8094
aV[deleted]
p8095
aVHe personally posted that cartoon, not some random member of a group was in.
p8096
aVDon't you see anything wrong with that cartoon?
p8097
aV[deleted]
p8098
aVThe cartoon portrays anyone black or Muslim as violent, and the white  Aryan family as victims.
p8099
aVThat's some pretty racist propaganda, and if was turned the other way round I'm sure you'd agree.
p8100
aV[deleted]
p8101
aVWhat's your interpretation of the cartoon then?
p8102
aVWhat is each character meant to represent?
p8103
aVIs it saying the media doesn't report on violent Muslim extremism, because it does.
p8104
aVWhat is the black guy with the guns supposed to signify?
p8105
aVAnd the white family? 
p8106
aV[deleted]
p8107
aV&gt; Are you just playing dumb or what?
p8108
aVAre you?
p8109
aVDo you not know what the word represents means?
p8110
aVI'm asking you, what do you think this cartoon is saying?
p8111
aVThat the media attacks white families?
p8112
aVI'm asking what it means to you, obviously you think it means something, it's not a fucking trick question.
p8113
aV[deleted]
p8114
aV&gt; This cartoon is saying that the media focus of attacks is on traditional, harmless concepts such as patriotism and the traditional nuclear family\u000a\u000aWhen has the media attacked patriotism or the traditional nuclear family?
p8115
aVUnless you believe to be patriotic you have to be racist or anti-immigration, things which are attacked?
p8116
aVOr that accepting things such gay marriage count as an attack on nuclear families, which is retarded.
p8117
aV&gt; Gang culture, honor killings, and radical jihadism are represented on the left.
p8118
aVNot just blacks and Muslims then?
p8119
aVBecause that's what it looked to me like the cartoon was trying to say, and that's probably why the BNP and Britain First loved it so much too.
p8120
aVJesus christ man, you should be ashamed of yourself.
p8121
aVWhy don't you just be honest about what you believe instead of weaselling around.\u000a  
p8122
aVThe reason low level UKIP members get so much attention is because they have come out with racist, Islamophobic or Xenophobic things.
p8123
aVIf a Green member made a similar comment, or anyone did, they would get the same amount of attention too. 
p8124
aVIslamophobia doesn't exist 
p8125
aVCare to elaborate?

aVHaving a phobia is an irrational fear; fearing a religion that promotes violence, slavery and pedophilia is perfectly rational in my opinion.
p8127
aVObviously not all Muslims are bad but the religion is.
p8128
aVMost religions promote certain things in their texts that we all disagree with.
p8129
aVThat doesn't make the religion inherently bad though.
p8130
aVChristianity and Judaism also promote pretty awful things. 
p8131
aVFirstly, I would argue that Islam does so more than either of the other two religions.
p8132
aVSecondly, I think Christianity and Judaism are bad too; I'm not championing any of them.
p8133
aVThe problem is that Islam is on a totally different scale of barbarism when compared to other popular religions and furthermore Islam is the religion which we are allowed to criticize the least.
p8134
aVIf you write an article in a newspaper denouncing Christianity nothing significant will happen but if you do the same for Islam you are labelled as an intolerant racist.
p8135
aVI thought, as a liberal country, we should be allowed to criticise each other?
p8136
aVApparently not in our skewed overly politically correct society.
p8137
aVLet me stress once again that I am not labeling all Muslims as bad people because I know that is what people generally think if you criticise Islam.

aVThe stories about pedophiles that were MP's worries me greatly though.

aV[deleted]
p8143
aVThat's fair and I was wrong and I sincerely apologise.
p8144
aVIt's deplorable that this has not been mentioned and I hold my hands up. 
p8145
aVI've not seen my grandmother plastered across the national news.
p8146
aVThe party really bears no relavence?
p8147
aVSo I'm assuming you heard about the [Labour councillor who compared a German resident to Hitler's wife](http://goo.gl/P0Nv0D)?
p8148
aVWhat about the [one who used the term 'queer little arse-licker'](http://goo.gl/QRTTio)?
p8149
aVOr the [one who accused a gay councillor of having a gimp in his basement](http://goo.gl/tDFFw6)?
p8150
aVAnd of course we all know the [Lib Dem councillor who shared Britain First material.
p8151
aV](http://goo.gl/scMZDo) And the [one who used a nazi slur against a fellow councillor](http://goo.gl/YlmVaK).
p8152
aVThen there's the [Conservative councillor who tweeted 'Am Machete - now THAT'S how you deal with immigration!
p8153
aV' He was allowed to keep his job.
p8154
aV](http://goo.gl/zNRfya) Also the [one who said that being "brown" and a woman is a handicap](http://goo.gl/HP6aEZ), which is probably worse than anything any UKIP councillor has ever said.
p8155
aVOdd are, you haven't heard of any one of these incidents before now, but you've probably heard of the former UKIP councillor who, when he was a Conservative, wrote a letter to David Cameron warning that gay marriage would cause extreme weather events.
p8156
aVYou might even know Rozanne 'Negoid Features' Duncan by name.
p8157
aVDon't kid yourself.
p8158
aVThe mainstream media, including the BBC, has a strong tendency clutch at much finer straws when attacking UKIP than it does with the major parties.
p8159
aVI'm not a UKIP supporter and I can see that.
p8160
aV&gt; Just a bunch of fruitcake marxists with crazy policies.
p8161
aVSo people post to inform.
p8162
aVIt's weird because I think they're nuts because I've watched people try and argue them and fail miserably.
p8163
aVAbsolute bollocks mate, UKIP supporters are a minority here, anything anti ukip always get tons of upvotes, I think the Lefties are upset their hugbox has been disturbed. 
p8164
aVUKIP supporters like to play the discriminated against white male minority card, you guys are pretty funny as long as nobody takes you seriously
p8165
aVIf there was a hugbox I have to be honest and say I would buy one.

p8167
aVHow does the massive upvoting of this thread sit with your narrative? 
p8168
aVYou say you are "pretty into politics".
p8169
aVand yet  you still haven't come to understand that different people have different political opinions.
p8170
aVIts not that this sub is particularly pro UKIP, as when they make a mistake they get called out on it.
p8171
aVThe problem is you are just not used to not having your anti-UKIP views challenged.
p8172
aVIf you want an echo-chamber, stick to /r/unitedkingdom
p8173
aVLet's just be clear though: "having your views challenged" and "being downvoted and abused for expressing your views" are not the same thing. 
p8174
aVCould you show me an example of someone being "abused" for expressing their views. 
p8175
aVNot really - I'm on my phone on the bus.
p8176
aVYou don't have to look hard to find personal insults and such.
p8177
aVThat's what I meant. 
p8178
aVWhat saviourman said.
p8179
aVIf I post anything critical of UKIP or pro left wing it gets downvoted regardless of the quality of the post.
p8180
aVI actually posted a thread inviting people to ask me questions about the Greens and why I supported them, so I am very used to having my views challenged! 
p8181
aVHaving your views challenged is very different from being unfairly criticized.
p8182
aVWere the things people said untrue?
p8183
aVThe greens have some very questionable policies, largely because they are a fringe party, and have no hope of leading government.
p8184
aVEven the party leaders don't believe their manifesto will ever be implemented.
p8185
aVIts simply a way of bringing attention to themselves.
p8186
aVIf they were to become more popular, their manifesto would change drastically, and become much more centrist, so its not surprising that as it currently stands, the green manifesto is very easy to criticize. 
p8187
aVThe Green party manifesto hasn't been published yet, their policies get published in full on their website as soon as they get agreed but they don't all necessarily get prioritised into the manifesto, some remain merely "aspirations".
p8188
aVNo other party is so open with it's policy making process, this is why Green policies get criticised because it's very easy for their enemies to cherry pick a few that are badly worded or open to (mis)interpretation and focus on them.
p8189
aVMate you really need to open your eyes and move beyond this sort of 'world is unfair and against my precious Green party' view.
p8190
aVPeople are quite obviously taking issue with more than just poorly worded policy (even though obviously this isn't exactly going to reflect well on any party advocating anything of claimed merit).
p8191
aVBut it's not like there's anything stopping you living that way yourself.
p8192
aVThat's the beauty of liberalism, and there are always alternate ways to reach sustainable ends.
p8193
aVThe other parties aren't 'secretive' about how they make policy at all.
p8194
aVIt's just not done in such a direct way since their organisations are far larger, more developed and have more resources to juggle.
p8195
aVJust join them and have a look for yourself...
p8196
aVEither way, saying something like, "You just haven't seen our best policies yet" isn't really going to convince anyone -- believe me.   
p8197

aV"hostile to debate"?
p8200
aVYou're complaining about a few down votes?
p8201
aVThe 'left' have whole  fake UKIP subbreddit setup, in an attempt to poison opinion here.\u000a\u000a
p8202
aVUs ukipers have to hang out here as the same happens to us at r/unitedkingdom
p8203
aVThis sub has a larger-than-proportional but not overwhelming UKIP presence.
p8204
aVI believe there was a poll recently and about 1/3 said they firmly support UKIP, 1/4 said they're on the fence and the remaining (~5/12) said they're certainly not voting UKIP.
p8205
aVNow compared to actual polls that's a much larger than average presence, and especially for the generally left-leaning redditor.
p8206
aVI do often see pro-UKIP posts being upvoted for seemingly no reason, but just the fact that UKIPers are still probably a minority on this sub means it can't really be thought of as pro-UKIP in general.
p8207
aVit just isn't good reddiquette
p8208
aVI posted yesterday about how Steve Emmens of UKIP said last night at the UEA NHS question time Trans*people should pay for their surgery,and called a Trans women how asked ''it'',and her tweet last I checked it was being downvoted with no comments.
p8209
aVYeah, *real* democracy sucks, maybe we should only allow one up or downvote from each constituency, see how that works out.
p8210
aVSometimes armchair politics is like that.
p8211
aVPeople shout loudly in relative comfort on here because it makes them feel and sound like a large slice of society.
p8212
aVRegardless, they're politically a minority. 
p8213
aV"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, ,then they down vote you and then you win.

aV"  Nigel Farage talking to the UKIPIDF 2015

p8222

p8230
aV/s\u000a\u000a
p8231
aV&gt; I'm sure I'll get downvoted or criticism for this but I'm fed up with it and people need to remember you're not winning anyone over by simply downvoting people who disagree with you!
p8232
aVRight now you're on +156, so you're not getting downvoted much.
p8233
aVUntil I posted this thread that was not the case! 
p8234
aVWhy is it only Kippers here?
p8235
aVAnyone who is Green is out hugging trees.
p8236
aVThe Labourites are too busy circle-jerking their oppression by laying around on steps outside a Banking corporation, the Lib Dems all agreed with Nick and went Tory.
p8237
aVThe Tories have an assistant to do their internet stuff so don't comment.
p8238
aVThe UKIPers are here because they are a new enough party to still want to discuss their ideals with the people that are only here to see what the Kippers are saying. 
p8239
aVI'm a Green Party supporter and I am not currently hugging a tree.
p8240
aVAlthough I am sat at a wooden table...

p8245
aV2.9 Million they spent on the European elections!
p8246
aVThats double what Labour spent!

p8251
aVIs this the kind of thing you were hoping for OP?
p8252
aVHaving been on here for a few years it has definitely moved to the right.
p8253
aVMy overall feeling based on what I've seen is that UKIP see the Greens as their main threat.
p8254
aV&gt;My overall feeling based on what I've seen is that UKIP see the Greens as their main threat.
p8255
aVIs this a joke?
p8256
aVUKIP and the Greens basically have no overlap in the kinds of voters they attract.
p8257
aVThe level of hatred UKIP supporters show towards the Greens here shows they feel threatened, and this has only been the case since we got more members than UKIP.
p8258
aVClearly you do feel threatened, not because there is an overlap in voters, but because it's destroyed your narrative of being the only insurgent anti-establishment party out there.
p8259
aVOr it could be because the Greens have pretty much the opposite views to UKIP supporters?
p8260
aVIt's not a joke.
p8261
aVIt's my opinion based on what I've seen going on on this sub.
p8262
aVThat is all.
p8263
aVBased on what?
p8264
aVWhy would UKIP or their supporters feel threatened by the Greens of all people?
p8265
aVPossibly because the Greens are actually an antiestablishment party while the Ukip are just purple Tory. 
p8266
aV*tips fedora*
p8267
aVDo you even lift, bruh?
p8268
aVHow the fuck would I know?
p8269
aVProbably because they are opposite political theories.
p8270
aVI can imagine a ukipper being anti green policies.
p8271
aVI bet they would say global warming is bollocks etc.
p8272
aVIt's true though that there is an anti green pro Ukip sentiment on here.
p8273
aV&gt;How the fuck would I know?
p8274
aVThrough logic and observation.
p8275
aV&gt;Probably because they are opposite political theories.
p8276
aVSo?
p8277
aVThat doesn't constitute a threat.
p8278
aVThe Greens are not doing damage to UKIP nor are they vying for the same voters.
p8279
aV&gt; I can imagine a ukipper being anti green policies\u000a\u000aEveryone blessed with critical faculties and the numeracy of a nine year old is anti green policies.
p8280
aV&gt;I bet they would say global warming is bollocks etc.
p8281
aVYou bet?
p8282
aVHow about you observe and find out instead of making assumptions?
p8283
aV&gt;It's true though that there is an anti green pro Ukip sentiment on here.
p8284
aVPerhaps.
p8285
aVI don't see why that is a problem in itself.
p8286
aVThe fact that the Greens are going from one cock up to another and that none of their policies can withstand even the most basic scrutiny doesn't help.
p8287
aV'Everyone blessed with critical faculties and the numeracy of a nine year old is anti green policies.
p8288
aV'\u000a\u000aYet when choosing policies over parties the majority of people choose Green policies?
p8289
aVhttp://voteforpolicies.org.uk/
p8290
aV&gt;majority of people choose Green policies\u000a\u000aThat site is not a legitimate poll.
p8291
aVThe people who fill that out do not represent a proportionate cut of the population.
p8292
aVMrs Miggins aged 87 from Penzance is not going to use voteforpolices.org.
p8293
aVMuch like reddit, that site will be used predominately by young people.\u000a
p8294
aVYet it still gets spammed daily on UK subreddits.
p8295
aVI'm not especially young and neither are my friends.
p8296
aVInteresting argument though - most UKIP voters are old and computer illiterate. 
p8297
aVNo my argument is that for any opinion poll to be credible it has to account for all demographics.
p8298
aVThat site doesn't and you know it.
p8299
aVIt's not just computer literacy.
p8300
aVPeople over the age of 35 generally have entrenched political opinions that aren't subject to yearly changes.
p8301
aVA 40 year old generally knows who he or she will vote for, and won't need an internet test to confirm it.
p8302
aVGreens/LDs can also promise the moon on a stick in their manifesto, which is what the VfP test is based on (2010 version), not necessarily what is achievable or realistic.
p8303
aVYou could start a political party promising free cute Russian girlfriends for everyone and gain some internet popularity from it.

aVI note that you, Pallas_ and ProfessorZOOM all seem to be friends.
p8309
aVYou use 'fuck' and 'bollocks' when speaking to him, he calmly replies to you, not swearing.

p8316
aVAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
p8317
aVI think you are proving the original posters point.
p8318
aVyou wouldn't go to /r/athiem expecting a balanced rational debate between an athiest and a christain.
p8319
aVWhy would you come here expecting a balanced rational debate between anyone? 
p8320
aVThe sub isn't called /r/UKIP, it's /r/UKpolitics, so it's reasonable to expect some degree of debate and balance of opinion, though that obviously doesn't happen.

aVI'm sure there are subs for that.

aVStrawman arguments are also another problem with this subreddit and arguments I see you constantly make.
p8346
aVBollocks, the pathetic meme that people are constantly smearing UKIP is utter tripe.

p8348
aVGive me a break...
p8349
aV&gt; Especially when it comes from people who have "a vote for labour is a vote for child rape" as their mantra.
p8350
aVWell, they wouldn't be wrong, given Labours track record.
p8351
aVHow about "A vote for UKIP is a vote for racists" then with UKIP's track record?
p8352
aVIt's just as asinine as the labour mantra. 
p8353
aVI wouldn't disagree. 
p8354
aV"We have the bravery to bring back slavery"
p8355
aVI think Casetteboy is acting In a reckless and provocative manner, we need to put aside the rhetoric and get around the negotiating table.

p8362
aV"\u000a\u000aOuch
p8363
aV&gt; But a new EU law coming into effect on Wednesday 1 October, will mean the makers of the satirical videos can only be sued if their version of a work conveys a discriminatory message, or competes with the original, BBC News reported.

p8372
aVI wonder how he makes these, very good.
p8373
aVHe probably makes a transcript first and then edits it all together. 
p8374
aVYeah, I think you'd write out the scripts of a few clips, try and out a few words together and let it write itself.
p8375
aVThe rap takes on an extra degree of complexity though
p8376
aVcassetteboy is immense.
p8377
aVI love his stuff.
p8378
aVSurprised there aren't more people in this sub saying that this video represents the real  conservative message and it's all a conspiracy to make the poor poorer and sell the NHS.

p8385
aVHopefully this will go viral and, although it's a parody, it will be able to inform people about the Conservatives.
p8386
aVAre.... you actually serious!
p8387
aV?
aVYou don't want people to be told how it really is?
p8388
aVI feel like a parody video which literally stitches together sentences people would never say is a pretty poor way of "how it really is"\u000a\u000aI mean I'm the furthest from a Conservative you're gonna get but this could just as easily been a video about how the Greens can't wait for fracking or that UKIP thinks there are too many white Brits in the country.
p8389
aVYes, but Cameron is a notorious supporter of ATOS work scheme's forcing cancer stricken people to work for like £2 an hour for their benefits, banker's bonuses, NHS privatization and just a general disregard for the poor.
p8390
aVHe hasn't addressed the massive issue of income inequality in this country so all these jokes can be made with factual foundations.
p8391
aVThe Greens have never supported fracking, neither have UKIP supported mass immigration.
p8392
aVThing is, I completely agree with your points.
p8393
aVBut there are much better ways of conveying that information than a video which could have been made to say just about anything.
p8394
aVI see where you're coming from, but personally I think it's good.
p8395
aVIt will go viral and draw attention to some serious flaws of the Tory party.
p8396
aVYou're embarrassing yourself.
p8397
aVGood argument.
p8398
aVCan't expect much more from a Tory supporter to be honest.
p8399
aV&gt; this could just as easily been a video about how the Greens can't wait for fracking or that UKIP thinks there are too many white Brits in the country.
p8400
aVHow do I get somebody to make these?
p8401
aVGive them a recording of speeches from members of either party, piece em together and give it a beat.
p8402
aV"We believe that fracking" - "is the most important thing" - "and furthermore" - "we should condemn" - "the planet" are all sentences I'm sure you'd hear at a Green Party meeting.

aVAre there videos of whoever the current Green leader is doing speeches?
p8404
aVIt would be even more funny if it wasn't too true.
p8405

aVAs funny as I found this, I consider this as taking away from a legitmate debate, when we take something to the logical extreme of ideology.
p8410
aVAs much as I hate the Tories, I don't think this is how they should be engaged. 
p8411
aVIt's a joke.
p8412
aVIf it makes you feel better here is new labour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-YyWwJSvc
p8413
aVAs someone who supports the conservative party, that was hilarious although there were only a few true lines: \u000a\u000a"I'm hard core\u000a\u000aand I know the score\u000a\u000awe are the party\u000a\u000aof the motherfuckers\u000a\u000awe don't care\u000a\u000aabout them mother suckers"
p8414
aV&gt;about them other suckers\u000a\u000aFTFY
p8415
aVFixed what?
p8416
aVwe shpuld just let the tories run things why bother with the other parties \u000a
p8417
aV[deleted]
p8418
aVNot sure I've ever heard an original joke.
p8419
aVMaybe some of Stuart Lee's work is original in a sense but his best stuff just cross-feeds from Samuel Beckett.
p8420
aVHumourless fucking lout you are.
p8421
aVThing is if he publicly went to a cheese seller and said this it would make him more normal.
p8422
aVHe only succeeded in *Bree*ding contempt for his party.
p8423
aVThis shouldn't go un*feta*-d
p8424
aVI see what you did there.
p8425
aVMeh, I made it too obvious. 
p8426
aVhttp://awkwardedmilibandmoments.tumblr.com/
p8427
aVIronically that tumblr made me see Miliband as less awkward because most of the pictures aren't that awkward.
p8428
aVThey just have really funny captions 
p8429
aVI agree, but I think the captions are really weak for a tumblr blog.
p8430
aVWhen people moan at how much of a geek Miliband is, they forget the possible reason the Labour party went uncharismatic for their leader (and arguably why charisma is a trait we, as a country, should avoid in prospective leaders in future at all costs) - after all, the last charismatic person we elected turned out to be a lying, two-faced, war-mongering, self-serving, religious nutjob who cost the country far more than money.
p8431
aVI'd happily vote for a geek, I'd love a geek in office and I think it would do wonders.
p8432
aVBut is Milliband the right geek?
p8433
aVIs he actually a geek?
p8434
aVPhotos of him holding a banana funny should be something he should be able to embrace and make fun of (it was a fantastic photo), although ultimately photos don't matter.
p8435
aVIt's things like him [getting stuck in a loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTggc0uBA8) regurgitating (particularly crappy) talking points.
p8436
aVOr down right not being able to make a solid argument that make me not think he's a geek, but awkward and a bit incompetent.
p8437
aVDo I think he could actually enact and push through his policies (of which I like the concepts, but think the chosen execution plans are horrible)?
p8438
aVNot really.
p8439
aVThe banana photo was David Miliband (one 'l').
p8440
aVThe Dave Miliband
p8441
aVAslate hit the nail on the head with Ed
p8442
aVAgreed.
p8443
aVNot that I agree with Boris Johnson's policies but he's infamous for being a different kind of personality in politics compared to the others.
p8444
aVThe major reason he's successful is because he cultivates those differences.
p8445
aVMiliband just sort of potters around, going through the motions and ticking off his interactions with the public from his checklist.
p8446
aVA "geek" that actually owned their personality would probably get my vote, but Miliband does nothing.
p8447
aVWhat do you mean when you say 'geek'?
p8448
aVSociety has tells us people who are a bit obsessive about things are charismatic and adorable ala the big bang theory.
p8449
aVIf you want the truth, he's a pretty boring bloke that's obsessed with politics.
p8450
aVEd in his element would be long, contemplative discussions about the future of social democratic politics.
p8451
aVNot something that can wow the celebrity obsessed public, eh?
p8452
aVAs for him not being able to pass legislation, I beg you to look at his record in government; he went 4 days without sleep in order to secure the Copenhagen deal with countries like China and pushed the climate change act, signing us up to cut emissions by 80%.
p8453
aVThat's pretty fucking incredible considering the fact that government is generally allergic to long-term thinking. 
p8454
aV...which is all utterly irrelevant because he's not cultivating that persona.
p8455
aVPerception is everything, and Ed's perception is "oh yeah, that guy exists.
p8456
aVWhat does he *do*, exactly?
p8457
aV"
aVThat's because he wants his campaign to be about policies instead of personalities.
p8458
aVEnergy price freeze, banking break up, restoring wage/wealth link, regional development and localism, rent control and housebuilding.
p8459
aVThis is the bread and butter of miliband's 21st century socialism.
p8460
aVAnd it will get him nowhere because the game of politics does not conform to his will.
p8461
aVThe "Game of Politics" is exactly what you, the electorate want it to be.
p8462
aVWould you rather we choose our leaders based on superficial traits or ideology and policy?
p8463
aVWelcome to the real world, where the electorate doesn't as a group make the perfect decision.
p8464
aV...and before that...\u000a
p8465
aVJohn Major wasn't exactly charismatic.
p8466
aVA sex machine, obviously.
p8467
aVBut not charismatic.
p8468
aVI was thinking further back than that.
p8469
aVWhen?
p8470
aVI don't think there was ever a time that John Major wasn't a sex machine.
p8471
aVHe had more charisma than Kinnock, though, and his tenure was just when they started allowing cameras in the Commons, so personality politics wasn't as strong.
p8472
aVOh great thanks I really wanted to see my breakfast again ;)
p8473
aV[deleted]
p8474
aVIt's not as simple as "oh I like him".
p8475
aVIt's about your belief in that person to get shit done.
p8476
aVAngela Merkel is not exactly Mrs Flash Git like Blair was Mr Flash Git, but she has a forceful personality.
p8477
aVShe is able to communicate her vision, then go and get that done.
p8478
aVShe is capable of sitting across the table from any world leader from Putin to Obama, and really grab what's best for Germany and it's people.
p8479
aVMilliband is giving me the vibe that he is weak, and could easily be pushed around.
p8480
aVHe shows not an ounce of leadership.
p8481
aVThe idea that he could sit down with Putin on our behalf sends a shiver down my spine.
p8482
aVI don't think it says anything negative about people that they don't want to vote for someone who is a life long loser.
p8483
aVWhy would we want a born loser representing us and our country?
p8484
aVEd belongs in the back office. 
p8485
aVIdk, he seemed to be pretty instrumental in not getting tangled in the mess that is Syria.
p8486
aVI mean, what are your choices?
p8487
aVHumanoid David Cameron?
p8488
aVNick Clegg who might as well be invisible?
p8489
aVAwkward Ed?
p8490
aVDoes it really matter?
p8491
aVSurely we want more from our politicians than mere charisma. 
p8492
aVI like the way religion was thrown in there despite the fact that he never did anything for religion while in office.
p8493
aVIn fact he was famous for not touching religion or any policies connected to it.
p8494
aVTony Blair set up faith schools.
p8495
aVI'd say that's pretty related to religion.
p8496
aV&gt; Tony Blair set up faith schools\u000a\u000aWhich is why I began attending a Church of England Primary school in the 80s, roughly ten years before Tony Blair became PM.\u000a
p8497
aVCoE schools have always been about because CoE is our national church but then he set up more faith schools and extended them to other religions (mosty Islam).
p8498
aVI don't have a problem with Islam.
p8499
aVI have a problem with religious schools because I believe in a secular education system similar to what France have.
p8500
aVI agree.
p8501
aVAn education that isn't peer reviewed and crafted by experts is just daft.
p8502
aVVoltaire's Pangloss has no place in our society.
p8503
aVHowever if you're going to have CoE schools it would be discriminatory to other religions to not allow them to set up schools as well.
p8504
aVI see nothing wrong with having religious schools provided they are held to the same rigor and standards of secular education.
p8505
aVI will say though, having lived in France for three years as an adult and being married to a French woman, that their relationship with religion is not as utopic as appears on the surface.
p8506
aVFrance's culture is very normative to the point that breaking those norms is infinitely more arduous than here.
p8507
aVMost UMP voters in France would vote UKIP, even if they don't like the reputation of the FN.
p8508
aVThey're all pretty racist and sexist.
p8509
aVI never realized just how tolerant and open British society was/is until I lived abroad.
p8510
aV'Happy hour' (as pigs call it) on the Tube aint got shit on Paris' Metro.
p8511
aVDoesn't mean you ought to avoid it at all costs. 
p8512
aVIt's true.
p8513
aVHe shouldn't be marketed as the "normal bloke".
p8514
aVI don't want a normal bloke in the running for PM.
p8515
aVPlay him off as a geek, someone passionate about ideology, or whatever.
p8516
aVNot normal - he isn't. 
p8517
aVI don't know why people seem to think ideology is a good thing in politicians.
p8518
aVThe very nature of ideology means that those with a particularly strong sense of them tend to make terrible decision makers, because they're unable to think critically or respond well to new information.
p8519
aVIt's really easy to see how true that is, look at anyone from places like the BNP, /r/shitredditsays or those guys selling Socialist Worker newspapers.
p8520
aVThey aren't the people you want running the country.
p8521
aVWell it depends on if the ideology is sensible or not.
p8522
aVBNP's 'ideology' (which to call an ideology is an insult to the word) is bollocks.
p8523
aVLook at Thatcher, a true conviction politician with a firm ideology, being PM wasn't a game to her.
p8524
aVNo major politician today seems to have any real passion or conviction, they seem to want the job for te job itself, not because they have a firm belief that they can improve Britain.
p8525
aVImage and publicity stunts seem to be more important nowadays than actual manifestos.
p8526
aVedit: And for the anti-Thatcherites, look at Atlee, another conviction politician, offering a third way between free market capitalism and pure socialism, stuck to welfare and defence budgets during a time of great austerity.
p8527
aVFar more concerned about improving britain and sticking to his guns than trying to appear nice and lovable for the camera.
p8528
aVTwo things about Thatcher.
p8529
aVShe never really cut government spending, she possibly changed priorities to some extent and slowed down the growth of expenditure, but it still rose every year that she was in office.
p8530
aVOn top of that she didn't really succeed in creating the Britain she wanted to see.
p8531
aVShe thought that reducing people's reliance on government and making it less involved would make everyone wealthier.
p8532
aVShe also thought people would return to a more reserved Victorian style sensibility and we would become a nation of shopkeepers.
p8533
aVInstead she had massive unemployment and stagnating median incomes (which still haven't risen much) while a small minority became arrogantly, ostentatiously wealthy.
p8534
aVAt the same time independent businesses have hardly thrived, constantly losing ground to big chains and multinationals.
p8535
aVIt's hard to see how her being a ideologue really helped.
p8536
aVAll it really did was prove that her ideology was wrong, in that those policy programmes don't create the outcome she expected.
p8537
aVAlso I don't understand how the BNP's ideology could not be an ideology.
p8538
aVIt's pretty much the dictionary definition.
p8539
aVThey have an frame of reference that completely effects their thought process.
p8540
aVThey are far and away the most ideological party to have won office in Britain in recent years.
p8541
aVTo say that isn't an ideology, because you don't like what they say is a failure to really understand what ideology and is a no true Scotsman argument.
p8542
aVYou're right about the BNP having an ideology, I concede to that.
p8543
aVThatcher's government certainly saw a growth in spending, mainly because of her need to pay higher unemployment benefits.
p8544
aVIt also saw a growth in bureaucracy which was contrary to her ideology.
p8545
aVHowever you have to look at the historical context to see that Thatcher effectively ended the 20 odd years of stagflation that consensus politics and the priority on maximum employment had failed to end.
p8546
aVHer shift to curbing inflation first had it's desired effect and her period saw a growth in GDP and of small businesses.
p8547
aVShe ended the union's preponderance over the gov't and their stifling of productivity, inertia to modernisation and constant demand for wage rises which were only furthering the rampant inflation.
p8548
aVThatcher's conviction put an end to all that where Heath had committed his infamous u-turn and labour struggled with its internal identity crisis.
p8549
aVJust because she never fully got her desired results doesn't mean we should just give up on ideology, it becomes a question of the balance between pragmatism and ideology and Thatcher was definitely a pragmatist when it came to expenditure.
p8550
aVShe recognised the growth in unemployment as failing industries that were draining subsidies were closed, and whilst Britain went through a shift in unemployment from industry to service, and responded accordingly by sticking to unemployment welfare.
p8551
aVThere is no ideology that is 'right', different ideas work in different circumstances and when they no longer seem to work, the electorate plays its part in ending the application of that ideology.
p8552
aVHer being an ideologue definitely helped in taking Britain out of its stagflation rut where other politicians would pander to quick fire answers that only served to extend their own time in office.
p8553
aVI don't want my politicians to try to convince me that they're a cool funny guy with a good image, changing their stance when talking to different groups of people.
p8554
aVI want my politician to truly believe in something, and to sell that something to me rather than themselves and their cult of personality image.
p8555
aVLet the electorate decide which ideology they want don't try to fool them into liking you as a celeb.
p8556
aVI have respect for the likes of Bevan, Disraeli, Atlee and Thatcher because they weren't just career politicians trying to get the top job, they had a vision and let the electorate decide whether their vision was worth something.
p8557
aVYou speak as if the only options are an out and out ideologues or cardboard cut out personalities.
p8558
aVNot people who are actually capable of weighing up all the options before they come up with a policy.
p8559
aVThatcher changed a system which was failing, but she left us with one which ultimately collapsed and left us back in the shit again.
p8560
aVShe left us with a paradigm where we have a banking sector that's so powerful no politician on either side will dare stand up to it.
p8561
aVMeanwhile median incomes are stagnant and our country's entire economy is based in the bottom south east corner.
p8562
aVI think there's a lot of truth in this - particularly around what Thatcher did and didn't manage to achieve.
p8563
aVI would dispute she was ideologue though.
p8564
aVI think her electoral talent was to convince voters that she did have an ideological vision and that the changes in 80s Britain were caused by her policies and statecraft when in reality rising and increasingly volitile globalisation was much more significant.
p8565
aVIn practice (and often secret) she was quite pragmatic - she didn't slash public spending, she negotiated with terrorists (sensibly), opposed the reunification of Germany in the interests of the UK and implemented almost no socially conservative legislation.
p8566
aVYes, I'd agree, but it's better to fairly show your party leader as being ideological, than to disguise them as someone who regularly goes to greggs\u000a
p8567
aVIndeed, the last thing this country needs is a PM who is passionate about ideology.
p8568
aVWe need a PM who is pragmatic and that has a strong sense of "if it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid".
p8569
aVpragmatism - expedience\u000a\u000aterrorist - freedom fighter
p8570
aVAbsolutely
p8571
aVHow fucking cringeworthy can you lot get?
p8572
aVHe's a politician, not Leonard from the Big Bang Theory.
p8573
aVThis geek shit that was in the news over the weekend is seriously insulting young voters, there's Farage who tries to appeal to the beer swilling, fag smoking every-man, and he gets the shit ripped out of him for it, now, the same people who have a dig at Farage are keen to have the leader of the opposition turned in to a geek celebrity to appeal to the young and left.
p8574
aVAny young person isn't going to be taken in by this.
p8575
aVYou are right though, he isn't normal.
p8576
aVI'm not saying he *should* be marketed like that, just that it's closer to the truth than how he is now.
p8577
aVWhich geek stuff in the news were you referring to?
p8578
aVI seriously hope people wouldn't be taken in by leaders at all.
p8579
aVYeh but it would be so randum xD.
p8580
aVLeft wing people are smart so geeks would be awesome for us XD
p8581
aVYour comment made my eye twitch a little.
p8582
aV&gt;He's a politician, not Leonard from the Big Bang Theory.
p8583
aV**Mili(re)brand** for the General Election, probably?
p8584
aV!
aV&gt;and he gets the shit ripped out of him for it\u000a\u000aNo, butthurt lefties on reddit try to.
p8585
aVNobody else cares.
p8586
aVWell to be fair it is all an act, he went to a public school that is part of the Eton Group, ffs.
p8587
aVTIL going to public school means you can't drink or smoke.
p8588
aVYou've read the Guardian or Independent this week, haven't you!?
p8589
aVI saw that headline but didn't read the article.
p8590
aVSo I don't think your opinion is your opinion at all, it's something you've read and latched onto.
p8591
aVI have, but it wasn't a "normal" op-ed; Victoria Coren tweeted a link to her column and it was a sarcastic piece about all of Labours great ideas for marketing Ed.
p8592
aVStuff sending him out to pubs and getting him to do weekly shops.
p8593
aVMy opinion on this has been the same since even before he was elected leader; I thought the same while he was running.
p8594
aVDavid was the clever one, and Ed was supposed to be "In touch" with the party core voters.
p8595
aVBut he isn't.
p8596
aVWhat are you talking about?
p8597
aVHe is just your average neighborhood Eton educated chap.
p8598
aVPubs are full of 'em where I'm from.
p8599
aV(/s)
p8600
aVHe didn't go to Eton though, just an everyday comp.
p8601
aVThe fact that everyone just assumes he went to Eton illustrates the problem he faces.
p8602
aVAnd it's truly ironic given that Farage attended Dulwich College...
p8603
aVWhat problem?
p8604
aVSticking to the subject of idiologies - Farage probably knows that he is never going to win over the type of voter over that is prepared to (basically) lie to themselves and overs on a regular basis about him and UKIP.
p8605
aVIronically these people are what we call ideologues... 
p8606
aVWho lies about UKIP?
p8607
aVThe UKIP councillors who tweet about gay people causing floods?
p8608
aVHow can a party possibly be suitable for government when it contains people who think that the best response to severe flood warnings would be to round up the gays?
p8609
aVHow about the fact that Farage is one of the the most abusive and wasteful MEPs, representing some of the worst value for money in Parliament?
p8610
aVThe idea that UKIP get lied about in the media is a typical victim complex.
p8611
aVThey're terrible but people who support them don't really care how terrible they are because it's not about facts.
p8612
aVErgo, to them anything bad about UKIP is a lie.
p8613
aVThe conclusion is reached first. 
p8614
aVzzzz..
p8615
aVYet again bring up individuals (that have on vast majority cases been fired or at the very least warned to change their ways) as if they represent the party.
p8616
aVAll the while I might add ignoring the numerous cases in other parties that are being recorded just as frequently.
p8617
aVTHAT is your deceit and we're not falling for it. 
p8618
aV&gt; THAT is your deceit and we're not falling for it.
p8619
aVYou're right.
p8620
aVI am perpetuating an intentional deceit that UKIP are a bad party even though really I think they are the best one.
p8621
aVThe sun shines out of Nigel Farage's arse but everyone who doesn't support him is jealous of his googly frog eyes and so we invent slights against UKIP and cover up all wrongdoing by every other party so that the hard working, hard drinking, hard smoking plumber down the pub who reckons there's too many brown people and funny looking Polaks when he goes down the town centre can have the opportunity to tell us that we are engaged in a left wing secret conspiracy against the only politician who's 'got it right'.
p8622
aVYou sound ridiculous.
p8623
aVIt's not a deceit.
p8624
aVMost people in the UK genuinely do not believe that UKIP are a good party.
p8625
aV&gt; You're right.
p8626
aVI am perpetuating an intentional deceit that UKIP are a bad party even though really I think they are the best one.
p8627
aVThe sun shines out of Nigel Farage's arse but everyone who doesn't support him is jealous of his googly frog eyes and so we invent slights against UKIP and cover up all wrongdoing by every other party so that the hard working, hard drinking, hard smoking plumber down the pub who reckons there's too many brown people and funny looking Polaks when he goes down the town centre can have the opportunity to tell us that we are engaged in a left wing secret conspiracy against the only politician who's 'got it right'.
p8628
aVThis one we call a strawman argument.
p8629
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man\u000a\u000a&gt; You sound ridiculous.
p8630
aVIt's not a deceit.
p8631
aVI might sound ridiculous.
p8632
aVThat does not make me wrong.
p8633
aVThis one we call an argument ad ridiculum.
p8634
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ridicule\u000a\u000a&gt; Most people in the UK genuinely do not believe that UKIP are a good party.
p8635
aVThis one we call an argument ad populism.
p8636
aVIt's a strange position to try and take given that UKIP are surging in the poles!?!?!!!
p8637
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBasically.
p8638
aVYour logic is flawed, your deceit is easy to detect and your argument is invalid.\u000a
p8639
aVI'm not going to carry on arguing with you because I think you're a GCSE student after that list of 'le logical fallacies'.
p8640
aVI don't think you understand them.
p8641
aVYour point was that I and those that do not support UKIP are deliberately deceitful.
p8642
aVThe inference can be made that you believe the object of this deceit to be UKIP supporters, because you claim that UKIP supporters a not 'falling for it'.
p8643
aVThat is not a straw man representation of your views, according to your original post.
p8644
aVI gave the first paragraph example because it demonstrates how ridiculous it would be if that was the case.
p8645
aVDemonstrating that a belief is ridiculous is not an 'appeal to ridicule'.
p8646
aVA demonstration that the logical outcome of a belief is ridiculous is a strong argument.
p8647
aVThe logic is as follows: \u000a\u000a1) People and media against UKIP are deceitful.
p8648
aV2) Therefore they do not believe the things they say, but rather must believe a different thing.
p8649
aV3) If the view of people who oppose UKIP are different to what they claim, they must not believe UKIP is bad for Britain.
p8650
aV4) If they do not believe UKIP is bad for Britain, they believe it is good or neutral for Britain.
p8651
aV5) Therefore, people who oppose UKIP invent lies and attempt to deceive UKIP supporters even though they believe UKIP would be good or neutral for Britain.
p8652
aVThe final conclusion is ridiculous, and my final point that most people do not support UKIP.
p8653
aVWe know this because only ~30% of a ~30% turnout voted for them in the EU election.
p8654
aVOnly ~10% of the country therefore voted for UKIP.
p8655
aVFarage himself has said that UKIP probably had the highest turnout of supporters.
p8656
aVTherefore, even if only half of UKIP supporters voted, only 20% of the country supports UKIP.
p8657
aVIf ~80% of people do not support UKIP, then by the conclusion (5) above there must be an enormous proportion of the country who secretly believe UKIP would be good or neutral for the country but engage in active deceit of others.
p8658
aVThis makes no sense.
p8659
aVUKIP like to portray themselves as fighting for a silent majority, but it is totally bullshit.
p8660
aVIf the majority of people supported UKIP, they would vote for them at the EU elections.
p8661
aVFinally, as an aside, I have found that practically anyone who supports UKIP does not understand the EU.
p8662
aVIf you advocate leaving an organisation that is so important, shaking up our entire economy and political structure, then you should understand the Treaty of Lisbon, the seven institutions, the *Factortame* decision, the differing legal effect of directives and regulations, Schengen (and why we aren't in it), and the legislating process.
p8663
aVIf you don't have even a clue of how those things work then literally all you have to base an opinion of the EU on is whether a foreigner stole your job or if there are too many Polish people in town.
p8664
aVWithout understanding, you can't validly make arguments that are not hopelessly informed.
p8665
aVAnd if an unskilled foreigner who doesn't speak English did steal your job then you should take a long hard look at yourself.
p8666
aVI must admit I stopped reading after the first ad hominem attempt and then the further twisting of what I clearly said.
p8667
aVI called you out.
p8668
aVYou don't like it which is why you are now becoming enraged.
p8669
aVIf you take one thing from this "GCSE student" of 31 years of age let it be this: You are the reason that the UKIP vote will become entrenched.
p8670
aVThe floating voter will look at our actions and at your actions (that of a spoiled liberal, stamping his feet and casting inaccurate assertions and shaming language at those who don't agree with him) and say, "to hell with him.
p8671
aVAt least the UKIP voters are honest".\u000a\u000a
p8672
aVI think you're living in a fantasy land.
p8673
aVYour response shows that you have no response to my points, demonstrating nicely how UKIP supporters have no actual knowledge of the matter, just a sneering contempt for anyone more educated or left wing than them. 
p8674
aV&gt; just a sneering contempt for anyone more educated or left wing than them.
p8675
aVIrony at it's very finest!
p8676
aVHave a nice day my intellectual superior.
p8677
aVYou can 'market him' all you like, he doesn't look like a PM.
p8678
aVCan you imagine him shaking hands with Obama on the Whitehouse lawn?
p8679
aV*shudder*
p8680
aVWhat the hell does it matter what he looks like?
p8681
aVChrist on a bike.
p8682
aVGrow up. 
p8683
aVI'd argue it's not what he looks like that matters (although like it or not, that plays into many people's opinion of him) but rather how he presents himself.
p8684
aVHe's not a statesman.
p8685
aVHe doesn't speak with conviction or confidence.
p8686
aVHe has a lisp and speaks so nasally that it's annoying (which again, shouldn't come into it, but it does).
p8687
aVI, and many others, just shudder at the thought of the man trying to hash out a deal with the likes of Obama or Putin.
p8688
aVThey'd tear him apart - he's simply not made of the material a highly publicised and constantly watched leader needs.
p8689
aVYou have an extremely cartoonish idea of how government actually works. 
p8690
aVThat Butcher is looking like he's about ready to kill Ed...
p8691
aVI don't really get why people don't like Miliband.
p8692
aVI think his slight awkwardness is endearing.
p8693
aVHe seems like the most reliable of the top three to me.
p8694
aVMilliband is really annoying me.
p8695
aVI used to be fully Labour, but now I don't know where I stand
p8696
aVIt always amazes me when people say they can't support a Party because of its leader.
p8697
aVAny party is a spiral of ideology featuring the input of thousands of people all vying for a common cause.
p8698
aV"Moyes is really annoying me.
p8699
aVI used to be fully Man Utd but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000a"The Pope is really annoying me.
p8700
aVI used to be fully Christian but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000a"The Queen is really annoying me.
p8701
aVI used to be fully British but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000aIf you really think you can let one man change your political beliefs; then maybe you should examine why you are voting in the first place.
p8702
aVTell labour what you think, throw an egg, spam him on twitter; whatever you want.
p8703
aVBut voting should be about your core beliefs &amp; aligning them with the party that suits them best.
p8704
aVIf awkward public appearances from a middle-aged man are enough to change that; then you need to look at yourself, not Miliband's  cringe-worthy TV shenanigans. 
p8705
aVLeaders can change parties to a great extent.
p8706
aVLook at the nature of Labour shifting from Foot to Kinnock to Blair's New Labour then to Brown's halfsided New Labour to Miliband's One Nation Labour.
p8707
aVThe nature of Parties is not as consistent as you may think.
p8708
aVLeaders didn't change Labour.
p8709
aVLabour elected leaders that represented change from within.
p8710
aVFoot-&gt;Kinnock-&gt;Smith-&gt;Blair was part of a long process of moving towards the centre for Labour.
p8711
aVLeaders aren't passive forces that are brought to the top by other people, leader's are the active force of change that create a momentum of people and support, thus pushing themselves to the top.
p8712
aVSo effectively leaders did change Labour, or at the very least, are a major factor in the change of a party official position.
p8713
aVMeh the whole "great men" v "social trend" argument gets done to death.
p8714
aVIt is a bit of both.
p8715
aVBlair wasn't selected out of the blue.
p8716
aVHe was selected as the final plank of a long running process.
p8717
aVYes he also helped accelerate that process.
p8718
aV&gt; "The Pope is really annoying me.
p8719
aVI used to be fully Christian but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000aIn the Catholic church, what the Pope says goes, so in that example it would be perfectly reasonable to doubt the whole faith if you don't like its leader.
p8720
aVWell to be honest labour do seem to be changing for the worst, at least to me they do, and I don't know if it's due to Ed or if he's just the scapegoat.
p8721
aVNot like the good old days of Tony or Gordon, eh?
p8722
aVThat blokes nasally voice has really made me question where Labour are heading.  
p8723
aVThe way I see it, they did great with Tony, Gordon was alright and by then they were too confident with their seat, then they lost to the tories and realised that they desperately needed to sort their shit out
p8724
aVWhat incisive analysis.
p8725
aVYou should go for Paxmans old job.
p8726
aVWhy do you think they are changing for the worst?
p8727
aVIf anything I think they are changing for the better, just not fast enough for my liking.
p8728
aVWell they've had the unions ripped out of the policy making thanks to Ed, which is a good start.
p8729
aVI don't think they're changing for the worse, at most going stale.
p8730
aVThey've lost their PR punch since the end of the Blair era, and when I see Ed Balls I'm forced to immediately projectile vomit.
p8731
aV&gt; Well they've had the ~~unions~~policy ripped out of the policy making thanks to Ed\u000a\u000aFixed.
p8732
aVI agree but leaders are usually the ones that dictate media representation,  which can be really irritating. 
p8733
aVNot really you need an effective leader that it tough and can be a global statesman representing our interests abroad, neither of which are traits of Miliband.
p8734
aVGiven that they're [changing their stance on immigration](https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/471305578740846593) based on a bad round of voting, neither do they.
p8735
aVIf I were to vote today it would be for labour.
p8736
aVHe's stood up to powerful people and that's what I want in a leader. 
p8737
aVYou also need leaders who choose their battles well.
p8738
aVAre the unions really the thing that's currently holding Britain back?
p8739
aVDid they cause the financial crisis?
p8740
aVWill they cause the next one?
p8741
aVA leader can only fight so many battles, and if he chooses the wrong enemies, he will weaken himself too much to fight the fights that really matter.
p8742
aVIt appears to me that Milliband is more a man of passion than of intellect.
p8743
aVThat's dangerous.
p8744
aVHe's the sort of man who could easily drag us into an unnecessary war.
p8745
aVThat's funny because he's already dragged us out of one. 
p8746
aVPossibly true.
p8747
aVAlthough many other voices were also pointing out how stupid it was to get dragged into Syria.
p8748
aVAny war in Syria would have been unpopular with the general public.
p8749
aVHowever I don't see that as indicative of how he would behave as a PM.
p8750
aVSaying no to one war whilst in opposition, offers little guarantees as to how he'd likely to respond to completely different circumstances as a PM.
p8751
aVBasically we need someone who can think things through carefully, and see through propaganda from both our enemies, and our allies.
p8752
aVI'm not convinced that Milliband fits the bill.
p8753
aVI'm no fan of Miliband either, in fact he appears fairly ineffective at lots of things even if you allow for the fact we don't necessarily want another leader with Blair-style charisma.
p8754
aVHowever I had a horrific moment of realisation the other day when someone on TV (probably Nick R) pointed out to me that it's overwhelmingly likely the next PM will be Cameron or Miliband.
p8755
aVEspecially now it looks like Labour don't have the time or inclination for a leadership battle.
p8756
aVBut I think I'd rather Ed be in charge, and pushed hither and thither by public and party opinion, than five more years of Cameron cutting every benefit he can get his grubby hands on.
p8757
aVIMHO the current Tory engineered housing bubble will collapse 1-2 years into the lifespan of the next government.
p8758
aVCould be sooner depending on international events.
p8759
aVIf the government is weak - e.g.
p8760
aVa minority government, or a government with a very small majority, then this will cause it to fall apart and we'd get another general election.
p8761
aVSo that would make the next election of little relevance.
p8762
aVSo the only scenario that really matters for voting is how each of the parties would react if they have a substantial majority, or lead a stable coalition.
p8763
aVFor the Tories the result would be fairly predictable.
p8764
aVMore cuts.
p8765
aVHowever what about Labour?
p8766
aVHow would Milliband react to declining tax revenues and a drastically worsening deficit?
p8767
aVI find his reaction to be much harder to forecast.
p8768
aVIf he tried bringing spending under control, he'd lose control of his own party.
p8769
aVIf he kept spending and building up more debts, he'd risk losing control of the economy.
p8770
aVI've got no idea how that would play out, but there is a lot of potential for nastiness there.
p8771
aVPersonally I'm done with the major parties, and I'm likely to vote Green in the next GE.
p8772
aVNo way they will win, and but at least I will get to smugly say "I tried..." when our children ask us what happened to their planet.
p8773
aVVery interesting point; there are few in Labour who seem to have the economic credentials to weather a storm like that.
p8774
aVI guess the best we could hope for is that if it were them in charge, and the bubble did burst, they were able to manage it in such a way that reduced prices are actually felt substantively by the working and middle classes.
p8775
aVBut I think the bubble is unlikely to 'pop' any *more* than it did in 2008-09, which wasn't actually that much in the end.
p8776
aV&gt; which wasn't actually that much in the end\u000a\u000aActually it was quite substantial.
p8777
aVThe economy still hasn't fully recovered yet.
p8778
aVThe problem with any second collapse is that it would be cumulative.
p8779
aVWe would enter it with much higher debt levels and much less fat that can be easily trimmed from the government budget.
p8780
aVSo even if in absolute terms the decline in the economy is smaller, we'll be in a much worse state to cope with it.
p8781
aVits easy to stand up to people when you are not in power and nobody cares what you do.
p8782
aVNo it isn't easy at all.
p8783
aVTo have the Murdoch press and the Daily Mail against you and your family must be very difficult.
p8784
aVIt's true that he went out of his way to defend his father against slander, and won that round.
p8785
aVWhich showed some backbone I suppose, although he was clearly in the right to do so and the Mail was clearly in the wrong, surprise surprise. 
p8786
aVIt is easier to stand up to people when you are in a position of power
p8787
aVI think the Syrians cared what he did, one way or another.
p8788
aVI wish someone would hit the nail on Ed's head.
p8789
aVIt looks like he fell over and flattened his nose.
p8790
aVUKIP seem to complain about the negative publicity, but I'd suggest the Greens are getting the raw deal by getting no publicity.
p8791
aVYou can spin bad press, but it's a lot harder to spin no press.
p8792
aVI'd like greens to get more press so that they have to actually answer for their anti science nonsense and then hopefully they'll reform their ideas so that I, and others put off by this, would vote for them.
p8793
aVAnti Science?
p8794
aVTheir views on nuclear and GMO's are more based on other issues, such as how carbon intensive uranium mining is, and how expensive to maintain nuclear plants are (along with the waste issue).
p8795
aVGMO's is mostly their opposition to corporate control of farming and the danger of monocultures failing.
p8796
aVHowever, anti science?
p8797
aVThe Green Party want's to spend 3% of GDP on science (which is about 10x more than we currently spend) and for research money to be split through the Haldane principle.
p8798
aVMost of the people complaining about the Green Party haven't actually done any research into their policies and are just repeating stuff they have read elsewhere.
p8799
aVPretty much 
p8800
aVWell [they still reference studies that they commisioned](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html) to show that nuclear was causing cancer in Wales, even though [the study was shown to be completely made up.
p8801
aV](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/) So that's anti science, as is their senior members telling protester to destroy a GM crop trial despite the scientists asking people to meet with them to discuss their issues, because the issues the Greens were shouting about did not apply to that trial.
p8802
aVFor instance, most GM research is done by universities for non-profit uses like alleviating suffering in the third world.
p8803
aVAnd modern crops are just as monocultured, you can make GM crops as diverse as the modern crop.
p8804
aVAnd nuclear is hardly CO2 intensive, there is a study I've seen green members use a few times (it's used by someone else on a TED debate on nuclear) where the CO2 of nuclear seems really high, but when you look into it, they look at things like the workers getting to work, and the other stuff, but don't look at that for wind, so straight off the source is bogus, but then also, they estimate that nuclear power will cause a nuclear war, and so they count in burning cities into their equations!
p8805
aVBURNING CITIES FROM A NUCLEAR WAR!
p8806
aVIn reality, the mining is no more intensive than the mining of coal, and the mining of coal, is really not the issue with coal.
p8807
aVIf we get off fossil fuels, then we're going to start using electric vehicles anyway, so it will be nuclear powered.
p8808
aVFinally, since wind, the green parties solution to energy but please don't ask tough questions because THE FUTURE WILL FIX IT, can only ever subsidise a main energy source, because we can't store energy, then the Green's suggestion actually involves heavy use of coal/gas (coal then, since they also make up things about fracking to oppose our use of gas).
p8809
aVSaying a nuclear + wind system is more CO2 intensive than a fossil + wind system is just bullshit.
p8810
aVIt's true that they have some things to answer for, but why not give them the benefit of the doubt and lend them your vote?
p8811
aVIf they get more votes, they'll get more publicity at some point where they upset a major party - that might not be far off if they get more EU election votes than the LDs.
p8812
aVThen their pro-immigration, anti-nuclear stances will be brought up, and they'll have to justify them, or change.
p8813
aVRealistically speaking, if they had any major successes, maybe a few more MPs with a hung parliament - at this point likely - they could join Labour (and the remaining Lib Dems) in a coalition.
p8814
aVTheir more misguided policies would not make it into a coalition agreement, or would be watered-down.
p8815
aVSee my reply to other commenter as to why there's a difference between the anti nuke and pro immigration.
p8816
aVShort version is that pro immigration is a policy you can have an opinion about, but in their anti nuke they use lies and outdated stats to convince people to follow their view.
p8817
aVThe first is key to democracy, the secondis actively working against it.
p8818
aVI think it's fine for you and others to act as you suggest, to try and change from the inside, but personally, as a scientist in Ecology and a keen conservationist,  I know that GM and nuclear power are our two best tools to combat climate change and habitat loss and future famines.
p8819
aVSo I won't support a party that uses lies to harm those tools.
p8820
aV&gt;  I know that GM and nuclear power are our two best tools to combat climate change\u000a\u000aOnshore wind provides cheaper energy than nuclear power.
p8821
aVAll that's needed is a government that cares about the environment enough to override the nimby's currently blocking expansion of onshore wind.
p8822
aVI'd suspect that the Green's are the best candidate for that role.
p8823
aVWhilst I personally wouldn't completely rule out nuclear, I'm a long way from being convinced that it's one of our best tools.
p8824
aVI would really recommend reading "sustainable energy without the hot air" by david mckay who is the chief scientific adviser to the DoE.
p8825
aVIt does a superb job of cutting through the crap and attempts to give a scientific and economical account of the pros and cons of almost all technology's available to us in our little island nation.
p8826
aVpage 60-67 deals with both shallow and deep water wind farms.
p8827
aVpages 161-176 deals with nuclear.
p8828
aVI'm not trying to incite an argument with this rather than give those who are interested, a way to become better informed and be able to back up their arguments with facts (the reference list and suggested reading in the book is second to none).
p8829
aVPersonally i am extremely pro-nuclear as a technology, and think that it is an integral part of the future energy generation of this country and, for that matter the world.
p8830
aVHowever, as i say it is only a part, and i would love to see the government actually go through and put a tidal barrage on the seven river.
p8831
aVI find the hardest part of debates over energy future's and technology's to be implemented is that emotive illogical arguments are given time such as the NIMBYesm of the arguments against the seven barrage and anything nuclear.
p8832
aVanyway went off on a bit of a ramble the link for the book is below hope you have a read.
p8833
aVhttp://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/book/tex/sewtha.pdf
p8834
aVThanks for the link.
p8835
aVI would like to read it some time and will bookmark it.
p8836
aVHowever at the moment I have a fair sized pile of books to read, both fact and fiction.
p8837
aVPersonally I prefer offshore wind as a power source.
p8838
aVI know it's not as effective as onshore, but we really do not have enough space onshore for the number of turbines required.
p8839
aVNo shortage of space out to sea though.
p8840
aVI live in east anglia, and can see the turbines of the giant offshore wind farms when I'm working, and I think they're fantastic.
p8841
aVHowever... they don't work if the wind isn't blowing and while it's pretty damn windy over here, there are still times when they stop spinning due to either too much or not enough wind.
p8842
aVI believe we need nuclear for the short term.
p8843
aVIt's pretty safe (really safe if you compare it to coal or gas in terms of human suffering - those poor miners in Turkey) and the biggest problem with it is the disposal of the waste.
p8844
aVOne of my lecturers at university is working on some pretty cool stuff to do with bacteria and radioactive waste disposal.
p8845
aVHopefully in the future we will be able to dispose of the waste much more safely, and faster.
p8846
aVRight now, the problem is keeping the lights on until we have enough turbines and solar panels. 
p8847
aV&gt; we really do not have enough space onshore for the number of turbines required.
p8848
aVWe've got space for many more turbines than we currently have.
p8849
aVWorry about offshore sometime we've forced all those aristocrats with vast private estates in Scotland to cover them with turbines.
p8850
aVWhy would we force the aristocrats to build turbines over their land?
p8851
aVIt's their land, they can do what they want with it.
p8852
aVBesides, you don't seem to have thought that idea through.
p8853
aVThe power has to get to the national grid somehow.
p8854
aVIt requires significant infrastructure in terms of cables, copper and pylons to get the energy from the site of production to the grid.
p8855
aVI'm from Suffolk, and live near (ish) to Sizewell nuclear power station.
p8856
aVAs well as it being windy here, the other reason they picked the East Anglian coast for the location of the turbines is that we already have the power lines in place to get the energy to the grid thanks to Sizewell.
p8857
aVI guess (I'm no expert here)that it's a heck of a long way from the Scottish highlands to the nearest point that could handle the amount of power input that the turbines create.
p8858
aVBesides, its really easy to install the turbines offshore.
p8859
aVThey bang them up really fast, it's surprising. 
p8860
aV&gt; Why would we force the aristocrats to build turbines over their land?
p8861
aVIt's their land, they can do what they want with it.
p8862
aVBecause (a) we need power and (b) I can't give a stuff about their inherited feudal rights which were based on conquest and repression.
p8863
aVWe aren't living in the 16th century anymore, and feudalism should have died a long time ago.
p8864
aVPerhaps a good start might be to tax these landlords properly, and stop them from receiving massive government farm subsidies to support their grouse shooting hobby.
p8865
aVOnce their land becomes uneconomic as their private \u000aplayground for shooting birds, then building wind turbines should follow.
p8866
aV&gt; The power has to get to the national grid somehow.
p8867
aVScotland already has several nuclear power stations, just like East Anglia.
p8868
aVThe SNP has a "no nuclear" strategy and plans to replace those nuclear power stations with renewables.
p8869
aVSo in order to implement the SNP strategy then the infrastructure will need to be in place.
p8870
aVAdding even more renewables should be completely feasible.
p8871
aV&gt; Because (a) we need power and (b) I can't give a stuff about their inherited feudal rights which were based on conquest and repression.
p8872
aVWe aren't living in the 16th century anymore, and feudalism should have died a long time ago.
p8873
aVModern inheritance laws = feudal system.
p8874
aVWell, that's quite a statement to make.
p8875
aVFeudalism did die a long time ago, and aristocratic privilege is nearly gone too, with only a few last dregs left.
p8876
aVLooking at the house of lords here, needs reforming IMO.
p8877
aVWhy should we punish the current members of the aristocratic families, by confiscating their land, for the perceived crimes of their ancestors?
p8878
aVSeems like a rather extremist view to me.
p8879
aVBeing born into a wealthy family is not a crime, nor in any ones' control.
p8880
aVBesides, I'm not too fond of the idea of planting wind turbines all over beautiful Scottish highlands, then setting up chains of pylons to finish the job off of ruining natural beauty.
p8881
aVYou might respond by saying that the beauty is reserved for the aristocrats who own the land, but I'd rather it exist than be wiped out all together.
p8882
aVShould we clear the forests in order to build turbines?
p8883
aVShould we knock down the stately homes of the wealthy, and those owned by the National Trust in order to provide more room for our energy demands?
p8884
aVWhy should we do any of that when we have offshore power as an option?
p8885
aVOne last point.
p8886
aVScotland is having a referendum on independence.
p8887
aVWhat happens if we legislate for the change you suggest and then they go independent?
p8888
aVPerhaps we should look into energy production south of the border.
p8889
aVI still believe that in this densely populated little island we have, we should save the space on the land for living and use the space around us for our energy needs. \u000a
p8890
aV&gt; Feudalism did die a long time ago, and aristocratic privilege is nearly gone too\u000a\u000aIf only that were the case.
p8891
aVIn reality some of the old feudal lords such as the Duke of Westminster and Duke of Buccleuch are still very much with us, and both have large estates in Scotland.
p8892
aVhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/who-owns-scotland-1320933.html\u000a\u000a&gt; Why should we punish the current members of the aristocratic families, by confiscating their land, for the perceived crimes of their ancestors?
p8893
aVWhy should we allow them to benefit from the perceived merits of their ancestors?
p8894
aVPersonally I believe that Britain would be a much better place of inequality was reduced, and this looks like a pretty good place to start.
p8895
aVI'd confront inequality by, for example:\u000a\u000a- Increased taxation for land ownership\u000a- Reducing farm subsidies (and getting agricultural subsidies for grouse shooting, as these people currently manage, is ridiculous)\u000a- Properly enforcing inheritance taxes on the wealthy (nice side effect - budget deficit reduced)\u000a\u000a&gt; Besides, I'm not too fond of the idea of planting wind turbines all over beautiful Scottish highlands, then setting up chains of pylons to finish the job off of ruining natural beauty.
p8896
aVI'd agree, that isn't ideal.
p8897
aVBut it seems to me to be a small price to pay for confronting climate change.
p8898
aVIf we don't act now, or we merely pay lip service by adopting token uneconomic measures as appeasement (offshore wind), then the price to pay in the future will be much higher.

aV\u000a&gt;Whilst I personally wouldn't completely rule out nuclear, I'm a long way from being convinced that it's one of our best tools.
p8901
aVThen you have done next to no research on the matter.\u000a
p8902
aVAnd where, in your post, can I find evidence of your research?
p8903
aVif you want to make the case for nuclear being cheaper, then please do so.
p8904
aVJust read this: http://www.withouthotair.com/\u000a\u000aYou will discover that there is no way that wind power could provide all of our energy needs, even if we covered 70% of the country with perfectly efficient wind turbines.
p8905
aVWind *does* make a cheap and useful contribution, but it's not enough on its own.
p8906
aVNuclear could provide all the power we need.
p8907
aV&gt; You will discover that there is no way that wind power could provide all of our energy needs\u000a\u000aI don't disagree.
p8908
aVI am simply disagreeing with the emphasis some posters have placed on nuclear when it isn't the cheapest source of non-carbon energy available.
p8909
aVUntil we get fusion, nuclear fission is one of the very few technologies that can provide the energy we need to keep our society functioning.
p8910
aVSolar is promising, but it works best in deserts.
p8911
aVSo the UK would need long and vulnerable transmission lines to get useful amounts of power from North Africa.
p8912
aVBut what the Greens tend to conveniently forget/ignore is that wind can only ever, I mean EVER, even if we get it to as best as we think we ever can, be used as a supplement to a main power source.
p8913
aVIt can, reduce your use of that main fuel part of the time.
p8914
aVIt's not constant and it's not predictable.
p8915
aVWe can't store energy, so even if we built as much as we theoretically needed (more on this in a bit) it still wouldn't be able to power us.
p8916
aVSo if we dive totally into wind, which is what the greens suggest, then we'd either have to go big nuclear, or stick with coal.
p8917
aVSo yes, lets build windfarms where we can, but lets not pretend that that is in any way going to solve the problem of carbon emmisons.
p8918
aVWind is a distraction, and the Green party knows this, but they're so stuck in their 60's era anti nuclear thinking that they would rather distract than actually take steps to stop climate change.
p8919
aVTo do that, you HAVE to go nuclear, there is no other realistic option.
p8920
aVAnd going back to the issue of space, I urge you to watch this interesting and informative talk by David Mackay who explains about energy generation per land area.
p8921
aVThere is a lot more wrong with wind than it's lack of reliability.
p8922
aVhttp://www.ted.com/talks/david_mackay_a_reality_check_on_renewables
p8923
aV&gt; Three completely independent reports on the wind variability issue appeared in June and July 2009, all with the same message: the variability of wind needs to be taken into account, but it does not make the grid unmanageable; and the additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.
p8924
aV...\u000a\u000a&gt; The report quantifies the additional costs of variability due to all causes (additional short-term reserve, extra backup for peak demand periods, and constraints when wind production exceeds consumer demand).
p8925
aVIt suggests that these costs, with 40% of the electricity supply coming from wind, might add about 5.5% to domestic electricity bills.
p8926
aVhttp://www.claverton-energy.com/wind-energy-variability-new-reports.html
p8927
aVSo what I said then?
p8928
aVAssuming 40% of your power comes from wind when it's windy, and we magically have space for it, and we don't mind the occasional brownouts.
p8929
aVyou're still burning coal for 60%-100% of the energy depending on the weather.
p8930
aVHow is that better than the same amount of wind if you so cared, but then 60%-100% nuclear?
p8931
aVI've already shown information that demonstrates brownouts won't occur.
p8932
aVYou're not paying attention.
p8933
aVThere are also other forms of alternative power in addition to wind.
p8934
aVAnd, as I've said repeatedly, although no-one seems to pay attention, I don't completely rule out nuclear power.
p8935
aVI just don't see it as necessarily being the main component of our response to global warming as some previous posters seem to insist on.
p8936
aVWell actually that link didn't address the issue of brownouts it just said "dont' worry about it" and then had busted links, but lets assume that's not an issue though for now for simplicity sake.
p8937
aVWhat other form of energy would you have as your main power provider, since it can't be wind, or solar, or hydro for obvious reasons.
p8938
aVWhat would you use to power 60% (if we're going with the best case) to 100% of the power (when the weather isn't ideal) of our power?
p8939
aVOh dear.
p8940
aVCongratulations on basing your opinion on one aspect of cost and nothing else. 
p8941
aVNice assumption you made there.
p8942
aVI don't base my opinion solely on cost, which is why I don't completely rule out nuclear.
p8943
aVIf cost was the only factor in deciding between forms of alternative energy, I would rule nuclear out.
p8944
aVNow do you actually have any point to make, or are you just here for baseless one liners?
p8945
aVOnshore wind is a terrible idea.
p8946
aVCompletely unnecessary.
p8947
aVIf you want wind turbines you can go stick them where they have the least impact on people.
p8948
aVOut at sea, where funnily enough they produce more energy.
p8949
aVNow then.
p8950
aVWind Turbines are not innovative.
p8951
aVThere are organisations that are looking to tap into wind better.
p8952
aVThis involves operating turbines at higher altitudes.
p8953
aVTheir proposals are for tethered turbines not structures as the higher you go the bigger the wind turbine structure has to be.
p8954
aVOrganisations are proposing systems that can produce the same energy, at half the cost and with 90% the resources of current wind turbines.
p8955
aVAlso as the wind is more consistent at higher altitudes they would generate electricity 66% of the time as opposed to just 33%.
p8956
aVIt is important to note the wind turbines as we see them in the UK won't get any cheaper than they are.
p8957
aVThey cost what they cost.
p8958
aVAlmost all household electricity will be provided by de-centralized solar over the coming decades.
p8959
aVThe cost of solar is decreasing, while the performance is increasing.
p8960
aVThis is at a time when battery technology is also improving and we will perhaps see a major breakthrough in storage technology in the next 10 years.
p8961
aVBut it is important to note that renewable methods are not effective at being reliable or generating large amounts of electricity.
p8962
aVWe need this for our manufacturing base and very high density areas.
p8963
aVSo we have two options, fossil fuels or nuclear.
p8964
aVNuclear has it's obvious benefits over fossil fuels.
p8965
aVBut nuclear energy is a part of our trajectory as a species.
p8966
aVWe will not advance as a society without it.
p8967
aVWe will not explore the universe and colonize other planets and moons without it.
p8968
aVBeing anti nuclear and anti GM is as anti science as you can get.
p8969
aVWe will not find a cure for cancers and other age related diseases without genetic modification.
p8970
aVThe train for the Green's will not stop at food.
p8971
aVIt will expand out to all genetic modification. 
p8972
aVOffshore wind is a much more expensive way of generating electricity than onshore.
p8973
aVThe only reason our politicians like it is because they are afraid to stand up to nimbys.
p8974
aV20% more.
p8975
aVNot much.
p8976
aVBut care to address anything else. 
p8977
aVOk - I can only give you my opinions, which don't completely match those of the green party.
p8978
aVHowever they are close enough that I'm happy to vote Green.
p8979
aV&gt; If you want wind turbines you can go stick them where they have the least impact on people.
p8980
aVOut at sea, where funnily enough they produce more energy\u000a\u000aOnshore wind is considerably cheaper than offshore wind.
p8981
aVAnd there are plenty of areas where they could be sited with minimal impact on most people.
p8982
aVPart of the problem for the mainstream parties is that the people who are impacted tend to be wealthy and politically influential country land owners, many of whom represent the vestiges of our aristocracy.
p8983
aVDid you know 50% of the land in Scotland is owned by only 432 people?
p8984
aVI don't care if these people have their view spoilt.
p8985
aVWe have a planet to save.
p8986
aV**GMO:** I've got nothing whatsoever against research into genetics, and I'd be happy to support it for medical use.
p8987
aVHowever, when it comes to GM crops, I do have a problem trusting some of the large agri-chemical companies involved, many of whom have a history of sharp business practices and deceit.
p8988
aVUltimately in order to seriously confront global warming, then we will first necessarily have to confront global capitalism, since a society based on continual acquisition is not compatible with sustainability.
p8989
aVOnce that's done then maybe it will be possible to create a framework in which GM crops may be a fruitful way forwards.
p8990
aV**Your science fiction fantasies:** We are an enormous way away from any meaningful space colonization.
p8991
aVIn order to get there we will need to deal with shorter term issues, such as climate change, first.
p8992
aV&gt; renewable methods are not effective at being reliable or generating large amounts of electricity\u000a\u000aActually, the best method of reliably and cheaply generating large amounts of electricity is renewable.
p8993
aVIt's a pity hydroelectric isn't equally available in all areas.
p8994
aVHowever industry could potentially be relocated to areas where it is available.
p8995
aVThis already happens to an extent (e.g.
p8996
aValuminium smelters in Scandinavia)\u000a\u000aReliability of supply is why, in the short term, I personally wouldn't completely rule out nuclear.
p8997
aVHowever I would also support further research into improving energy storage methods, where there is potential for enormous progress.
p8998
aVIf either cheap energy storage, or transmission, becomes available, then the case for nuclear disappears.
p8999
aV&gt;Actually, the best method of reliably and cheaply generating large amounts of electricity is renewable.
p9000
aVIt's a pity hydroelectric isn't equally available in all areas.
p9001
aVExactly why a logical conversation can not be had with yourself or the Green party.
p9002
aVWhat fucking relevance is that?
p9003
aV&gt;However I would also support further research\u000a\u000aWhat does that even mean?
p9004
aVAllow the private sector to innovate.
p9005
aVThat is what it does.
p9006
aVIn terms of a government they should be setting competitions with rewards not forcing their wind mill agenda on people.
p9007
aV&gt;Your science fiction fantasies\u000a\u000aThe fact that you call them fantasies is alarming.
p9008
aVSo you propose that we stall innovation and progress until a time when we actually want to explore other planets, moons and colonize them? 
p9009
aV&gt; Allow the private sector to innovate.
p9010
aVThat is what it does.
p9011
aVYou've swallowed too many capitalist myths.
p9012
aVMany of the most major technological innovations of the past century, including the nuclear power that you advocate, and the internet on which we converse, come from government innovation.
p9013
aV&gt; The fact that you call them fantasies is alarming.
p9014
aVSo you propose that we stall innovation and progress until a time when we actually want to explore other planets, moons and colonize them?
p9015
aVNo, of course not.
p9016
aVYou're just attacking a straw man.
p9017
aVHowever Space colonies didn't happen in 1999, and they aren't going to happen for the next several decades either.
p9018
aVThe challenges to overcome are enormous.
p9019
aV&gt;come from government innovation.
p9020
aVOriginates and then the private sector takes over.
p9021
aVWhich is why my point still stands.
p9022
aVIt is the fact that you are backing shitty wind mills as some sort of radical solution.
p9023
aVhttp://www.google.com/makani/challenge/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.google.com/makani/solution/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.google.com/makani/technology/\u000a\u000a
p9024
aV&gt; It is the fact that you are backing shitty wind mills as some sort of radical solution.
p9025
aVAnd it is a fact that you are backing nuclear power as some sort of radical solution.
p9026
aVIt isn't.
p9027
aVNuclear has been with us for decades, and we know what to expect.
p9028
aVWe can already measure it's performance and it's less cost effective than "shitty wind mills".
p9029
aVAs for your links, it's an interesting technology.
p9030
aVMaybe once it's developed it will represent another alternative to nuclear.
p9031
aVIt won't represent an alternative to nuclear it represents an alternative to shitty wind mills.
p9032
aVLook to the future and stop looking at the past and present.
p9033
aVYour proposals and the ones of the Green party are incredibly dull and boring and uninformed.
p9034
aVLiterally no research has been conducted by the Green party into such technologies as I have linked to you.
p9035
aVIt is not a progressive party. 
p9036
aV&gt;Look to the future and stop looking at the past and present.
p9037
aVAs I implied earlier - you are basing your arguments on science fiction fantasies.
p9038
aV&gt; Literally no research has been conducted by the Green party into such technologies as I have linked to you\u000a\u000aConducting research is not the job of political parties, but of scientists, and the Green party has pledged to increase funding into research for alternative energy sources, such as this appears to be.
p9039
aV&gt; Your proposals and the ones of the Green party are incredibly dull and boring and uninformed ...It is not a progressive party.
p9040
aVSo how does that differ from any of the mainstream parties?
p9041
aVThe job of political parties should be to govern, not to publish futurist manifestos.
p9042
aVYou should also be made aware that the term "Progressive" tends to be used in mainstream politics for parties favouring income redistribution, which definitely does include the Green party.\u000a
p9043
aV&gt; science fiction fantasies\u000a\u000aWhat like the links I gave you? \u000a\u000a
p9044
aV&gt;Nice assumption you made there.
p9045
aVI don't base my opinion solely on cost, which is why I don't completely rule out nuclear.
p9046
aVIf cost was the only factor in deciding between forms of alternative energy, I would rule nuclear out.
p9047
aVYou would rule out our cheapest long term solution?
p9048
aVOkay....\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9049
aVBecause nuclear isn't cheapest.
p9050
aVBut it provides more power over the long term.
p9051
aVThe French have invested more into Nuclear power than they have wind power despite having a larger land mass to population ratio to do so.
p9052
aVMaintenance on large areas of wind farms is extremely expensive and despite animal farming not being affected much land for crops is already in short supply here.
p9053
aVNot bashing wind but wouldn't it be more effective to force all new buildings designed for families to have solar panels and a small wind turbine on top of the house.
p9054
aVThe government could then put together a committee to review existing household structures that would be the best for such a scheme to be iplimented on and subsidise company's or families to have these added to the homes.
p9055
aVIf done over the course of the next 30 years this could tackle a large part of our co2 emissions.
p9056
aVAlso what happens when nuclear fusion becomes possible?
p9057
aVI predict it'll be ready within 15-30 years time.
p9058
aVThe life time of 1 or 2 wind turbines.
p9059
aVThe money we've invested on green alternatives will be too much and we won't be able to afford a fusion plant for say the next 30 years after that.
p9060
aVAt which point the price will have increased substantially as companies will be wanting to win multi billion contracts with countries like China, India and Brazil all rising super powers.
p9061
aVEdit: Apparently spell check thinks oval means Brazil.
p9062
aV&gt; Maintenance on large areas of wind farms is extremely expensive\u000a\u000aSo are waste storage/disposal and decomissioning costs for nuclear.
p9063
aVInsurance costs are also extremely expensive for nuclear (which is the reason the US abandoned building new nuclear power stations)\u000a\u000a&gt; If operators had to be insured for the whole potential damage, then, according to calculations by Versicherungsforen Leipzig GmbH for German nuclear power plants, this would lead to a price increase for nuclear energy of \u20ac0.139 to \u20ac2.36 per kWh.
p9064
aVCalculations for France lead to a price increase of \u20ac0.047 per kWh.
p9065
aV&gt; This insurance cost would raise current electricity prices for the French nuclear industry by 60%, for the German industry by at least 100%, while electricity prices for households would increase by 25% in France and by 50% or more in Germany.
p9066
aVhttp://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2265605/the_true_cost_of_disaster_insurance_makes_nuclear_power_uncompetitive.html\u000a\u000aNot requiring nuclear plants to be fully insured represents a hidden and enormous government subsidy for nuclear relative to other power sources (apart from coal, which somehow manages to dodge paying the cost of the enormous health problems it causes).
p9067
aV&gt; Not bashing wind but wouldn't it be more effective to force all new buildings designed for families to have solar panels and a small wind turbine on top of the house.
p9068
aVIn the UK wind is more cost efficient than solar.
p9069
aVHowever if we can find some way to cheaply transmit power from the Mediterranean area...
p9070
aVSolar may however still be useful for providing a more balanced and diverse supply.
p9071
aV&gt; Also what happens when nuclear fusion becomes possible?
p9072
aVThat's not likely to happen any time soon.
p9073
aVHowever if it does become possible, and it is cost effective, then I'd fully support it.
p9074
aV&gt; The money we've invested on green alternatives will be too much and we won't be able to afford a fusion plant for say the next 30 years after that.
p9075
aVThat's ridiculous.
p9076
aVIf a fusion plant becomes profitable then it will be built.
p9077
aVSpending money on wind now won't significantly reduce the production capacity we have available in the future.
p9078
aVCathartis is providing you with false information.
p9079
aVCurrent wind electricity generation as we see them in the form of wind turbine towers is as cheap as that specific technology will get.
p9080
aVIn fact when the subsidies are removed the cost will go up.
p9081
aVHowever the future of household electricity supply is de-centralized solar.
p9082
aVEven in the UK.
p9083
aVDon't fall for the lies about how solar is too ineffective in the UK due to the weather.
p9084
aVAs Elon Musk states, only 10-20% of solar generation depends on the specific ''bright light''.
p9085
aVThe cost of solar will continue to decrease while the efficiency increases.
p9086
aVSome physicists highlighting that one day solar panels will be like wall paper in cost and physical nature.
p9087
aVThe problem currently for de-centralization is power storage.
p9088
aVThis is seeing decreasing costs and also increases in efficiency.
p9089
aVOf course the obvious benefit to have de-centralized power is that you do not pay any rates.
p9090
aVGoing renewable is no guarantee of electricity prices going down, in fact they have gone up.
p9091
aVDe-centralized power is an upfront investment.
p9092
aVYou are paying fror something that would last for 20+ years.
p9093
aVWhere as thanks to inflation the amount for centralized power will continue to go up year on year (in general).
p9094
aVExpect a massive shift to de-centralized solar household power in the UK during the 2020's. 
p9095
aVI think most Green Party members can be brought over to that, those who understand science at least.
p9096
aVThat's why I said lend your vote.
p9097
aVThey share your goals, probably, but not your methods. 
p9098
aVI'm afraid for me, I can't support until they change that.
p9099
aVI'm an ecologist, so my priorities are scientific truth, and the environment, so I can't support a party that [produces fake studies about leukaemia clusters in Wales supposedly from the Sellafield plant](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/) and then even after they know that the study was false [CONTINUE to cite it on their website](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html) in order to turn public opinion against the only way our country can continue it's standard of living without continuing to pollute at such extraordinary levels.\u000a
p9100
aVWhat a great post!
p9101
aVI was only going to suggest on the OP's topic, perhaps the major Green story is the conversion of Liberal Democrat voters over to the Greens in the EU Elections?
p9102
aVThe Greens seem to be targetting them.
p9103
aVI think this is part of it, I'm not liking labour because of their civil rights record last time they were in office, I refuse to vote lib dem until the members who promised to vote one way and then voted another are gone (so a long time) and so what am I left with as a dirty commie lefty liberal?
p9104
aVGreens probably, but then as I say above, they're working against democracy by spreading misinformation.
p9105
aVSo today I'm voting Labour... as a best of a bad bunch.
p9106
aVMy problem with your argument is that they could just as easily say "look how many people voted for these policies, they must agree with us!
p9107
aV" Which is a strong disincentive to change them.
p9108
aVI would much rather they looked into WHY people weren't voting for them, and see how many young-lefty voters (many of whom would *love* a viable alternative to Labour) they're leaving out there because of their anti-science policies.
p9109
aVSpeaking from an entirely personal perspective they would also have to sort out their economic policies for me to vote for them, as their current ones are a fantasy. 
p9110
aVThat's true, it could also be interpreted as a measure of support for such policies.
p9111
aVThe only thing is putting them up to public scrutiny, which they're not going to get if they're out of the limelight.
p9112
aVAnd as an aside, which of their economic policies do you disagree with?
p9113
aVI wrote a long-ish [comment in another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/249mwl/why_you_should_be_voting_for_the_pirate_party/ch56pdj) about some of my problems with Green economic policy.
p9114
aVSimply put - they ignore reality.
p9115
aVIt's a manifesto written with the certainty that it will never be implemented and they'll never be called on it.
p9116
aVPeople who vote green do so for one of few reasons ("the environment" being top of their priorities, hard-lefties disillusioned with Labour, or a straight protest vote - I'd love to see research on more nuanced positions).
p9117
aVAs things stand (2010 manifesto) they ignore reality.
p9118
aVRenewables simply cannot compensate for the base load in electricity supply we lose when the next tranche of power stations are closed down.
p9119
aVThe numbers simply don't add up.
p9120
aVSo we need an alternative, there is a sensible conversation to be had around if that should be gas, nuclear or a combination of both, but the Green party don't want to be involved with it.
p9121
aVTheir economic policy is a lefties wet dream - but again, the numbers simply do not add up.
p9122
aVIt ignores the reality of living in a society with free movement of capital, and while the right over-state the perils of that as a matter of routine (we are still a nation of 70m consumers, demand exists, supply will too) there is no question that there is a point for every business where it simply doesn't make sense to be based here. 
p9123
aVMakes sense, thanks for explaining that.
p9124
aVStill, their economic policies, even if they are a little too radical, make them an alternative for those who believe that Labour has shifted too far in favour of big business over workers' rights.
p9125
aVI understand the concerns about economic policies going too far left, but the obscene increases in inequality suggest that the opposite is the case under decades of neo-liberalism.
p9126
aVNot only that, but favouring major multinationals over small to medium enterprises discourages competition and local prosperity. 
p9127
aVIt's not that they're radical that I object to... it's that the numbers don't add up.
p9128
aVI'm not even talking in a complicated modelled sort of way, I mean they are promising HUGE deficits from day 1... while I'm no hawk (Keynes was right, both sides of his principles), it's unsustainable, and with the current mood in financial markets we'd be in trouble.
p9129
aVAgain, real world over pipe-dreams.\u000a
p9130
aVWhy's a libsoc advocating voting if you don't mind me asking?
p9131
aVBecause I think we should be pragmatic about voting and democracy.
p9132
aVIt doesn't have to be a symbol of consent for the status quo.
p9133
aVEvery vote for say, the Greens, makes the establishment parties' majority that bit slimmer.
p9134
aVIt's a statement that you *exist* politically.
p9135
aVThat your vote will be counted.
p9136
aVAnd the more people think of their vote not as an instant payback, but an investment in politics, the better.
p9137
aVIt shows that you are not politically apathetic.
p9138
aVAnd that's incredibly important.
p9139
aVIt takes 5 minutes to go out and vote, to show that you are paying attention and you do *not* consent to the main parties' political mandate. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9140
aVThey have moderated on many things in the previous years, and I'm sure if their supporters wish it, the nuclear policy can change too.
p9141
aVTheir policy statements don't seem to be changing on that, and [they still reference studies](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html) that claim nuclear is killing people, [even though the study is known to have been completely fabricated](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/).
p9142
aVI'd like them to change, but I can't vote for them until they do.
p9143
aVThe green party also wants to completely open up immigration:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries.
p9144
aV&gt; \u000a&gt; In step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.
p9145
aVAnd:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG405 Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are a lot more problems with the green party than just their anti-science stance.\u000a 
p9146
aVI don't mind increased ease of immigration process.
p9147
aVAnd I especially don't see an issue with bringing immigrants already here into the legal working, taxable,  non-gang run fold.
p9148
aVIt lets them intergrate without fear of deportation and it robs the gangs of their power and income.
p9149
aVEasing the process is not the same thing as reducing controls.
p9150
aVCan you really not see any problem with this?
p9151
aVI can see why some might, but I mean that's the point of democracy, vote for the guys who most agree with your views.
p9152
aVSo like conservatives want to increase controls yeh (?)?
p9153
aVI disagree, but I think it's a legitimate viewpoint and SOME party should have it.
p9154
aVThe Green's anti science stuff though is spreading misinformation and refusing to acknowledge facts.
p9155
aVThats different because thats preventing people from making an informed choice.
p9156
aVPeople think green = environment, green say nuclear power is super dangerous and they tell loads of (false) stats about their harm (and also somehow call it elitest and hypocritical... with no explanation) and so people think nuclear = bad for environment, when almost all experts disagree and have for decades.
p9157
aVSame with their anti GM stance and spreading lies about its use, its risk, its benefits and activly tell people to smash scientific trials based on false facts.
p9158
aVThat's not a different viewpoint, thats shaping people's viewpoibt based on a lie.
p9159
aVIt would be like if Torys wanted to lower immigration and so told people we need to because 90% of immigrants were found to have built a bomb in 12 months of arriving.
p9160
aVThey don't say that, they tell the (selected) truth like all politicians and argue their view, which is fine.\u000a\u000a
p9161
aVI'm curious.
p9162
aVCan you give examples of these "false stats"?
p9163
aVIt's also not hard to note that the nuclear industry has a history of issuing false stats, starting with their original promises of "electricity too cheap to meter", and more recently illustrated by the discoveries made by the investigations following the Fukushima disaster.
p9164
aVWell the famous one was [when they went on about supposed leukaemia clusters in Wales supposedly from the Sellafield plant](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/)., when in fact when people went to repeat the study they found that the scientists (led by the Green party head of scientific communication at the time, and still linked to them) had just made up numbers, made up everything, there were no clusters, there was no danger at all\u000a\u000aThis is a study they [CONTINUE to cite on their website, despite it being proven to be patently falsified](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html)\u000a\u000aAs for Fukishima, what false stats do you mean?
p9165
aVThere is a  difference between "later found to be untrue" to "intentionally releasing false info".
p9166
aVThere's a lot of intentional false info around fukishima, but it's not from the nuclear side.
p9167
aVWhat you need to know about fukishima is that a total worst case scenario happened at a modern nuclear reactor, and nobody died of anything to do with the nuclear aspect.
p9168
aVNobody is predicted to **die of** cancer because of the Fukishima incident, not even the workers who went in to help clear it up (Don't get me wrong, they went in thinking they would die, and they were bloody heros, but luckily, it wasn't as bad as thought and all tests seem to show they'll be fine, it's like they flew in a plane a few times).
p9169
aV**Edit: in bold**
p9170
aV&gt; As for Fukishima, what false stats do you mean?
p9171
aVI recall several examples.
p9172
aVHere's one that I managed to find after a short search:\u000a\u000ahttp://enenews.com/tepco-admits-to-reporting-false-radiation-levels-for-past-2-years-at-fukushima\u000a\u000a&gt; Nobody is predicted to get cancer because of the Fukishima incident\u000a\u000aPlease source this claim.
p9173
aVI find it hard to believe given the levels of radiation exposure the workers at the plant suffered.
p9174
aVAlso, the world health organisation disagrees with your claim:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/28/us-japan-nuclear-cancer-idUSBRE91R0D420130228\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you've been reading misleading propaganda from the nuclear industry.
p9175
aVEdit: Also, the green party web site link points to an archived 2004 report.
p9176
aVI see nothing wrong in it's presence.
p9177
aVWould you expect mainstream science to purge it's archives of all papers that are subsequently found to be incorrect?
p9178
aVOr for newspapers to remove any stories from their archives that are subsequently found to be false?
p9179
aVSorry, I should correct myself on a re-read of what I put, nobody is predicted **to die** of cancer caused by it.
p9180
aVThere is a slight increase predicted in the number of very rare quite treatable cancers in certain people who can get regular checkups.
p9181
aVBTW, that Reuters article on the WHO report doesn't understand what relative risk is.
p9182
aVRead the actual report.
p9183
aVWhat I've been reading, is scientific articles published in proper peer reviewed journal, like those Green science reports WERE NOT.
p9184
aVAnd yes actually, science DOES put massive "THIS PAPER HAS BEEN RETRACTED" notices on papers that are found to be false.
p9185
aVand in many cases remove from online (which can be accessed on request, again with massive "RETRACTED" notices on.
p9186
aVBecause the intentional distribution of false or misleading science is an incredibly serious offence in the scientific community)
p9187
aVYep I had almost this exact conversation with someone couple of days ago.
p9188
aVI agree with the Greens on many issues but as long as they spread misinformation, oppose nuclear and don't put forward any better solutions, I'll never vote for them.
p9189
aVThey'll be forever confined to the Brighton new age hipster crowd.
p9190
aVIn fact, in many respects the Greens are the flip side of UKIP - just appealing to emotions and fears, with little rationality. 
p9191
aVI'm pretty sure ukip don't even believe in climate change.
p9192
aVThey do not.

aVThe Greens' migration policies are excellent.
p9200
aVThey are the only ones not pandering to the knuckle-draggers.
p9201
aVDo you also agree on their policy to remove any preference for skilled immigrants?
p9202
aVThe arguments for preferring "skilled" to "unskilled" migrants bemuse me.
p9203
aVEssentially, they amount to "people can come in and take *your* job, but we're going to give government protection to the jobs of those idiots who didn't pay attention in school".
p9204
aVOverall, I favour a global free-movement regime.
p9205
aVAnd your argument is "We shouldn't prefer people who are actually skilled and useful to society, but should let everyone, including people who didn't pay attention in school".
p9206
aVHow strange.
p9207
aVIt's called freedom.
p9208
aVNo, no it's not.
p9209
aVYes.
p9210
aVYes it is.
p9211
aVRemoving all immigration controls would make us all better off.
p9212
aVThere are sober estimates that it would [double global GDP](http://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/).
p9213
aVAnd we would all be much freer in a world where governments don't take it upon themselves to tell us where we can and can't live.
p9214
aV&gt; There are sober estimates that it would double global GDP.
p9215
aVAnd how would it affect our country?
p9216
aVLess than 1% of Muslims think that homosexuality should be legal.
p9217
aVWhat would happen to the rights of gays in this country if a large population of Muslims moved here?
p9218
aVYou can't just ignore the effect that the influx of a different culture would have.
p9219
aVAh, the inevitable islamophobia.
p9220
aVMillions of Muslims live in the UK already.
p9221
aVThey sky hasn't fallen in yet.
p9222
aVYet.
p9223
aVThe Muslim youth is highly radicalised.
p9224
aVSome quick quotes:\u000a\u000a&gt; Forty per cent of younger Muslims said they would want their children to attend an Islamic school\u000a\u000a&gt; Three out of four young Muslims would prefer Muslim women to "choose to wear the veil or hijab," \u000a\u000a&gt; One in eight young Muslims said they admired groups such as al-Qa'eda that "are prepared to fight the West".
p9225
aV&gt; 36 per cent of the young people questioned said they believed that a Muslim who converts to another religion should be "punished by death.
p9226
aV" \u000a\u000a&gt; Forty per cent of Muslims between the ages of 16 and 24 said they would prefer to live under sharia law in Britain\u000a\u000a&gt; UK Muslims (in 2006) comprised just 2% of the population, but committed 25% of all anti-Homosexual crimes \u000a\u000aJoin /r/exmuslim some time and read about Islam from their point of view.
p9227
aVAll religious extremists pose a threat to modern civilization.
p9228
aVThat's just as true of crazy Christians in the US as it is of crazy Muslims wherever.
p9229
aVThe solution is the same as it ever was: education, trade, commerce.
p9230
aVYou won't broaden an extremist's world view by locking them away in a grindingly poor 3rd world country.
p9231
aVEven if you keep them out, don't think it will make you safe: The World Trade Centre bombing was planned in Afghanistan and implemented by Saudis.
p9232
aV&gt; All religious extremists pose a threat to modern civilization.
p9233
aVYes, but remember that your idea of "extremists" represents around half of the Muslims in the world.
p9234
aV(Around 50% of the world's Muslims believe that you should be killed for apostasy).
p9235
aVAnd that's just a single measure.
p9236
aVIf you go by treatment of homosexuality, then the vast majority of Muslims are extremists.
p9237
aV&gt; You won't broaden an extremist's world view by locking them away in a grindingly poor 3rd world country.
p9238
aVYou also won't broaden their world view by just letting them come over here.
p9239
aVMuslims in this country are **more** extreme (roughly double the percentage) than their parents.
p9240
aVIt is the **children** that have become extreme.
p9241
aV&gt; Even if you keep them out, don't think it will make you safe\u000a\u000aSafety is relative.
p9242
aVThe question is - will we be safer with extremists in our country or out?\u000a\u000a
p9243
aV&gt; The question is - will we be safer with extremists in our country or out?
p9244
aVPersonally, I'd be much happier if we could deport bigoted fuckwits.
p9245
aVIf young British Muslims are more radicalised than their parents, then it's a reaction to over a decade of hysterical islamophobic scaremongering from the likes of you.
p9246
aV&gt; Personally, I'd be much happier if we could deport bigoted fuckwits.
p9247
aVOr just not let them in in the first place.
p9248
aV&gt; then it's a reaction to over a decade of hysterical islamophobic scaremongering from the likes of you.
p9249
aVThe British Muslims are nowhere near as bad as many other Muslim countries.
p9250
aV&gt; A 2010 Pew Research Center poll showed that 84% of Egyptian Muslims believe those who leave Islam should be punished by death.
p9251
aVWill you blame that on me too?
p9252
aVIran kills people for apostasy.
p9253
aVIs that my fault too?
p9254
aVIslam is the problem.
p9255
aVYet you prefer to stick your head in the sand and somehow blame the people who point this out.\u000a\u000a
p9256
aV&gt; Iran kills people for apostasy.
p9257
aVIs that my fault too?
p9258
aVI'd say that's mainly the US's fault.
p9259
aVCutting off Iran from world trade and cultural engagement has given all the power to their religious hard-liners.
p9260
aVIn general, Iran is a populous, well-educated, moderate country.
p9261
aVTheir Islamic Revolution was an extreme reaction to Western meddling that had lead to the Shah's totalitarian regime.
p9262
aVIf they'd been left to get on with it, Iran would have been reintegrated into the global system by now.
p9263
aVHave you even even *met* an Iranian?
p9264
aVYou realise that Christians were every bit as "scary" as scary Muslims, only a couple of centuries ago?
p9265
aVHell, there are millions of scary Christians even today.
p9266
aV(Btw I take my quotes from respectable polls.
p9267
aVIf you doubt any, just ask and I'll cite.
p9268
aV)
aVHow would the state be able to afford to support so many people?
p9269
aVWhy would the state have to support them?
p9270
aVLook at the recent addition of several relatively poor Eastern European countries to the EU's free movement regime: That hasn't added *any* extra burden to the UK public purse.
p9271
aVQuite the contrary - these extra immigrants have helped keep taxes lower for the rest of us.
p9272
aVhttp://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/great-uk-immigration-scare
p9273
aVPeople for whom immigration is a priority probably aren't voting green anyway.
p9274
aVThere's other parties that scratch that itch
p9275
aVLike which?
p9276
aVUKIP are a terrible choice for other reasons.
p9277
aVlibdems come somewhat close.
p9278
aVSpecificly ukip :)\u000aTories too.
p9279
aVNow I don't give toss about immigration, we could probably do with more of it.
p9280
aVI do care about energy policy, I do care about environmental policy and I do care about rational economic policy.
p9281
aVThe Tories have failed on all three
p9282
aVThey also want to completely dismantle the armed services.
p9283
aV&gt;PD200 The citizens and communities within a green society will create for themselves rewarding work, adequate housing, material security, appropriate education, accessible and sensitive public services, a secure present and hope for the future, all within the framework of a sustainable, ecologically benign economy.
p9284
aVThe world we build for our children will not depend on exploitative economic relationships or on new roles for outdated security alliances, but on the acceptance of our global interdependence.
p9285
aVThe present environmental destruction threatens our common survival; we have no choice but to build common and co-operative responses.
p9286
aV&gt;PD201 Warfare in the context of present offensive weapon systems, nuclear or non-nuclear, is so dangerous that it can not be regarded as a sane instrument of policy.
p9287
aVCommon security measures seek to build trust and co-operation, to prevent destructive conflict, to build a just local and global society based upon fairness.
p9288
aVIn a Common Security framework potential adversaries co-operate to enhance each other's security and well being, rather than competing for military advantage in a spiralling arms race.
p9289
aVAn important element of common security is the progressive reduction and eventual abolition by treaty of all offensive weaponry.
p9290
aV&gt;PD300 The policies espoused in the rest of this PSS are all intended to build a culture of trust among peoples, as well as the primary goals they proclaim.
p9291
aVIn particular, International (IP) and European (EU) policy is intended to create a world where regions collaborate where necessary and interact peaceably.
p9292
aV&gt;PD301 We would promote town twinning, exchange visits, pen friend schemes and Internet-based methods for learning about other countries and cultures by direct contact.
p9293
aVOne of the main purposes of embassies would be to learn about culture and current affairs of their host countries by immersion in a wide variety of local activities.
p9294
aVThe UN should provide significant support for building effective law and order systems that are not affected by corruption, and for support of free and democratic elections.
p9295
aV&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation.
p9296
aVCommitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary.
p9297
aVAny threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.
p9298
aVI really REALLY want to know what the fuck they've been smoking.
p9299
aVTown Twinning?
p9300
aVREALLY?
p9301
aV&gt; Town Twinning?
p9302
aVREALLY?
p9303
aVWhat's the issue with town twinning?
p9304
aVAs a viable part of a defence and security policy?
p9305
aVI can think of many other things that would actually be a much more effective defence and security policy than that.
p9306
aVLike waking up in the morning.
p9307
aVIt's part of a defence policy which is predicated on the idea that we're safest when we have greater levels of international understanding and cooperation.
p9308
aVA small part of that is town twinning. 
p9309
aVIt costs twenty to forty thousand a year, can be turned off and on at the drop of a hat, and really, who cares about it?
p9310
aVBut explain their rationale for thinking that it's more than purely a PR gesture.
p9311
aV(P.S.
p9312
aVDid those towns in Russia care they got untwinned from wherever because of Russias gay rights?
p9313
aVHint: The answer is no.
p9314
aV)\u000a\u000a&gt;Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary.
p9315
aVAny threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.
p9316
aVWhat this means in effect is that they believe they can mothball all of this equipment without needing to use it, which will mean a sell off because that kind of equipment cannot be just left laying over there thataway otherwise it degrades and deteriorates beyond use without constant maintenance.
p9317
aVSo if we sell off all the equipment then we might as well not bother having any soldiers, sailors, airmen or marines because they won't have any equipment to train with.
p9318
aVSo that means all the institutional knowledge is lost too.
p9319
aVSo please, we have town twinning which does bugger all in the grand scheme of things, and we have no equipment and no institutional knowledge either.
p9320
aVThe ramp up time on that is far and away going to be longer than anything the green party can imagine.
p9321
aVLet's take a look at the Yugoslav wars shall we?
p9322
aVIt took roughly a year for the Yugoslav wars to kick off, two years for the UN to intervene with MARITIME GUARD and then 3 years for the UN to try to intervene on the ground with UNPROFOR and in the air with Operation Deliberate Force.
p9323
aVUnless the Greens think Town Twinning is going to work to stop people like Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from committing atrocities.
p9324
aVI'm sure that sending him strongly worded letters saying "Please stop" would have worked.
p9325
aVI'm going to have to say that if the Greens had gotten into power at any time from even 5 years before the start of the conflict with their current proposals then we in the UK would have been able to do absolutely nothing to help to try and rein in the Yugoslav wars.
p9326
aVThe contempt I feel for the greens for this kind of policy and decision making is only but a shadow of the contempt that the rest of Europe would have felt for the UK.
p9327
aVThere was also the Northern Mali Conflict\u000a\u000ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mali_conflict\u000a\u000aAlso how about the Libyan Civil War?
p9328
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya\u000a\u000aI'm sure that begging "please don't do this" would work oh so well.
p9329
aVI'm not going to godwin this thread by talking of appeasement or you know who, but danegeld has never worked in history and I don't see why it would work now.
p9330
aVHow can they possibly consider either of these to be good policies? 
p9331
aVBecause it is estimated that removing all immigration controls would double global GDP?
p9332
aVBecause some people have absolutely no problem with people moving from one place to the other and there needs to be a party that reflects that view?
p9333
aVI like the way you think!
p9334
aVGot a source for that stat though?
p9335
aVhttp://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/great-uk-immigration-scare\u000a\u000aHere's two.

aVThe paper is in the first line of the first link.
p9337
aVDanke
p9338
aVThey also explicitly want to allow immigration through fake marriages:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.
p9339
aVRead the page :  http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html\u000a\u000aThere's just too much to post here.
p9340
aVEdit:  I have to add one more.
p9341
aVThey also want to completely eliminate the preference for skilled workers:\u000a\u000a&gt;  Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.\u000a\u000a
p9342
aVHa, they have this quote:\u000a\u000a"Only after the last tree has been cut down,\u000aOnly after the last river has been poisoned,\u000aOnly after the last fish has been caught,\u000aOnly then will you find that money cannot be eaten.

aV"\u000a\u000ayet want to ban GM foods? 
p9344
aV&gt; yet want to ban GM foods\u000a\u000aNo, they don't.
p9345
aVThey want a moratorium while GMO effects are scientifically assessed and they want to make sure that any modifications are purely beneficial for growers/consumers - not vendors.
p9346
aVAnd yet the only way to actually test GMO effects and doing research is by running trials...\u000a\u000aOh wait.
p9347
aVhttp://greenparty.org.uk/news.html/2012/05/25/why-im-going-to-rothamsted-to-protest-about-their-gm-wheat-trial/
p9348
aVWell, their actual policy stance on GMO is "more research".
p9349
aVThat link is to a comment from a single member two years ago.
p9350
aVOf course, there are plenty of members who are fiercely opposed to GM, yet I am also a member and I am not.
p9351
aVJenny Jones isn't just "a single member" though; she's one of the more prominent politicians in the Green Party.
p9352
aVShe's one that regularly appears in the press, she ran to be London mayor, and she was Deputy Mayor alongside Ken Livingstone for a while, and now she's a member of the house of Lords. 
p9353
aVThey want a moratorium on it in the same way UKIP want a moratorium on Climate Change.
p9354
aVIt's a foregone conclusion to them.
p9355
aVYeah, I love the greens, but their anti-nuclear (as an energy source, not weapons) and anti-GM really makes me mad
p9356
aVnuclear weapon wise I think we should just half our number to save a bit of cash, I think some is as much as a deterrent as lots.
p9357
aVMy theory is that the Green Party will, by the time of the next General Election, have successfully maneuvered themselves into the political space previously occupied by the Lib Dems.
p9358
aVWhat I mean by that is this:  I think many people were shocked when the Lib Dems went into coalition with the Tories, because a lot of people hadn't grasped that the Lib Dems and Tories have long shared a core ideology of free-market capitalism, and for a long time they were, instead, seen in the popular imagination as basically an idealistic, underdog version of Labour for middle-class people.
p9359
aVAnd it's that what I think the Greens are gonna move in on.
p9360
aVThey will be the new idealistic, underdog version of Labour for middle-class people, and as a Labour-voter myself, I genuinely wish them luck with that.
p9361
aVBut the Greens are more to the left of Labour and would benefit poorer people more than the middle class...
p9362
aVFine by me.
p9363
aVThe poorer you are the more you need help, generally speaking.
p9364
aVBut it invalidates /u/wolfbagga's point about the Greens being good for the middle class.
p9365
aVThe Greens are good for the lower class and awful for everyone else - I mean come on, that 'Robin Hood' tax?
p9366
aVYou're assuming everyone just selfishly votes for policies that most benefit them rather than what they think is right.
p9367
aVI don't see how it's selfish to look out for primarily yourself and your family.
p9368
aVSeems like common sense to me, and basic human instinct.
p9369
aV(of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.
p9370
aV"I joined them for selfish reasons"
p9371
aVWell you can be Mr Selfless then, but most people quite clearly do vote for the policies that *they think* would most benefit them. 
p9372
aVSome people do, some people don't.
p9373
aVThe typical green voter doesn't was my point.
p9374
aVhttp://greenparty.org.uk/values/policies-2010/2010manifesto-economy.html\u000a\u000aThere seems to be an awful lot more there aimed at the rich.
p9375
aVTo me it seems that the more money you have the more you're taxed, which is to me fair given current wealth distribution (or lack thereof...).
p9376
aVI meant more that the typical Green voter is middle-class as opposed to working-class, rather than who the policies are aimed at.
p9377
aVYeah you're probably right.
p9378
aVThe lower classes are typically Labour voters and the upper classes typically vote conservative...
p9379
aVI imagine those in the middle get split between the rest of the parties.
p9380
aVSounds good to me.
p9381
aVI disagree.
p9382
aVIn the Lib Dems people see fair social policy but also financial responsibility.
p9383
aVThe greens lack this aspect and the only space they are going to take in my opinion is that of Labour's which I hope they do, Labour is a very strange party ideologically, they're technically left but advocate things such as Internet censorship, foreign wars, increased tuition fees, etc.
p9384
aVI believe there should be a real mainstream left wing party.
p9385
aVI'm actually thinking of voting Green.
p9386
aVI like pretty much everything they have to say.
p9387
aVI think I will vote Green locally, but not at a European level with their policy on immigration.
p9388
aV&gt;MG400: It will not aim to allow increased net migration to Britain other than for humanitarian reasons or as a result of other Green Party policies.
p9389
aVSeems like a non-issue to me.
p9390
aVI believe it is likely that humanitarian issues will increase in the future due to instability - either politically or environmentally.
p9391
aVPersonally I would prefer a stricter policy.
p9392
aVYea it's really too bad about the anti nuclear and anti gm 
p9393
aVI've been thinking about this and I'm not sure that's a reason not to vote for them, in the short term.
p9394
aVSomeone may want to correct me, or provide examples, but I can see it being the case that when a smaller party grows and gains more influence then they will examine various aspects of their policy that are unfeasible or impractical.
p9395
aVCertainly there are people who stand for parties that don't agree with all their policies.
p9396
aV~~The one that leaps to mind is Anne Marie-Waters who is on the National Secular Society council/board of directors, yet is standing for UKIP in the European elections.
p9397
aVUKIP have several demonstrably anti-secular policies, as they're rather 'Britain is a Chrsitian country' oriented.
p9398
aV[Just found this blog post on the subject which might give a background (haven't read it yet).
p9399
aV](http://freethoughtblogs.com/godlessness/2014/04/29/4-questions-for-anne-marie-waters-and-secularists-voting-ukip/)~~\u000a\u000aedit - [following some reading (i.e.
p9400
aVthe blog post one day *after* the one above!

aV) it seems that Anne Marie-Waters has resigned from the NSS.
p9402
aV](http://freethoughtblogs.com/godlessness/2014/04/30/anne-marie-waters-resigns-from-the-nss/) Bugger - I need another example!
p9403
aV(I'm a physicist, ftr - regarding the Green/nuclear thing.
p9404
aVI like nuclear.
p9405
aVGrew up looking at a nuclear power station.
p9406
aVHasn't effected me.
p9407
aVOr affected.
p9408
aVEh.
p9409
aV)
aVThat's a lot fewer o_O points than any other party.
p9410
aVTheir platform is all democratically decided anyway, so probably the best thing to do is join up and vote for them to change their manifesto.
p9411
aVMuch easier than going with one of the other parties for the sake of those two issues and hoping they'll bend every single other policy to match.
p9412
aVSource?
p9413
aVEdit: courtesy of /u/DerekJDurand \u000a\u000aAnti Science?
p9414
aVTheir views on nuclear and GMO's are more based on other issues, such as how carbon intensive uranium mining is, and how expensive to maintain nuclear plants are (along with the waste issue).
p9415
aVGMO's is mostly their opposition to corporate control of farming and the danger of monocultures failing.
p9416
aVHowever, anti science?
p9417
aVThe Green Party want's to spend 3% of GDP on science (which is about 10x more than we currently spend) and for research money to be split through the Haldane principle.
p9418
aVYeah.
p9419
aVOne would think the current German situation would have convinced them that nuclear is vital to reducing CO2 emissions.
p9420
aVBut Greens always have put the appearance of doing good above actually doing so.
p9421
aVThey want to completely open immigration:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.
p9422
aV&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries.
p9423
aVIn step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.
p9424
aVetc.
p9425
aVThey want to instantly ban GMO.
p9426
aVThey want to ban all future nuclear power stations in the whole of the EU, and have already voted for that.\u000a\u000a
p9427
aVReducing immigration controls is not the same as removing them entirely, they aren't calling for completely open immigration.
p9428
aVBut a lot more open than it is today, and with enough loop holes that it is effectively open.
p9429
aVFor example, they want to make it perfectly fine to marry someone just for purpose of getting in.
p9430
aVAnd allow anyone that illegally immigrates to become an legal immigrant as long as they don't get caught for 5 years.
p9431
aVProof:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.
p9432
aVand:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG405 Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety.
p9433
aVhttp://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd on top of that, they want to completely elliminate the preference for skilled labour:\u000a\u000a&gt; Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.
p9434
aV&gt; they want to make it perfectly fine to marry someone just for purpose of getting in.
p9435
aVProbably because it's very hard to prove to a border official that you are marrying for love and not immigration status, and it causes a lot of distress and wastes a lot of time and money for them to try and dis-prove people are marrying for love, and you end up with [cases like this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sham-wedding-border-agency-bogus-uk-visa-520374).
p9436
aV&gt;And allow anyone that illegally immigrates to become an legal immigrant as long as they don't get caught for 5 years\u000a\u000aAgain there is logic to this, if they've managed to evade arrest for 5 years and live here unsupported by the state for all that time, we may as well make it legitimate so they can become full tax-paying members of society rather than working in the black market.
p9437
aVI believe the Lib-Dems have a similar policy.
p9438
aVIf the border force are doing their job, they'll catch illegal immigrants before 5 years by raiding employers that use illegal immigrant workers (which are a big problem as they will be paying them under the minimum wage and undercutting legal workers).
p9439
aV&gt;Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.
p9440
aVYeah I agree that ones a bit off (the desirable skills part) if it applies to economic migrants and not just refugees.
p9441
aVAny evidence this policy is harmful for the UK? 
p9442
aV&gt; They want to instantly ban GMO.
p9443
aV&gt; They want to ban all future nuclear power stations in the whole of the EU, and have already voted for that.
p9444
aVSo not very different from the mainstream parties then?
p9445
aVWe already have a moratorium on GMO and it's nearly 20 years since the last nuclear power plant was built in the UK.
p9446
aVWhy don't they consider nuclear power stations as a viable energy source if they are the "green" party?
p9447
aVBecause of the waste issue.
p9448
aVObviously.
p9449
aVDo you think Nuclear plants are without drawbacks?
p9450
aVI'm going to be voting Green, but I happen to agree that Nuclear opposition at this point is naive.
p9451
aVI'd *like* alternatives to step in but they simply aren't ready so Nuclear has to be seen as the least-bad option for where we are now.
p9452
aVHowever, when it comes to the next cycle of power creation, I'd like us to be saying "renewables are now viable", not "Ah well, we've been using Nuclear for the last 30 years, might as well carry on".
p9453
aVThe Greens are the only party who will genuinely push for that.
p9454
aVIf they were actually in government, I believe they would have to climb down on the anti-nuclear stance.
p9455
aVBut they are not in government nor are they likely to be.
p9456
aVThorium produces 98-99% less transuranic waste and has been used commercially as a fuel source since the 1960s.
p9457
aVIn addition, nuclear "waste" can actually be used as fuel again at a later stage so it's not entirely useless.
p9458
aVIt's also far, far more abundant and could probably even be mined in the UK.
p9459
aVThe only reason we used uranium for ours was that it lets you make bombs and that was something we wanted to do.
p9460
aVThe Green's energy policy makes no sense at all; nuclear (fission now, fusion later) should be the mainstay of our energy economy alongside renewable projects that make sense (e.g.
p9461
aVa Severn barrage).
p9462
aVI am interested in Thorium, although I understand that it's unlikely to be used commercially for another 20 years.
p9463
aVIf the Nuclear energy advocates are right, our need is more pressing than that.
p9464
aVThis is a common area of confusion.
p9465
aVThorium can and has been used commercially in traditional reactors since the 1960s; India still have two thorium plants that have been operational since the 1980s.
p9466
aVWhat will not be viable for another 20 years are molten fluoride salt reactors that can actually use uranium or thorium as fuel (but have only ever been demonstrated with uranium).
p9467
aVThorium can be used in a traditional reactor set up already, what people are talking about for the future are molten salt reactors that were initially intended to power aircraft with nuclear energy but essentially amount to a way to build reactors smaller and therefore get more electricity per unit of space.
p9468
aVOK, but the study/testing being done in Norway is the one the UK is interested in - and that's the new sort, no?
p9469
aVI guess I should have phrased it "We're not going to get any Thorium plants in the in the UK for 20 years".
p9470
aVYeah that would be molten salt reactors, which whilst awesome are not necessary to leverage thorium as a fuel source - they're just generally better whether you use uranium or thorium.
p9471
aVThere's no reason the UK couldn't build 5 or 6 thorium reactors instead of, say, HS2. 
p9472
aVI'd like to see the policy track: conventional thorium or uranium reactors--&gt;molten salt reactors--&gt;fusion.
p9473
aVI'm kind of with them in principle on open immigration.
p9474
aVThe problem is that the rest of the world isn't there yet.
p9475
aVWouldn't an ideal society be one where anybody could move from country to country freely?
p9476
aVHell no.
p9477
aVIn Iran you can get the death penalty for leaving Islam or for being gay.
p9478
aVIn Egypt 64% support the death penalty for apostasy.
p9479
aVWhat would happen to this country if there was a mass uncontrolled immigration of these types of people?
p9480
aVThe green party also want to have basic income.
p9481
aVThat would provide a huge incentive for people to come.
p9482
aVThese two things are in no way compatible.
p9483
aVYep basic income is a great idea and as nation we are set up to provide such a thing as we already have a huge welfare budget and an NHS.
p9484
aVHowever you can not implement a basic income successfully with mass uncontrolled immigration. 
p9485
aVThat's what I am saying.
p9486
aVThe rest of the world still needs to catch up so its not really viable at the moment, but I am firmly of the belief that if all borders in the world opened at once there wouldn't be too much trouble and it would be a very enlightening thing for many people.
p9487
aVIf all the borders of world opened while the world is in its current state, or if every country became westernised and dropped religion etc?
p9488
aVIt is an interesting thought.
p9489
aVThat I am not sure I agree with but.
p9490
aVIf all borders were droped over the world.
p9491
aVSo anyone can move to any country they wish.
p9492
aVWould then we not have a situ where people become a valuble resourse.
p9493
aVMost of the issues in the west.
p9494
aVExist because chaeper labour is abailable in other less well developed nations.
p9495
aVBut those nations have there own issues due to lack of freedom and development.
p9496
aVIf the citizens of any nation could go anywhere.
p9497
aVWould not those less developed nations need to try and prevent them from leaving.
p9498
aVIf we have a world with an idealistic level of freedom of movement.
p9499
aVThen the only way to keep workers would be to make life more desurable for them. 
p9500
aV&gt; Would then we not have a situ where people become a valuble resourse.
p9501
aVNo - the exact opposite.
p9502
aVEvery country has large numbers of unskilled unemployed people.
p9503
aV&gt; Exist because chaeper labour is abailable in other less well developed nations.
p9504
aVWhich also have huge numbers of unemployed unskilled people.
p9505
aV&gt; Would not those less developed nations need to try and prevent them from leaving.
p9506
aV14.6% of people live in developed countries.
p9507
aVThey wouldn't fit.
p9508
aVThe result would be that the developed countries would be dragged down to the level of the developing countries.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9509
aVCan't people claim asylum for those reasons anyway. 
p9510
aVIf they are the ones being persecuted, sure.
p9511
aVBut what about the persecutors?
p9512
aVShould they be given immigration status too?
p9513
aVWhy are you asking me about immigration status, when I'm talking about asylum?
p9514
aVAre they the same?
p9515
aVAlso why would the persecutors ask for asylum, are you talking about in general or if there was a revolution/coup/civil uprising? 
p9516
aVWhy are you asking about asylum when I'm talking about immigration?
p9517
aVIt was you that replied to me first.
p9518
aVBecause in that post you seemed ignore that people can claim asylum for those reasons which seemed to make your claim about open immigration redundant.
p9519
aVI wanted to know what your take on it was.
p9520
aVAh.
p9521
aVNo - I was complaining that we don't want to let in lots of people with the beliefs that we should kill people for leaving Islam, being gay, etc.
p9522
aVI wasn't complaining about letting in asylum seekers.
p9523
aVOr are you talking about people who fake being gay/ex-Muslim in order to come into the country?
p9524
aVI don't know how much of that actually happens, or what the process is for proving that you need asylum.
p9525
aVI think you are seriously overestimating the numbers of that sort of people who would actually want to come here.
p9526
aVThe green party also want to implement a Basic Income.
p9527
aVSo what percentage of 7 billion people would like to move to the UK and get a guaranteed minimum income for the rest of their life without having to work?
p9528
aVI'm not even being rhetorical - what percentage of the earth's population would do that in your opinion?
p9529
aVMake it only available to long term residents then.
p9530
aVProblem solved.
p9531
aV0.000031%\u000aDon't ask me to estimate a stupid number.
p9532
aV&gt; Don't ask me to estimate a stupid number.
p9533
aVYou were the one complaining that I'm over stating it, yet you have absolutely no idea how many it would be to the point that you can't even guess.
p9534
aVYou're kind of implying that we'd be flooded with "loads" of people who hate gays or whatever.
p9535
aVYou asked me for a *percentage*.
p9536
aVThere is a difference there.
p9537
aVI don't think it'd be loads, it'd be "some", but I can't put a percentage of THE WHOLE WORLD POPULATION on it.
p9538
aVI doubt I'll be lynched on the streets by a muslim if that's what you're trying to suggest...
p9539
aVAs long as you don't dare to leave their religion, be gay, insult their religion, draw Muhammad, or get accused of being a witch, then you'll probably be fine! 
p9540
aVI'm strongly in favour of a more liberal immigration policy, though I'm aware that I'm swimming upstream on that one.
p9541
aVWhile I've got nothing against GMO in theory, I'm very much against the IP protection that backs it up.
p9542
aVI think they have got it wrong on nuclear power, but I'm going to vote for them tomorrow in spite of that, because I agree with quite a few of their other policies. 
p9543
aV&gt; While I've got nothing against GMO in theory, I'm very much against the IP protection that backs it up.
p9544
aVWhy?
p9545
aVAre you against IP protection on medical drugs too?
p9546
aVOn software?
p9547
aVMusic?
p9548
aVGames?
p9549
aV&gt; I'm strongly in favour of a more liberal immigration policy, though I'm aware that I'm swimming upstream on that one.
p9550
aVDo you agree with them on removing the preference for skilled immigrants?
p9551
aVDo you also agree with them on having a Basic Income?
p9552
aVBecause for me, that's incompatible with a very open immigration system.
p9553
aV&gt;Are you against IP protection on medical drugs too?
p9554
aVOn software?
p9555
aVMusic?
p9556
aVGames?
p9557
aVSome IP protection is necessary to encourage innovation.
p9558
aVThis needs to be carefully limited to avoid creating barriers to entry, to avoid excluding smaller businesses, and to exclude rent seeking.
p9559
aVAt the moment IP protection has gone too far and it needs to be pruned back quite severely.
p9560
aVAs far as GM foods are concerned, IP protection could give  a small number of companies control over the bulk of the world's food supply.
p9561
aVMonopolies are never good things.
p9562
aV&gt;Do you agree with them on removing the preference for skilled immigrants?
p9563
aVI'm reasonably happy with the current EU arrangements, though the UK should join Schengen.
p9564
aV&gt;Do you also agree with them on having a Basic Income?
p9565
aVBecause for me, that's incompatible with a very open immigration system.
p9566
aVI'm in favour of a Basic Income, though it would be difficult to introduce until we get housing sorted out.
p9567
aVBut it's only practical to give Basic Income to UK citizens.
p9568
aVIn practice this would limit unskilled immigration because the unskilled migrant would be competing with a UK citizen in receipt of a Basic Income.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9569
aV&gt; This needs to be carefully limited to avoid creating barriers to entry, to avoid excluding smaller businesses\u000a\u000a\u000aThey also need to be strong enough for the exact same reason.
p9570
aVBut you know what else raises the barrier to entry?
p9571
aVConstantly raising the cost, time and risk to bring a product to market.
p9572
aVIf you were a small GMO company with a good product, what do you think would happen to you if the green party got in after promising an immediate halt on all GMO products, along with promising much stronger restrictions and regulations?
p9573
aV&gt; At the moment IP protection has gone too far and it needs to be pruned back quite severely.
p9574
aVWhat's your evidence for this in the context of GMO foods?
p9575
aVIt costs millions of dollars and many years to bring a GMO product to market.
p9576
aVThe IP protection needs to be long enough and strong enough to ensure that the company has a good chance of getting their money back from that.
p9577
aV&gt; As far as GM foods are concerned, IP protection could give a small number of companies control over the bulk of the world's food supply.
p9578
aVMonopolies are never good things.
p9579
aVThen please think about the effect of drastically increasing the risk and cost of bringing a GMO product to market.
p9580
aVThis is what is creating the monopolies.
p9581
aVNot the current IP protection.
p9582
aVLook at how much hate and attack Monsanto get for no reason.
p9583
aVWhy would any new company want to enter that field?
p9584
aV&gt; I'm reasonably happy with the current EU arrangements, though the UK should join Schengen.
p9585
aVThen you disagree with the green party in drastically reducing the restrictions?\u000a
p9586
aV&gt;If you were a small GMO company with a good product, what do you think would happen to you if the green party got in after promising an immediate halt on all GMO products, along with promising much stronger restrictions and regulations?
p9587
aVAdmittedly that is a problem with the Greens.
p9588
aVThey protested  Rothamsted's GM  research, thus adversely impacting on a smaller and more ethical competitor to Monsanto.
p9589
aVThe Greens don't seem to get the concept of least-worst options, either with GM or more importantly nuclear.
p9590
aVI don't think the Greens are perfect by any means, and I don't agree with all of their policies.
p9591
aVI just agree with them more than I do with LibDem, Conservative or Labour.
p9592
aV&gt;Then you disagree with the green party in drastically reducing the restrictions?
p9593
aVI'm voting Green to send a message to the other parties in favour of a more open immigration policy, in the same way as some people vote UKIP to send a message asking for a more restrictive immigration policy.
p9594
aVI don't expect the Greens to get far enough to actually implement their policy, though I would't be too upset if they did. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9595
aV&gt; I just agree with them more than I do with LibDem, Conservative or Labour.
p9596
aVWhat do you disagree on with LibDems?
p9597
aV&gt; I'm voting Green to send a message to the other parties in favour of a more open immigration policy\u000a\u000aMore open than we have currently?
p9598
aVI thought you said that you were fine with the current policy?
p9599
aV&gt;What do you disagree on with LibDems?
p9600
aVI disagree with the Orange Book faction of the LibDems, because I'm not in favour of private sector provision of public services.
p9601
aVI especially disagree with the ongoing privatisation of the NHS.
p9602
aV&gt;More open than we have currently?
p9603
aVI thought you said that you were fine with the current policy?
p9604
aVI support the current right to freedom of movement within the EU, and I'd like to keep the rest of the immigration policy as is, or at least as was before the current government started tightening it up further.
p9605
aVI wouldn't object to a more open immigration policy, but I agree with the Greens that this would need to be subject to environmental considerations.
p9606
aVPolicy MG400 says "It will not aim to allow increased net migration to Britain other than for humanitarian reasons or as a result of other Green Party policies.
p9607
aV"\u000a\u000aGreen immigration policies [here](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html).
p9608
aVI agree with the broad thrust of these.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9609
aV&gt; I disagree with the Orange Book faction of the LibDems, because I'm not in favour of private sector provision of public services.
p9610
aVI especially disagree with the ongoing privatisation of the NHS.
p9611
aVAgreed.
p9612
aVI have my own complaints with libdems - including the way that they campaigned for eliminating university fees and then voting to triple them!
p9613
aVAnd then excusing that by saying that they had only promised to eliminate the fees if they were elected.
p9614
aV&gt; Green immigration policies here.
p9615
aVI agree with the broad thrust of these.
p9616
aVOkay - I think we agree on the facts, but just disagree on what is best.
p9617
aVWhich is fine by me.\u000a
p9618
aVWhile I understand the premise of the article it's a little unfair to make the comparison.
p9619
aVUKIP are getting more coverage because they're a non-Labour non-Tory party that might win a major election in many decades, and it would be the first time ever that someone outside of the main two has won a European one.
p9620
aVAt the same time there are enough nutters in UKIP to continuously generate headlines about them saying something outrageous, which gives them even more publicity.
p9621
aVYes, the Greens are increasing in support, but it isn't at the same level.
p9622
aVAs based on the polling on [this website](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/uk-polling-report-average-2), the Green party only have 4% support in comparison to 15% support for UKIP.
p9623
aVThis is 54x less then what UKIP are on.
p9624
aVAs well as this, every UK general election that both parties have contested, UKIP have beat the Greens every time -  having at least double their votes from 2001 onwards.
p9625
aVUKIP is clearly a bigger party with a broader support, even though the Greens are represented in parliament and UKIP aren't\u000a\u000aFurthermore the Greens have 140 councillors, UKIP have 223, Greens have 2 MEPs, UKIP have 9.
p9626
aVGreens are polling at 3%, UKIP are polling at 14%.
p9627
aVGreens were 7th in the General Election (behind the BNP), UKIP were 4th.
p9628
aVThere really is no true comparison between the Greens and UKIP, they are on a completely different level
p9629
aVLooking at http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/ then the final Survation Euro poll has the Greens at 4%.
p9630
aVOpinum have them at 5%.
p9631
aVTNS didn't bother to separate them out from the 13% "Others".
p9632
aVComres show them at at 6%.
p9633
aVNow, they're not bad numbers by past standards for the Greens, but they're also not the sort of numbers that are going to deliver a swathe of Green MEPs either.
p9634
aVAnd they're certainly in no danger of being only the third party since 1920-something to top a UK-wide poll.
p9635
aVThe problem is UKIP gets more news coverage, then more things get brought up (found out or just more in public eye) , so they then get more coverage.
p9636
aVFree publicity good or bad.\u000a
p9637
aVDifference between a party polling under 10% and a party set to win which isn't lab/con.
p9638
aVLast survey I checked had ukip at 15% and the greens at 10% \u000a\u000anot much in it
p9639
aVIt's the European election tomorrow that's what people care about right now.
p9640
aVI don't know about you, but I only care about how the euro elections suggest the battlegrounds for the real election next year.
p9641
aVI suspect I'm not alone in ythis
p9642
aVPerhaps but the papers are more interested the current events.
p9643
aVIf the greens were polling 1st in the EU elections we would hear about it.
p9644
aVUndoubtedly :)\u000a\u000aI guess we'll have to console ourselves with an article saying support has tripled, even without the publicity boost that ukip has been getting
p9645
aVThat doesn't mean anything, though.
p9646
aVTiny parties like "Left Unity", "4 Freedoms" or "An Independence from Europe" have increased in numbers of support many times over than the Greens, that doesn't mean they're significant in this election.
p9647
aVPerhaps if we have a referendum and stay in the EU, the next election would be the day the Greens take over UKIP's place.
p9648
aVIt would explain why their European membership policy is exactly that.
p9649
aVOr to pit it another way: ukip are a protest vote in the euros that will go back to the Tories in the general election.
p9650
aVThe greens are mot tied to Europe, it's not an important part of their manifesto, so their support should remain strong in the general. 
p9651
aVThat would be completely true if we didn't have a first past the post system that causes many Greens to abandon their party to vote tactically in general elections.
p9652
aVHonestly, that's one of their biggest problems, that people so often don't vote for what they want, but against what they don't want.
p9653
aVThat usually means voting Labour or Tory, despite many people considering either of them the second worst option.
p9654
aVThe Euro elections are the real elections, the General Elections are no more important than council elections nowadays.
p9655
aVParty campaign  effort and spending suggests they disagree :)
p9656
aVRubbish.
p9657
aVParliament is still more powerful.
p9658
aVThe British Parliament can write laws.
p9659
aVThe EU Parliament doesn't even have the power to write legislation.
p9660
aVThe real power in the EU lies with the commission, which is chosen, indirectly via General Elections in the member states.
p9661
aV&gt; Last survey I checked had ukip at 15% and the greens at 10% \u000a\u000aReally?
p9662
aVSource?
p9663
aVI may have conflated the two polls here:http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/category/ukip\u000a\u000aThat would assume ukip get the polled 13 for the general and the greens keep their 9 current.
p9664
aVI think that was my thought process, unless there actually was a poll I can't find now
p9665
aV&gt; That would assume ukip get the polled 13 for the general and the greens keep their 9 current.
p9666
aVI think that was my thought process, unless there actually was a poll I can't find now\u000a\u000aIf you look at the detail of that poll it puts the Greens on 4% in the General Election.
p9667
aVThis would obviously be a very good result for them, but not remotely in the UKIP ballpark these days.
p9668
aVYou are the first to ask :) on mobile for next 4 hrs, after that 
p9669
aV&gt; You are the first to ask :) on mobile for next 4 hrs, after that\u000a\u000aTake your time :-) \u000a\u000aI took a look at some recent polls and couldn't see any related to the general election with greens on anything close to 10%.
p9670
aVBecause the media &amp; political establishment see a threat to the status quo from UKIP so are putting a lot of effort into destroying them.
p9671
aVThey're not giving them positive media coverage.
p9672
aVThe greens clearly aren't seen as a threat in the general election and in the EU elections at least they're pro-EU so why would the other pro-EU parties care that much if they do well?
p9673
aVUKIP are the political establishment who will enforce the status quo. 
p9674
aVOr maybe enforce the _status quo ante_ and return us to some imagined pre-1960's rural idyll when women stayed at home, homosexuality was illegal, and Britain still had an empire, a death penalty and pounds, shillings and pence.
p9675
aVActually I think they'd happily take us back to pre-industrial serfdom, before the Reform Act and the Tolpuddle Martyrs started making life difficult for decent, hardworking British landowners who sup pints in tweed jackets and cords.
p9676
aVI don't think you're that far from the truth.
p9677
aV[deleted]
p9678
aV&gt; but personally I believe its an apt punishment for serious crimes e.g.
p9679
aVserial killing, child murder, mass murdering etc.
p9680
aVOf course you do.
p9681
aVRight wingers very rarely have any empathy for human life other than their own in general.
p9682
aVThere's a reason "Right Wing" is known as "sociopath politics".
p9683
aVA very common trend.
p9684
aVDon't need to look at the website - the comments from their Councillors and supporters are more than enough. 
p9685
aV[deleted]
p9686
aVAnd what happens if 6 months after they are killed you find out they are innocent?
p9687
aVI _have_ looked at their web-site, and their manifestos.
p9688
aVNow and in 2010.
p9689
aVSame old Tories.
p9690
aVOkay, an off-shoot of the Tories.
p9691
aVThey don't have an official position on the death penalty - don't want to frighten the voters yet - but in their 2010 election manifesto, they wanted to chip away at maternity leave and make it more difficult for women to maintain a career.
p9692
aVThey also wanted to get rid of the minimum wage and a few other employment rights; but I think they'd have to get the UK to leave the EU to do it.
p9693
aVLimits on working hours, rules about the redundancy process.
p9694
aVAll these protections, UKIP would happily tell you, are forced on us by the EU.
p9695
aVAnd UKIP would cheerfully get rid of them so that employers can be better off and employees worse.
p9696
aVIn 2010 they wanted to replace the current tax bands with a single rate of maybe 25 or 30 percent.
p9697
aVThat's great news for higher-rate tax-payers at 40% or the much talked about 50%, but leaves the lower-paid worse off unless you juggle with the allowance to compensate.
p9698
aVIt's a regressive tax.
p9699
aVYou know who else implented a single rate of tax?
p9700
aVVladimir Putin.
p9701
aVAnd there the rich just got richer.
p9702
aVI know about UKIP.
p9703
aVI know where those ideas come from.
p9704
aVI know where their instincts are.
p9705
aVI know xenophobia when I see it.
p9706
aVMaybe because UKIP has the chance to top all the three traditional parties while not so for the greens???
p9707
aV?
aVIt really doesn't.
p9708
aVIt's barely polling above the Lib Dems for national elections, and most of those are bound to be voters in Tory strongholds.
p9709
aVUKIP won't win many seats, let alone enough to actually pose any serious threat. 
p9710
aVWere talking about the EU parliament elections not the General election.
p9711
aVThe EU parliament election is PR not first past the post.
p9712
aVAnd for the EU elections, UKIP has a chance of achieving a plurality. 
p9713
aVDepends entirely on turnout.
p9714
aVIt'll either be UKIP or Labour that achieves a plurality.
p9715
aVGreens might come out ahead of the Lib Dems.
p9716
aVThis is 100% accurate and yet you get down-voted, sad.
p9717
aVLabour may still well win and I wouldn't be at all surprised if the Greens beat the Lib Dems.
p9718
aVPeople get downvoted for no reason on this subreddit.
p9719
aVKarma doesn't signify a comment's quality any longer.
p9720
aVNot since 4chan has taken over.
p9721
aVMust... silence.... dissent... 
p9722
aVAnd greens will still end up in fourth or fifth place, When any elections in the world are mentioned do you believe that those in fourth and fifth place as somehow more worthy of getting attention then a party that has a chance of getting the most votes?
p9723
aVWhen it's unexpected?
p9724
aVSure.
p9725
aVGods only know we've got more than enough coverage about UKIP.
p9726
aVIt's boring.
p9727
aVLet's spice it up a bit.
p9728
aVIf it's boring then stop listening.
p9729
aVThe quality of political coverage does not correlate with how interesting it is.
p9730
aVEconomics is boring.
p9731
aVBureaucracy is boring.
p9732
aVSocial reform is boring.
p9733
aVVariety for variety's sake is interesting - but a waste of time.
p9734
aVUnless you want equal time delivered to the BNP, because that would be interesting!
p9735
aVBNP coverage would be utterly hilarious.
p9736
aVNational Front, too. 
p9737
aVIf it makes you feel better I also find the coverage for greens in r/UKpolitics, Boring.\u000a\u000a
p9738
aVIt's been mostly UKIP coverage here, there's been a few threads/stories about the Greens but not many you could easily have avoided them.
p9739
aVProblem is the greens aren't really saying anything different of any real consequence.
p9740
aVIt's just "bankers this", "social housing that", whenever they get any publicity they don't really speak much about any policies.
p9741
aVUKIP are sort of similar in that they don't have any policies either but they do go on and on about leaving the EU which people actually want, whereas the green's consistent message is green stuff which nobody cares about. 
p9742
aVI'm not the biggest Greens fan in the world, but clearly you don't know much about them.
p9743
aVThey have quite detailed policies you can find all over the place, probably the most radical out of the big 3 and UKIP, considering their offerings, from the NHS to education.
p9744
aVAgain, not the biggest fan of their nuclear policy and GM crops, but you are right in saying UKIP have absolutely no policies other than anti-EU since Farage disowned the parties' 2010 GE manifesto.
p9745
aVIf you read their rather pitiful offering this year, it has 13ish pages, all but 2 of which are pictures.
p9746
aVOn the two real pages, it basically says "no immigrants, no Europe, no climate change" but in different ways. 
p9747
aVClearly enough people care or they wouldn't be polling ahead of the Lib Dems.
p9748
aV&gt; Clearly enough people care or they wouldn't be polling ahead of the Lib Dems.
p9749
aVYes, but this says a lot more about the Lib Dems than the greens though.
p9750
aVThe polls indicate that the greens are on roughly the same share of the vote and about to get the same number of MEPs (two) as they got last time.
p9751
aVThis story isn't very newsworthy, is it?
p9752
aVThe fact that the Lib Dems drop below the Greens is the story here.
p9753
aVGreens support the idea of basic income.
p9754
aVBetween that and their energy policy we're talking pretty radical social change
p9755
aVBasic income combined with a complete relaxation of all immigration laws sounds like a terrible idea!
p9756
aV&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries.
p9757
aVIn step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.
p9758
aVhttp://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html
p9759
aVIt's pretty economically rational.
p9760
aVWe're economically productive enough to have the bulk of people in artificial jobs like mid management and still have 7% unemployment.
p9761
aVWell they don't shout very loud about it, their members are just too beta i've seen it on Question Time overwhelmingly weak women with no presence or inspiration. 
p9762
aVMeh, I prefer competence over theatrics.
p9763
aVWhen she was on newsnight the basic income was main topic of discussion.
p9764
aVWife reckons she might be the UK Merkel.
p9765
aVI imagine you dislike her too based on presence and inspiration?
p9766
aV:)
p9767
aVDidn't see that newsnight episode and haven't bothered to watch any of Merkel as what's the point? 
p9768
aVUKIP tends to get the turnout on EU elections, as they're basically the only party whose voters actually care about the EU, because they want to leave. 
p9769
aVUKIP are tipped to win in the EU elections, the greens may come 4th.
p9770
aVYou mean the Melon Party?
p9771
aVThere is no Green Party, it's just another useless left-wing pile of shit led by an insane Australian feminist.
p9772
aVThat and they're pro-EU.
p9773
aVYeah that's the one. 
p9774
aVI'm leaning towards voting for them, but I can't get my head around their energy policies.
p9775
aVSociety improves the more abundant and cheap energy is.
p9776
aVWe won't progress by restricting our energy usage, we'll progress by finding new ways to generate previously unheard-of amounts of power, cheaply.
p9777
aVThe green party wants to curtail our energy usage so it'll fit currently available renewables.
p9778
aVWe need to be increasing our energy output (regardless of the generation method used), not reducing it.
p9779
aVThe best way of improving our output at the moment is nuclear.
p9780
aVGreen party is against nuclear, because, it seems, of NIMBY's.
p9781
aVTheir energy policies do, at least, have potential.
p9782
aVHell, Austrailia's Right Wing govt.
p9783
aVjust wiped 90% of climate change funding.
p9784
aVThe Greens could presumably be persuaded over to the idea of nuclear.
p9785
aVTheir support is definitely growing, hardly surging though.
p9786
aVTypical Guardian spewing nonsense.
p9787
aVThe media prefer to talk about a wildcard party which has already had a million voters in one election compared to the Green's 250,000.
p9788
aVSupport may have surged in both, but it's stupid to ignore UKIP's lead.
p9789
aVThe same people who bang on about the Greens getting an MP means they have more support.
p9790
aVNo it doesn't.
p9791
aVYeah because UKIP's lead has been *totally* ignored by the press.
p9792
aVGreens aren't actually much up on their previous EU achievements in polling, it's just that the Lib dem collapse has made them look more important.\u000a\u000a
p9793
aVThey have a blatant disregard for science.
p9794
aVMost parties do, but a party which claims to support Green policies shouldn't have such an obvious disdain for the subject...\u000a\u000a(I'm referring to their nuclear stance in particular, but also GM to a certain extent.
p9795
aV)
aVPsst.
p9796
aVRepost.
p9797
aVTa - first linked here http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/262tm4/green_party_support_is_surging_but_the_media/ as you say, but this post has more comments so I'll leave it here for now.
p9798
aVReddit didn't pick up the repost because the Share function on the Guardian app uses the gu url shortener.
p9799
aVPeople want to read about UKIP because it's dramatic and exciting; if the Greens want some press perhaps they should suggest shooting Graham Norton, or blame crime on the Poles.
p9800
aVBasically what I said, go to a zoo and kick a few of the inmates on live TV, that'll get em UKIP levels of notoriety.
p9801
aV&gt;inmates
p9802
aV'surging' hahaha. 
p9803
aVI'd consider the Greens, but their economic ideas are a joke.
p9804
aVThey seem to be based on a pipedream where we have an economy built entirely on green manufacturing, which we would sell to the world, funded by a self-declared "Robin Hood Tax" which sounds good in principle, but amounts to nothing more than a pensions raid.
p9805
aVThis, of course, doesn't even start to consider that there are factories beyond Dover that could do the same thing and undercut the UK's exports.
p9806
aVIf the world wanted green technology, they would surely either prepare it themselves, or look to emerging nations with affordable rates.
p9807
aVIt would bankrupt the nation in a matter of years.
p9808
aVI also disagree with them on Nuclear Power, which I think is a far more sensible stop-gap until fusion is developed in 20-30 years time, but which is under threat from funding being diverted to renewables research.
p9809
aVThat is the power source of the future, and in my eyes, spending obscene amounts of money on relatively inefficient technologies like wind and solar power (here in the UK, at least) is madness when power consumption rises are outstripping increases in the capability of the board.
p9810
aVUnder Green energy plans, it's either a solar panel and a wind turbine the size of those in wind farms on everyone's roof, or we all go without power for half of the day.
p9811
aVThen there's their shameless "anti-austerity" drive, which echoes the empty nonsense Labour was throwing around at the beginning of the current parliament.
p9812
aVIt's very easy to sound as if you oppose service cuts from the sidelines when you're not the one doing the budgeting, but frankly, the crazy spending plans the Green party advocate would require massive funds which would inevitably require either massive spending cuts elsewhere or debts so eye-watering that they would make New Labour look positively frugal.
p9813
aVI'm an environmentalist, but one with a realistic worldview, and the Greens are fiscal suicide wrapped in a hemp blanket.
p9814
aVThe Green's are simply a think tank.
p9815
aVThey are crazy stupid with some proposals while others are good. 
p9816
aV&gt; until fusion is developed in 20-30 years time\u000a\u000aThis must be irony.
p9817
aVIn case you weren't aware, sustainable net-positive-energy fusion has been "20-30 years away" since the 60s, and it certainly doesn't lack investment.
p9818
aVThe assertion that renewables research is somehow funneling money away from fusion is completely false. 
p9819
aVNice misinformation.
p9820
aVThe "Robin Hood Tax" is a fairly mainstream idea that is backed by most of Europe.
p9821
aV&gt; but amounts to nothing more than a pensions raid.
p9822
aVRubbish.
p9823
aVLabour raided pensions.
p9824
aVThe Robin Hood Tax will be of minimal cost to long term investors like pensions companies. 
p9825
aVI like the greens and I am concerned about environmental issues in the UK especially the fact that my garden is full of plants and trees with blossom on them and not 1 single bee has visited all morning, this scares me a bit since it is blazing sunny and I live in a fielded area in N Worcs with farms around\u000a\u000aBut the truth is they couldn't run a piss up in a brewery.
p9826
aVSad but true
p9827
aVThe problem is, how can you not talk about UKIP?
p9828
aVWhen Nigel Farage goes about publicly spouting his hatred bullshit it's going to be picked up by every news outlet in the country.
p9829
aVI don't understand how he hasn't come under more scrutiny for his remarks about Romanians.
p9830
aVIf any other leader made the comments that he has, they'd be torn apart.
p9831
aVHe knows exactly what he's doing.
p9832
aVWhich is what makes him a very dangerous man.
p9833
aVI think the increasing popularity of the greens with students is a key vote that Lib-Dem won't be getting this time round.
p9834
aVHowever, we should not expect them to sack anti-gm and anti-nuclear yet as, after all, they are the environmentally friendly green party.
p9835
aVThis highlights the lack of parties in UK politics, and suggests the need for a social-democrat party.
p9836
aVI would vote for the greens but like many others I find myself held back by their immigration policy (Or lack of) and their anti-nuclear stance.
p9837
aVThe first point isn't a big deal as any party that isn't anti-EU has no realistic chance of affecting the EU freedom of movement issue.
p9838
aVThe second point is much more of a problem, nuclear is the only hope until we are in a position where renewable energy takes over.  
p9839
aVI'm going to vote for them because of their immigration policy, but like you I don't think much of their energy policy.
p9840
aVIt makes sense to use nuclear as  a stopgap till we get enough renewables up and running. \u000a
p9841
aV&gt;reposting here as other thread is less popular\u000a\u000a\u000ait's only because everyone is talking about ukip.
p9842
aVcan't expect the media to forcememe shit over what people are genuinely giving more attention, even if they are mostly speaking about said topic due to outrage
p9843
aVThe problem is, how can you not talk about UKIP?
p9844
aVWhen Nigel Farage goes about publicly spouting his hatred bullshit it's going to be picked up by every news outlet in the country.
p9845
aVI don't understand how he hasn't come under more scrutiny for his remarks about Romanians.
p9846
aVIf any other leader made the comments that he has, they'd be torn apart.
p9847
aVHe knows exactly what he's doing.
p9848
aVWhich is what makes him a very dangerous man.
p9849
aVI ilke 95% of of the Green partys policies except thier stance on nuclear power which unfortunatly stops me from voting for them.
p9850
aVSo you'd rather vote elsewhere on that 5%?
p9851
aVNot the same guy but it is a big 5%.
p9852
aVWe need nuclear power in order to have any sort of hope of surviving our looming energy crisis.
p9853
aVI agree completely but is it as big as the neoliberal stranglehold we're currently dealing with?
p9854
aVThey'll do more to sort out the energy crisis than any of the main three and definitely more than UKIP.
p9855
aVIf we hadn't privatised our power stations then perhaps we could have used that money to invest in renewable energy.
p9856
aVUKIP want nuclear energy, so how would they do more than UKIP?
p9857
aVBy investing in nationalised renewable energy rather than privatised nuclear energy. 
p9858
aVRenewable energy isn't nearly productive enough to start using en masse yet.
p9859
aVOnly because not much money has been invested in renewable energy.
p9860
aVIt's hard to make money from it.
p9861
aVI don't agree with the Green Party in terms of nuclear power or GM foods.
p9862
aVHowever, I do feel that their economic plan and their alternative energy solution could very easily work, not only that but I think they are improvements on our current system.
p9863
aVEspecially if we take offshore windfarms and hydroelectricity into consideration.
p9864
aVI suspect you agree with less than 80% of the policies with all other parties...\u000a\u000a95% is pretty damn high.
p9865
aVThe Greens vote on all their policies, the more support they get that is against a policy such as Nuclear or GM, the easier it is to change that policy.
p9866
aVBasically, don't give up on them just yet. 
p9867
aVDo you like &gt;95% of the policies of another party?
p9868
aVIt's a bad point, but it's one point.
p9869
aVHow many aspects of all the other parties make you queasy? 
p9870
aV&gt;...partys policies except **their** stance on... \u000a\u000aFTFY Guradem :)\u000a\u000a*Please don't hate me.
p9871
aVI'm only a simple bot trying to make a living.
p9872
aV*
aVThey've got my vote tomorrow.
p9873
aVSeem to be the most legitimate.
p9874
aVI don't agree with all their policies, but of all the parties to vote for, they seem to be the best.
p9875
aVThe greens are a load of idiots.
p9876
aVThey shouldnt be trusted to run a lemon stall let alone a country.....
p9877
aVI'm voting Green for locals, I was very impressed by their manifesto. 
p9878
aVInteresting to see that we're also very low on the rankings for actual spending on healthcare, when the mantra over the last few years has been that the NHS is bloated with spending and is inefficient.
p9879
aVWait a minute.... so you're telling me the Torys would just lie about one of our greatest assets we have.
p9880
aVI wonder why. 
p9881
aV&gt;I wonder why\u000a\u000a\u000aI smell a bargain...
p9882
aVIt can be both.
p9883
aVIt *is* bloated and inefficient, but it's also much less bloated and inefficient than other health care systems.
p9884
aVDamn the Tories for wanting to cut waste.
p9885
aVJust go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9886
aV&gt;Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9887
aVI've had many, always I was just in and out in 10 minutes, test results come back the next week.
p9888
aVIs there something wrong with that?
p9889
aVUh, I ordered three blood tests today and got the results to the patients within two hours.
p9890
aVI'm not sure where this inefficiency is but it's hiding itself very well.
p9891
aVIt may be hiding in the break room browsing reddit with me I guess.
p9892
aVClever bastard.
p9893
aVWell I've found the opposite.
p9894
aVI guess some run smoothly and others don't.
p9895
aVSo would it not be a good idea to have a shake up, make sure everyone gets the same service whichever hospital they may visit. 
p9896
aVSure, more healthcare spending sounds good to me.
p9897
aVMaybe *you're* the inefficiency.
p9898
aVDun dun dunnnnn!
p9899
aV&gt; Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is\u000a\u000aWhat do you mean?
p9900
aVI've had many, unfortunately. \u000a

aVI have done this many times.
p9906
aVYou sit in the waiting room for a bit, then get called in (they are often running a little late), they take your blood, you leave.
p9907
aVThinking that cutting only "gets rid of the inefficient bits" is such an utterly moronic viewpoint.
p9908
aVIt hurts everything.
p9909
aVPrivatising only makes it worse because the people who it's sold it to don't give a *fuck* about making it better, they just burn and get the fuck out.
p9910
aVThey don't want to cut waste, they want to cut its throat and give the profits to friends and future colleagues. 
p9911
aVlol yeah that's right.
p9912
aVAs we speak Cameron and his mates are sat at a table wondering how best they can profit from privatisation.  
p9913
aVYou mean like they did with Royal Mail?
p9914
aVYou truly believe that too, don't you?
p9915
aVWhy does the left assume they're all mates plotting for each other rather than just "British business", which by the way, fuels all the public sector. 
p9916
aVBecause often when such sales occur government advisors &amp; friends mysteriously make a killing. 
p9917
aVWell a lot of them did go to school together...
p9918
aVPeople don't like to hear of others making money from an opportunity they have missed.
p9919
aVThey need to blame. 
p9920
aVLabour almost managed to privatise it too. 
p9921
aV&gt; Damn the Tories for wanting to cut ~~waste~~ services.
p9922
aVFTFY
p9923
aV&gt; Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9924
aVI do.
p9925
aVRegularly.
p9926
aVI'm in, done and out most times within 15 minutes and I've often not even had to wait.
p9927
aVPerhaps you're getting yours done at a hospital and competing with the in-patients that all need bloods done as a matter of urgency?
p9928
aV&gt; Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9929
aVI don't think you know how blood tests are processed.
p9930
aVYour GP has to dispatch them to the haematology laboratory (which is often the largest hospital within your NHS trust), where it will be examined based on how urgent it has been marked.
p9931
aVIn an emergency, the sample will be bumped to the top of the pile and the results will be with your GP (and therefore you) within an hour of the laboratory receiving them.
p9932
aVAny delay is during shipment.
p9933
aVNHS trusts have been consolidating all the labwork over the past decade or so.
p9934
aVBloodwork is one of the most efficient parts of the NHS, especially within hospitals.
p9935
aVThat's the way, don't let facts get in the way of good rhetoric.
p9936
aVHave you tried doing that in any other healthcare system?
p9937
aVIt sucks
p9938
aVShhhh.
p9939
aVWe're not allowed to complain!
p9940
aVI couldn't see where they got the figures from and I'd be interested to see if they include our massive PFI bills.
p9941
aVYeah, Tories gonna spin bollocks to try to privatise it.
p9942
aVAnd labour will just pile up the debt to make it sound like they are doing something in throwing money at it, but not really caring how.
p9943
aVSo we still get more private involvement in the NHS (it didn't start under the current government and won't end under it), plus shit PFI deals which mean we don't own the hospitals we are paying for, and billions wasted on shit IT schemes.
p9944
aVWe spend quite a low amount on the NHS.
p9945
aVThe labour mistakes weren't overspending on the NHS, they were idiotic PFI schemes which leach what little money we do spend on the NHS.
p9946
aVThe debt is largely caused by the financial crash, not by spending policies.
p9947
aVThis is the same mistaken complaint made in almost every economy affected.
p9948
aVHell, the american right even blame a government which wasn't in power at the time for the debt!!
p9949
aV!
aVThe issue is not the crash, boom and bust is to be expected in a capitalist economy.
p9950
aVThe issue is that governments failed to prepare.
p9951
aVLabour were among the worst, with Brown going so far as to announce the end of 'tory boom and bust'.
p9952
aVAs such they ramped up spending and debt through the boom years (the national debt doubled under Labour) and come the inevitable bust we were left with a large deficit, made up in no small part of interest payments on the debt which should have been paid down in the boom years.
p9953
aVIt's not just a UK problem, many governments saw spending increases as good vote winners in the boom years, and ignored the coming bust, safe in the knowledge that they'd be long gone before it came time to deal with the problems they were storing up.
p9954
aVI wouldn't say Labour threw money at it.
p9955
aVThey increased spending because it had been so badly underfunded by the Tories, but all it that meant was that the UK caught up to the other couple of really badly funded countries while remaining at or near last place.
p9956
aVWe spend quite a low amount on the NHS.
p9957
aVThe labour mistakes weren't overspending on the NHS, they were idiotic PFI schemes which leach what little money we do spend on the NHS.
p9958
aVLabour (Under Tony Blair) set the ball in motion to privatise parts of the NHS.
p9959
aVWhy does this "Tories want to privatise the NHS" meme still go on?
p9960
aVIt's ridiculous.
p9961
aVAre you saying the Tories don't want to privatise the NHS?
p9962
aVI'm saying that if anyone wants to privatise the NHS, it's not exclusively the Tories.
p9963
aVIf there's a movement to say "Lets outsource some parts of the NHS, like we do in almost every other part of government", then it's not exclusively a Tory lead campaign to line their rich buddies pockets.
p9964
aVPersonally, I think there's massive sections of the NHS that could be privatised well, providing far better value for money for the tax payer.
p9965
aV&gt; "Lets outsource some parts of the NHS, like we do in almost every other part of government"\u000a\u000aTo g4S and Fujitsu and all those other fellows not cocking things up at all?\u000a
p9966
aVThere have been some bad privatisation, and quite a lot of very good privatisation.
p9967
aVWhen was the last time you were without water because of a strike for example?
p9968
aVHow about bins not being collected?
p9969
aVI live in Scotland where the water is publicly owned, it is a more expensive system to run due to the rurality and yet is the cheapest in the uk.
p9970
aVI have never went without water because of a strike.
p9971
aVDont you remember when they went on strike, and when Robo-Scargill went on the rampage and was shooting laser beams out of his eyes?, not being hysterical or anything....
p9972
aVMeanwhile privatised water in the UK is just fantastic.
p9973
aV&gt; How about bins not being collected?

VFreedom of choice.
p11182
aVMy ass.
p11183
aVIt's a perfect example of the conservative concept of choice - you can choose whatever you want, but you pay if you choose "incorrectly"...
p11184

p11188
aVA perpetual spirit of revival pervades the campus.
p11189
aVYou're being unfairly downvoted, but the title *is* true.
p11190

p11193
aVLiberty University sounds awful.

p11195
aVA few highlights:\u000a\u000a&gt; they would be fined [...] Not as much as they would be fined for possessing R-rated movies or practicing witchcraft\u000a\u000a&gt; The university, founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell, requires its 13,500 residential students to attend as many as three events each week as part of a program called Convocation...
p11196
aVSo... if you go to school there you know what the hell you're in for.

p11199
aVoops, 'math' must have been in that last year of college he missed

aVGenuinely fucking scary.
p11214
aVI don't see how the U.S. stays unridiculed by politicians in public on an international stage.
p11215
aVSeriously, as someone not from the U.S. and kinda sorta left leaning I suppose, the current administration is the least cringe-inducing in a long time.
p11216
aVOr, okay, Bush was a buffoon. 
p11217
aVI'm a not American, and totally agree .
p11218
aVI see the Republican attitude as selfish, greedy and pathetic .... 'I'm alright Jack !
p11219
aV'\u000a\u000aIs it true that the actual 'workers' only legally  have 4 paid for days holiday a year ?

aVNo.
p11224
aVYou should have to submit to one regardless of political party.
p11225
aVDemocrats are no better than republicans, they just have different view points when it comes to certain things.

aVThe best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.
p11227
aVRepublicans really represent all that is bad in modern American society.
p11228
aVThey are a force ranged against civilisation.
p11229
aVAnd Democrats display what is wrong in most of the rest of the "civilized" world.

p11233
aVThat's sadly unfortunate.

aVHer life just got fifty shades more complicated.
p11235
aVThankfully her family is [pretty well off](http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/summary.php?year=2011&amp;cid=n00030245), and that should help a lot with the cost of raising a child... \u000a\u000aWe don't (and likely never will) know the full story here... she may very well have attempted to prevent the pregnancy through recognized and approved forms of birth-control... but the irony is palatable.
p11236
aVHAHAHAHAHA!

aVNow, now..this is personal, family business and not the business of that filthy Press, donchaknow?
p11238
aVBut the GOP is also trying to kill USPS...WTF is his plan if the republicans are successful.

aVThey just haven't found the secret servers in his basement yet. 
p11242
aVThis is one of the few times I believe the swill that flows from him.
p11243
aV"The emails had been run through private accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee"
p11244
aVIs this somehow justification for Hillary's latest law breaking?
p11245
aVnope its just a little context as a side dish for your misplaced outrage
p11246
aVFunny.
p11247
aVI told my friend last night it's all stupid and if that's all they got it will work in Hillary's favor and that they should leave it alone.
p11248
aVSo much outrage huh.
p11249
aVNow I'm just mad that Hillary and Bush have even more in common.
p11250
aVHa.
p11251
aVAnd they try to call her a *Democrat.
p11252
aV*
aVWitholding emails has nothing to do with party affiliation. 
p11253
aVNo laws were broken from my understanding.
p11254
aVThe law didn't kick in until she was no longer Sec.
p11255
aVof State.
p11256
aVLike 1.5 years later actually.
p11257
aVIt's just another faux-scandal like Benghazi that conservatives are desperately trying to use to besmirch her name. 
p11258
aVI'm on year 3 of being out of school, working full time, and I can't even pay for a full semester.
p11259
aVMy yearly salary is about a year of a top law school.
p11260
aVLiving expenses, insurance, gas and all?
p11261
aVNope. 
p11262
aVyup.
p11263
aVI started College in 64, tuition was 32 dollars a Semester, in 68 when I graduated it was 150 dollars.
p11264
aVIn California back then some schools were tuition free...and those days had many young people questioning things like the Viet Nam war and The "establishment"---since that time, college became more expensive and the "man" the "establishment" found a way to limit education simply by making it into another investment for profit business for the rich.
p11265
aVHasn't been very many good student protests nor student picketing on injustices and politics since then has there?
p11266
aVThe rich don't mind "technical skills"---they truly don't want Liberal Arts Majors questioning the status quo.
p11267
aVStudents can no longer afford to think freely and act on their beliefs---they're too busy trying to keep their heads above the water.
p11268
aVMission Accomplished! \u000a
p11269
aV&gt;the meme\u2019s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording\u000a\u000aIT'S A FUCKING MEME!
p11270
aVI feel like this same thing has happened like 4 times already.
p11271
aVEither that or I'm having some serious déjà vu.
p11272
aVI thought that also.
p11273
aVA quick google found at least one other incident from a couple of years ago.
p11274
aVhttp://littlegreenfootballs.com/page/289412_McCain_Skipped_a_Briefing_on_B
p11275
aVHis aides probably told him the read-aheads didn't answer the question that he wanted answered
p11276
aVAides are a dime a dozen and a sorry excuse when leadership is requested.
p11277
aVIf McCain gave a shit, like he is supposed to, he should have been in that briefing, should have listed what he didn't like, should list what he wants to know.
p11278
aVBut he knows he is just dicking around to spin the talking heads in Fox.
p11279
aVAt this point McCain is a burden on American tax payers.
p11280
aVclearly you don't know how Congress works.
p11281
aVYou have no conception of how complex the Federal government is and how much oversight members of Congress have.
p11282
aVThey could not theoretically read through the amount of materials that they have to read through.
p11283
aVThey could not even come close.
p11284
aVIf its' that complex, then why is McFuckalls and the rest of the republican hyenas harping off in the media?
p11285
aVHe's been there over 30 years, he should know better than to mouth off like a frat chick on a xanax overdose.
p11286
aVTheoretically?
p11287
aVWhat fucking excuse is that?
p11288
aVHe is not being asked to read.
p11289
aVHe is being asked to get his ass in there and listen.
p11290
aVIf he has time to harp on fox news, which takes more time and effort than listening, then he has no excuses.
p11291
aVThe testimonies are a show.
p11292
aVThe real answers are always submitted in writing.
p11293
aVThat's not what he said.
p11294
aVWouldn't having people with affordable health care be better for the economy?
p11295
aVOr are the conservative reps like our liberal party in Australia, they have to repeal anything labor did since it is a labor thing, even if it is a worthwhile policy! 
p11296
aVRepublicans in America need no more than the "Obama likes it" mention, in order to oppose it.
p11297
aVObama has become their standard of hate.
p11298
aVTheir hate for President Obama is greater than their love for the country, or for any sense of reason at all.
p11299
aVRepublicans are the deranged copilot in our American flight.

p11303
aVyea, like that shit's gonna happen.
p11304
aVRegardless of what type of treaty, it starts with the Executive branch.
p11305
aV* Legally-binding treaties (described in the US Constitution) require 2/3 Supermajority of the US Senate to ratify.
p11306
aV* Merely politically-binding treaties (which do not change the law, nor have the force of it) can be ratified by a majority of both houses (congressional-executive agreements) or can be something agreed to only by the executive branch (sole-executive agreements).
p11307
aVThere was a good article by Peter Weber on [The Week's, Speed Reads](http://theweek.com/speedreads/543362/irans-foreign-minister-explains-international-law-senate-republicans ) that described why this letter was so bad to essentially say "Nya, Nya, We aren't going to do diddly once the people you're negotiating with leaves office!
p11308
aV"\u000a\u000a&gt;Iran's foreign minister ultimately dismissed the GOP letter as having "no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.
p11309
aV" But it also gives some propaganda ammunition to Zarif and Iran, notes Akbar Shahid Ahmed at [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/09/tom-cotton-zarif-letter_n_6835538.html ).
p11310
aVZarif used "the GOP misstep to seize an advantage that the Obama administration has said it does not want to give Iran: the chance to say the nuclear negotiations could fail because of the U.S."
p11311
aVFrom what I've heard, the Logan Act is generally considered to be overruled by the First Amendment, and only hasn't been stricken because no one has been prosecuted with it since the very early 1800s.
p11312
aVAs if the democrats had the backbone required to enforce the law.
p11313
aVOh they do.
p11314
aVBut under this administration it's not about backbone, it's about partisanship and they have played that card so hard that they can't do high profile arrests or risk exposure.
p11315
aVWho is responsible for prosecution?
p11316
aVCongress or the Attorney General? 
p11317
aV&gt;who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government \u000a\u000aI'm pretty sure it could be concluded in some way that congress IS the authority of the United States

p11321
aVThat spineless wonder in the White House is going to stand up to a GOP Congress.
p11322
aVHave they?
p11323
aVThe act says:  "who, without authority of the United States".
p11324
aVIsn't the house and Senate part of the U.S. government?
p11325
aVI would think this act would apply only to private citizens not representatives of any branch of government.
p11326
aVOf course, I'm no lawyer and admit that I know nothing about the previous application of this law.
p11327
aVHas anyone ever been prosecuted and/or convicted under it?
p11328
aVIt's more than that, House and Senate make the laws, that is what they exist for.
p11329
aVTherefore they have authority.
p11330
aVSomewhere along the lines people have apparently forgotten that the president is not the authority, he is the executor of the law and in fact has to get authorization from congress to do just about anything he wants to do.
p11331
aVIn theory yes, but President's usually take the helm in Foreign Policy only getting congressional approval for committing troops,as Commander in Chief he has 90 days to get done what he wants beyond that he needs approval. 
p11332
aVOh, the President definitely takes the helm with Foreign Policy.
p11333
aVThat does not mean he is the only one who can/does.
p11334
aVCongress can, they just don't as a matter of diplomatic etiquette.
p11335
aVSo while they can do what they did, it definitely is a diplomatic wtf.
p11336
aVThe president does however need congressional approval for much more than troops when it comes to foreign affairs.
p11337
aVWhile the pres can meet with whoever he wants whenever he wants, he can't enter into agreements or treaties without congressional approval.
p11338
aVWhich is what the dope-head republicans are basically telling the world.
p11339
aVHey Iran, he is going to say he is doing this treaty with you guys, but it isn't official cuz we didn't say it was so it can be taken away from you at any time by any president for any reason.
p11340
aVHave a nice day.
p11341
aVA shitty thing for them to do, but not against any laws or acts, just against the norm.
p11342
aVThat's exactly what I was trying to say but some people in this thread seem to think he can act unilaterally in Foreign Policy...
p11343
aVExactly
p11344
aVYou are incorrect.
p11345
aVNot exactly sure what you are so eloquently debating.
p11346
aVThat the house and senate makes the laws?
p11347
aVThat the house and senate have authority?
p11348
aVThat the president is not the authority?
p11349
aVThat the president is not the executor of law?
p11350
aVor that the president has to get authorization from congress for most things he wants to get done?
p11351
aVBecause unfortunately, They do, they do, he isn't (at least not the sole authority, maybe that is your hang up), he is, he does.
p11352
aVSo not really sure what you believe is incorrect?\u000a

p11360
aVIs this good or bad news
p11361
aVIt's good politically that Republicans are showing themselves so subservient to the wealthy and their hypocritical disdain for a level playing field in a supposedly free market.

aV(I'm a bot)\u000a*****\u000a&gt; After years of GOP attacks on the inheritance tax, also known as the estate tax, only a few thousand of the wealthiest families are subjected to it - 4,700 total in 2013, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
p11366
aV&gt; The legislation wouldn&amp;#039;t just eliminate the estate tax - it would also allow heirs to escape the already-generous capital gains tax on any stocks and real estate they receive.
p11367
aV&gt; The estate tax is even more regressive, applying to just 0.2 percent of estates a year, at an average effective rate of less than 17 percent, since millions of dollars of the inheritance are exempted from the formal 40 percent rate.

aVwhy do I get the feeling that the republican party is going to follow his lead on this?
p11393
aVjesus christ do we really need another era of famine and disease because of these anti-vaxxers?
p11394
aVI feel like this should not be a choice; that vaccination should be compulsory. 
p11395
aVWhen science is no longer manipulated to support vaccinations; when the toxic crap like mercury is removed; when the legit concerns and fears are addressed instead of blithely waved off, then I might agree that getting vaccinated is a social obligation.
p11396
aVRight now it's more like rolling the dice with your health.
p11397
aVMercury has been removed from almost all vaccines since 2001.
p11398
aVAny vaccine that still contains [a small amount of] mercury have Ethyl Mercury, which your body pisses out.
p11399
aVThe harmful mercury found in fish is Methyl Mercury.
p11400
aVPeople freak out that vaccines have formaldehyde, which is true, they do.
p11401
aVBUT your body naturally produces a LOT more than is even ingested through a vaccine.
p11402
aVSo that's a completely non-issue.
p11403
aVVaccines also can't give you the flu/measles/mumps/whatever.
p11404
aVI believe that they USED to be able to, when people were injected with active versions of infections/diseases.
p11405
aVToday, we're given inactive, or dead, version of the virus and it cannot affect you.
p11406
aVVaccines cause autism?
p11407
aVAbsolutely not.
p11408
aVThe guy that pioneered the idea, [Andrew Wakefield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), was outed for completely fudging his data, was paid a LOT of money (read: took a bribe) to testify in a lawsuit against MMR vaccinations and then applied for patents on his own vaccines.
p11409
aVHe was a scumbag that lied about everything to make money and was stripped of his medical licenses.
p11410
aVLiterally, the only negatives are redness, itching or swelling in the immediate area of the injection - and that clearly goes away.
p11411
aVThank you for the info.
p11412
aVDo you have anything to cast doubt on what [this doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efto1LpWkKw) says?

p11419
aVNow it is 1 in 50.
p11420
aV" Is this true?
p11421
aVIs so, what is causing it?
p11422
aVI honestly don't know if vaccines are causing autism or the array of other conditions attributed to them.
p11423
aVI don't know if the many experts who claim it is junk science are correct.
p11424
aVBut I think there are enough questions raised and evidence given to **respect parents who are trying to protect their children.

aVThis Humphries lady is full of shit.
p11427
aVLet's start...\u000a\u000a&gt; "There has never been a safe vaccination"\u000a\u000aThis is utterly absurd.
p11428
aVVaccinations are why the world is why small pox does not exist, measles and mumps have been 99% eradicated and whooping cough is down by 81%.
p11429
aVVaccinations.
p11430
aVThat's the only reason.
p11431
aV&gt; "it thwarts the immune system into a balance that's very unnatural and leaves it susceptible to ... more things ..." ???
p11432
aVThis is, for example, one of those many, many times she just rambles off some vague nonsense with out a single detail or point to back up this claim.
p11433
aV&gt; "...combined with all the chemicals and antibiotics, things that manufacturing companies may not know about"\u000a\u000aWTF is this shit?
p11434
aVThese vaccines are made so precisely and in an extremely calculated manner.
p11435
aVThey don't just throw random shit and chemicals in a vial and ship it out.
p11436
aV&gt; ... some nonsense about how the metallic needle affects the way our cells react to the vaccine and its chemicals\u000a\u000aThis is a completely made up concern.
p11437
aVNot once has a modern day needle been questioned to alter the affect of any injection.
p11438
aV&gt; "if people are really seeing each other dropping dead of smallpox"\u000a\u000aDoes she know what smallpox is?
p11439
aVGoogle it.
p11440
aVIt's killed hundreds of millions of people.
p11441
aV&gt; "... and they were really seeing each other being saved by a smallpox vaccine, the line would be out of town"\u000a\u000aKeep googling smallpox.
p11442
aVBecause due to a very successful wide-spread vaccination, it has been declared completely eradicated in 1979.
p11443
aVIt's been 2:30 and everything this lady has said so far is complete bullshit.
p11444
aVI'm not watching this anymore and will take a look at the other videos.
p11445
aVedit: she's also a proponent of homeopathy, which has absolutely no evidence of working in the medical world.
p11446
aVHomeopathy is complete bullshit.
p11447
aVI agree with everything except your last sentence.
p11448
aVPlacebo does have very positive effects, and you cannot just give a sugar pill otherwise people will not buy into the idea that it helps to cure.
p11449
aVSo in that sense IMO homeopathy does provide a positive effect. 
p11450
aVSeems you can\u000a&gt;[Not only did we make it absolutely clear that these pills had no active ingredient and were made from inert substances, but we actually had 'placebo' printed on the bottle](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/22/us-placebo-idUSTRE6BL4IU20101222)

aVI always thought that more expensive ones worked better:\u000ahttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080304173339.htm
p11453
aVI read somewhere that bigger pills work better than smaller ones and an injection is even more effective.
p11454
aVI was about to leave this, after a few minutes of the second lady, but started watching the 3rd one.
p11455
aVThis one actually makes a point withing the first couple minutes (I'm only a little more than a minute in right now).
p11456
aVI haven't looked into this CDC / Merck, but I believe it and it's not surprising at all.
p11457
aVThis happens all the time with huge companies like this.
p11458
aVLook at Comcast... their high ups are all over the regulatory boards.
p11459
aVThey're greedy fucks that pay to have things their way, to make them more rich.
p11460
aVIt's fucked up that the medical (and every other industry) are corrupted by the wealthy.
p11461
aVIn order to get a drug even considered for FDA approval, you need a LOT of money and a lot of time.
p11462
aVI'd bet that more money = less money spent waiting.
p11463
aVBut anyway, it's fucked up and no one agrees with the system.
p11464
aVBut back to the original point... this has no affect on the effectiveness of vaccines.
p11465
aVAnd no matter what these people say and believe, there's is extremely little evidence (none, literally) that they are harmful and A SHITTON of evidence that they are effective and necessary.
p11466
aVI was vaccinated as a child and turned out fine.
p11467
aVOf course, the vaccines were created differently back then, and we didn't get as many of them ... and they started later in life.
p11468

p11469
aVMy guess is that a subset of the population is intolerant to some vaccines, but to study and identify who they are, first a problem has to be acknowledged.
p11470
aVIt's sorta like when the tobacco industry denied that smoking causes cancer.
p11471
aVI remember the Congressional hearing where all those CEOs sat there and flat out denied it.

aVThen the trial lawyers pried more documents out of those companies that showed they knew very well that smoking causes cancer.

aVThe debate changes when faced with people whose children got sick right after getting vaccinated.
p11475
aVInfants *should* get vaccinated, because they're at highest risk of dying from these diseases.
p11476
aVThe risk of dying from the disease is hundreds of times higher than any problems from a vaccine.
p11477
aVThat's like saying we shouldn't put seat belts on kids because they risk choking from the belt around their necks.

aV&gt; vaccines were created differently back then\u000a\u000aYeah, they were.
p11480
aVThey were created with active versions of the virus and a ton of mercury.
p11481
aV&gt; Now infants are getting vaccinated, and that's just wrong\u000a\u000aHow?
p11482
aVPoint me to a credible source that proves vaccines are bad for infants.
p11483
aV&gt; My guess is that a subset of the population is intolerant to some vaccines\u000a\u000aIs this based on any fact whatsoever?

aVThe second lady...\u000a\u000a&gt; "vaccine safety studies are short; they're inconclusive; they don't go on for a long period of time.
p11485
aVAll the studies are performed on children who are not ill..."\u000a\u000aThe length of a drug or vaccine clinical trial varies greatly, often (usually?
p11486
aV) lasting years.
p11487
aVIn cases of outbreak (ebola, etc) they're done much faster for obvious reason.
p11488
aVThe FDA doesn't release drugs with "inconclusive" results.
p11489
aVAnd trials have a wide variety of test subjects.
p11490
aVThey're tested in a lab, then usually on animals, before testing a very small set of people, followed by a larger set, sometimes (not always) using children, if the vaccine will apply to children.

aVStill, I hope people rally around this case and affect some real change.

aVThis sort of thing has been happening all too often.
p11505
aV&gt;if there was no video here, there would have been no murder indictment\u000a\u000aExactly why cops hate cameras, and exactly why they are so needed.  
p11506
aVNope, only when there absolute indisputable evidence in the public domain.
p11507
aVOtherwise it is your word against a the police, and juries are instructed to believe a cop. 
p11508
aVYup.
p11509
aVThat's why cameras are so very important.
p11510
aVIf someone sees something like this happening shoot the video and get it into the public domain ASAP.
p11511
aVThis story tells you that it works. 
p11512
aVwait 24 to 48 hours for the Police and city officals to file their reports and make statements to the public.
p11513
aVLet them dig the hole first. 
p11514
aVWhat we need is a breakthrough case in which a cop is actually convicted in a situation like this one where the main evidence is a video.
p11515
aVThat will change things.

aVYeah.
p11550
aVHe must have been special in some way.
p11551
aVHopefully he was special academically (like he skipped the third grade) and it was not because he was a Congressman's son.

aVSince teens don't need to be accompanied by an adult to obtain contraceptives at the facilities, critics say the initiative undermines parental rights.

aVOnce a kid/teenager is making the adult decision to have intercourse, I'm not sure that "parental rights" really apply to that region of their kid.

aVQuite understandably, this is killing an entire generation's love of reading.

aVAnd your solution is to add porn.

aVEveryone with two brain cells knows we haven't had an outbreak like this in the US until those illegal children came across the border and were spread around the country by Obama.

aVHe is 267 pounds.

aVI see a lot of bad cop videos and am just as outraged as anyone else but this video did not seem like a whole lot of wrongdoing, he tased her and she hit her head and now she has died.
p11622
aVthe same thing could have happened if she were tackled by him for running away and hit her head.
p11623
aVthe girl was moving (albeit not very well) after the tasing and he did not continue to tase once she hit the ground (ops title suggests he tased her *until* she became vegetative and that is simply not true.
p11624
aVI dont see the outcome of this being much different if the cop was in good shape and just chased her down either because most likely (watched a few cop takedown videos in my time) he would have just tackled her and it appears it was her head injury that killed her.
p11625
aVanyone else have any other info on if it was the actual taser that killed her or if it was the head injury?
p11626
aV[Here](http://youtu.be/ZrDox4wYBlQ?t=35s) is the video after skipping past the overly dramatic introduction

aVLet her run.
p11628
aVLet Eric Brown walk away.
p11629
aVThese people don't have to die for minor offenses.
p11630
aVThey can be tracked down later and arrested if necessary.
p11631
aVIn most of these cases these are not inherently violent or dangerous people.
p11632
aVAnd they'd probably turn themselves in once that rush of adrenalin is gone.
p11633
aVInstead we have cases like this where a stupid girl who isn't a danger to anyone gets shocked like a rabid dog.
p11634
aVIt's unnecessary however it IS the current mentality that's pretty pervasive in a very authoritarian America.
p11635
aVWe tell officers that letting someone walk away is basically a guarantee of social anarchy and dead cops on every street corner.
p11636
aVWhich is, of course, not true.
p11637
aVIt's clickbait.
p11638
aVThe title says he tasered her until she passed into a vegetative state which is just objectively false.
p11639
aVHe tazed her one time and she fell and hit her head, the force of which led to brain damage.
p11640
aVWhile this is depressingly tragic, and I certainly think the officer could've avoided the use of his tazer, the title posted here on reddit and the article and video are disingenuously misleading and clearly driven by agenda.

aVIf the Corporations won't accept responsibility, then the People need to and they need to hold them responsible.
p11649
aVI seriously doubt any American would object to the Government doing that...
p11650
aVWhy should good god fearing philanthropists like the Koch brothers have to be responsible for cleaning their own mess?
p11651
aVThat's what government is for, right?
p11652
aVShouldn't all those peons who benefited from the Koch brother's immensity foot the bill for cleaning this shit of theirs up?
p11653
aVThey should see it as the honor and privilege it is.

aVhaving to clean  up your mess isnt an unnecessary risk, getting cancer and other ailments is however.

p11664
aVSo what's the straw manning outrage over?
p11665
aVWhat they should really do, and all newspapers around the western world should do, is publish Charlie Hedbo cartoons, all on the same day.
p11666
aVIt would be such a wonderful show of solidarity, as well as a collective FY to those who would try to suppress creative and political expression.

aVWhen Larry Flynt was shot by someone upset by all the interracial porn he published, the response wasn't to publish the same porn everywhere.
p11670
aVIt's not necessary to the reporting.
p11671
aVSecond, while I'm livid at these terrorists, publishing the Hebo cartoons isn't going to just "stick it to the terrorists," but also offend millions of peaceful law-abiding Muslims.
p11672
aVIf I hated Al Sharpton or Obama, using the N word on him is going to offend more than just him.
p11673
aVLet's mock the terrorists directly and endlessly rather than go after too broad a target. 
p11674
aVI agree.
p11675
aVEven though **no one** deserves violence for expressing their free speech, that depiction of mohammed is clearly offensive to many muslims.

aVI think this would have been better than omitting it:\u000a\u000aFox "News"
p11707
aVFox is only "News" between 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays.
p11708
aVThe rest is classed as "Opinion" which I think allows them to sidestep news reporting regulations.
p11709
aVApparently their own terms describe their channel as "for entertainment purposes"

aVI love the part where he says "I mean I don't care...." yes... yes you do.. or you wouldn't be complaining about it.
p11719
aVI find it funny that whenever there's a nuance against anything right-wing and/or Fox "News" they bitch about it.
p11720
aVIf it happens to anything/anyone else, they bitch about how that entity of overacting.  
p11721
aVWar is a large part of American culture, it's one of the reasons the US government can get away with committing frivolous acts of violence around the world, including convincing these people in uniform to go along with it.
p11722
aVEither way, the article's author is correct, using the term hero to paint "the troops" does make people sound dumb.
p11723
aVSince the Nixon administration "support our troops" has essentially been a political weapon to quickly kill all real discussion of war (which would involve real criticism, including civilian deaths) and make everyone fall into line.
p11724
aVIt's truly odd and sinister in a country where contempt for soldiers and the military is practically non-existent except in fringe far-right and far-left groups.
p11725
aVIt's practically the beginning and end to any thought certain people put into military conflicts our country engage in: "No matter what, you have to support the troops.

aVHa!
p11766
aVThey reprinted half the book in that article.
p11767
aVWhat's the context?
p11768
aVToo many to choose from, [this](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/) is the one I found most disgusting.
p11769
aV"Savage despicable evil.
p11770
aVThat's what we were fighting in Iraq.
p11771
aV" One of the first quotes in the article.
p11772
aVCan't say I disagree with that assessment.
p11773
aVThere are valid arguments about should we have been there, did our presence create Al Qaeda in Iraq .
p11774
aVOne thing you can't argue is Al Qaeda in Iraq (which became ISIS) is pretty fucking evil. 
p11775
aVWhats the proper context for him saying how much fun he had killing people?
p11776
aVFantastic point that is at the heart of my original post.
p11777
aVMy impression Chris Kyle has a genuine hatred for the people he was fighting, Al Qaeda in Iraq and later ISIS.
p11778
aVI don't think hate is a good thing but I've never walked in his shoes and don't feel like I can sit in judgment on him.
p11779
aVWhere this article becomes propaganda is in it's perversion of the direction of this hatred.
p11780
aVHe hated people that beheaded civilians and raped children, not Arabs, not Muslims, not civilians, not "people" just trying to get by.
p11781
aVThe author tries to link Muslim extremist as just regular people, "Arab" being her preferred word.
p11782
aVI believe there are many Arabs and members of the Muslim community that would [strongly dispute any such association](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30769681) with Al Qaeda in Iraq or ISIS.
p11783
aVWe can argue over words but my impression is he didn't have fun killing "people".
p11784
aVHe hated "Savage despicable evil" and probably did enjoyed killing those monsters.
p11785
aVThe fact that the author intentionally tries to blur those lines is what makes it propaganda.
p11786
aVedit: Posting the right link this time.

aV:)
p11788
aVThe Facebook graphic by OurTime.org claimed, "There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment.
p11789
aV" **The group left out a key distinction from the study** they cite: **Minimum wage workers can\u2019t afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent, a number determined by the federal government for each region set at the 40th percentile of all rents in that area.
p11790
aV**\u000a\u000a**That means that in some areas, minimum wage earners would be able to find and afford housing that is cheaper than the Fair Market Rent**\u000a\u000aTypical disingenuous progressive propaganda 
p11791
aVSo you say if people are stuck in a minimum wage situation they should only be able to live in a limited amount of places, probably the shittiest neighborhoods in the area?
p11792
aVNot necessarily anywhere near where they can find work.
p11793
aVYeah, and we'll no longer subsidize mass transit or have a minimum wage while we're at it to keep them there.
p11794
aVThat'll keep those uppity bastards in their place.
p11795
aVFuck the American Dream.

aVIts called having roommates.
p11799
aVI make three times minimum wage and live with roommates.
p11800
aVI don't understand why some entitled fucks think that they can deserve a two bedroom apartment on it.
p11801
aVI don't even see why a single person would need a two-bedroom place.
p11802
aVTed Cruz seems to have chosen to become a political whore of epic proportions.

aVCan't have that shit now can we? 
p11814
aVIs it me, or does it seem Republicans are not conservatives, but more reactionary, as instead of trying to maintain the status quo, they try to roll back Social reforms.
p11815
aVWHAT!?!?!?!
p11816
aVYou mean, Republicans don't have the best interests of the people they govern in mind?
p11817
aVThis bill wasn't going to help much by limiting payments, since that only meant more interest pilling up.
p11818
aVRepublicans are still generally assholes, but this bill wasn't going to help combat debt much.

aVOh what a surprise.

aVI think you're confused about what is meant by, women should have the right to choose whether or not they wish to give birth to children.
p11828
aVNot the state government, nor their citizens, or the average cop should be the one to decide this.
p11829
aVHopefully, I've helped clear that up for you.
p11830
aVPro-police brutality  pro-life conservatives' heads will explode from this story.
p11831
aVYes, $50k is too small.
p11832
aVBut as a point of fact, there was no "baby" involved.
p11833
aVNo child was killed.
p11834
aVThe woman was pregnant and the cop caused the woman to have a miscarriage.
p11835
aVHorrific, yes, but there's a night-and-day difference between causing a miscarriage and murdering an infant.
p11836
aVAccording to the law: \u000a&gt; Any person subject to this chapter who engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury a child who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
p11837
aVAnd goes on to say.
p11838
aV&gt;An offense under this section does not require proof that\u2014\u000a(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or\u000a(ii) the accused intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
p11839
aVYes, I get it that this occurred in the Bible Belt and many of those reactionary states push their right-wing "Christian values" onto the population in defiance of the Constitution and have anti-abortion laws that define a fetus as a living human being.
p11840
aVHell, states like Alabama *still* have laws on the books which prohibit black and white children from going to school together.
p11841
aVBut just because something is "the law" does not mean it is "just".
p11842
aVWhat I'm curious about is if the pig involved in causing the miscarriage will be prosecuted as a criminal, or if the pig(s) who tried to erase the tape recording of the event will be prosecuted.
p11843
aV(Because it would appear to me that the entire system is simply broken.

p11898
aVShe's actually accomplished a few things for consumer protection and what she tends to focus seems to be working class issues instead of corporate ones; unlike many of her co-workers.
p11899
aVI think she could accomplish more common sense bills if the bipartisan Congress, as a whole, wasn't so obstructionist to anything getting done.

p11950
aVMy state and federal taxes total 30% of my income, I'm to tithe 10% and follow the rule of saving 15% of my income for retirement that leaves me with 45% of my income to live on.

aVLabor unions are not official government representation. 
p11960
aV&gt; Labor unions are not official government representation.
p11961
aVLabor unions donate massive amounts of money to left wing political campaigns.
p11962
aVThe "representation" churches would get would work the exact same way.
p11963
aVIf they had to pay taxes then churches would be fully entitled to formally endorse candidates, run explicitly political advertising and donate to political campaigns just like every other taxed entity.
p11964
aVSure, but that's a completely different issue than "no taxation without representation" which is what I responded to originally.
p11965
aVAs it is now, we basically have a system where we bribe churches to stay out of politics.
p11966
aVWhere has that gotten us?
p11967
aVChurches are still in politics, and there are plenty of right wing funding groups that serve the same purpose now. 
p11968
aV&gt; Sure, but that's a completely different issue than "no taxation without representation" which is what I responded to originally.
p11969
aVNo it isn't.
p11970
aVIt is one and the same issue.
p11971

aVnot I ;) When I see a minister flying around in a jet and stealing from the pulpit I get sick to my stomach
p11978
aVMost of the ones doing that are doing it as part of a taxed business, not as part of their church.
p11979
aVThey're being paid as speakers.
p11980
aVAnd stealing from people doesn't change the taxing status.
p11981
aVThose people suck whether they are ministers or running a small business or head of a giant company.

aVSo, a Democrat refused to resign from her position as District Attorney, where she controlled the state\u2019s Public Integrity Unit, an entity which investigates ethics violations of elected officials.
p12003
aVThe likely reason why is that Perry, a Republican, would have almost certainly installed another Republican.
p12004
aVOne of the few positions in control of a Democrat under Perry\u2019s watch would\u2019ve vanished\u2014a big deal, given the power of the Public Integrity Unit.
p12005
aVPerry, as a means of intimidating the DA into resigning, publicly threatened to veto the Public Integrity Unit\u2019s budget.
p12006
aVAnd when she didn\u2019t step down, he made good on his tough talk, gutting all of its funding ($8 million) for two years.
p12007
aVPerry violated two laws:\u000a\u000aThe first of which prohibits public servants from consciously engaging in misuse of government property, services, personnel, or any other things of value belonging to the government that has come to the public servants custody or possession by virtue of the public servant\u2019s office or employment.
p12008
aVThe second of which bans coercion to influence or attempt to influence public officials in either a specific exercise of his official power or a specific performance of his official duty or to violate the public servants known legal duty.
p12009
aVAn Austin, Texas grand jury handed down the two count indictment late Friday afternoon.
p12010
aVIn the near future, Perry will have to present himself to a judge and be booked like a common criminal defendant, including fingerprinting and a mug shot.\u000a
p12011
aVNow THAT is going to be a mug shot heard 'round the world!
p12012
aVWhat gives the Texas Legislature the ability to criminalize a governor using their constitutional veto powers in any way they see fit?
p12013
aVVeto powers are coercive powers by nature.
p12014
aVThey let governor's and Presidents say "Do this or I won't approve this bill".
p12015
aVConstitutions usually protect against misuse by letting legislatures override them with a supermajority.
p12016
aVIn this case that didn't happen.
p12017
aVI don't know what you're talking about but Perry broke two laws.
p12018
aVELI5: The laws don't apply.
p12019
aVELI12: Threatening a veto is a central part of the governor's veto powers.
p12020
aVMaking a veto threat illegal would violate the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.
p12021
aVThat and the law he's charged with violating explicitly exempts governing bodies anyways.
p12022
aVHe also might not get any jail time (or any substantial punishment for that matter), since he's a politician with money and insider connections.
p12023
aVi would be shocked if it went down any other way to be honest.

aVHey, remember Blagojevich?

aV"Mostly false"?
p12040
aVThe article points out that the 1% far more wealth than the deficit and even has more income every year than the deficit.
p12041
aVSo this statement is TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY FALSE.
p12042
aVPolitifact is bending over backwards for the conservatives.
p12043
aVThey only say it's not completely false because the deficit is higher than the 1% current tax burden.
p12044
aVHow in the world could "taking every penny and even their dog" mean "their current level of taxation"? 
p12045
aVArrest their jive ass, and seize their assets.
p12046
aVAnd I wouldn't cut it off at the 1%, heh...
p12047
aVThey should all get a fair trial, of course.
p12048
aVI believe this can most optimally be achieved by stricter regulation, interpretation and enforcement, democratically, electorally...rather than by, say, collapse of the socio-economic system, chaos and insurrectionary civil war, which the right (and some elements of the purported left) would seem to prefer.
p12049

p12101
aVI can't understand how he can come across as being so breath-tauntingly ignorant.
p12102
aVSome of the things that this guy is attributed to are about as blatantly idiotic as the rantings of a derelict alcoholic on canned heat.
p12103
aVJust thinking, if he accidentally ended up in the White House gives me a headache.
p12104
aVFrankly, I don't get it, either.
p12105
aVSo far, he has displayed a personae that is all too comfortable pandering to the lowest common demoninator of the right and yet, he has a substantial education and a myriad of personal and political accomplishments that would lead you to believe that he is more than capable of a more politically savvy approach, even if he does favor the right (I don't).

p12156
aV" Ok, sure, they are scientists but as board members advising a policy making body it's a conflict of interest to evaluate your own work and its appropriate to recuse yourself... \u000a\u000aPerhaps that wasn't happening as frequently as it should have been.
p12157
aVDistricts are drawn at the state level, not the federal level and each state sets their own rules for how it is done.
p12158
aVWhile an admirable cause, you're targeting the wrong audience for this.
p12159
aVYou need to work at the state level or get an amendment to the constitution passed, which also does not involve the president.  
p12160
aVI hear ya bud, and I agree that change has to happen at the state level.
p12161
aVI am hoping that Mr. Obama would see the noble goal being proposed and work towards that outcome, even though he cannot directly influence districting efforts.

aVThis honestly won't do anything.
p12163
aVPresident Obama can say and do what he wants, but this is a state issue.
p12164
aVIt's a state rights issue.
p12165
aVBarring a constitutional amendment (and we all know the likelihood of that not happening), the states have sole control over this.
p12166
aVThe only way to fix it is by going to the states and demanding change.

p12204
aVJesus tucking Christ!
p12205
aVWhat you should remember is that around the 1900s southern organisations got laws passed in most southern states mandating that no school was allowed to teach that slavery was the cause of the civil war.
p12206

p12216
aVWhen one hears the blatant disregard of not only *constitutional* guarantees, but the stereotyped indifference and brutality involved by the institutions (courts, lawyers, jails, etc.
p12217
aV), and when one then thinks about how the corruption is system-wide and deep, one has to ponder the question: Can mere reforms address this or is something more dramatic required?
p12218
aVI think that the whole juvenile detention system is broken, and probably should be basically scrapped at this point.   
p12219

aVAnyone else notice before audio cuts out some saying "turn it off, everyone should be off"?

aVIf they were afraid of the gun, couldn't they just have had the two guys step out of the car and away from the gun?
p12226
aVNot when the cops were out for the hunt.
p12227
aVBad training.
p12228
aVThe cops are trained to be soldiers and not to be cops.

aVOur LEA's are broken.

p12231
aVWords are important, you know.
p12232
aVThat's exactly what he did.
p12233
aVActions are more important.
p12234
aVHow was that an execution?
p12235
aVIt was more like suicide by cop.
p12236
aVEvery single damn time there is a controversial cop shooting the victim was resisting arrest.
p12237
aVCops need to make decisions in the blink of an eye.
p12238
aVHe was dealing with a hostile person who was not following orders.
p12239
aVThe guy forced himself out of the car after being told to stay IN the car.
p12240
aVHe may have had his hands at chest level, but in 3 seconds he could have tackled the cop.
p12241
aVAlso, if you want to blame him for not having non-lethal force, thats not his fault, its the department's.
p12242
aVThe man has a prior history of shooting at police and that cop more than likely knew that and Bridgeton has a very high crime rate and has become a hotspot for gangbangers.\u000a
p12243
aVThe passenger was riding in someone else's car and may not have even known about the gun.
p12244
aVThat cop made a judgement call that ended the life of another human being without question.
p12245
aVThe other officer shot the victim in the back as well.
p12246
aVThese are coward, murderer cops and they need to brought to justice.\u000a
p12247
aVYou'll change your opinion in the future.

aVTrust me.

aVAmerica isn't a capitalist society, but a capitalistic plutocracy.

aVI heard on [today's DemocracyNow report](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/16/a_corporate_trojan_horse_critics_decry) that the US now has the 4th most unequal gap between the rich and poor of any country in the world, thus prompting me to search for information in the issue, turning up this 2013 article.
p12282
aV/r/inequality
p12283
aVThis was happening way before Obama.
p12284
aVObama just came to power after the recession which wiped out the wealth of the middle class.
p12285
aVThe middle class invested much of their wealth in their homes that when the housing crisis happened inequality went up. 
p12286
aVThanks Obama!
p12287
aVObama Obama Obama.... What about me!
p12288
aVI want some thanks too
p12289
aVRefreshing.
p12290
aVSo you admit to being Artificial intelligence.
p12291
aVThere is something really wrong about this.
p12292
aVOur family have trained dogs since 1956.
p12293
aVWe've trained for obedience, tracking, search &amp; rescue, and police work.
p12294
aVEvery dog we ever trained would not have done this.
p12295
aVIt's basic.
p12296
aVThe animal will "only" attack on command.
p12297
aVFor this to have happened, there is something very wrong with the dog, the handler, or it's training. 
p12298
aV...
p12299
aVThey will kill the dog to save the aggressor !
p12300
aVSeems like this was just a horrible accident.
p12301
aVStill, since police dogs are trained to be dangerous and live with their handlers, they should not be assigned to cops that have small children at home. \u000a
p12302
aVWell said Jon Stewart!

aVAnd Christie is the biggest pile of crap alive today.

p12307
aVNot sure about Batman but Margret Mitchell has been dead since 1949.
p12308
aVThe only ones who benefit are her heirs.
p12309
aVWhat do we continue in this country lavish wealth on those who did not earn it? 
p12310
aVCounterpoint, \u000a\u000aWhy is it that others should profit from such a unique and original work that they may dishonor, dilute or ruin?
p12311
aVAt least the creator can ensure that his family is taken care of for generations to come because of his work.
p12312
aVWhat gives society the right to this man's work without any regard for preserving it in the manner it was intended?\u000a\u000a
p12313
aV&gt; Why is it that others should profit from such a unique and original work that they may dishonor, dilute or ruin?
p12314
aVI take it you've never heard of fair use?
p12315
aVAlso Walt Disney created an empire doing exactly this.
p12316
aVWhy should these artists get protection from others doing to them what they did to others?
p12317
aV&gt; At least the creator can ensure that his family is taken care of for generations to come because of his work\u000a\u000aBecause after you're dead, you don't have a say, you're dead.
p12318
aVWhy should future generations be shackled to the past?
p12319
aV&gt; What gives society the right to this man's work without any regard for preserving it in the manner it was intended?
p12320
aVBecause all artists are heavily influenced by the societies they live in.
p12321
aVNot to mention without society, they have no wealth from their works as it's value comes from society at large giving it value.
p12322
aVUntil recently, the goal of copyright has been long understood as a means to foster creativity, not as some kind of absolute right of the creator.
p12323
aVIt's supposed to be a balance between allowing creators to profit from their works while allowing future generations to build upon and profit again.
p12324
aVIt's certainly not meant to allow people who've created nothing to continue to profit from the works of others (e.g.
p12325
aVheirs).
p12326
aV&gt; Why is it that others should profit from such a unique and original work that they may dishonor, dilute or ruin?

p12335
aVShe should challenge Hilary in the Primary to draw out stronger candidates (Cuomo, Warner) or at least show how bad Clinton is

p12337

p12338
aVLOL.
p12339
aVYeah, she's the best modern spokesperson for the fascist (aka "progressive") wing of the Democratic party.
p12340
aVAmerican style fascism is more of the smiley faced "we're here to help, this is for your own good" fascism.
p12341
aVAs George Carlin said: *"when fascism comes to America, it will not be in brown and black shirts.
p12342

p12349
aVThey do this in every state they have power in.

aVAs someone else pointed out, this measure was probably targeted more at Spanish-only speakers than Navajo specifically, but both lean Democrat so anything the Republicans can do to deny them the vote is a win in their book.

aVBecause they arnt members.
p12359

aVThere are phenomenal conversations taking place in America, and the rest of the world for that matter, about the course of humanity and these bandwidth hogginh koch brother dogs are polluting the airwaves and wasting everyone's time.
p12373
aVNot just the airwaves, but the entire political process.
p12374
aVThey are a clog in the flow of ideas, choking off any meaningful progress.
p12375
aVAs our economy sputters along years into a so called recovery leaving millions without jobs, as our debt soars to levels that all but guarantee the devaluation of our currency, as our stature around the world sinks in the shadow of one foreign policy disaster after another, as our healthcare system reels under the inept management of president Obama, the Democrats attempt to distract the public by pointing the finger at the other party.

aV&gt; Bates did say &amp;quot;Taser&amp;quot; before shooting Harris, and immediately after pulling the trigger, Bates drops the gun and says &amp;quot;Oh!

aVI&amp;#039;m sorry.&amp;quot; At a press conference on Friday, a Tulsa County Sheriff&amp;#039;s Office spokesperson claimed that Bates was a &amp;quot;True victim&amp;quot; of something called &amp;quot;Slips and capture&amp;quot; - a police term for when someone does one thing while believing they are doing something else in a high stress situation.

p12389
aVOddly, the shooter isn't the person I'm enraged at.
p12390
aVI accept that at some point, an honest mistake is going to happen.
p12391
aVNot to say that mistake should have no consequences to the the person who fucked up, mind you, only to admit that things like this can happen without intent or malice.
p12392
aVBut for the other officers at the scene to let the man die instead of fighting to save him has me enraged.
p12393
aVIn my mind, it was not the person who pulled the trigger who should be convicted of murder in this case, and several people absolutely need to see jail time for their willful inaction.
p12394
aVI'm most enraged at a system that allows a 73 yo man to buy a badge and be allowed to run around with a pistol and a taser with basically zero training acting like a cop.
p12395
aVThis was completely inevitable.
p12396
aVSooner or later someone was going to get hurt or killed and here we are.
p12397
aVThis insanity of this setup in a big city, or any city.
p12398
aVin America is appalling.
p12399
aVWhoever thought this was good idea should be the one on trial for murder.
p12400
aVThere a reason why cops go through so much training and testing.
p12401
aVI wonder how many other times this kind of shit has happened and been hushed up? 
p12402
aV"If she runs *and* becomes the Democratic candidate"?
p12403
aVMaher's money is safe -- both him and Warren knows that.
p12404
aVThere is simply no way the corporations and wealthy people that control the Democratic Party would allow Warren to become the party's nominee.
p12405
aVYeah, she's the only voice of reason that might keep America from going up in flames.
p12406
aVWhy would they support that when quarterly earnings reports are all that matter.
p12407
aVShe had probably a 15% chance of working a miracle.
p12408
aVNow its down to riots.
p12409
aV&gt; Now its down to riots.
p12410
aVIn general, I agree.
p12411
aVWarren was a pipe dream anyway.
p12412
aVNo Democratic president is going to oppose Wall Street or the wealthy people that control the vast majorities of *both* parties.
p12413
aVThe system is rigged.
p12414
aVThe [oligarchs](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/230sgy/us_is_an_oligarchy_not_a_democracy_says/) who control the Tweedledum and Tweedledee parties ensure that no serious "reform" of the US is going to come from either of our ruling parties.
p12415
aVI like what she has to say, but, that's about it.
p12416
aVShe's all bark and no bite.
p12417
aVShe says she'd like to do all kinds of wonderful things.
p12418
aVBut, what has she gotten done?
p12419
aVI think she's gonna run.
p12420
aVIf she does and she wins we'll see if she can actually deliver 1/10th of the things that have come out of her mouth.
p12421
aVI'm skeptical at best.
p12422
aVAs opposed to Hillary, who will deliver 0/10th of the things out of her mouth.
p12423
aVI am also, do not trust anyone after I put my eggs on Obama.
p12424
aVHe fucked everyone up.
p12425
aVDid nothing to the bankers , kissed Israel until just the last few months , has not helped the middle class  - wtf!
p12426
aVI also just hate Hilary the Witch, she is all bullshit, I will never ever vote for her.
p12427
aVBernie Sanders is another one I would vote for. 
p12428
aVI can't believe in the year 2015 that the citizens of Arkansas still want to pick Cotton.
p12429
aVThing about that "back-door tax" of summonses and arresting people for every little misdemeanor is that it's not just a back door tax, but it's on the poor entirely because politicians haven't got the balls to raise taxes on the wealthy even though it obviously needs to be done.
p12430
aVThey'd rather see all the poor in the country homeless then try to tax the rich.
p12431
aVIt's become more and more obvious that this is happening nationwide, and this strike just points it out in bold strokes.
p12432
aVIf we can't figure out what's going on from this amazing example I have no hope for America.
p12433
aVThe main purpose of the police, the military, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the laws, the courts, is to protect the interests of the plutocratic families, the corporate oligarchs and the international banksters...NOT We the People.
p12434
aVThe police are trained to behave like savage brutal thugs.\u000a
p12435
aVThe craziest thing about this case is the man who killed the two cops.
p12436
aVWe can sidestep the arguements about gun control for a min on this.
p12437
aVThis man from all accounts I've heard, was a nut.
p12438
aVIf the police didn't open themselves up to the public outrage, this man would've redirected onto something else.
p12439
aVSo we can add more to what we should be talking about here.
p12440
aVI believe that every American should be allowed to own a gun, have to go to safety classes, until it is provable they are not safe to use a firearm.
p12441
aVI think we should have some form of annual testing to make sure your accurate, know safety laws, and are mentally compatent.
p12442
aVI'm not saying expressly every year, maybe biannual or every five years.
p12443
aVThis may not be the answer either but it seems a good deal better then we got now.
p12444
aVMental health just needs a money dump from all levels.
p12445
aVLets be real here.
p12446
aVI wonder if redirecting money away from police to be tax enforcers to mental health professionals would result in more money saved in the long run.
p12447

aVNet worth was going up doing those other administrations.
p12764
aVThe Great Recession simply wiped out decades of gains and Obama's tenure has been unique in that it is the worst recovery in the post WW2 period and defies the established rule that the worst the crash, the more robust the recovery.
p12765
aVHis heavy handed approach has stifled what should have been a strong recovery and has us still worse off after 6 years of Obama than after 3 years of Reagan. 
p12766
aVthe recovery was fucked by the DO nothing Congress.. Just imagine how the recovery would of looked like if congress did their fucking job instead of trying to screw obama i mean the nation over?

p12771
aVOh, you mean a decline in net worth?
p12772
aVWell, thats not the same as poorer.
p12773
aVThey don't have the same buying power.

aVNo, I'm wondering how you account for the additional wealth.
p12778
aVHow do you calculate the entertainment wealth delivered in a modern cellphone?
p12779
aV(or, for that matter, what about your consideration of aircon, how much wealth does that deliver?
p12780
aV)\u000a\u000aI would argue that american's have lost their buying power.
p12781
aVThe argument is semantic, not political.
p12782
aV**What** additional wealth?
p12783
aVWhen they have mobile phones at all the country's poor doesn't typically have smartphones, they have base model cell phones that are more practical than ones anchored to the wall.
p12784
aVEntertainment wealth my ass.
p12785
aVYes, Americans have lost buying power (except for those in the upper 90th percentile) but it has hurt the poor the most.
p12786
aVWhat's left of the middle class has seen their wages and wealth stagnate but the poor have actually lost ground in terms of income.
p12787
aVThe nation's productivity has increased exponentially, but only a few are receiving much benefit from it.
p12788
aVAre you arguing that the access to infinite amounts of music and video entertainment is not additional wealth?

p12816
aVHow do I get permission from a corpse?

p12819
aVWell at least she can't complain about a headache !
p12820
aVum... how does an unenforceable law protect the innocent from anything?
p12821
aVSo what happens if you get oral sex from a corpse?
p12822
aVIt's much less shocking when you realize the victim was white.
p12823
aVTrue
p12824
aVWhy does it matter what color the victim is?
p12825
aVAll lives matter
p12826
aVI agree that it should make no difference what color the victim is.
p12827
aVUnfortunately, the justice system in the United States is demonstrably biased towards white people.
p12828
aVIt's not unreasonable to speculate that if the victim in this case had been a minority, the murderers would not have been indicted.
p12829
aVWell this is the most common sense plan I've heard in a long time.

p12835
aVJust watch how many down-votes this receives .
p12836
aVWhat?
p12837
aVShame on the media for exploiting tragedy toward political ends. 
p12838
aVShame on the ballsackless, flaccid politicians in congress and the whorehouse of representatives, shame on the NRA and shame on the gun owners the NRA registers and collects dues from everywhere.
p12839
aVThey've got blood on their hands.
p12840
aVShame on the media for glorifying these shooting situations more and more every time one happens, encouraging others to follow in the villain's footsteps and go for something bigger. 
p12841
aVWho is glorifying the shooting?
p12842
aVThe news media with all the constant attention that they are giving the killer in playing his manifestos, showing his pictures, talking about him non stop.
p12843
aVEveryone knows his name.
p12844
aVOff the top of your head, can you name any victims?
p12845
aVWhat about Sandy hook?
p12846
aVYou know the killer's name but no victims.
p12847
aVHow about Columbine?
p12848
aVMass killers do this to one up each other and for the attention.
p12849
aVBecause they know they will get it.
p12850
aVHere is something you should watch on why our media is doing it wrong:\u000a\u000ahttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1OCDCl_02NA\u000a
p12851
aVI don't think that's glorifying as much as it is informing.
p12852
aVThere is a throve of information about the killer and I think it is in the public's best interest to make up their own mind about it.
p12853
aVAlso, we are barely learning about the latest victims but I am sure that we will learn their names and about their lives in the near future.
p12854
aVI may not remember off the top of my head the names of the victims in Sandy Hook, and I often forget the name of the killer, but I will never forget the heinous act and what happened there.
p12855
aVIt doesn't mean I don't grieve for those kids any less every time I think about it and it doesn't mean that I forget what and who enabled the heinous acts either.
p12856
aVWhat does the public need to make their mind up about the killer?
p12857
aVIt's one thing if the killer is on the loose and dangerous to the public.
p12858
aVHe's dead and it's pretty clear he killed a bunch of people.
p12859
aVSo that's all that's needed to know.
p12860
aVThis is very clearly how you get copy cat killers. 
p12861
aVBecause life is not black and white.
p12862
aVNeither is death.
p12863
aVWas Chris one of the Asian kids that got stabbed to death?
p12864
aVNo.
p12865
aVHe was the last fatality. 
p12866
aVYou do know that all those kids survived and have recovered right? 
p12867
aV[No, they didn't.
p12868
aV](http://mashable.com/2014/05/24/santa-barbara-manifesto/) \u000a\u000aYou don't really recover from getting stabbed to death. 
p12869
aVI thought you were talking about a different stabbing... Way too much violence in the world :(
p12870
aVTrue that. 
p12871
aVIt must be nice thinking guns are the problem rather than the mental health of your nation. 
p12872
aVYou'd be surprised the effect weapons have on cognitive processing.
p12873
aVSince I work with them, no.
p12874
aVMental health is an issue, but it's an issue that is impossible tom100% deal with.
p12875
aVNot giving every crazy person a gun is a good step 
p12876
aVIn 2 out of every 3 deaths by gun, the shooter is also the victim.
p12877
aVIt's like thinking cars are the problem with drunk driving and not alcohol.
p12878
aVThe two are conflated.
p12879
aVYea, and the same argument goes.
p12880
aVPeople shouldnt be allowed to drive cars becuase some people drink, drive and crash.
p12881
aVSo instead of putting restrictions on all people driving cars, we should only place restrictions on drunk people driving car.
p12882
aVLikewise, instead of putting restrictions on all people owning guns, we should put restrictions on only mentally unstable people owning guns.
p12883
aVThe problem is some people think mental illness is a permanent condition - it would be like saying "when he passed his driver's test he wasn't drunk, don't see how he could have been arrested for drunk driving.
p12884
aV"  The mental state of people with guns should be checked as often as the drunkenness state of people with cars.
p12885
aVThat would make interesting headlines, u know, when the state starts doing obligatory "mental health tests" on the millions and millions of people with guns..
p12886
aVIt must be nice for you to have an excuse handed down to you by the NRA and not have to think about one yourself.
p12887
aVYeah, we want people like you having weapons.
p12888
aVWhat are you trying to say?
p12889
aVThat NRA made up an argument that is as old as man?
p12890
aVIt isnt the stone killing its the ape.
p12891
aVApes don't kill with stones.
p12892
aVIf that's what they tell you and you believe them, then you are disqualified to own a weapon.
p12893
aVThe point was that other specoes use tools to kill aswell and its never about the tool, its about the mind of the killer.
p12894
aVBanning guns would just make killer sprees find other absurd ways to kill mass people while rendering people unable to defend themselves.
p12895
aVYour tendency refering to me with personal insults tells me this debate is meaningless and your a child.
p12896
aVYou say the stupidest things.
p12897
aVToo bad you can't make a living out of it.
p12898
aVAd honimem again, wow such intellect
p12899
aVDon't get mad, I'm only being real.
p12900
aVLet me ask, what law do you feel has been blocked that would have stopped this crime?
p12901
aVHe passed a background check.
p12902
aVHe had 10 round magazines.
p12903
aVHe had handguns, not assault weapons.
p12904
aVWhat law would you propose that would have prevented this?
p12905
aVThere are plenty of ideas.
p12906
aVWe can begin with changing the weak federal laws that allow almost anyone, including the wrong people to get access to a wide variety of deadly weapons.
p12907
aVWhen you are at least 20 times more likely to be murdered with a fun just for being in the US there clearly is a problem.
p12908
aV- End the gun show loophole to include an IQ test and restrict what kinds of weapons that applicant can qualify for.
p12909
aV- Expand background checks to include a psychological evaluation.
p12910
aVWe can model this after Japan.
p12911
aV- Apparently a domestic violence conviction is needed to prevent gun purchases.
p12912
aVBut the standard is crap because SOs are gunned downs by their boyfriends/lovers/husbands at an alarming rate.
p12913
aV- Gun buyers need to attend mandatory workshops on handling/owning/storing weapons.
p12914
aVIOW, they are not to be used to replace tools (they are not tools), like that moron that wanted to make a hole in the wall to hang a tv and ended up killing his wife in the other room.
p12915
aV- Add teeth to any gun trafficking laws.
p12916
aVThis will stop dumbasses from carrying guns between states and/or through the airport.
p12917
aV- Give ATF the resources it needs to keep unscrupulous gun dealers in check.
p12918
aV- Improve access to funding and data for researchers so that smart, effective policies can be developed.
p12919
aV&gt;End the gun show loophole to include an IQ test and restrict what kinds of weapons that applicant can qualify for\u000a\u000aThe former I understand.
p12920
aVThe latter is lunacy; IQ tests aren't a reliable metric for competence or prudence.
p12921
aVI'm willing to bet Rodgers had a high IQ, and I would make that same bet for the VT shooter and the Aurora shooter.
p12922
aV&gt;Expand background checks to include a psychological evaluation.
p12923
aVAs long as it's provided at no cost to the gun owner, I could see this, though we'd have to have a serious debate about what exactly we're looking for.
p12924
aVPlease keep in mind that Rodgers was in therapy for most of his life and never officially diagnosed with anything.
p12925
aVIt is (and should be) hard to get someone declared mentally incompetent.
p12926
aVUnless we first repeal the 2nd Amendment, that's what you're testing for.
p12927
aV&gt;Apparently a domestic violence conviction is needed to prevent gun purchases\u000a\u000aYes, as there's that whole bother of "innocent until proven guilty".
p12928
aVIt's the same reason I don't think we should bar people on the terrorist watch list.
p12929
aVYou can have done nothing wrong and still be barred a right.
p12930
aVThat's a scary precedent to set.
p12931
aV&gt;Gun buyers need to attend mandatory workshops on handling/owning/storing weapons.
p12932
aVIf we expand that to gun safety courses taught as part of a high school education, I'm with you.
p12933
aVI think even people who don't want to own firearms should know how to safely handle and unload them.
p12934
aVIt would go a long way towards demystifying them.
p12935
aV&gt;(they are not tools)\u000a\u000aThere I have to disagree with you.
p12936
aVWeapon is a subset of tool.
p12937
aVWhat you're describing is 1) using a tool for something other than it's intended purpose, i.e.
p12938
aVdestroying targets and 2)already a violation of the four basic rules of gun safety, specifically knowing your target and what's beyond.
p12939
aV&gt;Add teeth to any gun trafficking laws.
p12940
aVWhat are the current penalties?
p12941
aV&gt;Give ATF the resources it needs to keep unscrupulous gun dealers in check.
p12942
aVVery little argument on that one.
p12943
aV&gt;Improve access to funding and data for researchers so that smart, effective policies can be developed.
p12944
aVIn general, I agree with this.
p12945
aVPersonally, I would add that we need to focus more on the reasons people shoot other people rather than what they shoot them with.
p12946
aVI think more lives could be saved by offering free anger management classes than lobbying for gun control. 
p12947
aVMass shootings are enabled by gun proliferation and not necessarily by anger issues.
p12948
aVThat's the bottom line.
p12949
aVThe minute you take gun control out of the solution process you are back at square one, or as we call it in America, every other day's mass shooting.
p12950
aVAnother law that comes to mind is making it illegal for anyone under 21 to own a gun. 
p12951
aVRight now, in many states, it's already illegal for a person under the age of 21 to own a handgun and in others any firearm at all.
p12952
aVIn regards to Rodgers, he was 22.
p12953
aVIf you have two people not interested in shooting each other and hand one of them a handgun, that person does not suddenly develop an interest in shooting someone.
p12954
aVThe motive precedes the means.
p12955
aVThe means do not grant the motive.
p12956
aVChange the people, they will set down the weapons on their own.
p12957
aVRemove the weapons, then people will find new weapons.
p12958
aVThat is the bottom line as I see it.
p12959
aVIt's been interesting.
p12960
aVI'll exit the conversation here.
p12961
aVPeace.
p12962
aVChange the people?
p12963
aVYou can't get people to change their eating habits even though they are morbidly obese and have had triple bypass surgery at 50.
p12964
aVBut you can change the law and solve the problem if not remove it altogether.
p12965
aVThat's the bottomline according to reality.
p12966
aVWow, you are one frightening individual.
p12967
aVHow many people called the cops on this kid before the shooting anyways?\u000a\u000a
p12968
aVWhile having non-elected officials is often good to de-politicize certain organizations (federal reserve, etc.
p12969
aV) the recent net neutrality situation reminds us yet again that just because there aren't elections doesn't mean officials will stay neutral.
p12970
aVOne might have imagined someone in the administration raising at least one eyebrow at the moment they decided to put a Comcast lobbyist in as chairman of the FCC.

p12982
aVThis morning on Fox &amp; Friends, Steve Doocy said "I haven't heard anyone else mention this but Sterling is a long time liberal democrat donor.
p12983
aV"  Ten seconds earlier they played a clip of Charles Barkley saying that the NBA was a black league and Brian Kilmeade asked "why would he say that when it has nothing to do with this?
p12984
aV" \u000a\u000aMy first reaction was , How are his political donations relevant to his racist remarks?
p12985
aVNow we see that he donated to three democrats 20 years ago and he's been a registered Republican since '98.
p12986
aVFaux News, lol.
p12987
aVThroughout that segment they also attacked the girlfriend multiple times but never directly defended Sterling.
p12988
aVSneaky.
p12989
aVIn another segment with Donald Trump they circumvented responsibility as usual by reporting that their viewers said that it was a private conversation, like that is suppose to make everything better.

aVI thought the United States of America was a Republic.
p12993
aVWell, now it's neither.
p12994
aVI don't know if this is an apt comparison... keep in mind, when the US Constitution was written... only landowners could even vote at all.
p12995
aVTrue, but land ownership was far more spread out - you didn't have a handful of people owning half the eastern seaboard.
p12996
aVTypically, landowners lived on the land they owned.
p12997
aVGeorge Washington owned like half of Virginia.
p12998
aVReally?
p12999
aVAre you sure?
p13000
aVNot exaggerating?
p13001
aVAccording to this sourced unreliable source he owned 52k acres\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_land_did_US_President_George_Washington_own?#slide=1\u000a\u000a\u000aKeep in mind, his first job outside the family was as a surveyor.
p13002
aVWell Virginia is about 42,000 sq miles, which comes out to about 26 *million* acres...
p13003
aVSo...
p13004
aVNo longer?
p13005
aVJesus, people.
p13006
aVDon't forget all the positive steps we've taken.
p13007
aVAnd more will come. 
p13008

aVGeez, give it a rest already, the woman has stated time and again, that she has no intention on running.
p13012
aVNo offense to those that would love to see her name on the ballot, heck I'm one of those people too, but let's respect her wishes.
p13013
aVIt's now or never for her.
p13014
aVIf she doesn't run and the next pres does 8 years, she'll be 73.
p13015
aVI don't think a 73 year old woman will e a viable candidate no matter how much we love her.
p13016
aVI hope she caves to the pressure and gives us the leader we truly want and need.
p13017
aVShe hasn't asked people to stop, and I think if she clearly did, they would.
p13018
aVWhether she's convinceable or not (which is hard to tell), the movement around trying to convince her to run also helps her accomplish what she wants as a Senator by giving her more press, more influence, more attention, more people willing to act on what she says people should do.
p13019
aVShe has never stated that she doesn't like these attempts to convince her to run, only that her intention is not to run.
p13020
aVShe also only ever ran for sentaor because she felt sort of a calling to fix the wrongs being done in washington.
p13021
aVShe's was of the good ones.
p13022
aVMakes sense we try to get her to run now before she might get corrupted like all the other do gooders seem to
p13023
aVI do not see her getting corrupted, considering how long she has been in politics already.
p13024
aVShe was organizing the effort to defeat the bankruptcy bill back in the 90s.
p13025
aVHer coalition won back then, and won again a few years later, and then lost in 2005 (the banking industry's third, and successful, attempt).
p13026
aVTARP oversight panel 2008/9, pushing for the CFPB and getting it passed, and then actually heading the CFPB and building it from scratch, all happened before she ran for Senate.
p13027
aVI wonder if she's waiting to see if Clinton shoots herself in the foot before the primary.
p13028
aVIf not she can stay by her word and do another term or two in the Senate.
p13029
aVIf Hillary does, then she can jump in to save the party.
p13030
aVI think she has to be careful of not being as political as the rest.
p13031
aVShe has said time and time again she isn't running.
p13032
aVI think that the more times she says that before she runs the more she looks like just another politician. 
p13033
aVWarren/Sanders 2016 is a ticket I would fight for.

aVfun fact, Rush Limbaugh has [ZERO](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/) true statements on politifact!
p13037
aVEven if this were utterly true, what would the independent actions of one senator have to do with a letter, very loudly trumpeted to the media, signed by forty-seven senators?
p13038
aVThere is a considerable difference between the two.
p13039
aVOne is an independent effort by one senator; the other is endorsed by the leadership of the party and dropped with a huge splash into the middle of fairly sensitive negotiations about something that could be the difference between war and peace.
p13040
aVWhy do we pay any attention to idiots like these?  
p13041
aVThat Politifact is just as biased as those it purports to check was amply demonstrated by Obama's "If you like your healthcare plan you can keep it" lie that was Politifact's "lie of the year" for 2013 despite being earlier rated by Politifact as true or partly true.

aVIt's not real.....\u000a\u000aTake the October 2008 article, it's not about the topic at all.
p13045
aVOr the August 2009 linked article, doesn't actually have the quote they claim.
p13046
aVThe June 2012 link claims the CBO said differently, even though Politifact linked the report themselves.
p13047
aVThe October 2012 link, they actually didn't say the same thing.
p13048
aVThen the last June 28, 2012, it's just stupid as they could have pointed out that Obama did lie....but they still couldn't get what he lied about correct.

aVIf you can prove the alternative superior, sure.
p13089
aVIn this case, it's speculation, which is nothing to base good decision-making upon.
p13090
aV(shrug) All decision making is based on analysis of likely outcomes, though.
p13091
aVIn this case, since we have some early-stage ebloa vaccines in human testing now  now (although it still has to be tested on more people), and since we know that the research was interrupted for several months due to the budget issues, we can reasonably expect that we would have had it sooner if not for that.
p13092
aVYou can call it a "counterfactual" if you want, but by that logic, so is "if I had just left for work 10 minutes earlier, I wouldn't have been late, so I should leave for work earlier tomorrow.

p13094
aVNope.

p13096
aVWell, but we need the money to blow up the Middle East, and don't have any left over for medical research.

p13110
aVBut more to the point, just because they were all men but decided correctly with regard to women's rights doesn't mean the current male supreme court justices can't have a blind spot about women.

p13122
aVIts a bit tongue in cheek, and I dont like Sarah Palin either, but to rate this as "FALSE" is pretty harsh.
p13123
aV&gt;As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan.
p13124
aVI kid you not\u000a\u000aThis is what she said, in a presumably serious tone.
p13125
aVThe CDC does the zombie apocalypse thing and a PR move to garner interest in a serious topic.

p13127
aVSo yes, it is false that the Government is preparing for a real zombie apocalypse, as Sarah Palin seems to be implying
p13128

aVIt should be important to note that the 'free market' solution to this problem would have been to let them fail... not getting deeper into bed with them and exacerbating the cronyism.

aVWhat really scares me is Cruz or someone like him could get the nomination, and if the stars align right, could get elected president.
p13153
aVI mean, it was obvious to anyone who took a close look at Palin or Bush Jr. that they were far from qualified for office, yet Palin came pretty close to being VP, and Bush served two terms.

p13192
aVThis country was founded on the IDEA of individual liberty and removing that civil right at a time when the authority and force of our federal and state governments has expanded exponentially and our ability to control it has shrunk drastically is pitifully stupid and truly ignorant of history as aware of it as you are.

aVThere's no way you can claim our country was 'founded on liberty' while slavery was the law of the land.

aVOur nation was founded on protecting the interests of a new aristocracy and the French sticking it to the British.
p13203
aVNo amount of hyperbolic crap regarding liberty changes that fact.
p13204
aVThis is why selling BS to the masses to get them to vote or act against their interests is as old as democracy itself.

aVHe is on the job wether he is wearing the uniform or not.
p13253
aVIf this story was about him saving a life in danger in his civilian clothes, he'd be peddled as the hero cop.
p13254
aVHe is not a hired actor pretending to be a cop between the hours of 7 to 3.
p13255
aVHe is a hired and trained cop on his days off from work, and that's what he is, a cop even when not giving a muthafuck out in the park chasing a barb-q bite with a chug of cheap beer.
p13256
aVAnd he should know better.
p13257
aVI didn't say he wasn't a cop.

p13293
aVSomeone is in need indeed if they are on welfare and hooked on drugs, we shan't punish this person.
p13294
aVWe should instead repair and heal this person through therapy and drug rehab so they may become a benefit to society instead of a hindrance.
p13295
aVIf this person is on drugs and can't eat, not much good is going to be happening with them.

aVAccording to eyewitnesses, more than 20 officers showed up to search the building just before noon Wednesday.
p13299
aVProbably the first time in the city's history a platoon of cops has been sent to check out an alleged occupancy code violation.
p13300
aVThis time they didn't come armed with assault weapons as witnesses said has been the case in previous raids.
p13301
aVNor did they take away any supplies, something that observers say happened in Tuesday's raid.
p13302
aVWTF?

p13308
aVHe's a lieutenant?
p13309
aVThat goes a long way towards explaining this whole response.
p13310
aVIt seems to me that this whole department, top to bottom, has been indoctrinated to believe that we the citizens are the enemy, and that violent response is called for given the slightest provocation.
p13311
aVSomewhere in the training of these cops someone has taught this as proper police procedure.
p13312
aVThis has become a national problem.
p13313
aVWhere did it come from?
p13314
aVThe police have always felt a certain separation from the citizens, but never so extreme as this.
p13315
aVThere have always been asshole cops, but this is way beyond that. 
p13316
aVThat's what you get when you disarm the populace.

aVIt could be that conservative economists don't need grants.

aVI wish he had started right after the election, but there you go.
p13334
aVNow works too.

aVNot only that, most of the same Republicans who are bashing Obama for "negotiating with terrorists" right now are the same ones who were demanding that he negotiate in order to free this prisoner a few months ago.

aVDon't worry citizens!
p13344
aVOnce our rulers feel the protesters have become a sufficient nuisance -- or heaven forbid, they start to garner popular support!
p13345
aV-- Obama will order the police to crack down on and to disperse the protesters.
p13346
aVWe'll forget about the protesters and everything will be just fine then...
p13347
aVIf you need to, see Occupy Wall Street for a precedent.
p13348
aV:-(
p13349
aVWhat's wrong with the Republican party is many of their voters are isolated from the world and from minorities to the point where their only impression of black people(and Hispanics) is those on the evening news and in rap videos and they are filled with terror at the thought of losing the country to THOSE PEOPLE who don't share our values of hard work and being white.
p13350
aVThe narrative of minorities just wanting a hand out and being takers sells easily to these people and when it becomes an us against them struggle you can see the world and the actions of Democrats in very simplistic terms.
p13351
aVBut really I'm just saying the same thing the article is.
p13352

aVMarriage is a religious ceremony, leave it to religion!
p13356
aVMarriage should not be a legal bond in any way between anyone.
p13357
aVSeparation of church and state!!!
p13358
aVSimple.
p13359
aVAll people should have to get a legal bond between them through the state, and the state shouldn't discriminate on sex nonsense.
p13360
aVThen religious people are happy and people in love can be legally bonded in the eyes of the state.
p13361
aVMarriage does not, never has and never should belong to religion.
p13362
aVYour proposal has been attempted in states like New Jersey and failed, couples joined in civil union were denied equal rights as married couples.
p13363
aVMarriage started because of religion by religious people.
p13364
aVThat's why its been held in a church so long.
p13365
aVI personally don't give a fuck because I'm not religious.
p13366
aVBut I get that religious people often like to keep tradition in tact, so I understand their position as well as homosexuals position on wanting to be legally bonded in love.
p13367
aVThat's false advertising from religion.
p13368
aVPair bonding and social recognition of such bonds have been around longer than any religion.
p13369
aVNo religion owns marriage, and no religion gets to define it.
p13370
aVFurthermore, recognition of gay marriage doesn't force anyone or any religion from participating in it; they remain free to choose what marriages they do or don't perform as they always have.
p13371
aVThey can practice their traditions as they always have.
p13372
aVThey cannot impose those traditions on anyone else.
p13373
aVPAIR BONDING, that's exactly what I'm saying should be the legal standard.
p13374
aVMarriage is a ceremony before god that religion made.
p13375
aVSocial recognition of pair bonds (aka marriage) still predates religion.
p13376
aVReligion does not and never will own marriage no matter how much they complain.
p13377
aVYes they do own the ceremony of marriage as it exists in our society today.
p13378
aVThey do not own civil bonds which predate marriage.
p13379
aVMarriage is a religious ceremony to celebrate a civil bond.
p13380
aVPeriod.
p13381
aVI'm not religious, I just know history.
p13382
aVTry it
p13383
aVAs far as the law is concerned, "marriage" is a secular legal institution.
p13384
aVThe word is also used to describe both religious and secular marriage ceremonies.
p13385
aVThis is how things have been for centuries: words are allowed to mean more than one thing.
p13386
aVFWIW, marriage has a very long history, and is older than any major modern religion.
p13387
aVBoth marriage and religion probably go way back into prehistory.

p13400
aV[deleted]
p13401
aVGovernment is not attempting to define marriage except for those trying to redefine it as "exclusively between a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation.
p13402
aV" No government or court is arguing that churches cannot decline to perform marriages for whomever they choose, we're arguing that you cannot deny marriage to others simply because you don't approve of their legal or religious union.
p13403
aVShould churches who allow gay marriage be prohibited from performing them?
p13404
aVGay marriage opponents have tried to pass laws that would.
p13405
aVGovernment has a proper place in not only recognizing gay marriage as valid but protecting gay marriage from religiously-based interference.
p13406
aV[deleted]
p13407
aV&gt; I don't care what people call it, I really don't.
p13408
aVThat seems to contradict everything else you are saying.
p13409
aVRight now, the legal term for the legal institution we are discussing is "marriage".
p13410
aVThe government could do a cut-and-paste job and replace every mention of "marriage" in the law and official documents with "union", but it would take a great deal of resources, create a lot of confusion, and wouldn't achieve anything.
p13411
aV&gt; If a church/organization preformed gay weddings and declared them marriages that's their own right.
p13412
aVThey also shouldn't need to call it a marriage if they don't want to.
p13413
aVThat's already allowed, except that in some states same-sex marriages are not officially recognized, so do not provide any of the legal protections that marriage usually does.
p13414
aV&gt; I know many heterosexual atheist couples that would like if it wasn't called marriage, they'd rather not have the religious associations.
p13415
aVI'm sure there are plenty of people who would object to having their marriage renamed to a "union" or "partnership" too.
p13416
aVThe government recognizes marriages for various important purposes and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, so they have to pick *some* word to describe them.

aVIf a truth-o-meter went from true to false, both true and false would be where "truth-o-meter" currently is and "truth-o-meter" would be centered where false is.
p13432
aVFor lack of any even reasonably sane alternative they'll just keep running this jerk hoping that the Democrats field someone so awful even he'll win the election. 
p13433
aVThe GOP is trapped in a Reagan era timewarp where the year is always 1980.
p13434
aVSo every new year that comes along puts the GOP one additional year that the GOP is behind the times.
p13435
aVPublic funding
p13436
aVbecause the media doesn't want campaign fiance reform.
p13437
aVMore money in politics is more ad money in their pocket.
p13438
aVPlus other reasons (like their bosses being the doners).
p13439
aV&gt; More money in politics is more ad money in their pocket.
p13440
aVThat sums it up in a nutshell.
p13441
aVThe capitalists that control the US economy have created the most expensive system of politics on the planet.
p13442
aVAnd just like our world's-most-expensive-health-care-system, it is discriminatory and sucks and works best for the rich people at the top that control the system.
p13443
aVAlso known as "all the things the President will veto". 
p13444
aValso known as "destroy the country cuz fuck it has had a good run".
p13445
aVMaybe republicans are sick of the trillion dollar deficits Obama has ruled over
p13446
aVSo what does this man's race have to do with the story?
p13447
aVSounds like the cops were just assholes
p13448
aVThey probably wouldn't have tried to arrest a white guy doing the same thing
p13449
aVWhy would you think that?
p13450
aVHow do you know these cops are racist?
p13451
aVIt sounds like you are making assumptions about the character of the police officers because of the color of their skin
p13452
aVI knew the numbers were gonna be low in regards to people who popped positive on a drug screening but it blows my mind just how low these numbers are coming to us.
p13453
aVmaybe you should read the article, toulouse420
p13454
aVI may have phrased this wrong tell me what you got from what I said also what you got from the article
p13455
aVno, you should read it.
p13456
aVit's no skin off my nose if you don't and I've got better things to do, but a refusal to read the article you're prating about would say a lot more about you.
p13457
aVI did read it, I was shocked at the numbers because I expected the number of people to test positive to be higher.
p13458
aVWhen I say higher I was thinking the number of drug users would be 10-15%.
p13459
aVWhat I was trying to say to you is tell me in you're own words what you believe I was getting at (your interpretation of the article isn't needed), if you're not able to then why comment further. \u000a\u000a
p13460
aVThe numbers are shocking because they aren't representative of the system.
p13461
aVTheir system of collecting this data is completely fucked.
p13462
aVFirst off, they started with a sample size of around 800 people.
p13463
aVEh, OK, decent size, I guess.
p13464
aVSo then what happens...10 people answer a drug question and answer that they do/have-recently-done drugs and are asked to take a test.
p13465
aV4 of them refuse.
p13466
aV6 people are tested, 6 people who admit to using drugs are tested, and 1 has a positive test.
p13467
aVSo to the click-bait organization that is ThinkProgress, 1/800 welfare recipients do drugs.
p13468
aVYou have to look at the method in how they get their results.
p13469
aVDid you know that Los Angeles is the gayest city in America?
p13470
aV100% of the people who live there are gay.
p13471
aV*\u000a\u000a*I asked the bartender at a gay bar if he was gay.
p13472
aV1/1 people surveyed said they are gay.
p13473
aV1/1 is 100%.
p13474
aV100% of LA is gay.\u000a\u000a
p13475
aVYour right sample sizes can be misleading.
p13476
aVI'm on mobile right now so when I get home I'll crunch some numbers and argue this further
p13477
aVAfter reading ended up with a sick feeling.
p13478
aVWell he owns his assets, if he wants to retire that's his choice.
p13479
aVBut, polling your employees on who they will vote for sounds illegal? 
p13480
aVIt must be abundantly clear to even the most distracted observer that congressional Republicans are completely unprincipled, and are motivated solely by the graft that "leaning toward the green" provides for them (and their hatred of the President).
p13481
aVYou just don't get it.
p13482
aVThese companies will take the money they saved and use it to invest more in the economy (by paying execs more) which will make the economy grow (read wall street) which will make more jobs(read as tasks)  /sarcasm if that wasn't picked up
p13483
aVOh...my bad!
p13484
aVTexas is a fucking shit hole. 
p13485
aVThe town I live in has a similar crooked towing scheme where they fine vehicle owners and hold their cars even if someone else is caught sound something wrong.
p13486
aVIt's got a long list of reasons from music too loud,  no insurance, incorrect tags (even if there was a paper work mix up at the dealer or dmv).
p13487
aVIs mostly targeted towards blacks and poor people since we have large population of them. \u000a
p13488

aVAs sad as I feel for this older woman, does anyone else see the humor in the fact that as the republican party's core voters age, they'll likely be a large percentage of those disqualified from voting?
p13492
aVUnfortunately this affects low income people of all voting ages. 
p13493
aVThey've got that covered.
p13494
aVYou see, what they did was totally ignored absentee voting in these voter ID laws.
p13495
aVAbsentee ballots are the least secure method of voting and these voter ID laws do nothing to change that.
p13496
aVNo ID required to vote by mail, but if you show up in person then you better be prepared to ID yourself.
p13497
aVWhich party do absentee votes benefit the most?
p13498
aVRepublicans.
p13499
aVWho made the voter ID laws?
p13500
aVRepublicans.
p13501
aVGreg Abbott (Texas republican gubernatorial candidate and current AG), actually went as far as to set up a website and advertise on facebook to encourage people to request their absentee ballots.  
p13502
aVOops.. Old post..
p13503
aVDat picture... that's one ugly-ass Queen.
p13504
aVHe's not anti-gay, he against gay marriage because he's a christians 
p13505
aVPlease note the use of the word "Former"
p13506
aVHe had that job for eight years.  
p13507
aVso surprised...
p13508
aVThis is a good thing isn't it?
p13509
aVIt's money out of politics.
p13510
aVIt's only good if money gets out from both sides of the aisle.
p13511
aVIt's not privatization when the government hires a contractor.
p13512
aVIt's privatization when the government leaves something completely to the private sector.
p13513
aVFor instance, privatizing the schools would mean that the government would no longer provide any services.
p13514
aVIt would be something that parents would have to purchase.
p13515
aVIt is privatization, and it rips us off.
p13516
aVIf the government can directly employ someone to provide a service, they should, as that means they can apply necessary oversight.
p13517
aVA private contractor will always aim to maximize their profit while minimizing their operating costs, which means that the government will pay for a full day's work, but receive only the bare minimum that passes as a full day's work.
p13518
aVThis has worrying implications when contractory privatization affects organizations that deal with people, such as schools, prisons, hospitals, orphanages, and especially elderly care.
p13519
aVIt is why those of us that are less off will end up spending our last years miserable, bed-ridden and sedated with as much medication as possible \u2013 because, you know, the government *pays extra* for that "service".
p13520
aVYou don't understand.
p13521
aVIf the government can't hire a private contractor and manage that contractor properly, then it can't be expected to provide the service that the contractor provides.
p13522
aVThe government has no factories.
p13523
aVIt doesn't make anything (other than paperwork).
p13524
aVIt must, by definition, hire contractors whenever it steps outside the realm of government into other areas.
p13525
aVYou don't need a contractor to pass a law.
p13526
aVYou will always need contractors to fulfill government healthcare or build roads or supply cops and soldiers.
p13527
aVThe choice is either to nationalize all businesses (in which case, the government would control the means of production) or sever the tie of government and allow these businesses to operate within the bounds of the law.
p13528
aVWhere you will always have problems (as you've quite rightly pointed out) is where government and corporations work together.
p13529
aVTake away the government's power to regulate and they are out of it, along with those problems.
p13530
aVI see your point.
p13531
aVLet me reiterate that government ownership should, in my perspective, only be mandatory in fields that, in one way or other, need to provide various people with basic human needs, as those are fields that humanity has time and again shown to be completely unable to handle morally in the context of money ownership.
p13532
aVI don't care who manufactures mini Obamas for tourists.
p13533
aVI'm not sure you're understanding.
p13534
aVManagement is the easy part and that's the part the government is terrible at.
p13535
aVThe reason it is so terrible at it is because there is no profit motives in government.
p13536
aVThe reason businesses are so good at it, is only because they have to be because of the profit motive.
p13537
aVA bureaucrat has no incentive to manage such important needs for people.
p13538
aVThey get paid whether they do a great, good, bad or horrible job.
p13539
aVIt's only when their performance is so outrageously horrific do they really get punished.
p13540
aVOn the one hand you have no faith in "humanity", well humanity is part of the government, except that a bureaucrat by his/her nature must sever their tie from humanity.
p13541
aVHow else can they be "fair"?
p13542
aVGovernments do not exist to provide more humanity, they do quite the opposite, clinically classifying people and forcing them to do things they wouldn't otherwise do.
p13543
aVI see that to you, my view seems incoherent, because you have given up on fixing your government.
p13544
aVYou're ready to shift all power to business, because you think that the stereotypical government worker is a lazy bureaucrat who only makes no decisions at all, and you are astonishingly *correct* in that belief.
p13545
aVBut, the solution to bad government isn't to leave the bad government in place and let someone sell you their "better" one.
p13546
aVThe solution to bad government is making it good government.
p13547
aVYes, but how do you make it good?
p13548
aVIf you already have a large, unwieldy organization, is the answer to give it more power, people and money?
p13549
aVNo.
p13550
aVThe answer is to make it small, more efficient, so it may not have as much power, but what power it does have is efficiently used.
p13551
aVThereby, you gain by doing less.
p13552
aVYou also have to understand that every program underneath the government is vulnerable to politics, whether that means direct intervention by some high authority or merely a low-level bureaucrat attempting to curry favors with someone on high.
p13553
aVSo whatever "fixes" you put in place get circumvented by politics.
p13554
aVAlways.
p13555
aVNo matter how many civilian review boards you have, no cop is going to write a ticket for another cop or the mayor.
p13556
aVAnd truly privatizing something like (say) education, doesn't mean the government wouldn't enforce the law regarding the people running the schools, it just means it wouldn't run the schools badly as they do now.
p13557
aVLike now, government swoops in when a law is broken or someone complains.
p13558
aVThe difference would be, under a private system, the private company would pay, the customers (ie students) would be compensated and it wouldn't cost taxpayers much.
p13559
aVUnder the current system, the government has to protect us from the government program, which is an inherent contradiction because of politics.
p13560
aVSo the "protection" comes in the form of minimizing the political damage and covering up what went wrong.
p13561
aVThat means, either no one is compensated or if they are, it comes out of the government's pocket, which is our pocket.
p13562
aVAnd we pay at both ends, we pay for the bad education, the correction for that bad education, the PR to correct the "problem of the problem" and on and on.
p13563
aVWe can't fire government, because we can't fire ourselves, but we can fire a private company.
p13564
aVThat company has the incentive to deliver at least a partially good product because of the profit motive.
p13565
aV&gt; The difference would be, under a private system, the private company would pay, the customers (ie students) would be compensated and it wouldn't cost taxpayers much.
p13566
aVI already wrote about this.
p13567
aVYou are only factoring in money.
p13568
aVYou are completely forgetting everything else in the world that is not money.
p13569
aVYou will forget morality because of money.
p13570
aVYou will forget to do good because of money.
p13571
aVYou assume that there is no money in helping poor people.
p13572
aVPoor people are poor, but they are not broke.
p13573
aVThey merely have less money than, say, working class folks.
p13574
aVThe business model would be aimed at them.
p13575
aVIt wouldn't be great, but the schools in poor districts are pretty horrific.
p13576
aVAnd since for-profit schools would want the best students, the smart ones would be recruited to better schools on scholarship.
p13577
aVAnd government could provide tax incentives to the private schools that service certain areas.
p13578
aVYou assume that corporations=no morality.
p13579
aVThen how can you assume people in government are more moral?
p13580
aV&gt; You assume that corporations=no morality.
p13581
aVThen how can you assume people in government are more moral?
p13582
aVI don't.
p13583
aVI assume they will do whatever they can get away with, hence the need for oversight, vertical transparency, etc.
p13584
aVIn a privatized model, the same would utterly fail, because corporations \u2013 or, more accurately, the *people* behind the corporations \u2013 have virtually limitless resources and can "sponsor" the members of any oversight committee or similar. 
p13585
aVBut where does the oversight come from?
p13586
aVYou cannot insulate one part of government from another.
p13587
aVWhatever happens in a state reflects on the governor.
p13588
aVWhatever happens at the Federal level impacts the president and policy makers at the state level.
p13589
aVPolicy makers have zero incentive to act morally, they merely need to act in their best political interests.
p13590
aVCorporations do not have limitless resources.
p13591
aVEverything they do is a calculation to make money.
p13592
aVIf it's cheaper to bribe Congress, they do it.
p13593
aVBut if Congress had no regulation power, that would be a waste of money.
p13594
aVTheir choice would be to bribe Congress to change laws that their competition wouldn't stand for or attempt to get a leg up on competitors through competition.
p13595
aVYour model has no competition, therefore, people in their jobs have no incentive to do anything, moral or otherwise.
p13596
aVVertical transparency.
p13597
aVGranted, it does require witting folk ready to run for office.
p13598
aVEdit: http://www.pogo.org/
p13599
aV&gt; Vertical transparency\u000a\u000aCannot work and is just as corruptible as any political group.
p13600
aVAnd yes, it is political.
p13601
aVIt also has no profit motive, which means, it too, is vulnerable.
p13602
aV"Witting folk"?
p13603
aVOh, I'm sure they run, but they don't get elected.
p13604
aVI mean, where are these people?
p13605
aVHave they ever run?
p13606
aVAnd what magical protection apparatus would shield them from the corruption of party politics to get anywhere?
p13607
aVAgain, another model/solution that is just as corruptible.
p13608
aVThe beauty of the private sector is that, well, everyone is out for the money.
p13609
aVEveryone involved knows that.
p13610
aVThere are no ideologues, no political zealots, no kowtowing to religious nuts or special interest.
p13611
aVThere is only math.
p13612
aVWhat is and what is not profitable.
p13613
aVYou know where you stand, always and that knowledge allows you to make plans and move forward.
p13614
aVIt is real, pragmatic and sensible.
p13615
aVThe problem with government is that it is not any of these things unless you're constantly pressuring and monitoring it.
p13616
aVAnd even then, that pressure and monitoring may not work.
p13617
aVOr may get delayed or may simply be politically impossible.
p13618
aVAnd if you truly want government to be more responsible to outside pressure, you'd shrink it considerably.
p13619
aVMake it a real possibility that people can throw out elected officials.
p13620
aVLess powerful government means more powerful citizens.\u000a\u000a
p13621
aVAnd again, you're cherry-picking the points that are failing\u000ain the system to support your own privatization fantasy.
p13622
aVThese are things that have to be fixed anyway!
p13623
aVMy point is, you can't fix the corrupting influence of politics any more than you can fix greed.
p13624
aVThe only thing you can do is separate the various influences and balance them against each other.
p13625
aVThe current two party system cannot be balanced.
p13626
aVThey are no longer opposing forces checking one another.
p13627
aVOver the years, the policies has cemented the power structure in such a way that there is no longer competition and there was precious little within the parties to begin with.
p13628
aVThat power structure has slowly drawn in more and more of the private sector, which benefits, but also is being corrupted.
p13629
aVOnce you're in an industry that needs government approval, you have to lobby Congress or watch your competitors crush you.
p13630
aVYou sever Congress's power in that area, you diminish the corruption.
p13631
aVThe greedheads in Congress go back to the private sector, where they can make more money.
p13632
aV&gt; The current two party system cannot be balanced.
p13633
aVSuggest you make it a more-than-two party system.
p13634
aVPrivatization at scale can never work, because game theory.
p13635
aVIt is always more advantageous for two corporations to work together towards a common goal.
p13636
aVThis is why we have Coke and Pepsi, for instance, but no real third alternative.
p13637
aVWould love multi-parties or no parties.
p13638
aVHowever, you need to cut off the endless money supply and you can't do that without changing the policies that drive the money into these campaigns.
p13639
aVIt is not always more advantageous for two corporations to work together because they are both vying for the same market.
p13640
aVTheir alliance is always very uneasy, because one will swoop in for the market share whenever possible.
p13641
aVOr are you now saying that corporations are good at keeping their promises?
p13642
aVAnd as far as Coke and Pepsi go, have you not heard of the many other colas available?
p13643
aVSome people (punishableoffense) are just born with small brains.
p13644
aVNo way around it, no matter how much sense you throw at them.
p13645
aVThey just repel common sense or plain out brainwashed.
p13646
aVI think, as compared to most redditors, (punishableoffense) was relatively polite and open to my views, even though he didn't agree with them.
p13647
aVI appreciate your support, but let's all try to keep it polite.
p13648
aVYou can't win people over with vitriol.
p13649
aVmaking govt good = making govt smaller and taking them out of the equation.
p13650
aVall the govt should do is run the court system and uphold the laws, plain and simple.
p13651
aVonly the local govts should collect taxes to run the basic necessities such as trash removal and policing. 
p13652
aVDown voted.
p13653
aVAlternet is a propaganda outlet funded by the lunatic left.
p13654
aVRemember folks this guy was elected.
p13655
aVHe has a constituency that apparently feel the same as he does.
p13656
aVWhat that says about America is fairly appalling.  
p13657
aVWhat the hell?
p13658
aVDuring the last few years of his presidency, Bush was also trying to get other nations to accept people from Guantanamo who were deemed to not be a risk.
p13659
aVIs there any part of US foreign policy this guy isn't trying to screw up?
p13660
aVSpare me Lord!
p13661
aVGore had his chance and he blew it.
p13662
aVGore was the only guy that could have lost to GW.
p13663
aVGore beat Bush.
p13664
aVKerry lost to Bush.
p13665
aVWell, he did already win.
p13666
aVIf he ran and won it would be his 2nd win yet only his first term.
p13667
aVExcept of course he didn't.
p13668
aVKeep telling yourself that though...it's cute in its own way.
p13669
aVExcept of course he did.
p13670
aVI'm genuinely curious as to what makes you believe otherwise, this is an established historical fact.
p13671
aVThen , if Clinton wins the primary, she can have Gore as VP.
p13672
aVNow the question is, can Bush get Quayle or his wife to run as his VP?
p13673
aVBush vs. Gore round 2.
p13674
aVThe payback!
p13675
aVI dont vote often, mainly because i refuse to pick the lesser of two evils, but if this guy was main candidate  I would have to vote.
p13676
aVJust to make sure Ted Cruz isn't our president. 
p13677
aVYour voice is speech.
p13678
aVMoney is a megaphone.
p13679
aVYou know what's cute?
p13680
aVThe left/right paradigm.
p13681
aVI love watching both sides sink my country into the shitter simultaneously while fucktards blindly swallow whatever they're cued to swallow.
p13682
aVI'm a &lt;politcal party&gt; and I feel great because &lt;other politician&gt; is an &lt;embarassment&gt; while MY &lt;guy/gal&gt; is an &lt;embarassment&gt;.
p13683
aVHooray!
p13684
aVDemocracy!
p13685
aVFuckin' AWESOME!!!
p13686

aVI want to get as many people who support this foolishness on record right now, so that my grandkids know whose graves to piss on in 75 years.
p13687
aVRick Scott, James Inhoffe...
p13688
aVbecause that will make it *ALL* go away
p13689
aVDemocracy means mob rule.
p13690
aVTo the extent that the mob can be persuaded by the propaganda of the Koch brothers, democracy means rule by the Koch brothers through this persuasion.
p13691
aVYou want democracy?
p13692
aVBe careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it.
p13693
aVNotice how they CAN be turned off.
p13694
aVIt should be taken as an indication of guilt.
p13695
aVThe investigation should be done by the FBI, they should skip the grand jury and go directly to trial and their testimony should no longer be privileged.
p13696
aVedit: also, an officer with the camera turned off, obscured or sabotaged is automatically no longer on duty.
p13697
aV(these things need an indicator light) Interacting with the public pretending to still be on duty should be considered impersonating a police officer.
p13698
aVThey would also be personally liable for anything that happens.
p13699
aVMake the Camera interfere proof ..... it defeats the object otherwise.
p13700
aVClearly there is intention to deceive if the camera is turned off by the officer just before the shooting.
p13701
aVIf your worn camera is turned off and you perform ANY act on duty that requires a report filed about the incident, you should be suspended without pay.
p13702
aVBut really we just need a full shakedown of every large police force in America. 
p13703
aVApparently,  "some state legislatures" should be burned to the ground by their constituency. 
p13704
aVYeah, but they need the money to create all the jobs.

p13719
aVI would propose:\u000a\u000a1.
p13720
aVRemove all limits on the amount of money someone can spend on political speech and when they can spend it because the First Amendment exists specifically to protect this.
p13721
aV2.
p13722
aVRemove the ability to donate anonymously, requiring that all money spend on political campaigns much be traceable, because the First Amendment doesn't protect donor anonymity.
p13723
aVIf our free press doesn't use proposal 2 to compensate for the disadvantage of proposal 1 then our culture doesn't deserve to have good democratic institutions anyway and it's pointless to try.
p13724
aVThere is such a thing as not deserving freedom.
p13725
aVwell if this were to be used we would at least know the names of our lords and masters anyway.
p13726
aVi don't think unlimited money is really the answer in the face of high corruption.
p13727
aVkinda like giving an addict a never ending supply of smack, but he has to tell you when he's gonna use it.
p13728
aVprobably just going to make the situation worse.
p13729
aVi would say to remove money from politics entirely.
p13730
aVwhen freedom of speech is regulated by how much money you have, those without money quickly loose their ability to speak.
p13731
aV&gt; when freedom of speech is regulated by how much money you have\u000a\u000aThat much is inherent in the idea of freedom of speech and it sure beats freedom of speech being regulated by the same people as the regulation is being applied to.
p13732
aV(i.e.
p13733
aVCongress)
p13734
aVi'm not interested in letting congress regulate themselves.
p13735
aVthat's how we've come to the point we find ourselves.
p13736
aVwhat i'm speaking of is a constitutional amendment ratified by a convention of the states totally bypassing d.c. limiting campaign contributions to a 100 dollar maximum.
p13737
aVand taking away the notion that corporations are people and get to make political donations under freedom of speech.
p13738
aVpublic financing of all political campaigns.
p13739
aVyou shouldn't have to be a billionaire or be completely beholden to one to run for public office.
p13740
aVbut due to this notion of unlimited political spending what we have now is little more than legalized mass bribery of our political structure.
p13741
aVit will take more than just making people sign their names to walk back the current state of corruption.
p13742
aVthe problem with money being what allows you to have the freedom of speech is that it limits that freedom to just a handful of people.
p13743
aVwe dont have a democracy right now, we don't even have a democratic republic.
p13744
aVwe have a plutocracy.
p13745
aVplain and simple.
p13746
aVthere's another name for a government totally ran by corporate interests as well.
p13747
aVbut i'll leave that one for you to research.
p13748
aV&gt; what i'm speaking of is a constitutional amendment ratified by a convention of the states totally bypassing d.c. limiting campaign contributions to a 100 dollar maximum.
p13749
aVSuggesting that we put a dollar amount in the Constitution shows a fundamental lack of understanding of either what the Constitution is, what money is or both.
p13750
aVHaven't you ever heard of inflation?
p13751
aV&gt; and taking away the notion that corporations are people and get to make political donations under freedom of speech\u000a\u000aCorporation owners are people, and they ought to be able to order their corporation that they own to spend money on whatever because that's what ownership means.
p13752
aVThat's freedom.
p13753
aVFreedom includes the power to do stuff you don't like.
p13754
aVwell that's a plan that's currently in motion, passed in three states already.
p13755
aVwolf-pac.com for more info.
p13756
aVi'm sure we can work out something that outsmarts inflation.
p13757
aVcorporation owners are people.
p13758
aVcorporations are legal fictions that exist to make those who own them money.
p13759
aVcorporations are born in a lawyers office on paper.
p13760
aVnot from a mother's womb.
p13761
aVyou can not have mcdonald's over for supper.
p13762
aVthere are plenty of things that we do not allow the legal entities known as corporations to not do (less nowadays but still).
p13763
aVthe minute you can put a pair of handciffs on a corporation and place it under arrest then i may consider the notion that corporations are people.
p13764
aVit's stupid.
p13765
aV&gt; there are plenty of things that we do not allow the legal entities known as corporations to not do\u000a\u000aAnd why should broadcasting political speech be something a corporation isn't allowed to do?
p13766
aVAlso, your same argument would seem to suggest that corporations shouldn't have to pay taxes either.
p13767
aVWell, in a sense, corporations never pay taxes.
p13768
aVAll corporate taxes are really customer taxes, since they come out of prices.
p13769
aVbecause the result is not worth it.
p13770
aVwe don't have unlimited freedom of speech anyway.
p13771
aVshouting fire in a crowded theater, slander, perjury, etc.
p13772
aVde facto bribery of public officials should be in the same category.

aVhow can i start my own business when you, my established competition, can simply have your pocket congressman regulate me out of the market?

aVWhat possible reason did they have to demand to see his ID in the first place?
p13779
aV?
aVWow, I'm not going to link it because they don't deserve the traffic, but the story from the local paper starts out as such:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA man who died a few hours after being shot by a Dothan police officer outside the Dothan Animal Shelter on Tuesday had recently served time in jail for making threats to government employees and also had two women file protection orders against him earlier in the year.
p13780
aVTheir priorities are straight.
p13781
aVLibertarian click bait. 
p13782
aVMaybe resisting arrest isn't a good idea?
p13783
aVIt's in the past... Now, on to something in the present... Benghazi 
p13784
aVShe sounds like some dipshit you knew in high school. 
p13785
aVI'm utterly shocked at how blatant and obvious the Fox News propaganda machine has become.
p13786
aVEdit: I knew it was bad back in 2000, but they've taken it to a whole new level. 
p13787
aVGood Lord...
p13788
aVSame thing could be said for Wall St/white collar crime.
p13789
aVIt'll most assuredly continue as long as it goes unpunished.
p13790
aVThe whole bit about not being able to lock any of them up because the economy would crash is complete bullshit.
p13791
aVJust as is any excuse as to why the police can't be held accountable when their actions are obviously outside the bounds of their position - especially as it relates to murdering perps.
p13792
aV&gt;It turned out that conservatives who read the correction believed Bush's falsehood more strongly than did conservatives who never read the correction:\u000a\u000aSo, knowing that a claim isn't true made them believe it was?

aVIs this bizzaro America?

aVInsanity strikes again.

aVI've read many horror stories about working for Amazon including both warehouse workers and IT workers.
p13799
aVWhy?
p13800
aVOf all the major corporations (comcast, verizon, google, apple, etc.
p13801
aV) I feel like Amazon is one of the best.
p13802
aVWorkers at Amazon distribution centres are required to wear digital arm mounted terminals that monitor their every move.
p13803
aVThere are no agreed protocols about breaks and speed, and a culture of bullying and harassment is rife.
p13804
aVStaff are reprimanded just for speaking to one another or even pausing to catch their breath
p13805
aVHuh, I thought they would have given it to someone in Dubai, AUE, or China.
p13806
aVThis seems a bit idiotic to call it "Worlds Worst".
p13807
aVYeah, Amazon has serious issues but it is FAR from the worst.
p13808
aVMaybe name it "Americas Worst" or "Most Controlling CEO in America"..
p13809
aVYeah, but, but........  men kissing, and murdered placentas!
p13810
aV!
aVNo surprise here, Obama since day one was waged a war on whistle blowers. \u000a\u000a
p13811
aVSince he is a member of the protected ruling class, I don't expect he will serve any time.
p13812
aVThat said, I hope he at least has a very shitty few years fighting this and disappears from the public eye. 
p13813
aVHe was just featured last night on "Years of Living Dangerously" as one of the only Republicans who'll admit that Climate Change is real and manmade. 
p13814
aVToo bad he wants to throw people off of balconies when they ask him questions he doesn't want to answer.
p13815
aVNobody is perfect.
p13816
aVIf you focus on party affiliation as the only reason to vote people out of office, you ignore the fact that affiliations [can be changed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_switching_in_the_United_States#1990s): just look at the half-dozen senators and US Representatives listed as changing affiliation in 1995 (i.e.
p13817
aVafter the 1994 midterm elections [brought the Republicans to power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Revolution)).
p13818
aVIf the corrupt elements care only for power (and I personally believe they do), there is nothing stopping them from saying "I'm a democrat now!
p13819
aVFree healthcare for everybody, and a chicken in every pot!
p13820
aV"\u000a\u000aVote *all* incumbents out.
p13821
aVIt's the only way to be sure.
p13822
aVYou only really *need* to vote out the people who have records of badness.
p13823
aVFor example, I'm pretty happy with Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, the Oregon US senators, who I have voted for.\u000a
p13824
aVTrue enough, but if&amp;mdash;like the original article&amp;mdash;you make a blanket statement on whom to vote out, I'm far more comfortable saying "everybody" than relying on a discriminant (party affiliation) that can be changed.
p13825
aVI'm not trying to imply that they aren't both terrible ideas, just stating my personal preference.
p13826
aVCui bono.
p13827
aVWho benefits.

aVIf even a small part of the Antarctica ice sheet melts sea level will rise ten feet.

p13830
aVWithin not too many years we will get that rise.
p13831
aVWhen it does happen southern Florida is gone.
p13832
aVSo who benefits from pretending it isn't and won't happen?

aVRich people who have big investments in Florida that they want to dump.

aVSo, he wants to deregulate businesses and let them opt out of employee hand-washing requirements by regulating businesses and forcing them to post signs that they've opted out.
p13839
aVDo I understand correctly?
p13840
aVThe next obvious step is allowing them to opt-out of disclosing their opting-out.
p13841
aVI'd be fine with that as long as they were required to post a sign saying they opted out of showing a sign.
p13842
aVNo he used it as an anecdote.

aVThe National Review article is silly outside of the cult of personality suggestion, which is largely true.
p13851
aVWhat else do you call people circlejerking to defend the man asserting dismissal of *an entire discipline*?
p13852
aVHell, the other critics sound like they are largely correct as well.
p13853
aVThe press statement did little to dispel the accusations...
p13854
aV&gt;not primarily because they like science, but because they like the intellectual superiority they think liking Tyson signifies.
p13855
aVUh, y'mean the intellectual superiority he DOES signify?
p13856
aVWell, like anything that more intelligent people like, there are certainly people that 'like' it to appear more intelligent.

aVAs a conservative who lives in a largely conservative town and went to school at a very conservative college, this is the first that I am hearing that we don't like Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

p13867
aVNot after Cosmos.
p13868
aVOh, my bad, just got my weekly conservative instruction booklet and apparently you are right.

aVAfter Cosmos we *don't* like NDT.

aVSeriously though, generally people aren't nearly as bad as the generalizations about groups they belong to make them out to be.
p13874
aVDid you see Cosmos?

aVIt was his statements on the certainty of evolution, the age of the earth/universe and climate change that got things fired up.
p13876
aVYoung Earth creationists are not a majority in any circle
p13877
aVWhat they mean is it unleashes economic growth for the wealthy.
p13878
aVThe rest is us don't matter to the republicans. 
p13879
aVExactly.
p13880
aVIt's been a great time for them.
p13881
aVFuck everybody else. 
p13882
aVDo any of you have any fucking idea at all what you're talking about?
p13883
aVYou think it's Republicans who favor the rich?
p13884
aVThen why is income inequality higher than ever under Obama?
p13885
aVWhy are 32 of 35 of the congressional districts with the greatest income equality represented by Democrats?
p13886
aVGo to any area under the control of Democrats and you see it, super rich elites living like kings and everyone else living like peasants.
p13887
aVGo to Republican areas and you find the middle class.
p13888

aVhttp://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/09/03/238428/leonard-pitts-jr-if-gop-is-so.html\u000a\u000aHowever, I don't think it's adequate to just compare geographical regions and assume correlation to causation.
p13892
aVIt's more appropriate to examine the economic policies endorsed by each party, and understand how each policy effects everyone throughout an economy.
p13893
aVTax cuts on the rich really don't help anyone except the rich.
p13894
aVWho endorses that?
p13895
aVRich republicans.
p13896
aVAlso, not so rich republicans, because they've been tricked into believing that it helps everyone. 
p13897
aVAlso poor Republicans because they've been propagandized into the team mentality that if it's Democrat it's bad, wrong, and likely causes genetic defects.
p13898

p13900
aVad nauseum.
p13901
aVWoah bro.
p13902
aVFirst of all, nobody is saying that our current president is just the bee's knees.
p13903
aVIncome inequality is a trend that surpasses individual administrations.
p13904
aVAs for Republicans favoring the wealthy, it's a little hard to argue such a point when they admit to it themselves.
p13905
aVWhether I cite comments made in the last election or the perennially Republican concept of trickle-down economics, it's pretty clear that Republicans favor the "job creators" and the business owners because that is who they believe spur on economic growth.
p13906
aVNow, if you're really indignant that someone would say the GOP favors wealth, than I'd say you have a crisis of faith on your hands that has far more to do with your own ability to keep yourself abreast of facts than it does with what those damn commies are saying about your institutionalized Reagan-boner.
p13907
aVJust my 2c.

aVI think it's important to also consider who is running the Senate and the House during those times, since they are the ones who write the laws.

aV"littering his body with nearly a dozen bullets in broad daylight"\u000a\u000aCould this article be more sensationalistic if it tried?
p13915
aVThe use of the word "littering" as if the cops were simply discarding bullets into a refuse bin, that refuse bin being a person.
p13916
aVNearly a dozen?
p13917
aVIt was 6.
p13918
aVNearly implies just shy of.

aVTry half a dozen.

aVSheesh.
p13921
aV&gt; The spark that lit the flame of unrest occurred on a Saturday afternoon earlier this month when Ferguson police gunned down an innocent college-bound teenager by the name of Michael Brown, littering his body with nearly a dozen bullets in broad daylight.
p13922
aVThey also manage to say innocent and college bound furthering the heart string tweakage.
p13923
aVOf course were exceptional!
p13924

p13939
aVSoooo...
p13940
aVThere was an errant smoke grenade that just happened to land beneath a very obvious group of reporters?
p13941
aVAnd the cops were very sorry and didn't want looters to steal the recording equipment, so they made it less obvious by placing the lights face-down for them?
p13942
aVAnd the camera too because... well... hmmm... the camera was no longer obvious and a two party consent recording law kicked in?
p13943
aVI dunno.
p13944
aVI got nothing.
p13945
aVI wasn't certain I could hear any beanbag rounds described by the article.
p13946
aVThere is some clicking that could be firing in the distance, but nothing near the microphone.

aV McConnell spokespeople were quick to offer a correction.
p13951
aV"The congressman meant to say he supported 'stronger violence against women than Barack Obama'", said an anonymous voice from a phone  that only faintly sounded like my voice talking through a handkerchief.
p13952
aV"McConnel thought it was an argument about who could better attract women with the 'bad boy' image.
p13953
aVYou know, like cancel their insurance coverage for contracepton, or pay them less for work than for men, or just pinch them as they go down the halls of the capital".
p13954
aVThe anonymous but highly placed source went on to describe McConnel's *black leather jacket*, but of course the MSM edited that out.\u000a
p13955
aVApparently the primaries are over, or his Republican opponent would have been running that.
p13956
aVSeems a little low...

p14050
aVIs the reason because US banks make such huge amounts of money from drug money laundering, or just the fact that our politics are controlled by two static parties?

p14053
aVthose fucknuts don't do anything they're not paid to do.
p14054
aVour political system is controlled by the corporate interest that have owned our politicians for a while now.
p14055
aVWouldn't that suggest that some of the legal crop is being diverted to states where it is not legal or was Colorado just smoking 90% of the pot in the US?
p14056
aVLogically.
p14057
aVBut as ~22 states (maybe more by now) currently have MMJ, it's not just Colorado and Washington consuming all that legal weed.
p14058
aVAdditionally, it's the quality of marijuana cultivated in the states that's superior to what the cartels are producing, bricking, and smuggling - which is certainly another factor in their decreased market share.
p14059
aVAs more MMJ &amp; recreational use gets passed, I'm assuming there will be even more dank grown, which will just offset the margins even further against the cartels.  
p14060

aVThe cartels will simply switch to importing cocaine, heroin, or some other illegal drug to replace their lost marijuana revenue.

p14069
aVHe knows what's up.
p14070
aVFortunately,  \u201cthe legitimate redistribution of economic benefits\u201d does *not* include violent seizure of wealth via taxation.
p14071
aVEr...  what?
p14072
aVI feel like you're referencing something, but I'm not sure what.
p14073
aV...Wow that's a really cool username you've got there.
p14074
aVHe's referencing the Pope's speech.
p14075
aVThe Pope didn't say redistribution of wealth by government agents.
p14076
aVHe said the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits, meaning equal *opportunity*, not equal outcome.
p14077
aVAnd the "legitimate" portion means charitable giving.
p14078
aVBasically, the Pope said to be more charitable in our own financial decisions.
p14079
aVPretty much what Popes have been saying for years. 
p14080
aVTaxation is only necessary because people aren't inclined to part with their money- well-earned or not- for the good of their society as a whole.
p14081
aVAlso, I wasn't referring to that part of his comment.
p14082
aVThat bit about force and government, that seemed like a reference.
p14083
aVNot sure what to.
p14084
aVAlso also, didn't Jesus say that money should be TAKEN from the rich and given to the poor, not just that the rich should donate their money?
p14085
aVHonestly, I don't give a shit what Jesus did it didn't say.
p14086
aVIf he was real and gave moral commands, they were transcribed by fallible men and out into a book compiled with political ambitions in mind.
p14087
aVAnd who determines the "good of society"?
p14088
aVThat's always the question that I can't find a suitable answer to.
p14089
aVAnd the part about force and government is probably alluding to some manifestation of the Non-Aggression Principle. 
p14090
aV"The good of society" seems a tad self-evident...  but I would, do, and have defined it as "anything that demonstrably contributes to the health and happiness of humanity in the short- and long-term.
p14091
aV"  Note- this does not mean "humanity at the expense of non-humanity", because most life that is not human plays a direct or indirect role in maintaining an ideal quality of life for most if not all people.
p14092
aVDoes that definition include a provision that says you can't achieve the good of humanity by committing a wrong?
p14093
aVOr does the end completely justify the means?
p14094
aVLogically, yes.
p14095
aVI asked an either/or, and you said yes.
p14096
aVThere's nothing logical about that whatsoever. 
p14097
aVThe end justifies the means, or rather, the result justifies the means.
p14098
aVKilling one random person to save two, etc.
p14099
aVAnd that's where we disagree.
p14100
aVAnd where you and the Pope would disagree. 
p14101
aVOh, sorry.
p14102
aVI'll give a better answer when I've got more time.
p14103
aVTaxes are not "stealing" they are the cost of having a civil society.

aVThe Koch brothers -- David and Charles -- are the right-wing billionaire co-owners of Koch Industries.
p14122
aVIn an article in the August 30, 2010 issue of The New Yorker magazine, author Jane Mayer links the billionaire brothers David Koch and Charles Koch, owners of Koch Industries to tea party movement funding.
p14123
aVMayer writes,\u000a\u000aThe anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs.
p14124
aVBy giving money to \u201ceducate,\u201d fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement.
p14125
aVBruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank that the Kochs fund, said, \u201cThe problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it\u2019s been all chiefs and no Indians.
p14126
aVThere haven\u2019t been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it.
p14127
aVSo the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create a movement.\u201d With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, \u201ceveryone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out there\u2014people who can provide real ideological power.\u201d The Kochs, he said, are \u201ctrying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own policies.
p14128
aVReports indicate that the Tea Party Movement benefits from millions of dollars from conservative foundations that are derived from wealthy U.S. families and their business interests.
p14129
aVIt appears that money to organize and implement the Movement flows primarily through two conservative groups: Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks.
p14130
aVthe Sarah Scaife Foundation as having given a total of $2.96 million in funding to FreedomWorks.
p14131
aVThe Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation is financed by the Mellon industrial, oil, and banking fortune.
p14132
aVThe Claude R. Lambe Foundation, also controlled by the Koch family, has donated more than $3 million to Americans for Prosperity.
p14133
aVThe Tea Party has also gotten substantial support in the form of promotion from Fox News Channel and its talk show hosts, including Glenn Beck.
p14134
aVKarl Frisch of Media Matters wrote that Fox News "frequently aired segments imploring its audience to get involved with tea-party protests across the country.
p14135
aV" Fox has also provided organizing information for the events on air and online.
p14136
aVWhile discussing the April 15 protests on his April 6 program, Glenn Beck suggested that viewers could "celebrate with Fox News" by either attending a protest or watching it on Fox News.
p14137
aVBeck stated that in addition to himself, hosts Neil Cavuto, Greta Van Susteren, and Sean Hannity would be "live" at different protests.
p14138
aVWhile Beck spoke, on-screen text labeled those protests as "FNC Tax Day Tea Parties.

p14140
aVNothing in this wall-of-text countered the evidence that I put forth that the tea party started as a ron paul fundraiser in 2007.
p14141
aVIn fact, i dont see how it relates at all.
p14142
aVThere is no debate to be had that the Kochs funded the latter tea party, the argument was on how it started, and how you lied about it.
p14143

aVThe reason they were raided was not, in fact, because they were throwing a "revolution-plotting party" as the title suggests, but rather because they sent a fake court summons to a county judge and a banker.
p14172
aVThe raid was for sending false court documents which were apparently legitimate-looking enough that an average person could confuse them for actual ones.

aVIf they "vanished" how do they know the whereabouts?
p14210
aVSounds like condoned theft, pretty much par for Ourpiehole's course.
p14211
aVMeanwhile, he's just going to waste more AZ taxpayer money on purchasing more overpowered weaponry (that will probably get "misappropriated," as well) and I'm sure he'll cost the taxpayers a few more million in lawsuits before his time is done.
p14212
aVThis guy can't leave AZ politics soon enough.
p14213
aVJust another fat old white guy being an asshole. 
p14214
aVGotta be the heat.
p14215
aVI wonder if he realizes how much he sounds like the leaders of the DPRK
p14216
aVWhat's the difference in Pearce being on the dole by accepting over $100,000.00 per year in taxpayer funded compensation and a poor person accepting public assistance?
p14217
aVYup...crazy people in charge of the government...not surprised. 
p14218
aV[deleted]
p14219
aVWhy not both? 
p14220
aVShhhhh the Liberatrians will hear you!
p14221
aVSterling paranoia there.

aVWhen they are that fearful of everything around them, it amazes me that they can even leave their houses.

aVI imagine she really believes that all immigrants are here to rape and pillage. 
p14224
aVSheesh!

aVThey are not Vikings.
p14226
aVThe idea that there are Islamic terrorist training camps in South America is a Republican thing.

aV[PoliticFact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hezbollah-latin-america-poses-imm/) has a story.
p14228
aVThose St. Louis County cops are an embarrassment to police everywhere.
p14229
aVWhat they are doing has nothing to do with proper police procedure and everything to do with wannabe paramilitary overreaction.
p14230
aVDoesn't what they are doing come under Posse Comitatus?
p14231
aVThat military forces are not to handle internal policing.
p14232
aVIf that's not the definition of a military force I'm really confused.
p14233
aVThey are armed better than I was as a Marine in combat. 
p14234
aVPerfect way to tie both of Monday's rulings together into a protest. 
p14235
aVAm I missing the union tie in? 
p14236
aVMaybe the other one is last week.
p14237
aVI meant the abortion protest ruling.
p14238
aVAh,  Monday's other one was union free riders. 
p14239
aVThey need a special color for countries he has wanted to attack twice.
p14240
aVSince McCain dropped bombs on Vietnam and southeast Asia during the US war there after the US refused to hold elections because the Vietnamese would have voted in a communist into power, shouldn't that also be included?
p14241
aVBut the larger question is: How can such sociopaths be elected into office and repeatedly reelected into office?
p14242
aVIt's an oldie but goodie :).
p14243
aVNorth Carolina is so terrible...  Ugh....
p14244
aVIt wasn't always the case.
p14245
aVThings were pretty good before Art Pope financed Gov.
p14246
aVMcCrory and other Republicans that took over the state.
p14247
aVIt's an ALEC testing ground now.
p14248
aVSadly, it went to shit rather quickly.
p14249
aVNo, I know.
p14250
aVI live there.
p14251
aVI'd never be so rude as to insult a state I don't live in.
p14252
aV....Except North Korea.
p14253
aVYeah, my folks retired there.
p14254
aVIt's a shame.
p14255
aVSuch a beautiful state with a rich Appalachian culture.
p14256
aVPretty noticeable difference in the atmosphere of government in the past fifteen years they've lived there.
p14257
aVAll gutted for some short term profits for a select few &amp; at the expense of everyone else that actually lives there.
p14258
aV can't help but think that if someone followed the money here it would lead to bankers seeking to privatize drinking water.
p14259
aVMake no mistake, in most areas (unless you are catching &amp; drinking rain water) these fracking chemicals will eventually end up your drinking water.
p14260
aVThis is what happens when maintaining the status quo for business becomes more important than national security or humanity as a whole.
p14261
aVIt's reached a point where they are not just anti-science, but anti-survival. 
p14262
aVstrike another blow for ignorance!
p14263
aVThere are a couple of inter-working parts in the machinery of right-wing foolishness.
p14264
aVRight-wingers equate the government with 'giving money to no-good lazy minorities'.
p14265
aVTherefore, starve the government of revenue, and create tax cuts which give money back to hard-working (white) people.
p14266
aVMake brutal cuts to government -- destroy public education, food stamps, public libraries, police, fire departments, zoning departments, sewage treatment plants, who cares because I've got mine and fuck everybody else.
p14267
aVBut for some reason, it doesn't work.
p14268
aVThe economy crumbles because the government, which is supposed to maintain infrastructure and public institutions on which we all (including private business) depend, has been starved of revenue.
p14269
aVWhen there's a recession and businesses lay everyone off, there's no government to keep spending, keep the money flowing through the economy, and keep people employed.
p14270
aVBut the wingers really don't care enough about their country for the destruction of their country to even matter to them.
p14271
aVThey hate above all the citizens of their own country, the 'lazy, no-good' minorities.
p14272
aVSo they enthusiastically collaborate to destroy their own country's government, encouraged by other racist traitors such as the right-wing media (Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity, Drudge, Savage, Levin, etc).
p14273
aVThese traitors, of course, are only enriching themselves at the expense of the fools who listen to them and fervently believe in their stories.
p14274
aVRacism, hatred, and greed are the core of right-wing thinking.
p14275
aVBrownbackistan...
p14276
aVThis is the free market, GOP utopia the Republicans would love to inflict upon all of America were they given half a chance.
p14277
aVMost of the the anti-tax conservatives will just pick up and move to another state when Kansas hits rock bottom. 
p14278
aV"Bleed revenue"?
p14279
aVThey're not collecting it, which isn't the same thing.
p14280
aVAnd taxes aren't revenue or profit.
p14281
aVOnly profit-making enterprises generate revenue.
p14282
aVTaxes are only taxes.
p14283
aVAnd it's no surprise that they need to cut back since they collected less taxes.
p14284
aVPeople in Kansas (and in the rest of the U.S.) are free to pay extra taxes if they think state and local governments will spend the money better.
p14285
aVYou really love to eat the right-wing bullshit with a fork and knife, don't you?
p14286
aVYou confuse a discussion about the policy with the backing of the party.
p14287
aVAnd while there are many people that have drank deep of the GOP Koolaid, you sounds as if you drank the opposite flavor.
p14288
aVMost people in Washington are blatant opportunists who back whatever they need to back to get re-elected.
p14289
aVIt's ridiculous to assume "the economy will crumble" because of "lack of infrastructure".
p14290
aVDoes that sound like something the powerful corporate lobbyists want to have happen?
p14291
aVIt's about stealing the money for the rich.
p14292
aVIt's a lot easier to steal when it's in the hands of the politicians who got elected by the rich, regardless of their political affiliation.
p14293
aVAh, yes.
p14294
aV'The Dems and Reps are exactly the same' gambit.
p14295
aVThey are not exactly the same.
p14296
aVOne party gives health care to millions of Americans, saving many from disease and/or bankruptcy.
p14297
aVThe other party fights tooth and nail to take health care away from Americans.
p14298
aVOne party wants you to vote, the other party wants to keep you from voting.
p14299
aVOne party wants to make a treaty with Iran, the other wants to go to war with Iran.
p14300
aVThey are not the same, and your false belief that they are the same makes certain people very happy.
p14301
aVNo, I didn't post that.
p14302
aVBut if you would like to believe that Democrats operate out of the goodness of their hearts and not because health insurance lobbyists are making millions off the current system, you believe that.
p14303
aVAnd as far as Iran goes, the 47 dumbasses that signed the letter [aren't alone.
p14304
aV](http://nypost.com/2015/04/04/ny-democrats-speak-out-against-iran-nuke-deal/)\u000a\u000aAnd if you want to see how Democrats well third party candidates on a local level, feel free to run.
p14305
aVThey're fine with voting, as long as there's no other actual competition.
p14306
aVJust ask the Greens.
p14307
aVAh, the NY Post.
p14308
aVMy favorite go-to tabloid for nonsense and bullshit.
p14309
aVYou are deflecting and evading.
p14310
aVOne party wants to keep people from voting using Voter ID laws; the other wants people to vote. 
p14311
aVIf you're going to tell me what I think, then you're having a conversation with yourself.
p14312
aVIf it was a little boy that was raped, they probably would have no-knock raided a few houses and NEVER used the term *promiscuous*
p14313
aVNice to see a well run sensitivity training program.
p14314
aVObviously none of them are fathers, and I hope they never are. 
p14315
aVThis might be true, but if the sports franchise's arena, field, or stadium is rented out for concerts, it could add more cultural activities which enrich our lives. 
p14316
aVI really wonder why they are doubling down so hard on this.
p14317
aVThis is politically very stupid.
p14318
aVI guess the republican ideals of local government and states/citizens rights being prioritized over a strong federal government no longer apply.
p14319
aVWho would enforce such a federal warrant?
p14320
aVThe DEA/FBI?
p14321
aVPretty sure the mayor is guarded by the DC police and wouldn't recognize the warrant .
p14322
aVWould LOVE to see this played out in a court. 
p14323
aVThreatening an elected leader with jail for doing his job and obeying his constituents - I might be able to think of a better symbol for right-wing authoritarianism, but it won't be easy.
p14324
aVPlease, please call them on that bluff and lets hope it's not a bluff.
p14325
aVNothing would help change opinion more.
p14326
aVrepublicans really pushing that small government initiative i see!
p14327
aVI'd like to see this one go to the supreme court. 
p14328
aVWhat about smaller companies that don't have billions in profits but still need large full-time employee bases?
p14329
aVPrivate companies not backed by shareholders and whatnot?
p14330
aVSure it's great for Wal-Mart, but what happens when you get let go because the smaller company can't afford  50+ health plans?
p14331
aVThis is one concern I didn't see addressed.
p14332
aVDoes anyone have info on how that turned out?
p14333
aVObamacare has only been selectively and inconsistently enforced.
p14334
aVWho could know ahead of time what effect that might have?
p14335
aVPeople can honestly support nationalizing health care or some set of specific provisions or whatever.
p14336
aVBut really, no one can honestly support the Affordable Care Act as a whole because no one can have read it.
p14337
aVIt's deliberately obfuscated in the text to make it difficult to read and understand.
p14338
aVI don't think it even technically qualifies as a law, philosophically speaking, because one of the properties of a law (as opposed to a secret decree) is that laws have to be publicly readable, and this isn't.
p14339
aVCourse, many of our so-called "laws" these days wouldn't really qualify under that reasonable standard either.
p14340
aVI'm not saying Obamacare is alone in that.
p14341
aV"Free Market" in operation.
p14342
aVBig news here Laura: we all do. 
p14343
aVIngraham does not sound like a Native American name to me...
p14344
aVIf she had one, it'd be Shitting Bull.
p14345
aVHe's speaking as though it hasn't already happened...
p14346
aVI have to think that if we manage to vote against our own best interests, again, and the GOP takes the senate, that America will be hardly recognizable as a democracy in four years.
p14347
aVEspecially if the Democrats manage to lose the presidency in '16.
p14348
aVThat the Republican Congress and the conservative SCOTUS will become very cooperative with each other and solidify a true Oligarchy, if it isn't already.
p14349
aVObama is not even much of a moderate financially and is far too willing to give up in the face heavy opposition and lobbying.
p14350
aVIt would put him in the difficult position of being the only defense left.
p14351
aVOne of saddest things is that many of those people who are dependent on current social programs like SS are likely to be the swing vote that puts the GOP into a position to change or outright destroy the very programs that they depend on while the rest of the (non)voters sit on their hands. 
p14352
aVIF the GOP manages to take the Senate in 2014, my "hope" is that shit will get much much worse for the majority of working class Americans (trash the ACA, drastic SS and Medicare cuts, further austerity measures, further abortion restrictions, no minimum wage increase, continued or increased wars, and more tax breaks for the rich, etc.
p14353
aV) and they show up en masses in 2016 to actually vote in their own best interests.
p14354
aVStill, it will be a long and painful two years and it will leave much to be overturned and corrected.
p14355
aVBut honestly, Hillary waiting for her turn in 2016 isn't that appealing either.
p14356
aVOh god no.
p14357
aVHilary is the least appealing candidate I can think of.
p14358
aVShe is totally bought and happily I think.
p14359
aVOne of the things that scares me is what they will do to voting regs and regulatory agencies.
p14360
aVThey hold the purse strings to de-fund whomever they wish.
p14361
aVAlso they can pass appointments and judgeship's that would damage the country for decades to come.
p14362
aVThis is the true mischief that the Bush admin with a sympathetic Congress did: they appointed as many of their own people as they could and we still feel the results of that now.
p14363
aVA lot of the bad decisions that have been blamed on Obama are made by those politicized appointee.
p14364
aVWith an aligned Congress it really easy to push whomever they want into the regulatory and enforcement agencies, and they are hard to dislodge once in office. 
p14365
aVYeah, good points on funding of the regulatory agencies and appointments.
p14366
aVIt's going to get pretty ugly (much uglier).
p14367
aVIt's stunning how one of our two main parties essentially just represents the interests of a tiny handful of people.
p14368
aVright, but also consider that party representing interests of "a tiny handful of people" will be the majority in the Senate.
p14369
aVThat's not gerrymandering and deals for your hometown, that's the majority of people in a state voting for R vs D. \u000a\u000aGranted, it doesn't make their ideas more right or wrong, but they are certainly popular in lots of places.
p14370
aVThe fact that they can get people to vote against their own self-interest is pretty annoying.
p14371
aVAnd let's not forget the voter I.D.
p14372
aVlaws to prevent "fraud," the fact that election day is NOT a national holiday, it's in November, etc.
p14373
aVYeah, we really need to lose one famous person holiday and make election day a full-on federal holiday.
p14374
aVThat son of Washington state's richest banking family, Bill Gates, used his family connections to sell IBM a computer operating system that he literally did not possess.
p14375
aVGates then licensed one and then broke the license agreement when he was wealthy enough to afford the lawyers and court costs.
p14376
aVGates is now the richest person in the world...
p14377
aVSo the Kochs stole oil from Native Americans?
p14378
aVBig deal, didn't we steal the entire continent from them and break countless treaties with them?!
p14379
aVAll the other examples of corruption and corner-cutting by the Kochs are *routine* for businesses.
p14380
aVThe bottom line is that the wealth of the planet should be shared with all people.
p14381
aVThat's the fundamental principle we're ignoring.
p14382
aV&gt; "Behind every great fortune there is a great crime.
p14383
aV" -- Honore de Balzac (20 May 1799 - 18 August 1850).
p14384
aVI'm not sure if it's what they've done (You're right, not that unusual for big business) as the sanctimonious hypocrisy that surrounds it.
p14385
aVThey are so unflinchingly slimy at every turn.
p14386
aVI find them to be terrifying because they seem like they would love to fire up the gas ovens and fill them with anyone considered to be in their way.
p14387
aVThey have no humanity at all, not even, apparently, any grasp of what it is to be human.
p14388
aVCan you imagine what kind of a world it will be if they get what they want?  
p14389
aV&gt; Can you imagine what kind of a world it will be if they get what they want?
p14390
aVIMO it'd be little different from what Warren Buffett, Bill Gates or any other capitalist is proposing.
p14391
aVOur economic system is inherently unfair and unsustainable; we're ignoring that core fundamental principle noted above.
p14392
aV&gt; "Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.
p14393
aV" -- Famous capitalist economist John Maynard Keynes.
p14394
aVNice quote from Keynes.
p14395
aVI like that one.
p14396
aVThat's always what has astounded me about Libertarians.
p14397
aVThat is the base assumption of their belief.
p14398
aVThat bad men will do good things just 'cuz.
p14399
aVMarket forces my ass.
p14400
aVWhich "free market" was that.
p14401
aVHas there ever been such a thing?  
p14402
aVThat's what happens when you prioritize tax cuts over roads and schools.
p14403
aVNeoliberal economics is basically throwing money out the window, after you do it you don't get the money back, but you still need it too survive.
p14404
aVThat's where the rest of us come in to save their asses.
p14405
aVThis is a major economic problem in pretty much all red states but almost no is talking about it.
p14406
aVThese states have only been GOP dominated for about 20 years and they are already falling apart.
p14407
aVInfrastructure?
p14408
aVPublic education?
p14409
aVEnergy?
p14410
aVHealth care?
p14411
aVThere is no reason to suspect these states will stop voting GOP anytime soon and little suggesting the GOP will change its economic policy.
p14412
aVThis is going to get much worse and continue for awhile.
p14413
aVThe one thing I would like to point out is that 60% of Alaska is owned by the Federal Government.
p14414
aVAt least a portion of the money spent in Alaska is to manage those Federal Lands.
p14415
aVOtherwise, mostly agree that most red states don't understand how dependent they are on the Federal Government.
p14416
aVNice, but the people of Pennsylvania should be demanding *full* *legalization* and an end to the drug war from our plutocratic, non-representative government.
p14417
aVWe need to learn from Portugal's 10+ year policy: Decriminalize *all* drugs.
p14418
aVPortugal has shown that this will gut drug-related crime and does not result in skyrocketing drug use (Portugal has the lowest rate of heroin addiction of all of Europe) like our drug warriors claim.
p14419
aVA majority of Americans want marijuana to be *legal.
p14420
aV*\u000a\u000aNew ideas and politicians/parties that represent common Americans (and not corporations, the status quo and the rich) are what's needed.
p14421
aVWe need to demand more.
p14422
aVEdit: Typos
p14423
aVWow, even more questions about jurisdiction?
p14424
aVWhat about state police?
p14425
aVWhat does the Governor think about this action?
p14426
aVYou're right, it's a confusing jurisdictional scenario.
p14427
aVMy prediction: The clock is ticking before our corrupt national government has its Supreme ~~Corp.~~ Court issue a ruling that strikes down Washington and Colorado's legalization laws and the federal government goes on a PR kick re-demonizing marijuana.
p14428
aVPhilly, the birthplace of American democracy.
p14429
aVGood for you.
p14430
aVNope.
p14431
aVWe just don't want to know about it.
p14432
aVWe don't want to know that freedom and equality take more than lip service, and just  because we say we are the most free country in the world doesn't make it so, and as long as we can get away with our tv's and our toys and our greedy greedy ways it's not going to change.  
p14433
aV&gt; We just don't want to know about it.
p14434
aVI call BS.
p14435
aVOf course we know what to do about it.
p14436
aVMuch of this involves rewriting Reagan's tax changes and the entire pro-corporate push that has been going on for the past few decades.
p14437
aVIt will mean reintroducing into the tax system the idea that "earned income" (wages, etc.
p14438
aV) should be taxed at a lower rate than "unearned income" (capital gains, dividends, interest, speculation income, etc.).
p14439
aVWe *know* what needs to be done.
p14440
aVThe problem is that, as Jimmy Carter stated, the US is no longer a "functioning democracy" -- we're a plutocracy or an oligarchy.
p14441
aVThe rich control *both* of the 2 political parties that control the US.
p14442
aVThus, people are powerless to stop the tyranny of the US government unless we start seeing mass protests and more uprisings, and start refusing to support the 2 corrupt parties that rule the US.
p14443
aVYou mean we have to get off our asses and put down our cell phones?
p14444
aVWe have to get out in the streets and do battle with the hyper-armed police forces that work for the Oligarchs?
p14445
aVLove to see it, but I'm not holding my breath. 
p14446
aVThe thing is, human nature dictates that most people think that they might one day be one of the people who wind up with a disproportionate share of wealth.
p14447
aVFor that reason they are okay with the rules as they are.
p14448
aVThe truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people will not become wealthy.
p14449
aVThe number of jobs available for humans to do is decreasing as technology develops.
p14450
aVThe only thing worse than building a fortune by taking advantage of your fellow human being is replacing your fellow human being with a robot or piece of software.
p14451
aVBut that is exactly what is happening and its rate of progress is growing exponentially.
p14452
aVThe only thing that is constant in the universe is change.
p14453
aVAnd the change that is going to have to come is the manner in which wealth is distributed.
p14454
aVI hope that this change comes in a peaceful manner.     \u000a\u000a

p14559
aVWe may find incremental increase in the usage of the postal service.
p14560
aVHowever, the net result is declining volume for USPS (and thus revenue), and, if we subscribe to a market-based idea, that means USPS should offer less service when compared to the past.
p14561

p14599
aVInstead, our corporate mass media will cover the election as a horse race -- endlessly talking about personality, charisma, amount of money gathered, etc., etc.
p14600
aVBut who knows, maybe the mass media would choose marijuana as one of the popular [wedge issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue#United_States) so they can pretend that there are significant differences between the two halves of the capitalist ruling duopoly that runs the country...\u000a\u000a&gt; "The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.

aVI mean, given the way many politicians bend in the breeze according to what opinion polls say is the prevailing political winds, it is rather refreshing to see a politician sticking with his 10th Amendment-violating and civil liberties-crushing views.
p14607
aVThat's doubly true of Christie and this issue given the fact that across the country a majority of Americans want marijuana legalized.
p14608
aVSo kudos to Christie for sticking to his views!

aVTed Cruz not only gets the climate science wrong, he got the history about Galileo wrong as well.
p14631
aVCruz said that contemporary \u201cglobal warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers.\u201d \u000a\u000a\u201cYou know it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier,\u201d he said.
p14632
aVIt was never "accepted scientific wisdom" that the Earth is flat.
p14633
aVBy the time that Galileo was born (1564) scientists, navigators and the educated class had known for almost two millennia that the Earth was in actuality a sphere.
p14634
aVIn fact, the geographer, mathematician and astronomer Eratosthenes of Cyrene (Who died in 194 BCE), knowing that the Earth was a sphere based on the work of earlier astronomers, calculated the actual size of the Earth to within a few percent, as well as calculating the tilt of the Earth's axis.
p14635
aVThis was over two centuries before Jesus was ever born.
p14636
aVAdditionally, Eratosthenes was well known to the Church throughout it's history and even Columbus frequently mentioned Eratosthenes in his journals and letters.
p14637
aVThe truth is that Galileo was eventually ~~excommunicated from~~ tried by the Church and imprisoned for the remainder of his life for his views on the Copernican System, as well as for mocking the reactionary Catholic dogmatics in his treatise on the subject, NOT because he challenged the concept of a "Flat Earth".
p14638
aVNot only is that claim factually wrong, it is simply ignorant.
p14639
aVThe reality is that Galileo relied on the best available scientific evidence, something that Cruz unilaterally rejects with regard to climate science.
p14640
aVAnd Cruz does so all because it is politically and philosophically inconvenient.
p14641
aVEdit: Galileo was in fact not excommunicated.
p14642

p14686
aVI don't know the direct jobs created by a project should be the metric considered.
p14687
aVI would imagine that it's more likely to create jobs indirectly through an increase in economic output.
p14688
aVIt might be helpful to think about the inverse situation: we could pay 50,000 people to dig holes in the ground and another 50,000 people to fill them in - 100,000 new jobs!
p14689
aVExcept, we've not increased economic output, so we've just devalued the dollar and hurt the economy (unless you subscribe to Keynsian economics, which would assert that the increase in demand would spur an increase in economic output).
p14690
aV50,000 holes in the ground don't have the potential to leak and enter one of the most important aquifers in the nation.
p14691
aVAll to simply fall back on oil dependency and extract some more profit for transnational corporations amidst an environmental crisis.
p14692
aVSenator Bernie Sanders says it best, imho:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a&gt;When people tell you that Keystone is a jobs program, they\u2019re not telling you the truth.
p14693
aVAccording to the State Department, it will create about 2,000 temporary construction jobs over a two-year period, and then about fifty permanent jobs.
p14694
aVIf you want a jobs program, let\u2019s rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
p14695
aVInvest a trillion dollars into doing that, and create 13 million jobs, not 2,000 jobs.
p14696
aV&gt;This oil, at least a significant part of this oil is going to be exported to Asia.
p14697
aVIn fact, there are at least three different studies, including one at Cornell, which suggest that because of the refinery infrastructure, domestic prices will actually go up.
p14698
aV**So here we are doing something which will exacerbate climate change, will create a minimal amount of jobs, will enrich the companies that own the oil fields and who do the refining, and at the same time, raise gas prices in the United States.
p14699
aVThis does not make a lot of sense to me.
p14700
aV**\u000a\u000aTL;DR There's a lot better things we could do for our country's future than build KXL or your silly example of digging and filling holes.\u000a

p14702
aVI don't know enough about the project or its potential to impact individual or environmental rights to say whether I support it.
p14703
aVThis article was largely focused on the purported lack of economic benefits, and the main argument was "it's only 50 jobs" - which I wanted people to consider from another angle.
p14704
aVBut I will say, in your example or alternate uses for the money -  what money?
p14705
aVIsn't this being built with private capital? 
p14706
aVThe economic potential of KXL is for a very few already rich people and a handful of jobs, big whoop.
p14707
aVSeriously, 50 jobs is so minuscule, it's not even worth taking into consideration.
p14708
aVAnd not buying your trickle down suggestion that it will "create jobs indirectly through an increase in economic output.
p14709
aV" Don't believe the hype.
p14710

p14713
aVSo would the gas users (mostly diesel).
p14714
aVThe environment will "pay," as well.
p14715
aVPerhaps most importantly, the taxpayers will be paying, as it would be [subsidized](http://priceofoil.org/2012/02/08/keystone-xl-benefits-from-taxpayer-subsidies/).
p14716
aVUS taxpayers paying so transnationals can make a bunch of money...\u000a\u000a&gt;The refineries that are linked to the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline as committed shippers will receive between $1 billion and $1.8 billion in tax breaks.
p14717
aVThey are paid specifically for investing in equipment to process the heavy sour oil the pipeline promises to deliver.
p14718
aV&gt;The largest of these refineries, Motiva, is half owned by Saudi Refining Inc., and will receive between $680 million and $1.1 billion in U.S. taxpayer support.
p14719
aV&gt;Keystone XL, like all oil industry projects, is enabled by substantial taxpayer subsidies.
p14720
aVThree of the refineries that are planning to process the pipeline\u2019s oil have invested in special equipment to handle the extra heavy tar sands oil.
p14721
aVAccording to our conservative estimates, the U.S. taxpayer is subsidizing these investments to the tune of $1.0-1.8 billion.
p14722
aVEdit: Unsure who compensates for invoking eminent domain to seize the land. 
p14723
aVYou had me at subsidies.
p14724
aVI'm firmly against corporate welfare. 
p14725
aVThe Republicans don't message well.
p14726
aVIt isn't all about jobs.

aVMore jobs will be brought back or created when the oil gets flowing to refineries.
p14728
aVAlso, it's about having and using our own oil supply and not being dependent, in any measure, on foreign oil.
p14729
aVWe could be the oil supplier for the world and rake in the dough to where taxes could go down for everyone. 
p14730
aVNews for ya, refined KXL oil is going to be shipped to Asia.
p14731
aVWe just get to let it leak as it crosses our country and enjoy the environmental impacts of increased refining of this sludge while transnationals profit.
p14732
aVIt will do nothing to increase our "oil independence.
p14733
aV" Especially since oil companies want the oil export embargo lifted, which means we'll stop paying the reduced rates we currently do and will be paying international rates for barrels.
p14734
aVThere' have been several studies that indicate that KXL will raise the price of gas in the US.
p14735
aVOne thing: none of the tar sands oil's going to the U.S. Too sulfurous.
p14736
aVIt's a lousy kind of oil.
p14737
aVSo that's all most likely going to China.
p14738
aVNot one drop of that'll be used here.
p14739
aVI rather expect the profits will not be used to lower your taxes either.
p14740
aVI have some grave doubts that the cheapest possible pipelines run the cheapest possible way will be exceedingly safe, especially since there's effectively no pipeline safety agency in this country.
p14741
aVThere *is*, but they have to ask permission to send strongly-worded letters.
p14742
aVThis'll end badly.

aV&gt;1 in 25 Americans was arrested\u000a\u000aI wonder if they're taking the n=total arrest and dividing it by population.
p14744
aVIf so, this is very misleading.  
p14745
aVIt will be very interesting to see people's opinions on this.
p14746
aVI would think that there will be a big scream of No!
p14747
aV....... but in actual fact it is the perfect way to fight Crime and solve many unsolved Crimes !
p14748
aV............  just saying !
p14749
aVIf you could guarantee that it would only be used to solve violent crime and no one else would ever get access, I would agree.
p14750
aVCan't make that guarantee and even if they did our law enforcement agencies have abused such trust in the past too many times to have any credibility.
p14751
aVLet me start by saying I'm just an OAP in England, and have NO interest in law enforcement.
p14752
aVFingerprints have helped solve many crimes.
p14753
aVI do believe that DNA identification would be a very big deterrent to all aspects of crime.
p14754
aVIt astounded me some years ago when a  30 year old unsolved murder was solved because a DUI driver had his DNA taken on his arrest......
p14755
aVThe driver was not the guilty person, his uncle was !
p14756
aVThat says a great deal about testing.
p14757
aVAlso this last week an American guy was released from 30 years in prison and proved innocent of a double murder by his DNA !
p14758
aVJust curious.... What are you afraid of?
p14759
aVSo what if someone has access to your DNA profile?
p14760
aVAnd are those fears worth letting some criminals free or keeping some innocent people in jail?
p14761
aVGenetic profiling and discrimination.
p14762
aVAnd yes, I think that potential (likely?
p14763
aV) horror is worse than not solving some crimes.
p14764
aVLaw enforcement are already using data to try to predict crime, turning innocent people into suspected criminals without them giving any direct cause for suspicion.
p14765
aVI can easily see a couple of more steps down this slippery slope leading to people getting things like extra surveillance of their lives, restrictions on where they can go, or even detention based on some supposed proclivity to types of criminal activity based on DNA.
p14766
aVAnd God help us if/when corporations get this data.
p14767
aV&gt; Law enforcement are already using data to try to predict crime, turning innocent people into suspected criminals without them giving any direct cause for suspicion.
p14768
aVWhat do you mean by this statement?

aVBullshit, the official government stat, which omits people who gave up looking for a job because they sent out applications from 2008 to 2014 and never got a job offer, might be lower than it was, but real unemployment is definitely higher than it was.
p14783
aVSomeone didn't read the article.
p14784
aVI did read the article, it said the official unemployment rate is the same, not lower than it was in 08, and other indicators of true unemployment are worse than they were in 08.
p14785
aVThat makes the statement mostly, if not entirely false, not mostly true.
p14786

aV&gt; They tried a non-violent revolution in the Ukraine\u000a\u000aI disagree, Ukraine is a bad example -- "they" didn't try it.
p14858
aVThe US government, directly and by stooge NGOs, funded Ukrainian dissidents and arranged a "colored revolution" -- just like our evil government has done to many countries, democratic and non-democratic alike.

p14886
aVIllinois cops are about as shady as they come. 
p14887
aVWhat's really crazy is that - typically - the culture has shifted along with the powerful in order to validate their way of living, and now this is considered a bar for success: to make one's living without having to work at all, or at least as little as humanly possible.
p14888
aVThat's always been true, yes, but in the past it was considered a kind of pipe dream; now that's what *everyone* is after.
p14889
aVThe elevation of parasitism has had terrible consequences for society, I think, and it creates a standard of living that only the prenatally, preternaturally wealthy can live up to without running up enormous debt, taking advantage of others or engaging in outright crime.
p14890
aVThe only beneficial argument that can be made for it is that the diarrhetic abuse of money it involves is good for local economies, in the unlikely event some of it lands there instead of in multinationals or back into the same coffers it came from.
p14891
aVBut what good has this mentality done for this country, or any other, that a true work ethic couldn't surpass? 
p14892
aVI totally agree with you about the setting of unrealistic goals for society.
p14893
aVIts been called "conspicuous consumption" (Thorstein Veblen - in his "[The Theory of the Leisure Class](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/833)" - free on the net and very much worth reading) or more recently, "Affluenza".
p14894
aVIt is extremely destructive carried to the level it is in America today.
p14895
aVBut that is not really the norm around the world.
p14896
aVThere's another issue which few are bringing up as we need to.
p14897
aVWe all need to wrap our heads around the implications of the fact that the raw numbers of people required to work to maintain society *at its current level*, is falling exponentially.
p14898
aVAnd we're being discouraged from making the necessary adjustments which we would need to do to keep employment high.
p14899
aV(We would need to stop trying to beat creativity out of people, and give everybody a much more complete education) Instead they are trying to slow down change.
p14900
aVWe need to increase the average skill level of everybody so that we're living in the 21st century and not the 20th.
p14901
aVBut, that will mean that new technologies replace others very rapidly.
p14902
aVWhich is happening anyway.
p14903
aVThats what's changing.
p14904
aVThe shift has been making business more and more profitable because the need for unskilled, semiskilled and even skilled workers - and therefore, business costs, are falling.
p14905
aVVirtual companies are now common where the workers are scattered around the globe.
p14906
aVWhat would you call it where somebody has created some new product or service and they have set up a company to manufacture it and sell it and automated the entire thing, from beginning to end?
p14907
aVSome companies exist just to make the products of thousands of other companies.
p14908
aVOther companies exist just to store, ship and deliver the products of thousands or even millions of small companies.
p14909
aVPreviously, those companies would have had a much higher cost of entry, because each had to maintain a building somewhere, and employ sales and warehouse staff, and a shipping department.
p14910
aVWhich is expensive.
p14911
aVNow they don't.
p14912
aVPeople are working smarter.
p14913
aVIn ten or fifteen years, the level of automation will be several times more than today.
p14914
aVLots more people will be unemployed because the volume and number of tasks which people are needed to do for pay will be far smaller than it is today.
p14915
aVIt will be much cheaper to do those tasks with some form of technology.
p14916
aVWill politicians still be saying then that they don't have a work ethic?
p14917
aVNo, that will be impossible, because barring some miracle of shifting national priorities to education and business incubation, most of society by far, will be unemployed or close to it.
p14918
aVWhere is the discussion about that that we need to be having?
p14919
aVMaintaining society at its current level is not conducive to game changing new technologies, and society will always need those who are willing to work if it's going anywhere other than the unhappy fate Rome met.
p14920
aVThere is a nihilism in believing that it doesn't matter that the goal of an entire culture is to either do nothing, or to live a dissipate, self-interested existence mostly consuming resources and benefiting from the growing portion of society who do actual and necessary labor for ever-dwindling return.
p14921
aVThe way you talk here, there's a utopian robot society right around the corner where indolence is no crime at all, and the need for real work is nearing extinction (and falling in value at the same time).
p14922
aVThat isn't, will never be true.
p14923
aV**edit**: The way societies get by with this mentality is by utilizing slave labor, and that's what's going on now: you seem to think I just don't understand things on your end of the economic spectrum, and maybe that's so, but this is what's going on on mine.
p14924
aVThere are companies and businesses all over the world -- all over the US -- that operate in an unsustainable and parasitic way by taking advantage of economic or political desperation to pay real workers next to nothing.
p14925
aVThat is the source of 'lower costs of labor' and ultimately the potential to amass fortunes so large that individual work can be foregone.
p14926
aVThe global economy has created an endless pool of cheap labor, and when the standard of living rises to the point where a true share of the benefits is expected by workers in one place, multinational companies simply resource their labor elsewhere.
p14927
aVThat is the big picture.
p14928
aVThat is the framework that supports these utopian ideals of a world where people can live a (forgive the term) cancerous existence by amassing and devouring resources without the consequences inherent to input/output.
p14929
aVIt takes a hundred men to hold one financial golden child out of the ordinary ups and downs of life, including the necessity of doing what one has to instead of what one wants to. 
p14930
aV&gt;The way you talk here, there's a utopian robot society right around the corner where indolence \u000a\u000aIndolence being wasting time?
p14931
aVNot doing anything constructive, or not doing work for money?
p14932
aVNot doing work for money will be common because to do work for money people will need to be better all the time.
p14933
aVLook at the sciences, where people in most of the sciences (with several notable exceptions) really have to be PhD level and have published to get a good "career" level job.
p14934
aV&gt;is no crime at all, and the need for real work is nearing extinction (and falling in value at the same time).
p14935
aVThat isn't, will never be true.
p14936
aVThe definition of "real work" is changing.
p14937
aVI do agree with you about the predatory and unhealthy nature of the forced overconsumption in society.
p14938
aVAlso, that shifting money around isn't working.
p14939
aVI think that a lot of elements of our society are really out of control in a bad way.
p14940
aVBut, the changes being brought by technology (freeing up a lot of time for other things) has the potential to be very good.
p14941
aVThe definition of real work is changing because of the ability of technology to now effortlessly do so much of what we considered to be real work yesterday.
p14942
aVYou know the legend of John Henry?
p14943
aV&gt;There are companies and businesses all over the world -- all over the US -- that operate in an unsustainable and parasitic way by taking advantage of economic or political desperation to pay real workers next to nothing.
p14944
aVI agree with you, thats really become a serious problem, well, its always been a serious problem, but as some of society's tolerance for it is ending, another part is saying "with supply being so high and demand falling, wages should be falling to zero".
p14945
aV&gt;That is the source of 'lower costs of labor' and ultimately the potential to amass fortunes so large that individual work can be foregone.
p14946
aVYes, in part thats true but there also is this other thing going on that I think is rapidly becoming the dominant cause of this race to the bottom on wages and working conditions and that is not such an easy moral call.
p14947
aVbecause the underlying cause of it- is good.
p14948
aVLots of prices should be falling that are not, because of special interests and corruption.
p14949
aVLow wages could be said to hold back the development and adoption of new technologies somewhat and higher wages to increase their rate of adoption, but in the long run, their effect on that is very small.
p14950
aVWe should have higher wages because societies that do have higher wages seem to be better prepared for thse changes.
p14951
aVI dont think wages are, or should be, as large a chunk of the costs of a business.
p14952
aVBusinesses should be trying to do whatever they do in the smartest way possible.
p14953
aVSmart isn't always more technology.
p14954
aVSometimes its smart not to use technology for some reason.
p14955
aVSlack has its uses.
p14956
aVEfficiency shouldn't be put on the pedestal it has been.
p14957
aVBut- anyway, bla bla bla..
p14958
aVThe main thing I need to say is that what's happening now is really quite new in its scale and its potential impact on how we do things.
p14959
aVIts telling us we need to be better members of society.
p14960
aVNo man is an island and no business should be predatory.
p14961
aVWe all have an interest in weathering these changes together.
p14962
aVThe shift is really the biggest challenge the human race has ever had to deal with and how we deal with it is the single most important question in the history of mankind.
p14963
aVI agree with most of what you say, but you have to be careful to understand this other thing is happening too.
p14964
aVIf you don't recognize it, you'll be unable to adjust to it the way you need to.
p14965

aVSo now what?
p14996
aVIs the city going to open a check printing kiosk for slavery reparations, on the current non slave holding taxpayers, out side of city hall.
p14997
aVIf so, put several check cashing places around it so those money pigs can rob them of their money.
p14998
aVThe FCC is clearly run by insufferably fetid buffoons.
p14999
aVWell yes, but the FCC doesn't create bills.
p15000
aV&gt; The bill, introduced late Wednesday by Representative Bob Latta, an Ohio Republican, would block the FCC from reclassifying broadband as a common-carrier telecom service 
p15001
aVIt almost appears that a second cable system might be being built here, at least it seems to be looking that way.
p15002
aVIt's getting more and more confusing. 
p15003
aVA couple questions here:\u000a\u000aWhy would any idiot anywhere lease anything for more than a lifetime to a company that has shown zero performance other than projections?
p15004
aVWith no consequences for poor performance even.
p15005
aVWhy would anyone think that a private for profit company would do a cheaper job better than a government?
p15006
aVWhen has that ever happened other than closely supervised companies like the post office which only runs at a loss because Congress won't let it alone, and it's still the best most comprehensive delivery service we have. \u000a\u000a
p15007
aVOh here is this crazy idea that you might or might not have heard but it's called competition.
p15008
aVYou see when there are several companies that deliver a similar type of product or service at the same price in order to get a better market share they need to do a few things but most often they a) find more efficient cost structures to lower the price or b) sell a product or service that has a better perceived value than the competition, regardless of the price.
p15009
aVA private company needs to make a profit to survive and if you took an accounting class you would know that it requires selling A LOT of that product or service and the only way they can do that is by becoming more efficient.
p15010
aVWhy is government less efficient than a for-profit entity?
p15011
aVSimply because the risk involved does not effect the government.
p15012
aVA private business would cease to exist if it made the wrong investment decision while the government would simply continue operating at a loss and the poor decision would be passed on us, the tax payers.
p15013
aVThe post office is not doing well because its failing to adapt its cost structure to the age of the Internet.
p15014
aVAll of those pensions that have been promised for the employees can no longer be paid for since the revenue has dropped.
p15015
aVThat's why companies like UPS have started to compete with the postal service in order to become more efficient in every aspect and believe me, they are now a case-study for how well they operate.
p15016
aVActually I think you're wrong in a couple places.
p15017
aVThis competition concept of which you speak needs to have corporations which actually compete, as opposed to devour the competition to monopolize and collude to fix pricing to what they need this week.
p15018
aVThere is no free market anymore, and it's not the government that made that happen.
p15019
aVWhat the government has done is secondary, and has come as a result of demands from the corporate hierarchy.
p15020
aVWe have been steadily moving away from orderly regulated capitalism since Reagan.
p15021
aVMost all of the changes in the law have been to free up companies from fears of monopoly charges and price fixing.
p15022
aVHow many case of either has the Justice Dept handled in the last decade?
p15023
aV&gt;Simply because the risk involved does not effect the government.
p15024
aVThe other side of that is innovation.
p15025
aVThe government is free to innovate to a degree that is simply not available to companies that have to answer to stockholders.
p15026
aVThe government is able to take a longer view in what they do because their funding isn't dependent on immediate profit rather than having to constantly cater to the demands for immediate profit.
p15027
aVWe wouldn't be doing what we are doing on what we're doing it on without government funded research.
p15028
aVOne of the main problems we have in the world today is the extremely short sighted orientation that most of the privately funded world is forced into by short term greed.
p15029
aVThe reason the government is so inefficient is more a matter of the demands to cater to the status quo rather than work for the future.
p15030
aVAs long as we have to subsidize industries that no longer need subsidies, and do projects and spend money on things that do nothing for the country or the people, as long a private business does everything is can to stop progress this is what we live with.
p15031
aVI think government is inefficient because we make it inefficient.  \u000a\u000a 
p15032
aVThere's not much competition in a monopoly.
p15033
aVNever ever trust a Liar
p15034
aVOur so called regulatory groups are a fucking joke.
p15035
aVIf an owner of a public utility attempts to shut down a facility every dime of tax payer money including all incentives, eminent domain costs, and any other tax break that facility has has ever received should be immediately due and payable to the government.
p15036
aVElizabeth Warren said what about this? 
p15037
aVUnsure of the point you're trying to make.
p15038
aVAre you generally asking what her comment was in regard to this type of behavior?
p15039
aVOr are you looking for a comment specifically about Brayton Point and Energy Capital Partners?
p15040
aVOr are you trying to make some sort of point with regard to her?
p15041
aV* Senator Warren talking about [Wall Street's manipulation of commodities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXpLIqDksDA) This is more so on the shell game they're playing with metals to artificially jack up prices, but definitely related.
p15042
aVIf that doesn't suit your question, give her a little time.
p15043
aVI'm confident she'll make a statement about it soon.
p15044
aVI only found a few stories relating to [Brayton Point Energy &amp; Capital Partners](http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=Brayton+Point+Energy+Capital+Partners) without much comment by anyone in DC, as of yet.
p15045
aVThank you - definitely the middle question - did she respond to them directly?
p15046
aVI am from Massachusetts but I live overseas so I only have sporadic news information - I love Warren I hope she is president soon! 
p15047
aVI haven't seen any clips of anyone in DC speaking about Brayton Point.
p15048
aVOnly a few articles in Boston paper websites for the most part.
p15049
aVBut I'm sure something is going to come out of it, especially when power rates in Mass go up this summer.
p15050
aVHmmm... not sure how many cotton-picking jobs are available to people in Las Vegas, Nevada.
p15051
aVCan someone please forward this story to the White House
p15052
aVThis woman is my hero
p15053
aVWhy do the Koch brothers hate Americans?
p15054
aVI wish they would put some sort of corporate logo on all their products so I would know what to boycott.
p15055
aVThis should get you started:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.boycottkochbrothers.com/
p15056
aVJust as an asterisk I would like to say that since the Clintons have only existed politically for one generation, they are a political *family* and not a political dynasty, whereas the Bushes have been in high elected office for four generations, more comparable to the Kennedys.
p15057
aVThat being said, I agree with your general sentiment.
p15058
aVThe Democrats, however, don't have a whole lot of nationally recognized names besides Hillary.
p15059
aVI don't think someone as far left as Warren or Sanders will get the nod.
p15060
aVJim Webb is really cool though!
p15061
aVBill Clinton is a very popular ex-president while George Bush is a very unpopular ex-president.
p15062
aVRemember that parties 2012 political conventions?
p15063
aVGeorge W. Bush, aware of his deep unpopularity, was too ashamed even to go.
p15064
aVWhereas Bill Clinton gave an incredible main speech of the first night that the whole country was talking about.
p15065
aVAnd your point is...............
p15066
aVThat being related to Bill Clinton is an asset and being related to George Bush is a liability.
p15067
aVWhat about a Rodham?
p15068
aVDems I'd like to see: MN gov.
p15069
aVMark Dayton, MA Senator Elizabeth Warren, VT Senator Bernie Sanders.
p15070
aVSounds good to me.
p15071
aVIf this ends up being Bush v Clinton again I'm going to puke.
p15072
aVWould it be crazy to suggest no Democrats or Republicans?
p15073
aVOr at least, none that meet the party mold?
p15074
aVYeah, let's rag on the people with families and let the loners waltz in and cash out via the polling booth.
p15075
aVThat has worked wonderfully in the Wall Street!
p15076
aVExcept it won't happen: the 1% write the laws in this country.
p15077
aVWork that stereotype Grandma.
p15078
aVThat's the disconnect that has always baffled me.
p15079
aVHow do the die hard "keep gummint outta my life" advocates reconcile that with all of the lifestyle legislation they push so hard?
p15080
aVIt's like someone split their brains down the middle and the right doesn't talk to the left.
p15081
aVAnd they don't even notice anymore how much they've lost. 
p15082
aVI think we should get the real perspective from someone who has both happen, where is that lawyer that Dick Cheney shot in the face? 
p15083
aVsetting off bombs are illegal, but they happen anyway.
p15084
aVguns are illegal in school zones, they happen to find their way onto school grounds anyway.
p15085
aVweed is illegal in most states, people still smoke it anyway.
p15086
aVlaws are bullshit, you cant stop a mass murderer with laws.
p15087
aVif they are determined to kill a bunch of people, it will happen one way or another.
p15088
aVjust because you ban a weapon, doesnt mean they wont find another way to kill people.
p15089
aVstupid liberals and their utopian ideals.
p15090
aVhave a fresh cup of reality for a chance
p15091
aVSpeaking of reality, contact with thereof, did you read the article?
p15092
aVBecause I find it hard to see how this comment connects to the article at *all.
p15093
aV* \u000a\u000aIt's as if you *guessed* what it must be about.
p15094
aVSo go back and read, for it is from pandagon and written by Amanda Marcotte who among other things quotes herself to nail down the essential point about how *some* conservatives DO whine when they are not the center of attention.
p15095
aV&gt; You will not be surprised to note that while Continetti works up a healthy mouth-froth over the fact that Mozilla pressured Brendan Eich to resign over his anti-gay activism, he doesn\u2019t castigate his fellow conservatives for hounding yours truly in the press for weeks back in 2007, when conservatives managed to make a national scandal over the fact that I had written something blasphemous about the Virgin Mary.
p15096
aV**(Specifically, \u201cWhat if Mary had taken Plan B after the Lord filled her with his hot, white, sticky Holy Spirit?\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019d have to justify your misogyny with another ancient mythology.\u201d See, it was funny!
p15097
aV)** Which is interesting, since his argument\u2014that opposition to shooting people in the head over blasphemy should naturally translate into opposition to criticizing people or even firing them over what they said\u2014much more closely applies to my case than Eich\u2019s.
p15098
aVAfter all, mine was strictly a speech issue, whereas Eich donated money.
p15099
aVAnd I, like the folks at Charlie Hebdo, was castigated for making fun of a deity that a lot of people take really seriously, whereas Eich was attacking real people.
p15100
aVIf you really want to draw lessons about not being mean to people who commit blasphemy, by god, isn\u2019t my case much stronger than Eich\u2019s?
p15101
aVI highlighted the parts I assume you will be outraged by.
p15102
aVBecause, you know, we seem to think alike and I am just helpful like that. 
p15103
aVSo, let me get this straight.
p15104
aVBecause making it harder for people to hurt each other won't stop people from hurting each other, we should continue to make it easy for people to hurt each other?
p15105
aVEven if we can see how making it harder for people to hurt each other has reduced the homicide rate elsewhere?
p15106
aVI really can't tell if your post is a Poe or not.
p15107
aVWow, it's like a magic incantation, a cop blocker, so to speak.
p15108
aVAlthough, it may be that the only ones we see are the ones where they let people go.
p15109
aVwtf is wrong with tattoos?
p15110
aVIgnorant bitch, judge people on their actions not their appearance. 
p15111
aVIgnorant bitch indeed!
p15112
aV! 
p15113
aVTattoo's and parking funny.
p15114
aVThat's a strangling right there!
p15115
aVSucks when "we the people" speak out against totalitarianism doesn't it?\u000a
p15116
aVTraffic light cams aren't totalitarianism.
p15117
aVThe problem with them, particularly when operated for profit, is that they don't allow the same loose enforcement that Americans have come to expect with traffic laws.
p15118
aVSo they are unpopular.
p15119
aVThe democracy angle is really secondary.
p15120
aVI absolutely agree that the plebiscite should be respected but courts are not supposed to be legislatures so the question is not what *should* the state constitution say but what it actually does. 
p15121
aVThe problem with them is that they increase the accident rate at the intersections at which they are installed.
p15122
aVI was unaware of this though the data I found from NJ doesn't seem conclusive.
p15123
aVIs there more?
p15124
aVMissourian here.
p15125
aVThis debate has been going on for awhile.
p15126
aVMy town installed red light cameras a few years ago and then was ordered to deactivate them for legal reasons (can't remember if it conflicted with local/state/federal laws).
p15127
aVIt will be interesting to see how this plays out since it's in the St Louis area.
p15128
aVPretty disgusting...
p15129
aVHope you got a fuckin lawyer!
p15130
aVThis shit needs to stop!
p15131
aVI can't find the video, what part of the page is it on?
p15132
aVOne incident does not a whole make.\u000a\u000a
p15133
aVOne incident is enough.
p15134
aVNope, not to blanket a whole it isn't.
p15135
aVIf you did something "vile" in your business, would it taint all of the people in your business?
p15136
aVNo, so it goes with police.
p15137
aVGrow up.
p15138
aVYour condescending statement did that.
p15139
aVI gave you a proportional response, but I see it went right over your head.
p15140
aVNext time you want to play a man's game at least put your daddy's shoes on.
p15141
aV.... His daddy's a Copper
p15142
aVOk, so how many then?
p15143
aVHow many times will they have to violate your rights before you say something? 
p15144
aVROFL!
p15145
aVTypical response.
p15146
aVI don't have to say how many, you do.
p15147
aVYou posted the "vile" post, not me.
p15148
aVNot all police officers are vile ...
p15149
aVIf you believe that, I feel so, so sorry for you. \u000a
p15150
aVI didn't say all officers are vile, I asked how many times will you let someone violate your rights before you say something.
p15151
aVI'm trying to have a serious conversation with you, it would be a lot easier if you got off your high horse. 
p15152
aVIt makes a HOLE.
p15153
aVIf the cop can't legally do the things he did in this video, then what is the point of even having DUI checkpoints?
p15154
aVWhat is so bad about opening your window and telling a cop your age?
p15155
aVCop needs to do his job and not waste time and tax payer money on stupid questions.
p15156
aVHe should have started with "did you drink today sir?
p15157
aV"\u000a\u000aNope.
p15158
aVHe went straight to waving his dick around.
p15159
aVBut he got caught with his dick in his hand on camera.
p15160
aVCan't have that shit going on anymore.
p15161
aVBetter response : pass your license and registration and insurance card through the very narrow window opening. 
p15162
aVThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of sobriety checkpoints in Michigan v. Sitz, even though the law generally forbids law enforcement officers from stopping drivers unless there is a suspicion that the drivers have violated the law.
p15163
aVThis guy is a sociopath.
p15164
aVHis credo that any criticism of any cop is an unwarranted criticism of all cops and that no one who gets police protection should ever speak against anyone on the force is terrifying.
p15165
aVHe IS what's wrong with law enforcement.
p15166
aVFree Kiriakou!
p15167
aVBridge-gate.
p15168
aVEbola-gate.
p15169
aVWhat next?
p15170
aVWow.
p15171
aVThat would be a huge landfill.
p15172
aVSo if I got this right, Rand is quoted saying that new media can help outstanding teachers reach more students but the article writer then schools him by pointing out thatreal life problem solving cant (apparently) be teached trough new media..
p15173
aVThis sub never seizes to suprise me
p15174
aVWell you certainly highlighted the problem in American education.
p15175
aVExcellent comment.
p15176
aVI hate to say it but I agree with Rand Paul on this one.
p15177
aVI don't think that there are many drawbacks to implementing many aspects of the Khan Academy approach.
p15178
aVAutomated lectures leaving the teacher free to work individual students, nobody is going to convince me that the traditional method will perform better.
p15179
aVSure, but if you think that is going to make some huge difference, it won't.
p15180
aVI gotta disagree with you on this one.
p15181
aVIt seems to me that often students get hung up on one aspect of a subject that they are learning that prevents learning the next one.
p15182
aVBeing able to get their questions asked should help a lot, I certainly remember teachers never having any time for this.
p15183
aVAs I said, probably no downside to this, but needs research to prove it, but the idea that this is going to make some huge change is silly.
p15184
aVIt's a lack of schooling that affects most libertarians...
p15185
aVWhat a analytical and educated comment!
p15186
aVWhat an analytical....etc...
p15187
aVSpelling: when u got nothing else!
p15188
aVTell me why circlejerk in an empty sub, whats the point
p15189
aVIt made my point quite well, don't you think? 
p15190
aVIs impartiality not cool anymore or something.. man I feel old
p15191
aVPretty sure people had opinions back in the day.
p15192
aVSome students are naturally born smarter than their piers (and teachers).
p15193
aVThis bureaucratic academia we see today is a dinosaur left over from the days of the industrial revolution where we needed to quickly make populations literate.
p15194
aVToday, IF you make it through a Ivy league university.
p15195
aVYou may be \u000arecruited for an alphabet soup agency, that's about it.
p15196
aVTo learn is to perceive reality on a day to day basis, reality is part physical and part imagined so everybody has a different perception of the fundamental truth.
p15197
aVTeachers are not aloud to teach any of this because it is a "Libertarian fantasy".\u000a
p15198
aVThe highest correlation of student success if the circumstances of their birth.
p15199
aVThat has been demonstrated time and time.
p15200
aVIt even made Morgan Freeman's "Through the Wormhole.
p15201
aV"  Born poor, the odds are you stay poor. 
p15202
aVExactly, The man with the worlds highest recorded IQ.. Is a bouncer at a bar
p15203
aVReagan polling so high is not unexpected but certainly shows his post-presidency sainthood.
p15204
aVHe was considered an intellectual lightweight, an actor for chrissakes, and a demented one at that by the end of his second term.
p15205
aVThis doesn't seem different than a popularity contest.
p15206
aVIf you disagree with someone, you aren't likely to find their decisions to be intelligent.
p15207
aVPartially, but not completely.
p15208
aVIt's unlikely, for instance, that GW Bush would come so low based only on popularity.
p15209
aVHe is actually more popular relative to several of the others.
p15210
aVAnd if you look at the partisan differences, Republicans are more charitable to Obama and Clinton than they would be on pure popularity. 
p15211
aVThat maps directly to the voters as well.
p15212
aVThis is a absolutely useless exercise.  
p15213
aVand they say arkansans are dumb...
p15214
aVMy minimum wage jobs are 1000x tougher than my not min wage jobs.
p15215
aVJesus, could this guy be more out of touch with reality.
p15216
aVEvery one of these assholes should be made to try and live on minimum wage for a week or two.
p15217
aVIt wouldn't take long. 
p15218
aVI never knew my Father.
p15219
aVI also survived puberty without slutting it up.
p15220
aVDear Lord, these images make me feel uncomfortable.
p15221
aVCringe so many Cringes
p15222
aVThere's an obvious sexual component to the way those fathers hold their daughters in these photos, as if they were lovers and not fathers with daughters.
p15223
aVI'd really like the photographer to speak to the question of how he arranged these portraits.
p15224
aVDid he ask the fathers to hold their daughters like this in order to obtain such creepy photos, or did the men do this on their own?  
p15225
aVEww.
p15226
aVEww is right.
p15227
aVOf course Christians are all experts on protecting virginity.
p15228
aVOh..that's not creepy at..wretch.. all.
p15229
aVCheney certainly puts a lot of effort into being a cruelly repulsive scumbag.
p15230
aV"Someone needs to tell her to take that up with her daddy Dick.
p15231
aV" Love it Heather!
p15232
aVReally?
p15233
aVThis is a satire site.
p15234
aVChris Christie is really an unconditionally repulsive maggot.
p15235
aVThis article is a satire it says so in fine print right beneath the source.
p15236
aVIn fact, Harry Reid said something very similar to this in 2008.
p15237
aVThe point of the satire is, would you be willing to call Harry Reid an unconditionally repulsive maggot too even though he's a liberal?
p15238
aV[source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/09/harry-reid-negro-comment-_n_417406.html)
p15239
aV&gt; would you be willing to call Harry Reid an unconditionally repulsive maggot too even though he's a liberal?
p15240
aVI believe I would.
p15241
aVThis seems fake.
p15242
aVThere are a couple of word for word versions of this floating around on different shady webpages, one references abc news as the source but I can't find it there.
p15243
aVIt would be news if he really said that.
p15244
aV&gt;After the incident became public\u000a\u000aWhat!
p15245
aV?
aVMakes me think, Christie seems to me to be a fat slightly greasy Italian with a dumb NJ accent. 
p15246
aVMost black people talk differently than most white people.
p15247
aVSo what?
p15248
aVWow!
p15249
aVThis guy must be racist for stating the obvious.
p15250
aVIf you want to hate Chris Christie then it should probably be because he's a fat wreck and corrupt as fuck.
p15251
aV&gt;Most black people talk differently than most white people.
p15252
aVHow people talk has nothing to do with their skin colour.
p15253
aVJust because the two can correlate does not mean they're in anyway related...
p15254
aVStereotypes exist *for a reason*.
p15255
aVWelcome to reality.
p15256
aVWell, the people belonging to the culture that created the culture that resulted in the stereotype should not negatively stereotype that culture.
p15257
aVYou are aware that the typical "black American" accent is a result of many generations of institutionalized subjugation and impoverishment, right?
p15258

aVI'm only 29 years old, but to me it seems this sort of precedent has never been taken before in US politics.

p15310
aVYou know what, I bet they do just that. 
p15311
aVIsn't that one of the many things they get paid to specifically ignore?
p15312
aVTurning their back on the mayor in a silent protest isn't out of control at all.
p15313
aVThey disagree with what he has said recently, but they are still showing up at work to do their job.
p15314
aVThey are still protecting people.
p15315
aVThey are still going into potentially dangerous places.
p15316
aVThey aren't walking off the job and refusing to do their job.
p15317
aVThey aren't sitting back as criminals take over the city.
p15318
aVThey aren't suddenly cracking down even harder on people.
p15319
aVIn fact, [NYPD cops didn't even fire on an 18-year-old who pointed a gun and pulled the trigger on them yesterday just hours after the execution.
p15320
aV](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/21/nypd-man-attempted-to-shoot-cop-but-gun-was-empty/) So I'd say they are far from out of control.

aVI would say their actions are no less professional than the mayor was when he made his comments about the protests and race.
p15322
aVI disagree with what my boss says at work sometimes, many of my coworkers do.

aVBut we don't turn our backs at the next meeting.
p15324
aVWe raise our concerns through communications via the regular hr channels and guess what, it works!
p15325
aVThese cops should have done the same.
p15326
aVBut they wanted a show.
p15327
aVIronically, cops don't think much of general citizens that give them the same treatment.
p15328
aVIn fact, some in their upper ranks feel that people protesting must be roughed up so that they shut up.
p15329
aVCops behaving that way is completely irrational and unprofessional.
p15330
aVLike 3-year old brats protesting mommy for saying no more candy.
p15331
aVLike everyone else, cops have two ears and one mouth, they should listen twice as much.
p15332
aVThey might actually learn something.
p15333
aVWhat these cops did is a dog and pony show for tv.
p15334
aVIt's just their latest expression of bullying.
p15335
aVThey did it back when wearing those stupid bands on their wrists in support of paranoid cold blooded murderer Darren Wilson, and here they are, a few instigators doing it again.
p15336
aVThey should be fired at once.
p15337
aVWe have enough gang problems on our streets, we don't need gangs in our police departments.
p15338
aVGood luck firing hundreds/thousands of union employees.
p15339
aVThe way you and I deal with issues in a small company environment is different than how unions (for better or worse) deal with things.
p15340
aVI just feel like it's tough to try to judge their reactions in all of this.
p15341
aVAs with any story, we don't know how much is completely accurate with the way the media reports any of this.
p15342
aVYou don't need to fire everyone.
p15343
aVJust the handful of instigators.
p15344
aVIt's really to the benefit of the police departments.
p15345
aVHopefully most cops don't want to make their jobs more dangerous and reciprocate the kind of treatment they expect the public gives them.
p15346
aVThe title of this submission is just childish.\u000a

aVGood comment on the differences between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to voting rights for the people of Kentucky.
p15362
aVHowever, it also seems that McConnel launched this tactic to distract Grimes as well as voters.
p15363
aVVoters should be angry at this tactic.
p15364
aVWhile Grimes needs to forcefully respond, as she has,  McConnell has in a sense set her agenda, rather than having her choose the topic of debate in the final days.
p15365
aVGiven that McConnel has done this before, there is no doubt that he had planned this for the final week.
p15366
aVHe seems to think so lowly of Kentucky voters that he has to cheat and intmidate in order to win

p15378
aVI would argue that while the Republicans are leading the charge to America's demise, they have taken the Democrats, kicking and screaming, a long way down the road with them.
p15379
aVWashington is certainly broken.
p15380
aVThat's for sure.

aVNothing new about Fox denying video evidence at all.
p15399
aVI think they figure that anyone who watches them is so interested in hearing what they want to hear that they also will deny reality and then call it a consensus.

p15422
aVThe problem is not to dismiss the idea of functional conservatism.

aVI know circlejerking around hating the koch's is all the rage around here, but there are real reasons to have a fee(now the size of which is debatable) for supplying power INTO the grid because as everyone should know the power grid is old and not built for houses to pump energy backwards.

p15455
aVThe question here to ask is "How could knowing the real numbers be bad?
p15456
aV"
aVNo that's not the question.
p15457
aVThe question is "Given the limited resources and their scope and charter is this the way they should be using those resources?
p15458
aV" If we gave them unlimited resources and tasked them with doing whatever they want then they could probably answer a lot of questions about social issues that have impact on health but nobody has given them either the resources or the charter to do so.
p15459
aVThey could also probably gather a lot of data on occupational hazards but that isn't their job either.
p15460
aVThey appear to think so.
p15461
aVAnd other forces who would undoubtedly be referred to as "vested interests" if they were trying to teach children or liked hugging trees wish laws to explicitly prevent such studies being done.

aVThe little dweeb banned me from r/politics.

p15486
aVHere's a rule.
p15487
aVIf you are one of the charter members of r/politics, who are the ones who put it on the map in the first place, no snot nosed little wannabes are allowed to ban you.
p15488
aVIn fact until you've been a redditor for at least 3 years, you are ineligible to be a moderator at r/politics.
p15489
aVI guess we spent the first 5 years here wasting our time so someone else can take credit for it.
p15490
aVNobody that was here when spez started the place has a clue of just who it was that put reddit where it is today. 
p15491
aVHe's probably the one who banned me too, but probably /u/hansjens47 reinstated me, he seems to be one of the good ones.
p15492
aVI used to be a lot more involved in /r/politics than I am now.
p15493
aVI don't like the idea of letting them have their way, but /r/altnews, /r/uspolitics, and /r/PoliticsBlacklist seem to have more of what I'm looking for.

aVI know that kind of ghettoization is what they wanted, but I don't have time to fight that fight.
p15495
aVObviously our form of government is failing us.
p15496
aVSo long as we aren't making generalizations.
p15497
aVIf you ask six different libertarians what libertarianism means they will all six probably say something along the lines of "Less government, less regulation, more decentralized power, no government monopoly on the use of force, all transactions should be voluntary.
p15498
aVForce should only be used as a response to force.
p15499
aV"\u000a\u000aWhen you ask them about where the line should be on specific policies you are likely to get six very different answers.
p15500

p15501
aVYeah, too bad Ayn Rand is so dead already.
p15502
aVRand Paul's policies on feeding her could have save us a lot of taxpayer money.
p15503
aVSimplifications and generalizations are great if you are running for office and you want to try and persuade the undecided with short, emotionally charged memes that no one has to think too deeply about.
p15504
aVThe reality of policies, legislation and the specific details therein often shatter the implications of those generalizations when examined closely.
p15505
aVThe problem is that we don't actually require this examination from the voter before they are allowed to decide who makes these decisions.
p15506
aVThe motivations for the politicians are, among other things, money and power.
p15507
aVRegardless of all other considerations these two incentives are ever-present in anyone running for office.
p15508
aVI would hazard to say that most of them, especially the newer ones, have genuine altruistic intentions.

aV&gt; None of the officers accused of assaulting Williams in that motel room on Nov. 19, 2011, were fired, according to Chris Robertson, a member of Williams&amp;#039; legal team: Officer J. Byrum, Officer J. Fogel, Officer Habersham, Officer K. Beckman and Sgt.

aVI agree.
p15549
aVI know when I was in high school it was much easier to get pot than beer.
p15550
aVSince 2000 (and arguably before), the GOP has led this country from one disaster to the next.
p15551
aVAnd yet the anti-Vaxers are clustered into the most liberal enclaves:\u000ahttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/22/vaccine-deniers-stick-together-and-now-theyre-ruining-things-for-everyone/
p15552
aV&gt; That liberals are least likely to believe in a link between vaccines and autism might be surprising given well-publicized reports about low childhood vaccination rates in wealthy, liberal enclaves in states such as California.
p15553
aVIt may be that anti-vaccination liberals are quite rare and that their existence is mostly anecdotal.
p15554
aVOr perhaps anti-vaccination liberals are widespread but are adept at masking their attitudes in surveys.
p15555
aV&gt; Although we cannot adjudicate between these possibilities, our findings do not suggest that anti-vaccination attitudes are concentrated on the left fringe.
p15556
aVInstead, anti-vaccination attitudes appear concentrated among conservatives and those who distrust government.\u000a
p15557
aVmorons are more likely to believe moronic shit
p15558
aVHopefully there will be a book by that name soon that includes this amongst the other Republican beliefs.
p15559
aVHey I have an idea.
p15560
aVYou should try to make vaccines a partisan issue by behaving like assholes so that you drive conservatives away from supporting vaccines out of a desire not to be associated with your scumbag behavior.
p15561
aVThat way, the anti-vaxxers will look more credible in comparison to you and less kids will get vaccinated.
p15562
aVAnd of course, every opportunity must be taken to insult people who disagree with you on unrelated issues.
p15563
aVAfter all, "the personal is political.
p15564
aV" Everything must be politicized.
p15565
aVLife is political.
p15566
aVDeal with it.
p15567
aV&gt; Life is political.
p15568
aVDeal with it.
p15569
aVSo you support (or at least are indifferent to) the opportunistic use of the vaccine controversy (which shouldn't be a controversy because vaccines in fact do work) to insult conservatives, even though insulting conservatives in this case may lead to less conservative people's kids getting vaccinated, which in turn may lead to an increased spread of disease?
p15570
aVIdeas have consequences.
p15571
aVHow is it an insult?
p15572
aVSeems like whenever the facts challenge the worldview of a conservative, it's taken as an insult.
p15573
aVYou'll probably take that as an insult too!
p15574
aVMaybe conservatives need to stop being so sensitive.
p15575
aV&gt; How is it an insult?
p15576
aVI know sometimes nuances drop off in text-based communication, so that could be what's happening here, but I must say that this question seems disingenuous, especially in the light of what you followed it up with.
p15577
aVI was right!
p15578

aVUp to a year of jail for *wearing a hoodie*...?

aVYou have got to be kidding me.
p15595
aVAnd we all thought going to jail for weed was ridiculous....
p15596
aVI wonder [how far](http://tightrope.cc/catalog/images/boysinthehood-bhood.gif) the ban extends...
p15597
aVLooks kind of bad if you only read the headline:\u000a\u000a&gt; the bill is intended \u201cto deter crime, making it unlawful to wear a mask, hood or covering during the commission of a crime or to intentionally conceal a person\u2019s identity in a public place.\u201d The reasoning behind the bill is to cut down the number of masked robberies and crimes.
p15598
aV&gt; There are similar laws already on the books in to other states around the country, including Florida, California, New York and Washington, DC, according to Oklahoma-based Channel 6.
p15599
aVHoodies are often not allowed at high schools and several banks including PNC and Provident.
p15600
aVCross Country Federal Savings Bank, meanwhile, bans both hoodies and sunglasses, but the prohibitions are rarely enforced.
p15601
aVWhile the article does make a valid point, the far larger issue of why poor people stay poor is that the entire political economy of capitalism and western "democracy" is unjust and forces poor people to be poor so that some can be very, very rich.

p15662
aVExactly.
p15663
aVVarious presidents have made clear and distinct deals with terrorists and kidnappers.
p15664
aVPerhaps some of the most famous deals (plural) were done by Reagan, who on 4 March 87 felt he had to issue the mangled statement of "I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.
p15665
aVMy heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true -- but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.
p15666
aV"\u000a\u000aSometimes it makes perfect, logical sense to make such a deal.
p15667
aVOther times it's foolish.
p15668
aVTo adopt a "we *never* do X, Y or Z" attitude is as stupid as the many "no tolerance" rules we see permeating our society -- it's just a mindless move to stop communication and thought.
p15669
aVAnd yet in the upcoming mid-term election, Republicans are predicted to capture the majority in *both* houses of congress.
p15670
aVWhat's wrong with this picture?

aVGerrymandering, the fact that the Dems are historically bad at turnout in midterm years, and a lot of disillusioned young people.
p15672
aVSad, but true.

p15678
aVAt the risk of "talking out of school," a group which takes him quite seriously, [the tobacco industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC2xeT2yOg), recently incurred the ire of Human Rights Watch by [taking advantage of some particularly vulnerable citizens](http://www.hrw.org/node/125316) that the government should have been protecting ;).

p15691
aVThen the company that they owe money resorts to taking legal recourse to get their repayment... and they're the bad guys.
p15692
aVThe people that consumed beyond their capacity and cannot repay their debts; they're not the bad guys?

aVIn a society where companies manipulate people to overspend and make promises about repayment terms that aren't honored?
p15694
aVYes, yes they are the bad guys.
p15695
aVThere's plenty of guilt to go around, but constructing an industry that depends on people not repaying their debts is inherently immoral.
p15696
aVPlenty of companies advertise their products and attempt to persuade people to purchase them.
p15697
aVThat doesn't mean that the purchaser isn't responsible for their purchases.

aV&gt; So Florida Republicans will get to run two full elections using maps that were declared unconstitutional.
p15786
aVAnd, when the new maps take effect in 2016, they will make only minor changes to the existing gerrymander.

aVSo now what we need is a House Special Committee to investigate why the House panel wrongly concluded that there was no wrongdoing by the administration in regards to Benghazi.
p15816
aVThey just have to keep Benghazi in the headlines.
p15817
aVOtherwise they'll have to come up with some new justification for their poo-flinging for the next two years.

aVDo I hear Obama and Clinton chortling in the background?

aVSo far, sfgate.com is the only one sourcing this story.

aVOh heck, I could have sworn before I clicked on the article that the university was ASU (Arizona State).

aVLet's see here.
p15823
aVThe CIA and the NSA lied to Congress about spying on us.
p15824
aVAll of us.
p15825
aVThen they discover it really was all of us including them.

p15841
aVYep the math checks out...

p15843
aVWhat are you babbling about?
p15844
aVNobody said all or even most.
p15845
aVWhat is wrong with your reading comprehension?
p15846
aVHe didn't even say gun owner.
p15847
aVThere are plenty of people who own guns that are not "enthusiasts".
p15848
aVYou are twisting words around, I don't know why.
p15849
aVThe comment made above is absolutely correct.
p15850
aVIts a simple, clear and accurate assessment.
p15851
aVThey are gun enthusiasts as evidenced by their little club.
p15852
aVAnd joking murder upon the top elected US office is their version of "patriotism".
p15853
aVIf she was just joking around then so was the commenter above!
p15854
aVIts not like he said ALL gun nuts are low intelligence emotionally damaged sociopaths.
p15855
aVThat placing so much emphasis on weapons of death under any guise indicates psychological difficency.
p15856
aVNobody here said gun culture, anger and right wing hatred (especially towards this President) are deeply and historically intertwined.
p15857
aVOr that these utter morons are the lowest common denominator of society and highly susceptible to the most primitive forms of propaganda.
p15858
aVWhich is exactly why they wish murder upon him because the right wing propaganda machine (which they are the prime targets of) has gone into post civil war mode of crazy... Nobody said any of that stuff.
p15859
aVWhat is your problems?
p15860
aVI like what you did there.
p15861
aVBravo sir. 
p15862
aV[deleted]
p15863
aVInteresting point.
p15864
aVIf the leader of some black only organization had publicly made this same statement about a president, how would it sound?
p15865
aVNot patriotic... Would it be funny hahah?
p15866
aVThere is also the key difference that gun enthusiasts have never been second class citizens subjected to institutional and social discrimination.
p15867
aVSo yes the generalization would have been quite different.
p15868
aV[deleted]
p15869
aVIf I'm understanding your meaning properly - would you say this Facebook post is making gun owners look bad?
p15870
aV[deleted]
p15871
aVI think she makes right wing gun issue mothers look bad yes.
p15872
aVBut I was posing the question to you.
p15873
aVBecause it has been you that is feverently insisting she is a fringe of gun enthusiasts. 
p15874
aVSo, your massive issue with me saying\u000a\u000a&gt; Gun enthusiasts, showing their true "patriotism".
p15875
aVis because you would "feels better" if I had said\u000a\u000a&gt; Some gun enthusiasts, showing their true "patriotism".
p15876
aVIs that really what gets your panties all knotted up?
p15877
aVBecause it seems a pedantic difference to normal people.
p15878
aV&gt; Now go back to spinning records.
p15879
aVYeah, that is what I do.

aVI don't get the point of this comment. 
p15886
aVI don't get the point of this comment. 
p15887
aVSaying 'Gun enthusiasts, showing their true "patriotism"' to describe the actions of one individual gun owner is akin to saying 'blacks' when referring to the actions of one specific black person.
p15888
aVWell that's rediculous, they're two radically different groups of people.
p15889
aVFirst point being no 3 year old ever said "mom look a gun enthusiast!
p15890
aV" To her social dismay. 
p15891
aVIt doesn't matter what the group is, equating all members of a group with the actions of one is always wrong and unhelpful.
p15892
aVI agree with that, generalizations make poor arguments and are incorrect to begin with.
p15893
aVBut so is equating a race to a group of people who enjoy a hobby. 
p15894

aVThere was a time when many Americans joined the Klan.
p15926
aVThen we ridiculed them as ignorant fuck-wits, until their numbers dropped to the level of insignificant.
p15927
aVI hope we can do the same thing with gun ownership.
p15928
aVShame these morons so that the next generation wants nothing to do with guns.
p15929
aVWe didn't have to outlaw the klan, as we had a more powerful tool: ridicule.
p15930
aVAnd yes, I'm rigidly opposed to Klansmen. 
p15931
aV[deleted]
p15932
aVI see socializing the facts about gun owners - that they tend to be less educated, have lower IQs, and are more racist than normal humans - as beneficial to society. 
p15933
aV[deleted]
p15934
aVHow about the Klansmen who never hurt anyone?
p15935
aVGood to know you'd proudly jump to their defense, when people shun all klansmen.
p15936
aV[deleted]
p15937
aVYour claim is that smearing an entire group of people as ignorant is wrong, as some members of that group might not be ignorant.
p15938
aVThe exact same argument could be used against shaming all klansmen.
p15939
aVAs far as which group poses a greater threat to society, clearly it's the gun owners.

aV[deleted]
p15941
aVYou know what I find offensive?
p15942
aVWhen idiots shoot at me or near me.
p15943
aVI am terribly offended when that happens.
p15944
aVThe use of ridicule or shame is a perfectly valid method of changing society for the better.
p15945
aVWhether you are trying to reduce klan membership, homophobia, scientology or gun ownership, mocking the individuals who participate in such stupidity has a proven record of success.
p15946
aVThere is a reason we shame and ostracize: it works.
p15947
aV[deleted]
p15948
aVGun owners and Scientologists, only one of these groups actually threatens my life.
p15949
aVI've been shot at once.

aVI was offended by all 4 experiences. 
p15952

p15953
aV&gt; Do you think the typical American has been shot at or witnessed any homicides?
p15954
aVNo.
p15955
aVOnly 100,000 Americans get shot in any given year.
p15956
aVJust like your typical American doesn't acquire HIV, only about 50,000 do each year.
p15957
aVAnd yet we all work to reduce HIV.
p15958
aVHmm.
p15959
aVI saw a guy get shot in front of my Apt in Harlem in the 90s.
p15960
aVIn the early 2000s, I witnessed a guy getting shot in front of my Apt in the LES.
p15961
aVA couple years laters I witnessed a girl get shot in front of a nightclub in Detroit.
p15962
aVThe night I was shot at was in Harlem.
p15963
aVThere was a cat in heat on the fire escape a few feet from my head late one hot night in August.
p15964
aVOne of my idiot neighbors couldn't take the noise, and shot at the cat.
p15965
aVThat's what idiots with guns do.
p15966
aVThey shoot at things.
p15967
aV[deleted]
p15968
aVNo I wasn't hit.
p15969
aVSo, as I pointed out, we have twice the gun problem as we do an HIV problem.
p15970
aVMy suggestion is that we shame high-risk sex, so as to discourage it.
p15971
aVSimilarly, I intend to shame gun ownership, so as to discourage it.
p15972
aVAre you confused by that?
p15973
aV[deleted]
p15974

p15978

p15979
aVI helped re-invent that business for us last year.
p15980
aVBut we don't see plan participants as clients.
p15981
aVOur clients have UBS Financial Advisors.
p15982
aV&gt; That would mean that 0.03% of population gets shot at per year\u000a\u000aI was just contemplating this.
p15983
aVGiven that the average American lives to about 79, I think that means that over 2% of Americans get shot, at some point in their lifetime.
p15984
aVAs you've pointed out though, I'm just a DJ.
p15985

aVGun-related violence is most common in poor urban areas and frequently associated with [gang violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_violence), often involving male juveniles or young adult males.
p15990
aV&gt;While increased time has been given to mass shootings in the media, the frequency of these events has declined since the 1990s.
p15991
aVHand guns figured in the [Virginia Tech massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre), [Binghamton shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binghamton_shootings), [2009 Fort Hood shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Fort_Hood_shooting), [Oikos University shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oikos_University_shooting), and [2011 Tucson shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting).

aVAssailants with multiple weapons committed the [Aurora theater shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting), and the [Columbine High School massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre).
p15993
aV&gt;In 2009, according to the [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_on_Drugs_and_Crime), 67% of all homicides in the U.S. were conducted using a firearm.
p15994
aVTwo-thirds of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. are suicides.

p16049
aVA fair point.
p16050
aVThe idea that the federal government should be limited to those functions and powers enumerated in the constitution has been a central tenant of conservative thought at least since the time of Barry Goldwater.
p16051
aVThere is nothing crazy about it.
p16052
aVTo quote Goldwater:\u000a\u000aI have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size.
p16053
aVI do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom.
p16054
aVMy aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them.
p16055
aVIt is not to inaugurate new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have failed their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden.
p16056
aVI will not attempt to discover whether legislation is "needed" before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible.

aVYou make an absurd and obscene fetish of the constitution.
p16060
aVYou are conserving nothing - these ideas are far more radical than Marxism.
p16061
aVYou can believe anything you like but don't kid yourself that you and your ilk own some correct and pure interpretation of the constitution, and that you are actual conservatives of tradition.
p16062
aVThe world has never seen the likes of today's GOP - they are beyond reason and out of step with all of humanity.
p16063
aVHumanity - with its values of common social welfare and stewardship of the planet - these are the true conservatives.
p16064
aVJefferson would weep tears os shame to see the today's GOP acting in the name of the constitution - and that is simply a fact. 
p16065
aVAs soon as I see the word "ilk", I know an adhom can't be far behind.
p16066
aVAnd you didn't disappoint.
p16067
aVWell, shit.
p16068
aVWhy not just secede?
p16069
aVThis almost reads like that.
p16070
aVOh.Wait.
p16071
aVFederal dollars!
p16072
aV"You can just drop those at the border station over there, son.
p16073
aVWe don't allow your kind in our pristine Christian State.
p16074
aV" \u000a\u000aThe more of this kind of thing I read; the more I begin to see the positive side of secession.
p16075
aVGive 'em the south.
p16076
aVI don't think we'll miss them much. 
p16077
aVeat the rich
p16078
aVIn a perfect world people would realize that how we spend our dollars  is in fact a way of either maintaining a way of life that is unsustainable or is the beginning of better world.
p16079
aVIf we were able to score every dollar spent as to whether it takes us closer too, or further away, from the kind of world we need to live in, we could change everything!
p16080
aVThe plutocrats are running the show because we empower them by purchasing their products in spite of their attitudes toward us!
p16081
aVThis is a breach of Human Rights.
p16082
aVThis Police 'man' should be in Prison
p16083
aVIt doesn't help that you have "onion" in your username.
p16084
aVSaw the video, and it looks real enough.
p16085
aVStill, with a username like that, it makes one consider whether or not we're being trolled.
p16086
aVThe behavior in the video is absolutely inexcusable.
p16087
aVIt's real, I saw the news story on TV this weekend.
p16088
aVAfter arresting the woman the police wouldn't let her family see her for a week.
p16089
aVWhy don't you look at your own name?
p16090
aVshoe?
p16091
aVWhat is that?
p16092
aVSomething with a hole that you step into and step on (how weird is that?).
p16093
aVShoes are unnatural!
p16094
aVOnions, man they are real.
p16095
aVSurely you must already be aware of The Onion.
p16096
aVhttp://www.theonion.com/\u000a\u000aCommon, now.
p16097
aVThere's no faux news organization called The Shoe.
p16098
aVPeople are used to "onion" being synonymous with "bad made up news".
p16099
aVSure, and regulated markets killed socialism...
p16100
aVI would actually say capitalism killed free markets. 
p16101
aVSome might say the free markets and capitalism are the same thing.
p16102
aVThen again, the same some are probably the stupid some in the crowds.
p16103
aV&gt; The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation.
p16104
aVThe Republicans' "new math": 50 = 100,000
p16105
aV&gt;Republicans begin shift to the MORE Right !
p16106
aVI didn't think there was anymore right to the right of them left anymore.
p16107
aVPretty soon they'll be so far out in right field that they'll be out of the ballpark entirely.
p16108
aVGood riddance to them!
p16109
aVSadly the whole thing is an exercise of redefining what makes for ballpark dimensions and faux-normalizing the presumptive "center".   
p16110
aVUp-voted for your valor
p16111
aVThe fools, cantor lost because people despise washington and the way money controls it.
p16112
aVHis opponent ran as an anti insider and anti waste.
p16113
aVIt wasn't because he was more right or more left it was because he was seen as someone not in bed with the washington establishment and lobbyists.
p16114
aVits fine though please go more right and shrink your base further. 
p16115
aVIt's not that liberal and conservative are so similar, it's that mainstream Democrats are not liberal.
p16116
aV"The left" is unrepresented on the main stage.
p16117
aVMainstream Democrats?
p16118
aVMost democrats in the US are not as liberal as they think they are. 
p16119
aVRight.
p16120
aVBy "mainstream" I basically meant "most.
p16121
aV"
aVexcept there is no left.
p16122
aVTo be honest US foreign policy has very little voice or influence .
p16123
aVI say this with great respect for President Obama.
p16124
aVThe only thing that keeps 3 rd world countries in contact with US is hope of Aid.
p16125
aVThe random killing by drones and Netanyahu's influence over the middle east makes a nonsense of justice and lowers the respect others have for the once mighty USA
p16126
aVIt is simply Greed that spurs them on.
p16127
aVBlind Greed.
p16128
aVGood on you girls
p16129
aVWe talking about this American hero Oliver North?
p16130
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLD2JyFAlE
p16131
aVSame guy, the convicted felon pardoned by Ronnie.
p16132
aVApparently John Boehner is not an economist.
p16133
aVUh oh... You know there's an important election coming up when Republicans suddenly remember that jobs matter to the peasants.
p16134
aVOh, alternet.
p16135
aVFox is stupid and bat shit insane, but alternet, that's balanced news media.
p16136
aVWhat next?
p16137
aVMoveon.org and thinkprogress?
p16138
aVWar on science?
p16139
aVYou mean liberal's crippling fear of GMO?
p16140
aVFox news doesn't even apologize for blatant false reporting of "News".
p16141
aVThey even go so far as to skew graphs to make them look more in their favour.
p16142
aVSometimes their percentages don't even add up.
p16143
aVFox News is nothing buy a far right propaganda machine. 
p16144
aVNo conservative's belief that everything is in God's hands and things will just work out by his special magic.
p16145
aVNow *that's* fucking stupid.
p16146
aV[And even the Pope isn't making that argument.
p16147
aV](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/05/21/3440075/pope-francis-if-we-destroy-creation-creation-will-destroy-us)
p16148
aVPertinent to this discussion how?
p16149
aVLeft as an exercise for the reader Johny GMO.
p16150
aVSeems disingenuous that for the nearly two hundred year period being discussed gun ownership was a given and so there wasn't anything *to discuss* until it wasn't.
p16151
aVI'm happy to let you in on what confuses a lot of contemporary American gun nuts.
p16152
aVThe founding fathers likely assumed that Americans had an individual right to possess firearms.
p16153
aVHowever, that doesn't mean that that was what the 2nd Amendment was about.
p16154
aVThey could believe that you have a right to possess firearms, and simultaneously acknowledge that it wasn't what was asserted in the 2nd Amendment.
p16155
aVIn other words, they may very well have assumed that White Adult American Males had a right to own 18th Century firearms.
p16156
aVHowever, even if true, that in no way is evidence that they were instituting via the 2nd amendment that all future Americans get to own any firearms that they wish to own.
p16157
aVPeople can enjoy firearms without being nuts.
p16158
aVWhatever the founding fathers intended doesn't really matter as long as people are free to own firearms - which they are.
p16159
aVHave a nice day!
p16160
aV&gt; People can enjoy firearms\u000a\u000aYep, people can enjoy being racists too.
p16161
aVLikely, we will never outlaw people from being racists or gun nuts, or for that matter, dumb shits.
p16162
aVHowever, we are also allowed to laugh at these ignorant, racist, dumb-shit gun nuts.
p16163
aVAnd this is what I tend to do on reddit: laugh at all the ignorant racist gun nuts here.
p16164
aVWant some cheese to go with your whine?
p16165
aVWhine?
p16166
aVLike I said, you are free to be a racist ignorant dumb-shit if you so choose.
p16167
aVI have no problem with that.
p16168
aVBe true to yourself.
p16169
aVBut realize I'll also be true to myself by laughing at your ignorance. 
p16170
aVTissue?
p16171
aVYes, you are a failure in comparison to someone like me.
p16172
aVI wish you all the tissues you can collect.
p16173
aVThat's it let it all out.
p16174
aVYou'll learn how to deal with your emotions when you grow up but for now it's OK to wallow in your misery.
p16175
aVOh, I'm rolling into 50, child.
p16176
aVHowever, I doubt there is an age I'll reach where I'll suddenly support gun violence.
p16177
aVOr racism.
p16178
aVOr stupidity. 
p16179
aVWell some people take longer to grow up than others.
p16180
aVGun ownership does not mean racism, low intelligence, or support for gun violence.
p16181
aVAs far as my being 'a failure compared to you' I'll let that statement speak for itself.
p16182
aV[Who owns guns?
p16183
aV](http://www.halfsigma.com/2007/04/dumb_white_peop.html)\u000a\u000a[Who opposes gun control?
p16184
aV](http://www.salon.com/2013/11/05/study_white_racism_linked_with_opposition_to_gun_control_partner/)\u000a\u000aFact: [Gun ownership rates are inversely correlated with educational attainment.
p16185
aV](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/in-gun-ownership-statistics-partisan-divide-is-sharp/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0) There is a reason for that.
p16186
aVThat's great but you are still an emotional infant.
p16187
aVI'm feel sorry for you Mr. 50.
p16188
aVBecause I understand that racism correlates with opposition to gun control?
p16189
aVThat hardly seems a reason to feel sorry for me.
p16190
aVOr is it because I'm better educated and more accomplished than most gun owners?
p16191
aVYou seem to think quite highly of yourself.
p16192
aVWould care to share what it is that you have accomplished that makes you feel this way?
p16193
aVEdit: yeah that's kind of what I thought
p16194
aVI'm not anonymous.
p16195
aVFeel free to look up my award-winning creative direction, 100K+ selling albums, or patent winning inventions.
p16196
aVHowever, simply acquiring a college degree made me more successful than your average racist gun nut. 
p16197
aVYou must have skipped the class on statistics where they discussed variance.
p16198
aVAre you an American?
p16199
aVAbsolutely. 
p16200
aVThe founding fathers had no problems with privately owned cannons and issued Letters of Marque so that privateers could use their privately owned warships to strike at British vessels.
p16201
aVThe author is ignorant and anyone who holds similar views is either also ignorant or similarly deluded.
p16202
aVMichael Waldman is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.
p16203
aVYou have difficulty discerning "ignorance".
p16204
aVConsidering that he didn't cite any sources and his statements are belied by simple historical facts like [Letters of Marque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_marque) his presidency has little to do with his ignorance on this subject matter.
p16205
aVHe's making unsound statements that aren't based on fact.
p16206
aVIf you support them, you are not only similarly ignorant, but now that I've shown you that they are wrong, either stubbornly wrongheaded or blinded by confirmation bias.
p16207
aVEither way, you are still wrong ;)
p16208
aVWhat, exactly, do you find unfactual in the story?
p16209
aVIts history of NRA, court cases cited, et cetera, are all facts.
p16210
aVIts listings of political figures and their actions are all facts.
p16211
aVWhat is it, then, that find in the article to be invalid? 
p16212
aVHe lies through omission, whether deliberately or through ignorance you can be the judge.
p16213
aVClearly he hasn't read the relevant Federalist Papers, nor does he support his interpretation of the contradictions regarding quotes from Henry, or Jefferson.
p16214
aVHe doesn't seem to grasp the nature of the militia, or that the they are composed of the organized and unorganized militia groups.
p16215
aVHis article is merely a multipage collection of rants, half truths, lies and hand wringing.
p16216
aVHe cannot reconcile the facts that diametrically oppose his opinions, so he ignores them outright (see cannons, letters of marque, etc)\u000a\u000aMost disconcerting though is this collectivist interpretation of the 2nd amendment, which requires a tortuous amount of argumentation to have the reader believe that "the people" (found to be individuals in each and every other right in which they are mentioned) somehow mean the collective in the 2nd.
p16217
aVNice try.
p16218
aVBy all means though, read through the relevant Federalist papers.
p16219
aVCheck out [29](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) which contains\u000a\u000a&gt; What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government is impossible to be foreseen...The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution... Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.
p16220
aVand [46](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp) which includes\u000a\u000a&gt; Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.
p16221
aVNotwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
p16222
aVAnd it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes.
p16223
aVBut were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.
p16224
aVHell, here's a more complete breakdown - http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndpur.html\u000a\u000aIn short, the author is either ignorant or lying.
p16225
aVYou choose.
p16226
aVI have to agree with the comment below - you're not responding to the question, which was a request that you point out what was incorrect in the article.
p16227
aVYou stated the author made "unsound statements that aren't based on fact" - I asked you to stipulate - you haven't.
p16228
aVIn addition - you cite 29, which is not relevant.
p16229
aVThat pertained to national military vs. independent state military that had no national/federal oversight.
p16230
aVBack to the point - the story pertains to changes in formats/leadership of the NRA; history of judicial review to application of the 2nd (including change in NRA's interpretation of the 2nd); and misquotes and chopped quotes now used.
p16231
aVYou said the article was false on those (and/or other) statements - please defend your argument. \u000a\u000a
p16232
aV/u/mitchwells is a well known anti-gun troll so it's really not worth addressing him (see his other posts in this topic for context), but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
p16233
aVFirst, your objection with 29 is wrong simply because it provides context.
p16234
aVIt's ready evidence that the founders intended for private ownership of arms to not only be widespread but to be militarily effective.
p16235
aVThe Dick Act later clarifies the types of militia into organized &amp; unorganized but does not obviate the needs of the average citizen to be able to defend themselves.
p16236
aVSecond, with regards to the article in question; it's very title is a lie designed to frame the debate in dishonest terms.
p16237
aV&gt; How the NRA Rewrote the Second Amendment\u000aThe Founders never intended to create an unregulated individual right to a gun.
p16238
aVToday, millions believe they did.
p16239
aVThat's bullshit.
p16240
aVThe author hasn't provided any citations supporting his argument.
p16241
aVHe pretends that the Federalist papers don't exist to give context, or that journals or letters or other contemporary evidence is similarly missing.
p16242
aVHe buttresses this with selected factoids following the Miller decision and Burger's famous quote, but leaves out anything contradicting this.
p16243
aVFurthermore, he expects us to believe that "the people" mentioned in the 2nd are somehow different from "the people" mentioned elsewhere (and found to be individuals) which is hilariously wrong as well.
p16244
aVIn whole, his argument is entirely bankrupt.
p16245
aVNobody (other than an insignificant &amp; irrelevant minority) is campaigning for entirely unregulated firearms ownership, especially not the NRA.  
p16246
aV&gt; Nobody (other than an insignificant &amp; irrelevant minority) is campaigning for entirely unregulated firearms ownership, especially not the NRA.
p16247
aVActually, the NRA *is* campaigning for unregulated ownership - no type of background checks at all; promotes unlicensed sales; no registration\u000a - check out its lobby group site: http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/issues/background-checks.aspx \u000a\u000aAnd the claims in the article about the misquotes/chopped quotes are valid - and the claims about significant change in NRA stances, first in the '70s, then again in 21st century, are documented, too.
p16248
aVAs for the documentation - this isn't Politico's normal daily online edition.
p16249
aVThis is Politico magazine; magazine's don't print links/can't embed them in printed text, for the websites of magazines, text is just copied/pasted, so you won't find cites in these editions.
p16250
aVThe law cases referred to are well-known already, and can be quickly validated by anyone who wants to verify. 
p16251
aV&gt; Actually, the NRA is campaigning for unregulated ownership\u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]*\u000a\u000a&gt;no type of background checks at all; \u000a\u000aThat's a lie.
p16252
aV&gt; promotes unlicensed sales; \u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]*\u000a\u000a&gt; no registration\u000a\u000aWell *duh* - registration is nothing other than a revenue generation scheme.
p16253
aVIt's absolutely useless as a crime prevention tool and easily &amp; entirely circumvented.
p16254
aV&gt; check out its lobby group site: http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/issues/background-checks.aspx\u000a\u000aSo?
p16255
aVThat doesn't support your argument.
p16256
aV&gt; And the claims in the article about the misquotes/chopped quotes are valid - \u000a\u000aSure, and they are examples of lying through omission, as I already stated, and have nothing to do with the entirely false premise, as I already stated.
p16257
aV&gt; and the claims about significant change in NRA stances, first in the '70s, then again in 21st century, are documented, too.
p16258
aVSo?
p16259
aVDoesn't make his claim any less bankrupt.
p16260
aV&gt; As for the documentation - this isn't Politico's normal daily online edition.
p16261
aVThis is Politico magazine; magazine's don't print links/can't embed them in printed text, for the websites of magazines, text is just copied/pasted, so you won't find cites in these editions.
p16262
aVThe law cases referred to are well-known already, and can be quickly validated by anyone who wants to verify.
p16263
aVBy all means, verify them.
p16264
aVI notice you haven't done so.
p16265
aVNor have you supported his already demonstrably incorrect false premise that the NRA has rewritten the 2nd Amendment.
p16266
aVEDIT: Btw this article is basically promotion for his upcoming book, just released, that's a hitpiece on the the individual rights interpretation of the 2nd amendment.
p16267
aVExpect more rebuttals as the book is circulated.
p16268
aVNo lies on my part- and all your "Citation needed" requests were already met prior to, and with the link to NRA's lobby group - and on that particular page does the NRA challenge all needs for any type of regulation, including background check and licensing of sales (despite fact that 90% of the population supports background check and licensing of sales).
p16269
aV&gt;Sure, and they are examples of lying through omission, as I already stated\u000a\u000aOkay - so now you're admitting that the NRA and others using the chopped quotes/misquotes are lying?
p16270
aVGood!
p16271
aV&gt;By all means, verify them.
p16272
aVI have.
p16273
aVAs I noted, anyone can, and very quickly.
p16274
aVAll of the statements in this that you originally challenged are, in fact, legitimate and well-founded.
p16275
aVAnd that leads me to yet again ask you, as others on this thread have, to cite your claims that the statements are wrong (or "lies," as you say).
p16276
aVThat's how it works in court, debates, etc.
p16277
aV- if someone introduces a statement, and you challenge its validity, it is then YOUR responsibility to validate your challenge.
p16278
aVYou haven't.
p16279
aVNot once.
p16280
aVYou offered a couple of links from Federalist Papers, one of which is of no relevance to your argument (a chopped interpretation) and the second of which is irrelevant due to its date - that was before the Constitution was ratified and enacted, so how is it, then, of any relevance to the amendments of the Constitution?
p16281
aVAnd your third link is to a funky group that does a bad job of trying to hide its operator - even its host (Network Solutions, which normally allows as anon as possible registration) cites it for trying to clamp that info (your guncite is registered under the same name/address/phone of another site called Hip Hop Honeys - looks like an escort service).
p16282
aVAnd if you think all such registration weapons in the private market is invalid, then why aren't you bitching about automobiles?
p16283
aVDriver's licenses?
p16284
aVThat sure as hell affects a lot more people, right?
p16285
aVShoot - you need driving instruction, written test/driving test/eyesight test, must have insurance, must carry the license whenever operating a vehicle, must pay penalty for violating any rules about auto use and operation, must have vehicle inspected (in almost all states) for safety, the car must meet minimum safety standards, and you can lose the license if you violate enough terms.
p16286
aVSince that affects so many more people, why aren't you going after that?
p16287
aVALSO: Since all that beeg gubbamint junk on driving went into \u000aeffect about half a century ago, we now have over 4 times the number of vehicles on the road -- and less than half the number of fatal accidents. 
p16288
aV&gt; No lies on my part- and all your "Citation needed" requests were already met prior to, and with the link to NRA's lobby group - and on that particular page does the NRA challenge all needs for any type of regulation, including background check and licensing of sales (despite fact that 90% of the population supports background check and licensing of sales).
p16289
aVActually you haven't met any of the requests.
p16290
aVYou made a couple unsubstantiated statements about things and didn't provide a whit of evidence supporting them.
p16291
aVNote, a link to the NRA-ILA isn't evidence.
p16292
aVSo, let's reiterate:\u000a\u000a&gt; Actually, the NRA is campaigning for unregulated ownership\u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* as this is not true.
p16293
aV&gt;no type of background checks at all; \u000a\u000aThat's a lie.
p16294
aVStraight up, no quibbling there - this is a lie.
p16295
aV&gt; promotes unlicensed sales; \u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* because you really need to support this.
p16296
aVFeel free to answer those.
p16297
aVBe *specific* in your claims because thus far you've made a couple very large lies.
p16298
aV&gt; Okay - so now you're admitting that the NRA and others using the chopped quotes/misquotes are lying?
p16299
aVGood!
p16300
aVWrong.
p16301
aVI'm saying the author in the OP is lying.
p16302
aV&gt; I have.
p16303
aVAs I noted, anyone can, and very quickly.
p16304
aVAll of the statements in this that you originally challenged are, in fact, legitimate and well-founded.
p16305
aVAnd that leads me to yet again ask you, as others on this thread have, to cite your claims that the statements are wrong (or "lies," as you say).
p16306
aVThat's how it works in court, debates, etc.
p16307
aV- if someone introduces a statement, and you challenge its validity, it is then YOUR responsibility to validate your challenge.
p16308
aVYou haven't.
p16309
aVNot once.
p16310
aVNope.
p16311
aVYou've made a couple "nuh uh" responses and haven't provided anything actually backing up your statements.
p16312
aVOn the other hand, I provided direct citations from the Federalist papers and specifically mentioned Miller, all of which add up to my position that **the author has lied, repeatedly**.
p16313
aV&gt; You offered a couple of links from Federalist Papers, one of which is of no relevance to your argument (a chopped interpretation) \u000a\u000aWrong.
p16314
aVAgain it specifically mentions a need for the common citizen to be armed.
p16315
aV&gt; and the second of which is irrelevant due to its date - that was before the Constitution was ratified and enacted, so how is it, then, of any relevance to the amendments of the Constitution?
p16316
aVOh that's rich.
p16317
aVSo the original source material prior to the Constitution being written, detailing their *reasoning* behind why they'd write things the way they did, is not considered relevant?
p16318
aVThat's hilarious.
p16319
aV&gt; And your third link is to a funky group that does a bad job of trying to hide its operator - even its host (Network Solutions, which normally allows as anon as possible registration) cites it for trying to clamp that info (your guncite is registered under the same name/address/phone of another site called Hip Hop Honeys - looks like an escort service).
p16320
aVOh, the ad hominem argument.
p16321
aVHow droll.
p16322
aV&gt; And if you think all such registration weapons in the private market is invalid, then why aren't you bitching about automobiles?
p16323
aVDriver's licenses?
p16324
aVYou do understand that automobile registration is for revenue, right?
p16325
aVNot as a crime fighting measure, which is what the typical anti-gun proponent states is the purpose for gun registration.
p16326
aVFurthermore, you do understand that automobiles are fairly large items that are not easily concealed, and when they operate on a road they have plates which are clearly visible from distance?
p16327
aVJust checking because it seems that you've lost your cognitive abilities thus far.
p16328
aV&gt;  That sure as hell affects a lot more people, right?
p16329
aVShoot - you need driving instruction, written test/driving test/eyesight test, must have insurance, must carry the license whenever operating a vehicle, must pay penalty for violating any rules about auto use and operation, must have vehicle inspected (in almost all states) for safety, the car must meet minimum safety standards, and you can lose the license if you violate enough terms.
p16330
aVSince that affects so many more people, why aren't you going after that?
p16331
aVHaving fun with that strawman?
p16332
aVOr do I need to illustrate just how lax automobile regulations are compared to firearms?
p16333
aV&gt; Since all that beeg gubbamint junk on driving went into effect about half a century ago, we now have over 4 times the number of vehicles on the road -- and less than half the number of fatal accidents.
p16334
aVOk?
p16335
aVWe had [606 fatal firearms accidents in 2010](http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html) in a nation with 300 million guns.
p16336
aVThere were 35,332 motor vehicle fatalities the same year, with far fewer cars.
p16337
aVFirearms accidents aren't a problem.
p16338
aVYou really suck at being a troll.
p16339
aVYou keep trying to spin this in circles, but you have not once provided any basis of your claims (that the article of this thread has invalid claims).
p16340
aVYou keep saying it, but keep diverting away to multiple tangents when asked for source.
p16341
aVNever addressing the same subject you yourself introduced.
p16342
aVYou keep saying the "author has lied repeatedly" ... **but have not provided any source that validates your claim.
p16343
aV**  You've provided ones to other statements  you made (and which are either invalid or of questionable source itself), but not one to your claims that the arguments in the article - i.e., NRA history, change of NRA stances and actions, legal history of relevance, etc.
p16344
aV- are invalid.
p16345
aVYou've had quite a loooong time to do so, too -- but haven't.
p16346
aVYou're also using tactics from "Trolling for Dummies" - when facing a fact you can't counter, you just try to insult the facts.
p16347
aVYou not only cite questionable source, but are now using ones that don't validate your claims at all (you probably listed the general link hoping I and others don't know how to use CDC's data base - you were wrong).
p16348
aVAs for that, the total firearms deaths in 2010 was 31,672 - a number that's been growing annually since 1981.
p16349
aVThe claim of 300 million guns is crap - only NRA says that, and it's already been criticized for a shitty attempt by NRA to count every weapon that may or may not have been in the US since 1776.
p16350
aVThe number is actually 170 million (scientific estimate limited by the lack of registration requirements today), a majority of which are shotguns and rifles, and that includes collectors/antiques that never get used except for display.
p16351
aVOld/defunct/dismantled/confiscated/destroyed doesn't count.
p16352
aVAs for ownership, 34.4% of US households.
p16353
aVNow for autos/licenses: 32,367 vehicle fatalities in 2013 - lowest in 62 years (consecutive decline), too.
p16354
aV254.4 million private-use vehicles used by 95 percent of all US households. 
p16355
aV&gt; You really suck at being a troll.
p16356
aVYou keep trying to spin this in circles, but you have not once provided any basis of your claims (that the article of this thread has invalid claims).
p16357
aVYou keep saying it, but keep diverting away to multiple tangents when asked for source.
p16358
aVNever addressing the same subject you yourself introduced.
p16359
aVOh, ok.  By all means, show some proof of the claims you made, specifically:\u000a\u000a&gt; Actually, the NRA is campaigning for unregulated ownership\u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* as this is not true.
p16360
aV&gt;no type of background checks at all; \u000a\u000aThat's a lie.
p16361
aVStraight up, no quibbling there - this is a lie.
p16362
aV&gt; promotes unlicensed sales; \u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* because you really need to support this.
p16363
aV&gt; You keep saying the "author has lied repeatedly" ... but have not provided any source that validates your claim.
p16364
aVStrange, the very title of the article in question is that the NRA has rewritten the 2nd amendment.
p16365
aVHe's shown no support for this claim; in fact I can't remember a constitutional convention in my lifetime.
p16366
aVPerhaps you could show where the NRA has rewritten the 2nd Amendment?
p16367
aVOh, you *can't*?
p16368
aVWell don't worry, we have a term for that.
p16369
aVIt's called *lying*\u000a\u000a&gt; You're also using tactics from "Trolling for Dummies" - when facing a fact you can't counter, you just try to insult the facts.
p16370
aVWhat facts, precious?
p16371
aV&gt; You not only cite questionable source, but are now using ones that don't validate your claims at all (you probably listed the general link hoping I and others don't know how to use CDC's data base - you were wrong).
p16372
aVBy all means, contradict the CDC data showing 606 unintentional firearms deaths.
p16373
aVShow your work.
p16374
aV&gt; As for that, the total firearms deaths in 2010 was 31,672 - a number that's been growing annually since 1981.
p16375
aVOh so we're arriving to the next lie used by anti-gun trolls - shifting the goalposts.
p16376
aVOriginally you made the comparison of car accident fatalities halving, to which I showed data illustrating that firearms accidents are much lower.
p16377
aVNow you are equivocating and trying to include *homicides* and *suicides* which is unsurprising because deception is the favorite tool of anti-gun trolls.
p16378
aV&gt;  The claim of 300 million guns is crap - only NRA says that, and it's already been criticized for a shitty attempt by NRA to count every weapon that may or may not have been in the US since 1776.
p16379
aVThe number is actually 170 million (scientific estimate limited by the lack of registration requirements today), a majority of which are shotguns and rifles, and that includes collectors/antiques that never get used except for display.
p16380
aVYeah, I'm going to need a citation for your 170 million estimate.
p16381
aVThe [BATFE](http://www.atf.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf-files/052013-firearms-commerce-in-the-us-annual-update.pdf) reports otherwise, and even [Mayors Against Illegal Guns, antigun astroturf group that they are, agrees with this number.
p16382
aV](http://www.gunfaq.org/2013/03/how-many-guns-in-the-united-states/), but by all means, feel free to quibble.
p16383
aV&gt; As for ownership, 34.4% of US households.
p16384
aVIrrelevant.
p16385
aV&gt; Now for autos/licenses: 32,367 vehicle fatalities in 2013 - lowest in 62 years (consecutive decline), too.
p16386
aV254.4 million private-use vehicles used by 95 percent of all US households.
p16387
aVRight, we've already established that automobiles are much more dangerous than guns with regards to accidental deaths, to the tune of 50x incidents.  
p16388
aVYour first source lists "International Trade Commission" to be its source for the number - and "international" means....**worldwide.
p16389
aV** The others credit their sources to be either NRA or CRS (which itself cites NRA as source for most estimates).
p16390
aVYour claims of 606 firearm deaths is invalid --- your own source (which I know how to use, fumbduck) proves it.
p16391
aVNow you're trying to move all this into the same cycling loop, and by reintroducing the same bullshit - which has already been answered, despite your circle of denials - and still avoiding having to answer the original request for validating source.
p16392
aVNobody else is reading this thread, so the opportunity for you to sink your bullshit into someone stupid enough to believe it is long gone.
p16393
aVSo please stop wasting your time and just go fuck yourself (which medical studies say is the only opportunity for most handgun-loving enthusiasts - who are also dominantly racist and uneducated - to get laid). 
p16394
aV&gt; Your first source lists "International Trade Commission" to be its source for the number - and "international" means....worldwide.
p16395
aVThe others credit their sources to be either NRA or CRS (which itself cites NRA as source for most estimates).
p16396
aVYou do know that the BATFE is a government agency that regulates guns manufactured and imported into this country, right?
p16397
aVIf you want to dispute their numbers, source it up.
p16398
aV&gt; Your claims of 606 firearm deaths is invalid --- your own source (which I know how to use, fumbduck) proves it.
p16399
aVNope.
p16400
aVYou cited accidental deaths.
p16401
aVI provided impartial government numbers on accidental deaths.
p16402
aVIf you want to shift the goalposts that doesn't invalidate the point, that just makes you dishonest.
p16403
aV&gt; Now you're trying to move all this into the same cycling loop, and by reintroducing the same bullshit - which has already been answered, despite your circle of denials - and still avoiding having to answer the original request for validating source.
p16404
aVI notice you still haven't shown proof of your claims about unregulated  ownership, sales promotion, etc.
p16405
aVYour handwaving is pretty amusing, but you haven't supported your claim.
p16406
aVHow about you man up and just admit you were lying?
p16407
aVYou can't quote a single sentence from the article that is counter-factual, can you?
p16408
aVI'm interested in hearing your argument against something claimed in the article, rather than your argument against something you are pretending to be stated in the article.
p16409
aVYou do you realize Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning are not  journalists don't you?
p16410
aVA source law is designed to protect journalists.

aVA source law is not designed to protect them.

aVyeah, Russia's treatment of gays has sort of taken a backseat to their invasion of Ukraine.
p16413
aVI wonder why?
p16414
aVPretty high on the disinformation there...
p16415
aVBut if you have an axe to grind...?
p16416
aVI note that ThinkProgress has neglected to mention that the FedEx facility was a gun-free zone across the street from a police substation and the shooter blasted an unarmed guard on his way in. 
p16417
aVDownvoted.

aVIts literally the only place in town thats a gun free zone.

aVBefore the vote, the bill&amp;#039;s sponsor, Sen. Josh McKoon, joined the hearing to similarly argue against making an exception for nondiscrimination protections.
p16434
aV&gt; He claimed that the bill&amp;#039;s religious liberty protections would no longer be &amp;quot;Uniform&amp;quot; across the state, adding, &amp;quot;That amendment would completely undercut the purpose of the bill.&amp;quot; Rep.

aVbeing gay, straight, bi, anything else is a matter of who you *want* to have sex with, not who you *do* have sex with.
p16445
aVmany people have sex with people they do not want to have sex with.
p16446
aVYes, that would be Mr. Savage's point to Dr. Carson.
p16447
aVFor me being straight ( as I understand straight in the traditional sense being to be in search of an opposite gendered mate ) is based on my entire being being in a state of preparation for two things, mating for life with the mother of my child children , my entire being is and has been in a state of preparing for being a parent , I played as a youth to prepare me for how children behave , if society deems me an unfit parent because of how I played I will never have children but that is not up to me, that is up to the community I live in and work in.
p16448
aVI am a free lance head of house hold until I become a head of house hold and modern politics makes it difficult for me to be such a thing because as I understand it the work of Dan Savage and his peers were to bring society to this point where someone like me, would experience , well , my life.
p16449
aVI have not down voted you for your comment, but I think you are conflating multiple traits:\u000a\u000a* a desire to raise children is not merely a heterosexual trait -- gay partners have surrogate babies and adopt.
p16450
aVstraight partners choose not to have offspring.
p16451
aVNeither case makes them less gay or more straight.
p16452
aV* being of one gender (male?, but you never stated) does not make you the de facto *head of household* -- If anything, when you enter into a partnership with another person (of whatever gender), you give up your *ruling* status because you have another adult whose opinions are equally valid.
p16453
aVYou are never on a life track to be head of a household; that's something you work out with a willing partner.
p16454
aVIn either case, you don't experience less of your life, adopting or partnering simply changes your life.
p16455
aVThat is not what I took away from the point Dan Savage was trying to make.
p16456
aVedit: on re-reading, I think I mistook your example of playing as a child as a metaphor for learning how to be straight, but if you really meant that it was your best qualification for raising children, I'll point out that it's just crazy.
p16457
aVYou played as a child because you were a child; not as a qualification for raising them.
p16458
aVA woman is qualified to raise a boy child even if she never was a boy.
p16459
aVA parent should override their child's desire to eat every meal at Chuck E. Cheese even if that is the only place he or she wanted to eat as a kid.
p16460
aVA parent who was abused or molested by a parent is not disqualified from raising their own kids in the future.
p16461
aVI fail to see how community standards (good or bad) of your own childhood might disqualify you from raising your own kids.
p16462
aVAs either a metaphorical example or a separate point, it fails.
p16463
aVI would require training to engage in this conversation with you. 
p16464
aVYou've changed the wording in your original post so my first response has changed context.
p16465
aVIt'd help to reply to my comments rather than to change your original wording since that changes the meaning of what i've said.
p16466
aVBut I'll respond to additional points your new wording makes:\u000a\u000a* being straight is "to be in search of an opposite gendered mate" -- having an opposite gendered mate is ancillary to being gay or straight.
p16467
aVWe don't consider Freddie Mercury, Kenny Everett, Anthony Perkins, Oscar Wilde, or many others to be straight even though they were married to women and some produced offspring.
p16468
aV* being straight is in preparation for "mating for life with the mother of my [children]" -- How is that preparation?
p16469
aVYou do not become less straight if you divorce, have an affair with an opposite gendered partner, re-marry after death of your partner, fail to have kids, or become infertile.
p16470
aVThe length of your relationship, the number of children you raise, and where you like to grind your genitals are not necessarily related.
p16471
aV* "my entire being is and has been in a state of preparing for being a parent" -- Being a parent does not define the purpose or meaning of your life.
p16472
aVWe consider Beethoven, Isaac Newton, Ada Lovelace, the Wright Brothers, Jean Paul Sartre, and many others (to have been straight and) and to have made significant contributions through their lives despite not marrying or having offspring.
p16473
aVThere's also a fellow named Jesus who isn't noted for his parental contributions, but some would argue he led a meaningful life (whether or not he had kids).
p16474
aVYou don't have to be a parent, or even a *good* parent, to have meaning in your life.
p16475
aV* "I played as a youth to prepare me for how children behave" -- No, you played as a youth because you were a youth.
p16476
aVChildren we know to be biologically infertile do not get put into the workforce, nor are children with terminal illnesses executed.
p16477
aVAnd certainly your experiences as a child don't raise or disqualify you from parenthood.
p16478
aVBeating your Cabbage Patch doll does not mean you will beat your child.
p16479
aVYou are not disqualified from raising girls because you were a boy.
p16480
aVAll-A, honor-roll, students have not learned how to motivate or raise a child (on the honor-roll or not).
p16481
aVYes, your childhood may offer you some insight, but there's a huge amount to learn about child behavior that you'd be wise to learn as an adult.
p16482
aV* "If society deems me an unfit parent because of how I played, I will never have children [even if I want to since that is] up to the community I live and work in" -- No.
p16483
aVThere are really bad kids, juvenile delinquents, and criminals who grow up and have children of their own (some of them even turn out to be good folk).
p16484
aVSociety may shame or shun them, but no one needs to get a license to procreate.
p16485
aVThe sins of the fathers are not sins of the son.
p16486
aVYes, you can have offspring taken away from you, but that's due to your actions as an adult and are meant to protect the child; you could still inseminate and produce many off-spring.
p16487
aV* [Whether a single adult male or married, my life experience is defined as] "head of household" -- That's an old-fashioned misogynistic tradition.
p16488
aVToday, we recognize a wife as an equal partner in a marriage.
p16489
aVFor example, you *can* be convicted of raping your wife even if *you* wanted to have sex.
p16490
aVThat hasn't always been the case, but it's the way of doing things today.
p16491
aVSome partners do defer to all decisions being made by one person, but that's still an arrangement the two partners have come to agree on.
p16492
aVA workable marriage is about the adults having a way of working things out; it doesn't come just due to fiat of gender.
p16493
aVI am not heavily invested in this movement and because of such I do not know which notes to meet you at in corresponding with you about this topic on your , what appears to be , advanced level.
p16494
aVWonder if Hillary is going to boycott Netanyahu during his visit to Congress ?
p16495
aVSeems to be a generational thing.
p16496
aVWe've slowly become more distanced, opposed and polarized.
p16497
aVWouldn't it be nice to have a legitimate third option to represent those that aren't pulled to either side, to plug that democratic deficit? 
p16498
aVHow do you do that in a political system that effectively requires a two-party system?
p16499
aVUntil we can fix our electoral system to allow third parties to be viable I don't see what choice we have.
p16500
aVI don't want to live through another 2000.
p16501
aVopen and blatant racism should be swift end to a politicians career.
p16502
aVthere is no reason to tolerate this garbage when there are many who can fill this guy's shoes the very next day
p16503
aVYeah but then you'd have to apply it both ways. 
p16504
aVIm dont see a downside to that
p16505
aVIts good to see a politician working hard to improve the lives if those he serves. 
p16506
aVYeah, that's not gonna fly. 
p16507
aVWhy not.
p16508
aVKinda worked for Obama. 
p16509
aVObama was talking about persecuting those who did it.
p16510
aVHe was very vocal on the wisdom of the decisions to use force -- one aye, one nay.
p16511
aVNow, granted, I didn't read the article.
p16512
aVBut I'm willing to bet Jeb isn't talking about prosecutions; he's talking about the decisions to use force.
p16513
aVAnd if he wants to be president, he's gonna have to do better than that.  \u000a\u000a

aVSteinem's quote:\u000a\u000a&gt;When we think of violence against women, for instance, we understandably think mainly of other countries, where the degree of violence is much higher," Steinem is quoted as saying in an Oct. 1, 2014, Associated Press story.
p16576
aV"But what is also true is that if you added up all the women who have been murdered by their husbands or boyfriends since 9/11, and then you add up all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq, more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends.
p16577
aVOK, I know this is being nitpicky, and the point of Steinem's quote stands, but... notice how a general term for 'women' is used while she's specific about Americans having been killed by the 9/11 attacks and ensuring wars.
p16578
aVDoes she mean more women worldwide or more American women by partners than Americans from the attacks and war?
p16579
aVIt's ambiguous.

aVBe very careful allowing the executive branch to take power from the legislative, all those powers will still be there when another Republican is president.. Obama might be a great guy that would never misuse his power (imo, he is not) but these actions set a precedent for the Executive Branch.
p16618
aVFor Example, Obama unilaterally delaying the employer mandate means that the next President can do the same.

p16811
aVThey were holding her down.
p16812
aVShe was immobile, and *then* they let the dog come over and eat part of her leg.
p16813
aVYes, eat.
p16814
aVThe article has a picture of her wounds.
p16815
aVThere's a huge hole, about three inches in diameter, where the dog obviously tore a big chunk of muscle out of her leg, as well as several huge tears that the doctors already closed with stitches.
p16816
aVThere's so much fucked up here.
p16817
aVI can't even imagine any context in which three officers would need a dog to restrain an unarmed woman, let alone in the situation described here when she's ALREADY RESTRAINED AND ON THE FUCKING GROUND.

aVThis guy ran for governor of CT about 10 years ago, and lost. 
p16822
aVAbandon Democrats for Republicans or meaningless losing?
p16823
aVAgree that it's been a while since I've seen Democrat-supported  *sustainable* planning.
p16824
aVIt does seem to me that Republican representatives span a spectrum of political opinion that once covered both Democrats and Republicans--with core American values.
p16825
aVBut so often now, the values promoted by Democratic representatives do not represent thought rooted in the Constitution or thought that clearly demonstrates traditional American core values.  
p16826
aVWhat spectrum of political opinion are you talking about?
p16827
aVWhat are "American core values"?
p16828
aVwho defines that?
p16829
aV&gt;spectrum of political opinion\u000a\u000aDifferent representatives have different platforms/views on issues such as immigration, economic debt, and even health care.
p16830
aVI know this is obvious, but it is less obvious that the views represented by some republicans pretty much fit old school democrat positions.
p16831
aV&gt;American core values\u000a\u000aThe US Constitution and amendments express the core values.
p16832
aVThings like freedom of speech, the press and religion.
p16833
aVThings like a humanitarian view of individuals ('individual soul liberty') which also links to the phrase 'inalienable rights' and 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'.
p16834
aVLiberty is elastic so that 'my liberty ends where yours begins' and liberty recognizes responsibility as well as freedom.
p16835
aVI don't see Republicans having different opinions on immigration, MOST DEFINITELY not on healthcare.
p16836
aVIf you could provide examples I'd be much obliged.
p16837
aVRepublicans and Democrats have changed ideologies so many times throughout American history that the labels are almost meaningless.
p16838
aVI think your view on Republicans representing American core values is also relative.
p16839
aVFor instance, the sponsoring of anti-gay marriage legislation is completely against what Republicans (small government) and what our constitution are about.
p16840
aVBoth parties suck.
p16841
aVThis country has too many people to neatly fit into red or blue. 
p16842
aVThere are republicans supporting as well as opposing the Affordable Care Act.
p16843
aVThere are differing perspectives on immigration reform as well.
p16844
aVSome decrying amnesty altogether because of illegal status and others who take a softer approach to those immigrants who love American ideals but could not access US residency legally.
p16845
aVCheck out Jeb Bush.
p16846
aVI think the republican party is upholding the values that used to be esteemed by both Democrats and Republicans.
p16847
aVCurrent Democrat applications seem prone to 'over correct' in areas of social justice (extends into fiscal programs) to the point of limiting liberties.
p16848
aVSuch positions do not uphold American core values that protect these liberties\u000a\u000aAnti-gay marriage legislation is actually protecting the conscience' of people who define marriage the way it has always been defined.
p16849
aVThere is no reason for homosexuals to impose their interpretation on the standard.
p16850
aVJust as they use new words to identify their partners (SO rather than husband or wife), they could represent their household unit in other terms, they do not need to hijack the term *marriage.
p16851
aV*\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p16852
aVWell, when marriage guarantees you certain rights and gives you benefits, I'd call denying same sex partners the same rights and benefits outright discrimination.
p16853
aVThat is more than enough reason for same sex partners to want to marry each other.
p16854
aVHaving the government "protect the conscience" haha, I can't even finish that sentence, that is a ludicrous justification to enact a federal law to protect the religious definition of marriage.
p16855
aVA more Republican course of action would be to eliminate all tax credits married couples receive or enact legislation to give same sex couples the same benefits.
p16856
aVHiding behind the "sanctity of marriage", an practice that ends in divorce about 40% of the time in the US, is cowardly drivel.
p16857
aVYou can't just say there are Republicans that support this or that without providing facts\u000a\u000aHere are a couple of articles about democrats against the ACA:\u000a\u000ahttp://swampland.time.com/2013/11/15/meet-the-39-democrats-who-voted-with-the-house-on-obamacare/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-who-voted-against-obamacare-keep-your-plan-2013-11\u000a\u000aLikewise, there are some Dems against amnesty.
p16858
aVWhat values are the Republicans holding up, specifically?
p16859
aVIt seems to me that they are overly concerned with reproductive rights (limiting the liberties of women who are the ones who have to carry babies) continuing the war on drugs (limiting the liberty of what the individual chooses  to partake in, as opposed to the legal drugs of alcohol and tobacco) and NEITHER party has done a damn thing to get Americans working good jobs with good wages.
p16860
aVI just find that your hypothesis is flawed, or atleast seriously tinted with the glasses of your chosen ideology. \u000a\u000a
p16861
aVUsing the term 'civil union' could be considered.
p16862
aVBut even then you'd have to think about the difference between marriage and such a civil union:  one reason marriage is protected because of it's potential reproduction and intended place as a societal stabilizer.
p16863
aV(Unfortunately as you noted, marriages are declining in quality and quantity--I think we need to have self-reflection about why this is occurring, and recognize that *defining* marriage differently is *not* the answer, though valuing and protecting it may contribute to strengthening society).
p16864
aVOf course this would move the debate into a different ethical arena centered around whether or not government should tacitly support harmful practices--homosexual relationships proliferate STD's and HIV and result in higher instances of cancer.
p16865
aVAnd I think that debate is more appropriate then trying to suddenly force the word 'marriage' into a definition that is an outright affront to biblical texts (religious stances).
p16866
aVProtecting the conscience is the same thing as protecting freedom of religion, speech and press.
p16867
aVIt is allowing a person to believe what they believe without fear of repercussions.
p16868
aVRecent cases show an increasing tendency to force people to accept things they find objectionable.
p16869
aVUsing the word 'marriage' to define other civil unions which are not marriage is an example.
p16870
aVAnother area would be the reproductive rights which you brought up--there is a hierarchy of law in effect here:  should a women's right to her body be more important than saving a life?
p16871
aVThat is the question.
p16872
aVI think there are gray areas in cases of rape (where the woman did not chose the action that impregnated her) as well as when a mother's life is in danger.
p16873
aVBut generally, we should value saving lives more than keeping people comfortable.
p16874
aVDrugs is another thing.
p16875
aVI think the debate here should focus on resulting behaviors rather than on ingesting.
p16876
aVThis is where the rights of an individual can absolutely destroy another person/family.
p16877
aVPunishing those who behave irresponsibly is more the role of government than regulating individual liberty; however some drugs are obviously only destructive for recreational use.
p16878
aVYou can google the phrase 'Republicans support Obamacare' and get all sorts of discussion.
p16879
aVDiscussion on that has been rather prominent.
p16880
aVI haven't said that *all* Democrats oppose American values; I said there is a trend for limiting core American values through applications that affect those protections.
p16881
aVAnd I said that some republicans today are filling the gap in ideology.
p16882
aVThink about historical democrats and compare their platforms to the parties today--it's obvious.
p16883
aVMost of them would run as Republican.
p16884
aVI agree that creating jobs and developing a competent and committed  workforce are crucial to a strong, stable economy.
p16885
aVI have supported candidates who emphasize this.  
p16886
aV&gt; Using the term 'civil union' could be considered.
p16887
aVBut even then you'd have to think about the difference between marriage and such a civil union: one reason marriage is protected because of it's potential reproduction and intended place as a societal stabilizer.
p16888
aV(Unfortunately as you noted, marriages are declining in quality and quantity--I think we need to have self-reflection about why this is occurring, and recognize that defining marriage differently is not the answer, though valuing and protecting it may contribute to strengthening society).
p16889
aVYes but.....having children is not a prerequisite of to receiving these benefits.
p16890
aVSo what is the difference between a childless marriage and a same sex one?
p16891
aVThen again, encouraging same sex couples to adopt might help the vast amount of children without a family.
p16892
aVNo one is defining marriage differently, same sex couples simply want the same protections and benefits that straight ones do.
p16893
aVYou can't say that civil unions carry all the same benefits as marriage.
p16894
aVThats discrimination.
p16895
aVHomosexual relationships are not inferior to heterosexual relationships.
p16896
aVHomosexuality itself does not proliferate STDs.
p16897
aVIn fact, I think how Society has relegated them as inferior to male-female relationships is a large part why they are more prone to STDs.
p16898
aVGay men typically have more partners than straight ones.
p16899
aVIf we "normalized" homosexuality, its possible you'd see less promiscuity and more longer term relationships, and the rates of STDs between homo and heterosexuality will even out.
p16900
aVAs to it being an affront to religious texts...well, that is their problem.
p16901
aVNo one is forcing them to marry gay people, but gay people should enjoy the same protections with their long term partners that straight people do.
p16902
aVreproductive rights are about more than keeping people comfortable.
p16903
aVHaving a kid is a huge responsibility and a gigantic cost.
p16904
aVIt takes both sexes to make the unwise choice before they are prepared yet only one has to really bear the burden.
p16905
aVPerhaps if we had a better system of adoption that encouraged gay partners to adopt I'd be with you.
p16906
aVAlso, are you willing to pay out of your own pocket in taxes to support all these unwanted kids if we eliminated abortion?
p16907
aVAs to drugs.
p16908
aVAlcohol and cigarettes are legal, and they are among the worst poisons a person can ingest.
p16909
aVThey wreck your health and in the case of alcohol, can make a person aggressive and irrational.
p16910
aVEvery drug should enjoy the same status as alcohol and cigarettes.
p16911
aV&gt; I haven't said that all Democrats oppose American values; I said there is a trend for limiting core American values through applications that affect those protections.
p16912
aVAnd I said that some republicans today are filling the gap in ideology.
p16913
aVThink about historical democrats and compare their platforms to the parties today--it's obvious.
p16914
aVMost of them would run as Republican.
p16915
aVYes, and historical republicans would run as democrats.
p16916
aVThe parties have switched ideologies, thats just history.
p16917
aVI think what you define as core American values is extremely subjective and varies between Americans.
p16918
aVI am not less American than you, yet obviously we have a difference in opinion on what are our values, I don't think mine are lesser than yours. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p16919
aV&gt;If we "normalized" homosexuality, its possible you'd see less promiscuity and more longer term relationships, and the rates of STDs between homo and heterosexuality will even out.
p16920
aV...because heterosexual relationships are following this trend?
p16921
aVYou pointed out how marriage has become less popular as divorce rates have risen.
p16922
aVHow does your argument here follow that?
p16923
aVI think you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.
p16924
aVWe need a good long look at the societal decline of marriage.
p16925
aVCouples already receive some benefits based on number of dependents.
p16926
aV&gt;They wreck your health and in the case of alcohol, can make a person aggressive and irrational.
p16927
aVEvery drug should enjoy the same status as alcohol and cigarettes.
p16928
aVAnd you are again choosing a position that employs massive cognitive dissonance.
p16929
aVSales on alcohol and cigarettes are regulated and taxed, but you are claiming that decriminalizing drug use will lighten government interference.
p16930
aVYou also need to consider the necessary increase in spending within a criminal justice system with a glut of cases for irresponsible behavior from drug use--vehicular manslaughter domestic abuse...etc.
p16931
aVSo there is a place for determining valuable prohibitive legislation.
p16932
aVCore American values are tied to the documents that established the distinctive US style of government.
p16933
aVThe Constitution and amendments define that.
p16934
aVSure, we interpret; but that interpretation takes into account those defining values and *protects* them, not subjecting them to frivolous and casual applications that undermine them.
p16935
aV&gt; because heterosexual relationships are following this trend?
p16936
aVYou pointed out how marriage has become less popular as divorce rates have risen.
p16937
aVHow does your argument here follow that?
p16938
aVI think you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.
p16939
aVNo, im just pointing out that your main objection- STDs- is a product of a behavior conditioned by society, not any biological difference in same sex activitiy.
p16940
aV&gt; Sales on alcohol and cigarettes are regulated and taxed, but you are claiming that decriminalizing drug use will lighten government interference.
p16941
aVYou also need to consider the necessary increase in spending within a criminal justice system with a glut of cases for irresponsible behavior from drug use--vehicular manslaughter domestic abuse...etc.
p16942
aVSo there is a place for determining valuable prohibitive legislation.
p16943
aVWhat prevents us from regulating and taxing drug use?I've claimed no such thing, I am claiming that instead of making criminals we should make tax payers.
p16944
aVAs to your second point....lord almighty, do you not think that there is a glut of cases for possession and distribution of drugs?
p16945
aVArent we ALREADY spending money on vehicular manslaughter and domestic abuse stemming from drug abuse??
p16946
aVThere is no place for prohibitive legislation, you'd think we would've learned that when we tried alcohol prohibition, a massive failure.
p16947
aVUnless your argument is that a governments role is to police the morals of its citizens, something no conservative should be for.
p16948
aV&gt; Core American values are tied to the documents that established the distinctive US style of government.
p16949
aVThe Constitution and amendments define that.
p16950
aVSure, we interpret; but that interpretation takes into account those defining values and protects them, not subjecting them to frivolous and casual applications that undermine them.
p16951
aVWell, Id argue that interpretation is very subjective.
p16952
aVIm sure we have two very different interpretations of the freedom of religion clause for instance.
p16953
aVAnd Im sure the founding fathers would take both of our interpretations of the constitution and its amendments as ridiculous. 
p16954
aVThe negative health side effects of homosexuality are clear.
p16955
aVYou can deny them, but you are denying facts.
p16956
aV&gt;instead of making criminals we should make tax payers.
p16957
aVThe black market.
p16958
aVand tax evasion.
p16959
aVThere's no way around it.
p16960
aVLegislating taxes will not take care of root problems.
p16961
aVYes, there is already a backlog of cases.
p16962
aVBut more would not help.
p16963
aVThat's why we need to get to the root of the problem rather than slapping a band-aid law on it.
p16964
aVAs for 'policing morals,' you can't get around the necessary protective nature of government.
p16965
aVPunishing domestic abuse and vehicular manslaughter are examples of this.
p16966
aVIt is wrong to abuse the people in your care, even if you are unaware that you are doing it because you have made a choice to use drugs that limit your judgement.
p16967
aVIt is still wrong and it always will be.
p16968
aVThis is a moral.
p16969
aVIrresponsible behavior that takes a life is another serious moral issue.
p16970
aVThis goes along with the discussion on abortion.
p16971
aVThe debate can not be over the criminality of killing a human, it is over when human life actually begins.
p16972
aVThis is why there is very little support for late term abortion.
p16973
aVAnd why killing babies at birth is still tried as murder.
p16974
aVIt *is.
p16975
aV*  People who choose to have sex, know that pregnancy is a very plausible result.
p16976
aVIf they are making irresponsible choices, why should the law become complicit?
p16977
aVAll laws incorporate a degree of morality.
p16978
aVThink about it, even the fact that we punish those who break the laws shows that.
p16979
aVCivilization breaks down when the people who comprise it don't work together and hypocrisy and deceit go hand in hand with criminality.
p16980
aVYour interpretation of the freedom of religion clause does not take into account the entire text.
p16981
aVIt is constructed merely as a loophole seeking enterprise, and does not uphold the integrity of the document. 
p16982
aVThe "Progressive" left respects "progressive values" and not tradition.
p16983
aVFor all the talk about the "Moral Majority" putting so many of the religious voters in the Republican column in the 80s, many stuck with the Democrats.
p16984
aVAt this point the Democrats' base is openly hostile towards traditional religion.
p16985
aVPolitics is becoming their religion. 
p16986
aVWhat is "traditional religion"?
p16987
aVIt seems progressives are more supportive of freedom of ALL religions versus christian hegemony. 
p16988
aVThey tend to dislike Christianity and Judaism.
p16989
aVThey are more likely to be militantly opposed to free expression of religion than other groups. 
p16990
aVThat is utter poppycock since the grand majority of them ARE christian and jewish.
p16991
aVCan you provide examples of them being militantly opposed to free expression of religion? 
p16992
aVNot everyone who identifies as Christian or Jewish actually practices their religion or have strong/educated belief in God.
p16993
aVThose who attend service weekly, which helps to cull the herd a little bit, are far more likely to be conservatives.
p16994
aVYou must not have gone to college, at least any time recently.
p16995
aVThe college campus is the best example of this sort of thing.
p16996
aVKids in high schools schools are told they cannot pray, not even on their own time in a private group.
p16997
aVIf you don't see what is happening you aren't paying attention.
p16998
aV"A secular political party, in the traditional sense, has been neutral as between religions--at least insofar as the represent different versions of traditional morality.
p16999
aVA secularist political party is neutral as between religion and irreligion: It believes that moral issues \u2018have no place in politics,\u2019 and replaces such issues with the idea of \u2018fair and equal\u2019 treatment of all \u2018lifestyles,\u2019 all beliefs about what is permissible and what is not.
p17000
aVThis is accompanied by a powerful animus against the dominant traditional beliefs, especially religious beliefs.
p17001
aVThe American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association faithfully represent this ideology, which explains why they are comfortable banning the Ten Commandments from the classroom but don\u2019t mind feminist or homosexual art.
p17002
aV"\u000a\u000aOn the grassroots level, the *hatred* of those who stick to their Jewish or Christian moral values is off the charts.

p17008
aVIf you don't see what is happening you aren't paying attention.
p17009
aVSo what, you decide who is and isn't religious?
p17010
aVYou poll people at every church in the country about their political ideologies?
p17011
aVLord almighty, the amount of baseless assumptions you are making are incredible.
p17012
aVAs to college campuses and high schools...plainly put, religion has no place there.
p17013
aVLet the kids pray on their own time, why should they be allotted SCHOOL time for their worship?
p17014
aVThat makes no sense!
p17015
aVWho are you quoting in your second paragraph?
p17016
aVMoral issues do have a place in politics but morals as dictated by one particular religion do not.
p17017
aVI am comfortable with having the ten commandments anywhere, so long as they are next to say, Hindu and Buddhist texts, or do you think those are inferior?
p17018
aV&gt; On the grassroots level, the hatred of those who stick to their Jewish or Christian moral values is off the charts.
p17019
aVRidiculous assertion, you can't get elected to public office without being religious.
p17020
aVHow many self proclaimed atheists in Congress?
p17021
aV&gt;So what, you decide who is and isn't religious?
p17022
aVYou poll people at every church in the country about their political ideologies?
p17023
aVLord almighty, the amount of baseless assumptions you are making are incredible.
p17024
aVIf you say that you are a "Catholic" but do not attend mass, do not study the bible, etc then you are different type of "Catholic" than one who does attend mass, who does study the bible, and who is involved in the church/community.
p17025
aVBoth count just as much as "Catholic" in most polls.
p17026
aVBreaking things down by frequency of church attendance brings you closer to how *truly* religious people think.

aV&gt;As to college campuses and high schools...plainly put, religion has no place there.
p17028
aVLet the kids pray on their own time, why should they be allotted SCHOOL time for their worship?
p17029
aVThat makes no sense!
p17030
aVSo you're against allowing kids to pray on their own time with their friends while on school grounds.
p17031
aVThat's not only an unconstitutional view, it supports what I was saying above.
p17032
aVThat progressives despise religion.
p17033
aVA goal of progressives, fascists, Nazis, communists and other left-wing political movements has been to weaken and ultimately destroy the church so that it can be replaced by the State.
p17034
aV&gt;Who are you quoting in your second paragraph?
p17035
aVMoral issues do have a place in politics but morals as dictated by one particular religion do not.
p17036
aVI am comfortable with having the ten commandments anywhere, so long as they are next to say, Hindu and Buddhist texts, or do you think those are inferior?
p17037
aVIt was Irving Kristol.
p17038
aVIf 90% of the population identifies as Christian, 5% Jewish, and 5% atheist why should all religions be on display?
p17039
aVIt would be idiotic to put every religion imaginable on display.
p17040
aVMoral issues are matters of faith.
p17041
aVAlso, the first amendment protects the right to freely exercise one's religion.
p17042
aV&gt; Ridiculous assertion, you can't get elected to public office without being religious.
p17043
aVHow many self proclaimed atheists in Congress?
p17044
aVLOL.
p17045
aVYou're out of touch, my friend.
p17046
aVOn the left's grassroots level traditional religion is widely mocked.
p17047
aVMany nonbelievers in politics, mostly on the left, have sought out churches just to be able to say they're good Christians.
p17048
aVBarack Obama is one of them.
p17049
aVHe sought out a church after the people he was trying to work with told him that he should in order to be taken seriously.
p17050
aVThe church he chose to attend was an incredibly extreme one.
p17051
aVAnd perhaps ironically, many of the same "treat all religions" equal types were attacking Romney for his religious affiliation just 4 years after they were defending Obama's affiliation with a church that was, by any reasonable person's view, FAR worse than Romney's. 
p17052
aV&gt; If you say that you are a "Catholic" but do not attend mass, do not study the bible, etc then you are different type of "Catholic" than one who does attend mass, who does study the bible, and who is involved in the church/community.
p17053
aVBoth count just as much as "Catholic" in most polls.
p17054
aVBreaking things down by frequency of church attendance brings you closer to how truly religious people think.
p17055
aVWhat you are saying here is that you know for a fact how often Democratic reps go to church and how much they study the bible?
p17056
aVWhere are you getting these facts?
p17057
aVThen you go on to describe what you consider a "better" Christian.
p17058
aVIsn't that for God to decide?
p17059
aVCareful friend, you are getting dangerously close to pride, and thats a deadly sin, you know.
p17060
aV&gt; So you're against allowing kids to pray on their own time with their friends while on school grounds.
p17061
aVThat's not only an unconstitutional view, it supports what I was saying above.
p17062
aVThat progressives despise religion.
p17063
aVNo, I personally dislike religion because I think its hogwash but most college campuses go above and beyond in sponsoring religious, specifically christian groups on their campuses.
p17064
aVMost have a ministry and several student organizations devoted to Christians.
p17065
aVPlease point to the part of the constitution that says you should be allotted special time to pray in school?
p17066
aVThe supreme court has already maintained that religious freedom is not absolute, and while beliefs may be respected, *practices are not* So I think you are dead wrong on that end, friend.
p17067
aV&gt; A goal of progressives, fascists, Nazis, communists and other left-wing political movements has been to weaken and ultimately destroy the church so that it can be replaced by the State.
p17068
aVHAH!
p17069
aVWell, neat trick lumping progressives with Nazi's.
p17070
aVMy only answer to that is that the Church has no place in the State.
p17071
aVIf you want to talk about the Constitution and the amendments, its pretty clear that our forefathers intended for religious beliefs to be personal.
p17072
aV&gt; If 90% of the population identifies as Christian, 5% Jewish, and 5% atheist why should all religions be on display?
p17073
aVIt would be idiotic to put every religion imaginable on display.
p17074
aVWhy?
p17075
aVBecause yours is right and everyone elses is wrong?
p17076
aVI, as a minority, have no right to express my religion?
p17077
aV&gt; LOL.
p17078
aVYou're out of touch, my friend.
p17079
aVOn the left's grassroots level traditional religion is widely mocked.
p17080
aVGive us proof.
p17081
aVHow do you know so much about the lefts grassroots?
p17082
aVYou don't associate with them, so I assume all you know about them is what you read and watch on your biased news source of choice.
p17083
aV&gt;Many nonbelievers in politics, mostly on the left, have sought out churches just to be able to say they're good Christians\u000a\u000aAgain, I demand proof, not just words.
p17084
aVYour assumptions about Obama are just that.
p17085
aVRomney is a mormon, do you believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles?
p17086
aVIf not, how is it worse?
p17087
aVIsn't it...just the same?
p17088
aV&gt;What you are saying here is that you know for a fact how often Democratic reps go to church and how much they study the bible?
p17089
aVWhere are you getting these facts?
p17090
aVThen you go on to describe what you consider a "better" Christian.
p17091
aVIsn't that for God to decide?
p17092
aVCareful friend, you are getting dangerously close to pride, and thats a deadly sin, you know.
p17093
aVAll that I was doing there was explaining the obvious difference between a self-professed religious person who doesn't study or practice it at all, and one who does.
p17094
aV&gt;No, I personally dislike religion because I think its hogwash but most college campuses go above and beyond in sponsoring religious, specifically christian groups on their campuses.
p17095
aVThey go out of their way to sponsor and raise awareness for their pet movements, which get more attention.
p17096
aVChristian groups are sort of like the College Republicans in that they are just, well, disliked.
p17097
aV&gt;Most have a ministry and several student organizations devoted to Christians.
p17098
aVThey also have other religious clubs if there is enough interest.
p17099
aV&gt;Please point to the part of the constitution that says you should be allotted special time to pray in school?
p17100
aVIt's in the same part of the constitution that says you should be allowed to eat lunch while in school.
p17101
aVI was not talking about special time for praying at school.
p17102
aVI said ON THEIR OWN TIME.
p17103
aVOf course, there's nothing wrong with learning about religion or praying at school either.
p17104
aV&gt;HAH!
p17105
aVWell, neat trick lumping progressives with Nazi's.
p17106
aVThey drink from the same ideological well... \u000a\u000a&gt;My only answer to that is that the Church has no place in the State.
p17107
aVIndividuals do not lose their constitutionally protected rights whenever they enter a government entity.
p17108
aV&gt;If you want to talk about the Constitution and the amendments, its pretty clear that our forefathers intended for religious beliefs to be personal.
p17109
aVThe founding fathers did not intend for religious beliefs to be left in the home, never to be so much as espoused in the public sphere.
p17110
aVQuite the contrary.
p17111
aVThey viewed religion as an essential element of a free and moral society.
p17112
aV&gt;Why?
p17113
aVBecause yours is right and everyone elses is wrong?
p17114
aVI, as a minority, have no right to express my religion?
p17115
aVPutting a Christmas tree and a Menorah in the town green doesn't establish a religion.
p17116
aVIt celebrates the religious values of the majority, but it doesn't establish a religion.
p17117
aVMuslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Wiccans, Scientologists, etc are all free to practice their religion.
p17118
aV&gt;&gt;You're out of touch, my friend.
p17119
aVOn the left's grassroots level traditional religion is widely mocked.
p17120
aV&gt;Give us proof.
p17121
aVHow do you know so much about the lefts grassroots?
p17122
aVLOL.
p17123
aVThey even booed God at their convention!
p17124
aVI used to read the Democratic Underground, and they *hated* the religious.
p17125
aVLiberal heroes mock religion.
p17126
aVYou even dismissed all religion as "hogwash" in this very comment.
p17127
aV&gt;Again, I demand proof, not just words.
p17128
aVYour assumptions about Obama are just that.
p17129
aVThey aren't assumptions.
p17130
aVYou can verify what I said about Obama with his own words.
p17131
aVAny reasonable person who looks at Mormonism, as it exists today, and then looks at Black Liberation Theology and specifically at Obama's church will conclude that Obama's church was far worse.
p17132
aVWhat makes the criticism so ironic is that the people who attacked Romney's religion are the first to stand up and defend most other religions, such as Islam, from criticism -- even when that criticism comes from one of their own such as Bill Maher. 
p17133
aVNazism is fascism which has very little to do with progressives.
p17134
aVEven comparing it to socialism, Nazis denied the concept of class struggle, worker solidarity and defended private property.
p17135
aVIt probably has more in common with tea party conservatives than it does liberal progressives.
p17136
aVIt takes a willful misunderstanding of it to begin to compare it to progressives.
p17137
aVAgain, Religious practices are not protected by the constitution.
p17138
aVOh lord, The DNC did not "boo god" they booed the outcome of a procedural issue when the results of a floor vote where seemingly ignored.
p17139
aVLook at the video and you will hear no boos when god is discussed.
p17140
aVYou seem like a smart guy, too smart to believe nonsense propaganda.
p17141
aVI did dismiss religion as hogwash because that is my personal belief, I find it hard to believe that any one religion is more accurate than another, and it is very clear that there is a lot of plagiarism from earlier religions.
p17142
aVI do not think others should not be allowed to worship whatever they believe in, but I also do not think it should influence the state in any way.
p17143
aVThat is my PERSONAL belief. 
p17144
aVNazism and fascism are leftist.
p17145
aVThey dropped the class stuff and instead made them based on race and nationality, respectively.
p17146
aVNazis have A LOT in common with the progressives, as do the fascists.
p17147
aVThe progressives of yesteryear really did like Mussolini.
p17148
aVThe official Nazi party platform would undoubtedly be looked at as *left* wing by any reasonable modern-day American.
p17149
aV&gt;Again, Religious practices are not protected by the constitution.
p17150
aVYou are wrong.
p17151
aVThe first amendment explicitly protects the right to freely exercise one's religion.
p17152
aVThe left is most certainly an "anti-God" party.
p17153
aVCan you imagine if an *Evangelical* tried to run for president as a left winger today?
p17154
aVSince Carter lost the Democrats have become a party whose leaders are mostly "pretenders" when it comes to religion, while the Republican leaders are more likely to be true believers.
p17155
aVThis is somewhat of a "gut" thing, but it's sort of verifiable as well.
p17156
aVAnd of course neither is a universal thing. 
p17157
aVThe supreme court has stated that religious practices are not protected.
p17158
aVThat is why polygamy as practiced by mormons is a federal crime.
p17159
aVI am not wrong at all, you can claim that the supreme court is wrong but that is another argument.
p17160
aVFascism is far right.
p17161
aVYou'll be hard pressed to find a lot of progressive nationalists.
p17162
aVIf anything its a weird mixture.
p17163
aVAre you willing to concede that the DNC did not boo god as you erroneously claimed?
p17164
aVThank you for admitting its a gut thing because its absolute BS, and not verifiable at all unless you claim to know what lies in the hearts of men and women you don't personally know. 
p17165
aVReligious practices that are in conflict with long-standing law are where it gets complicated.
p17166
aVThe court also told some Native Americans that they cannot use peyote with a religious exception.
p17167
aVThe freedom to exercise one's religion really is protected by the first amendment.
p17168
aV&gt;Are you willing to concede that the DNC did not boo god as you erroneously claimed?
p17169
aVIt's not BS.
p17170
aVI'm sure some booed for the reason you gave, but I'm sure more booed because they did not approve of having "God" in their platform.
p17171
aVThey tried to put "God" in the right way but those in attendance shouted NO.
p17172
aV&gt;Thank you for admitting its a gut thing because its absolute BS, and not verifiable at all unless you claim to know what lies in the hearts of men and women you don't personally know.
p17173
aVYou can absolutely verify it with Obama.
p17174
aVThe reason he went looking for a church back in his agitator days is public info!
p17175
aVAs is the extreme nature of the church he chose.
p17176
aVWith Clinton, for me, it's more of a gut thing.
p17177
aVI know his wife and future presidential candidate was a member of some kooky group of methodists who had this far-left wing magazine she kept every copy of since she started receiving them.
p17178
aVBut they still do not strike me as "churchy" people.
p17179
aVRomney, Both Bushes, and Reagan strike me as genuinely "churchy".
p17180
aVMcCain does not.
p17181
aVJimmy Carter is the last really "churchy" Democrat to win the presidency, IMO.
p17182
aVIt's not absolute BS.
p17183
aVJust a small example.
p17184
aVThe compassion that George W Bush has for others is really amazing when contrasted with the lack thereof with Obama.
p17185
aV[Here](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/joseph-curl-christmastime-george-w-bush-was-santa-/) is one recent story that supports this view.
p17186
aV&gt;Fascism is far right.
p17187
aVYou'll be hard pressed to find a lot of progressive nationalists.
p17188
aVIf anything its a weird mixture.
p17189
aVTake out the nasty, mostly racial, stuff and the Nazi platform could be confused with the Democrats' platform.
p17190
aVThe progressive movement was, way back, pro-war, pro-eugenics, racist, aligned with some churches.
p17191
aVThey were ruthless towards those who did not go along with their new way of doing things.
p17192
aVThings changed quite a bit after WW2 exposed the Nazi atrocities, and things changed some more in the 1960s.
p17193
aVReagan got in trouble for pointing this out, but before WW2 some New Dealers were openly supportive of the Italian Fascists, and while there wasn't wide approval of the antisemitic component of the Nazis they were liked as well.
p17194
aVHitler himself publicly praised FDR and even wrote personal letters.
p17195
aVThe Nazis were absolutely left wing in the American sense of the term.
p17196
aVThe "Far Right" would be the kooky Libertarians that you see on reddit and out in the wild posting Ron Paul signs all over the place. 
p17197
aVI agree--parties are not divided clearly along religious demographics.
p17198
aVI actually didn't think to bring in religion specifically;but sure enough religious liberty does seem to be something that the current democrats see as negotiable.
p17199
aVThis is a huge cause for concern--it is a core American distinctive.
p17200
aVAnd if he does, hopefully John 'finds a way' to sue his ass into poverty. 
p17201
aVSadly, the money comes from taxpayer funds.

aVThere's a stunner.

aVBut I'm sure this story is now canon in right wing circles, along with how Obama is a Kenyan socialist muslim.
p17223
aVwhy would someone carry a prayer rug presumably from the middle east all the way to the texas border to just abandon it anyway?
p17224
aVa prayer rug.
p17225
aVa rug that you use in your religion to pray, that you carried half way across the world.
p17226
aVjust a silly premise in the first place.  
p17227
aVYeah, that'd be like abandoning the family bible because it got too heavy.
p17228
aVWhat an idiot. 
p17229
aVwell like abandoning the family bible on a whim after you packed the damn thing half way around the world.
p17230
aVof course you should remember that there is no such prayer rug anyway.
p17231
aVi'm just stating why it seems unlikely to find one in the first place.
p17232
aVOh I know it's something that never happened.

p17258
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism)" Well, that's not history, it's mythology - and it ties right into all sorts of associated magical thinking, like, [Manifest Destiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny) and [Anglo-Israelism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Israelism).
p17259
aVAnd of course, it all boils down to justifying the use of power as the expression of the will of God.

p17283
aVForcing employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay an employee who is on leave is not "pro family".
p17284
aVeasing the burden of creating an actual family is about as pro family as i can conceive of something being.
p17285
aVi suppose tax cuts for the very very wealthy is what you call pro family?
p17286
aVcorporatist like you are all about letting big business suckle at the tit of big government but nobody else.
p17287
aV&gt;easing the burden of creating an actual family is about as pro family as i can conceive of something being.

aVExcept it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family.
p17289
aVThat's the job of the couple.
p17290
aVAlso, the government has no right, and should have no right, forcing employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay an employee who is not working.
p17291
aV&gt;i suppose tax cuts for the very very wealthy is what you call pro family?
p17292
aVThis isn't even about tax cuts.
p17293
aV&gt;corporatist like you are all about letting big business suckle at the tit of big government but nobody else.
p17294
aVHow amusing of you resorting to name calling.
p17295
aVAlso, employers/companies who don't pay for an employee who is on leave is not "letting big business suckle at the tit of big government".
p17296
aVok well no.
p17297
aVyou are wrong on virtually everything you said.
p17298
aV&gt;it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family\u000a\u000aso why do they give tax incentives to get married?
p17299
aVclearly they think families are a good thing to have to where we do give monetary rewards for starting families.

aV&gt;How amusing of you resorting to name calling.
p17305
aVAlso, employers/companies who don't pay for an employee who is on leave is not "letting big business suckle at the tit of big government".
p17306
aVi'm not name calling.
p17307
aVyou are clearly on the side of big business.
p17308
aVso labeling you a corporatist is not meant as a slight, only an identifier.
p17309
aVand do i really need to bring up subsidies that we pay to some of the largest profit making corporations in the world?
p17310
aVare you going to sit there and tell me that BP or Exxon simply could not exist without those ginormous paychecks from our government?
p17311
aVreally?
p17312
aVlook virtually every other civilized nation has some form of paid maternity leave.
p17313
aVwhy don't we?
p17314
aVgreed.
p17315
aVplain and simple.
p17316
aVgreed.
p17317
aV&gt; ok well no.
p17318
aVyou are wrong on virtually everything you said.
p17319
aVExcept I'm not.
p17320
aVOnly in your opinion that you think I am.
p17321
aV&gt;so why do they give tax incentives to get married?
p17322
aVclearly they think families are a good thing to have to where we do give monetary rewards for starting families.
p17323
aVYes they do, but the government shouldn't have such policies since it discriminates against single persons.
p17324
aV&gt;so strike those disability and worker's comp payments right?
p17325
aVThis is an entirely different subject due to the fact that it depends on if the employer/company is at fault on the claim.
p17326
aV&gt;i didn't say it was.
p17327
aVThen there was no point in mentioning it.
p17328
aV&gt;i'm not name calling.
p17329
aVyou are clearly on the side of big business.
p17330
aVso labeling you a corporatist is not meant as a slight, only an identifier.
p17331
aVExcept it is name calling.
p17332
aVYou're only calling me a 'corporatist' because I don't support *your opinion*.
p17333
aVAlso, someone who doesn't support using the force of government to force an employer/company to pay an employee who is on leave, does not make them a 'corporatist'.
p17334
aV&gt;and do i really need to bring up subsidies that we pay to some of the largest profit making corporations in the world?
p17335
aVare you going to sit there and tell me that BP or Exxon simply could not exist without those ginormous paychecks from our government?
p17336
aVreally?
p17337
aVActually you don't, because I'm against subsidies and welfare for any businesses.
p17338
aVThe government shouldn't be picking the winners or losers.
p17339
aVAre you the same?
p17340
aVOr are you just against subsidies for those kinds businesses, but yet support subsidies for businesses that you like?
p17341
aV&gt;look virtually every other civilized nation has some form of paid maternity leave.
p17342
aVSo what?
p17343
aV&gt;why don't we?
p17344
aVgreed.
p17345
aVplain and simple.
p17346
aVgreed.
p17347
aVIt is not "greed" that we don't force employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay an employee who is on leave/not working.
p17348
aVOnly in your bubble that you actually think it is.
p17349
aVso what is it that you think government should do?
p17350
aVyou sound like a libertarian.
p17351
aVwhich is cute on paper, but then in the real world is just another way to let corporations run amok.
p17352
aVi feel that there is a need for government.
p17353
aVif left to their own devises most people will pursue selfish goals to the detriment of society as a whole.
p17354
aVa lot of the problems in this country boils down to the fact that most of us think in terms of what's in it for me, not what is best for everyone.
p17355
aVeveryone else isn't my responsibility, i've only got to look out for number one etc etc.
p17356
aVwe've lost our sense of community.
p17357
aVand it's really kind of sad.
p17358
aVa good person would want to help a new family out. \u000a\u000a 
p17359
aV&gt;so what is it that you think government should do?
p17360
aVWell, they obviously should not be forcing employers/companies(or taxpayers) to have paid leave.
p17361
aV&gt;you sound like a libertarian.
p17362
aVwhich is cute on paper, but then in the real world is just another way to let corporations run amok.
p17363
aVIn your opinion you think would 'run amok'.
p17364
aV&gt;i feel that there is a need for government.
p17365
aVI do as well, but in a limited form.
p17366
aV&gt;if left to their own devises most people will pursue selfish goals to the detriment of society as a whole.
p17367
aVAnd not forcing employers/companies(or taxpayers) to have paid leave doesn't lead to the detriment of society.
p17368
aV&gt;a lot of the problems in this country boils down to the fact that most of us think in terms of what's in it for me, not what is best for everyone.
p17369
aVExcept the problems in this country are mostly caused by terrible policies from the government(debt, over regulation, crony capitalism, etc.
p17370
aV)\u000a\u000a&gt;a good person would want to help a new family out.
p17371
aVYeah I agree, but it's an entirely different subject when it comes to the government trying to force policies like that.
p17372
aV&gt; Except it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family.
p17373
aVThat's the job of the couple.
p17374
aVIsn't the government made up of people?
p17375
aVOr are politicians and bureaucrats now generated in big buckets like beer instead of being born?
p17376
aV&gt;Isn't the government made up of people?
p17377
aVTechnically yes, but that still doesn't change the fact that it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family.
p17378
aVIt also doesn't change the fact of overall issue that the government has no right, and should have no right, to force employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay for an employee who is on leave/not working.
p17379
aVIf he ran for president young people and intelligent people might actually vote
p17380
aVConservatives know that they are by nature selfish.
p17381
aVThey fear that they will be exposed for who they are.  
p17382
aVHe's black.
p17383
aVThis is all bullshit.
p17384
aVI'm conservative but I like NDT.
p17385
aVI just bought Cosmos on BR.
p17386
aVIt is the fundies that don't like NDT.
p17387
aVIn other words, "I am only half-crazy!
p17388
aVI only deny some science!
p17389
aV"\u000a\u000aFurthermore, it is the moderate conservatives that allow the fundamental right-wing to exist and maintain power. \u000a\u000a
p17390
aVI like how conservative is synonymous with crazy in your head.
p17391
aVIt must be nice to be able pigeon hole everyone's realities in such nice little labels.
p17392
aVGuess that makes decisions easier if you don't have to actually think.
p17393
aVI use "crazy" as a catch-all for qualities like irrational fear of others and insecurity which lead to harmful social constructs such as hierarchies which then lead to disastrous social policies like anti-immigration and war. 
p17394
aVso hes saying reagan was horrible on the border?
p17395
aVi thought saint reagan could do no wrong?
p17396
aVAll bias aside, I saw this as extremely biased and lacking scriptural evidence saying Christians are to do these things.
p17397
aVNot saying they don't, but "Christians" are not always the best actually doing what the Bible says they should do 
p17398
aVThis wasn't quite what I was afraid it was going to be from the title.
p17399
aVEver since the Hobby Lobby "people can legally ignore/break laws due to religious belief" ruling I've been waiting for cases such as "But it is my religion to kill gays", or "But it is my religion to kill anyone not in my religion" or other similar arguments for breaking other laws.

aVThe sad thing is that the Obama administration *deserves* to be "driven out of office" -- for reasons other than Obama's birth certificate or many of the other issues this group objected to.

aVHow these secretive, war-loving torturers who function as tools of corporate power and who spy on every single American in the country -- and who defend the practices!
p17465
aV-- can remain in power is a sad testimony of just how passive the American people are and just how broken our entire political system is.
p17466
aVBy your logic, every American president should have been unfit for office since the 40s.
p17467
aVGet real.
p17468
aVVery true.
p17469
aVAnd yet we we somehow wonder why people like former president Carter says that the US is not a "functioning democracy" and why corporations and the rich control our political system to such an extent that academic studies report that the US is in reality an "oligarchy".
p17470
aVSo let's say we ignore those facts.
p17471
aVThe big question would be, is the direction the country is heading in getting better or getting worse?
p17472
aVAre political trends positive -- that we are becoming more democratic and representative of the American people?
p17473
aVOr is the trend in a negative direction with our political system becoming more plutocratic and oligarchic?
p17474
aVThat answer is crystal clear...
p17475
aV&gt; we somehow wonder\u000a\u000aNo.

aV&gt; You're problem is, you think that Obama is a king.
p17486
aVWhen did I say that?
p17487
aVHe's anything but.
p17488
aVObama is simply a figurehead for the factions and people that control the US government and economy, and which fund both halves of our ruling political duopoly.
p17489
aV&gt; He was elected democratically by a majority of voters, twice.
p17490
aVAfter the disastrous Bush presidency, Obama's first election definitely had some popular support, that's true.
p17491
aVI think a majority of Americans actually came out and voted that election.
p17492
aVBut Obama's campaign was a campaign of lies in a broken, plutocratic and non-representative political system.
p17493
aVEverything from Obama's promises of the most open government in history, his opposition to "signing statements", his positioning himself as a peace candidate, to his promise to back feds off from enforcing medical marijuana laws -- all have proven to be bald-faced lies.
p17494
aVObama's one sole claim to fame is that he ruled a single-payer health care system "off the table" and forced a right-wing-invented, pro-corporate health care system down the throats of the American people that forces people to pour profits into the pockets of the shareholders of private, for-profit health insurance corporations.
p17495
aVThose lies and that one program is not what the American people voted for, that's for sure.
p17496
aVIn his reelection, the majority of the American people sat at home and refused to vote because our political system is so broken that it's a waste of time.
p17497
aVThe electoral system is rigged to force a choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee -- a choice between a pro-torture, war-loving right-of-center politician who oversees violations of the Constitution and the gutting of civil liberties, or one that is *even* *further* to the political right.
p17498
aVSo-called "third party" candidates are required to have huge sums of money to even get on the ballot, and then if they dare assume they can be on TV with the other 2 candidates they're simply arrested and are taken away in handcuffs.
p17499
aVIn such an unfair, broken political system, I would be leery of calling Obama's "reelection" some sort of sign that people approve of his policies.
p17500

aVIn case you are unaware, there are hundreds of lawmakers regulating what Obama can and can't do.
p17507
aVHe does not rule by decree like all you Obama haters think he does.
p17508
aVAnd when he himself suggest the use of executive orders, which are 100% legal, you call him a lawless president.
p17509
aVYou can't have it both ways.
p17510
aVYou can't even have it one way, and that is 100% your fault.

p17613
aVWhile I agree that Citizens United is a damaging blemish on our society, we should also recognize that we haven't done enough to reign in our politicians to clearly address the problem with legislation and/or a Constitutional Amendment.
p17614
aVIf we had legislators that led with clear vision, they could have addressed this problem in no uncertain terms that the SCOTUS could misinterpret. 
p17615

aVFTA:\u000a\u000a&gt; Why is there this sudden interest on the right in shining a light on the way that conservative leaders see their followers less as fellow travelers and more as marks?
p17619
aVPart of it is likely due to a major exposé of the same problem\u2014scam PACs\u2014run by Politico last month.
p17620
aV\u201cSince the tea party burst onto the political landscape in 2009, the conservative movement has been plagued by an explosion of PACs that critics say exist mostly to pad the pockets of the consultants who run them,\u201d Vogel wrote.
p17621
aVThat means, as Hawkins noted in his coverage, that money that might otherwise help sway elections is instead just spinning down the drain.
p17622
aV&gt; That means, as Hawkins noted in his coverage, that money that might otherwise help sway elections is instead just spinning down the drain.
p17623
aVMy guess would be that there has to be more to it than that.
p17624
aVBecause it has swayed elections, even so.
p17625
aVAnd I don't see the results as being all that good for the GOP.
p17626
aVAnd weren't the exploitative tendancies obvious years ago?
p17627
aVThis is not a new thing, this is not a new insight, it's been part of the conservative landscape since - well, since the eighties.
p17628
aVIt was possible to ignore during the Regan years, but it certainly should have been obvious even during Clinton's first term.
p17629
aVBut as Newt might well say, "it's not whether you win or lose, it's whether you beat the spread.
p17630
aV" And certainly Newt and the various suspects noted in the article have done very well by themselves, focusing on "Some of the people you can fool all of the time.
p17631
aV"\u000a\u000aI suppose a more precise question would be "*Why* is this a tipping point?
p17632
aV" Perhaps some are coming to realize that the GOP has simply become a SEO marketing firm relying entirely on clickbait.
p17633
aVIt has no serious intention, much less ability, to do anything intelligent with the power of elective office.
p17634
aVElections have consequences - we are told.
p17635
aVBut it's hard to believe, looking at the things that come across my screen, that all these obvious consequences were foreseen by those who should have.
p17636
aVIf they did, clearly they didn't give a crap.
p17637
aVMaybe it's a tipping point because there are some conservatives still out there that think that good governance *matters* and who realize that "Politics is the Art of the Possible.
p17638
aV" Perhaps they are as concerned as I am that if things continue as they are - making more and more discussions impossible - people will start seeing "Politics by other Means" to be the only rational alternative.
p17639
aVI would think that part of it would be that the GOP has become so dependent on cash and support flowing from the sort of people the huxters pray upon that they simply cannot bring up good candidates who could benefit from their lop-sided fundraising advantage.
p17640
aVThe short term tactical victories that could be bought this way are starting to look like long term strategic losses.
p17641
aVThey are  becoming more and more inextricably bound to values that appeal to a shrinking demographic largely confined to the Old South, and more and more, electing the sort of people you'd expect.
p17642
aVIt's not that they are racists that is the problem.
p17643
aVSad to say.
p17644
aVAt least, it's not the most significant problem.
p17645
aVPlenty of pretty good politicians have been racists.
p17646
aVThey just haven't been criminally stupid, willfully tone-deaf racists - and it's become clear that willingness to compromise is simply not something their electorate will tolerate.
p17647
aVWell, you just can't govern that way.
p17648
aVThere are many virtues and loathesome traits that one may have and still be a successful politician of any stripe but if you can't do any horse-trading, everyone goes home broke and hungry.
p17649
aVSo I think some figures within the party are starting to worry as much or more about the implications of winning elections as they are about losing.
p17650
aVThat could be my biases talking - but a lot of the problems I see now with the GOP are things that Barry Goldwater and Eisenhower warned about.
p17651
aVI hope this next election is a crushing defeat for the GOP.
p17652
aVI don't actually *expect* that, but I do hope.
p17653
aVRight now, the GOP is not permitting any intelligent policy to happen.
p17654
aVIt won't let democratic initiatives move forward and it can't craft intelligent and workable policies of it's own.
p17655
aVSo - people who can do that and speak authentically from an informed, literate intelligent and pragmatic Conservative perspective are going to need a way to do that.
p17656
aVBut the reality is, until the GOP goes away - they won't be able to do that.
p17657
aVOf course, this is great for the Democrats.
p17658
aVThey don't really need to win.
p17659
aVThey just need to allow the GOP to lose.
p17660
aVSure, this is *terrible* for the nation as a whole, but since it's also the *will* of many of the people that things are just as they are, well, they are more than willing to accept a legislative stalemate and use that as ammunition in a cultural war.
p17661
aVWhich, I may point out, is not going well for the Cultural Warriors of the Right.
p17662
aVAgain, every small advance tends to be a grave strategic victory.
p17663
aVIn my humble opinion which I sincerely hope dismiss out of hand.

aVNot Christian, not white male, not even a hate crime, just oops?
p17668
aVWhite American culture needs to take a hard look in the mirror and find out why it is so full of hate for everyone else in this country. 
p17669
aV&gt; Not Christian, not white male, not even a hate crime, just oops?
p17670
aVYeah, that's right.
p17671
aV/s\u000a\u000aJust think of this like some right-wing preacher ranting every Sunday about the evils of abortion, riling people up and exhorting them to take action.
p17672
aVAnd then when some nut shoots a doctor, the preacher says, "Oh no, that's not what I meant.
p17673
aV"\u000a\u000aThese types of crimes are inevitable given our propaganda systems' non-stop demonization of Muslims, rants about "Islamofascism" and the US' ongoing wars to control Middle East oil...
p17674
aVis it that simple though?
p17675
aVI mean is it just Fox "News", Rush Limbaugh and the more radical elements in conservative media egging this on?
p17676
aVPerhaps a dash of economic or social distress pushes people over the edge to resorting to violence.
p17677
aVI have to wonder if there is something more institutional that is responsible.
p17678
aVAll my white friends tell me about their one racist uncle or grandparent, is it time to start asking if they have guns?\u000a
p17679

aVFox is ranting about the atheist progressive who killed some people, and you assholes are ranting about how republicans are egging people on to do this shit and guns are evil.

aVI love Elizabeth Warren as much as the next liberal, but she's basically a sincere, initially naive cultural conservative Republican who deeply learned about one subject and then urgently adopted a liberal position on just that one thing, like a far-right Congressman whose daughter comes out as a lesbian and suddenly becomes a Log Cabin darling.
p17721
aVWarren studied the social safety net in hopes of proving people on public assistance were generally lazy parasites exploiting the system.
p17722
aVWhat she found is the american economy fails some people terribly.
p17723
aVShe went on to become something like an economic justice advocate, albeit just within the narrow band of her judicious study.
p17724
aVThere are plenty of positions I'd consider her for, but not President.
p17725
aVShe remains, for instance, a [defense hawk](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119965/elizabeth-warrens-foreign-policy-positions-are-mystery), though she has become cautious about admitting it lest she lose her support among liberal Democrats.
p17726
aVShe's fine with abolishing the estate tax.
p17727
aVSupport from [US conservatives](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/why-are-we-supposed-to-hate-elizabeth-warren/) (who really should be her natural base) will always be a lost cause because of the [hit job](https://www.google.com/search?q=fauxcahontas) on her by the banking industry.

aVI have to run, or [I'd look up other positions](https://www.google.com/search?q=elizabeth+warren+conservative+positions).

aVI believe (but don't have links handy) that she's a principled  deregulator who trusts business far more than sense dictates, and I would bet on "social" issues she's behind most of us.
p17730
aVShe is obviously highly intelligent and sincere* enough to change based on what she learns, but I would not presume in advance that she'll ever be the President we would want.
p17731
aV\u005c* Does "intelligent and sincere" sound patronizing?
p17732
aVI think the apparent lack of those traits in all our other political figures is the real reason people want Warren to be their President.
p17733
aVWhat the actual fuck is this lady talking about?

VI think it would work better if we just found 365 people to take shifts of a day each.
p18682
aVSet them off with a five pound subway voucher and a dairylea lunchables.
p18683
aVIm down with this.
p18684
aVShotgun day 100
p18685
aVI can see how that would be very tempting, but I really think you should just stick with a camera.
p18686
aVAh, the ol' Reddit [cameraroo](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2a7jxa/i_helped_some_people_move_today_and_made_a/cisql2k?context=2).
p18687
aVHold my canon, I'm going in.
p18688
aV[deleted]
p18689
aV...this is a thing?
p18690
aVUp parascope!
p18691
aVDive!
p18692
aVDive!
p18693
aVDive!
p18694
aVPew pew pew!
p18695
aVIf we are counting from today you had better book 17th October off.
p18696
aVAnd are you sure you want to give up a Friday to follow that cunt around?
p18697
aVlunchables make up for it 
p18698
aVi did mine yesterday.
p18699
aVwhere's my subway voucher?
p18700
aV?
aV[deleted]
p18701
aVyea i ummm forgot to put film in my camera
p18702
aVGod damnit Krieger!
p18703
aVDespise them all you want, but some paparazzi are actually professionals who are skilled at what they do (ie shooting situations to fabricate bullshit.
p18704
aV)  Fast tele lenses aren't cheap, either.
p18705
aV340 days out of a year with some boneheads snapping blurry garbage with their phones isn't going to achieve the same effect.
p18706
aVEncouraging folks to add to the scrum at critical times/events might be a useful thing, if everyone behaves.
p18707
aVI don't think skill is the key intent here.
p18708
aVI think it's just to be an invasive arsehole.
p18709
aVI'd imagine most people would struggle to be as invasive either.
p18710
aVThey'd probably just stand a few metres away taking pictures.
p18711
aVi don't think they mean physically invasive, more invasive of privacy
p18712
aVTake pictures of his wife , his kids, when they go on school trips, run shitty little stories about how his kids will be hot when they're older - run constant stories about dodgy tax dealings. 
p18713
aVAssuming you aren't actually a 'journalist' this is a good way to get arrested
p18714
aVNah it'll be fine, put a small disclaimer buried deep in the CSS stylesheet that everything written is not necessarily true and is the subject of parody.
p18715
aVThat'll definitely cover it.
p18716
aV^^^^\u005c(IANAL)
p18717
aVA CSS stylesheet?
p18718
aVIs that like a PIN number or ATM machine?
p18719
aVI use it to make my source code look pretty.
p18720
aVWell I've not seen anyone getting arrested for it so far.
p18721
aV£5 barely gets you a footlong these days and not a good footlong either 
p18722
aVItalian BMT and a drink for a fiver.
p18723
aVThat'll do me. 
p18724
aVDo people know about the Chicken Pizziola?
p18725
aVPeople often have no idea what I am talking about (thankfully the staff do) but it's a great sub!
p18726
aVI've seen them Stateside, but not here.
p18727
aVYou can get them!
p18728
aVI have them pretty much every time and the staff always know what I am on about.
p18729
aVI did actually see it on the menu once but it didn't have an image and people still don't seem to notice it.
p18730
aVThey were in the subway here for a while, on the board at the back I mean.
p18731
aVThey were ok but not enough to sway me from my BMT.
p18732
aVYeah the BMT is my subway of choice as well here in the UK
p18733
aVSteak and cheese, man.
p18734
aVNothing else comes close for a lunch sub.
p18735
aVBut steak and cheese isn't in the £5 drink deal.
p18736
aVI'm not paying like £8 for a sandwich with a drink lol
p18737
aVThat and southwest sauce....
p18738
aV[deleted]
p18739
aVYeah it is, if it's not on the menu (I think it might be on at the mo but without a picture) then the staff will know what you mean.
p18740
aVAh, the good old big man ting. 
p18741
aVWe told a friend it stands for big meaty twat and he still orders them today as such.
p18742
aVHe hasn't realised it's not that. 
p18743
aVWith honey mustard.
p18744
aVA man after my own heart!
p18745
aVCheese, but not toasted FTW.
p18746
aVWhat sort of savage are you? 
p18747
aVI don't like how the toasting drys the bread out.
p18748
aVI like my subway soft. 
p18749
aVsoft southerner confirmed
p18750
aVSo, did you go down to watch the tour the other day?, I was planning on driving to Sheffield to have a watch but figured it would be rubbish for the 30 or so seconds that the riders go past.
p18751
aVWas it packed out?
p18752
aVYork resident; can confirm, was well rammed.
p18753
aVHaving seen a lot of my trans-Yorkshire mates' pictures, it was the same pretty much everywhere, even in the inconvenient parts of the Dales (a bunch of incredibly masochistic people even cycled up Buttertubs Pass).
p18754
aVDo they still charge VAT on toasted sandwiches?
p18755
aVMan I haven't had subway in ages
p18756
aVI've always been offered it as an optional free thing, never something I've paid extra for
p18757
aVWell I remember seeing a sign around the time of the "pasty tax" saying that now they'd have to charge VAT.
p18758
aVMaybe it's been reversed now, I'm not sure. 
p18759
aVGo the extra quid &amp; bacon that sub up.
p18760
aV[deleted]
p18761
aVIts the same price here
p18762
aVWhat?
p18763
aVWhere do you live?
p18764
aVIt's *exactly* a fiver for a footlong. 
p18765
aVyeah but like the 6 healthy ones.
p18766
aVIt's all about the steak and cheese or chicken teriyaki 
p18767
aVItalian BMT is now considered healthy?
p18768
aVSweet Jesus! 
p18769
aVIs Italian bmt part of it?
p18770
aVIt used to be the 6 'low fat' ones that were the cheaper deal.
p18771
aVChicken pizziola and chicken avocado are nice too
p18772
aVOh yeah baby, it's included. 
p18773
aVWhat the fuck is a pizziola? 
p18774
aVThey toast it with cheese and the meatball sauce.
p18775
aVTry it.
p18776
aVConsider it considered! 
p18777
aVItalian bmt has been part of it for donks.
p18778
aVThey used to also give you crisps or a cookie, but they ditched that a couple years ago.
p18779
aVYou might as well buy some rubber and pur 250g of salt on it.
p18780
aVSubway meat is so shit it on the verge of being vegan.
p18781
aVOnly for the cheapy ones.
p18782
aVThe good ones are either 5.39 or 5.89.    
p18783
aVI will literally do it everyday.
p18784
aVFor fun, and 30k.
p18785
aVI would happily be a part of this.
p18786
aVGive me a greggs voucher and I would be the first one there.
p18787
aVI've got a week-old bacon sarnie and I can microwave a grey meat pasty for you.
p18788
aVDeal?
p18789
aVDone and done.
p18790
aVSubstitute the Lunchable with a snack pot of Moroccan Style cous cous and I'm in.
p18791
aVJoking apart, I've been wondering when someone would do this.
p18792
aVI've pretty much come to realise it hasn't come to pass because 50% of the time, celebrities want/need the publicity.
p18793
aVThey just find that they can't put the genie back in the bottle when they get caught getting a BJ from a hooker.
p18794
aVThat being said, the Daily Mail is utterly  reprehensible.
p18795
aVIf it shines a light on their BS, I'm right behind it.
p18796
aVI'm not sure it will get anywhere, but if a few more people start wondering why do many people *loathe* The Mail...\u000a\u000aEDIT:  On the off-chance this does blow up, I think you'd better be very careful - harassment and all that jazz.  
p18797
aVThis sounds like fun.
p18798
aVI'll do it for a 99p KFC streetwise snack
p18799
aVI will do it for a Bargain Bucket, it may be a little bit more expensive, but the end product will be far superior.
p18800
aVRather than employing someone, wouldn't it be better to straight up offer £1000 every week to anyone who can get the best/worst photo of him.
p18801
aVThink how many broke students there are in London who'd wank off a tramp for a grand.
p18802
aVIt would annoy him far more than one dude wandering around after him\u000a\u000a
p18803
aVI demand cheese strings.
p18804
aVThey taste fucking foul, but that'll keep me awake.
p18805
aV[deleted]
p18806
aVAlso if it's someone different every day he'll be less likely to see them coming. 
p18807
aVOscar Meyer must have bought dairyleA.
p18808
aVShame
p18809
aVI see.
p18810
aVMiddle management? 
p18811
aVI'm in, but can I take one of the early days please, I'm going on maternity soon.
p18812
aVThis was funny enough before I started imagining a Glasgow accent saying it.
p18813
aVHow about making this a challenge for anyone living in/ visiting London?
p18814
aVThen fund it like You've Been Framed - 250 upvotes for every entry ;-)
p18815
aVI don' think 365 people would be as annying as the sme one all the time.
p18816
aVAlso, a real pap (or at least a dedicated amateur) will learn where he goes etc and be more effective.
p18817
aVHaving said all of that, the real annoyance of paparazzi must be their ubiquity.
p18818
aVA celebrity can take a car or even plane somewhere, get out and still have attention.
p18819
aVWe couldn't match that without more staff.
p18820
aVCount me in for a day but I need double lunchables.
p18821
aV*edit* diarrhea lunchables
p18822
aV*tube
p18823
aVAlright,  a dairylea tube then. 
p18824
aVAnd set up a website with invasive photos of him on holiday, walking down the street, going to dinner with people, hanging out with his family - potentially adding unsubstantiated comments as context to the photos (saying he has family problems if one of the photos makes his wife look a bit sad; say he's under pressure in his job if one photo makes him look a little bit stressed). 
p18825
aVDepending on the workload of our private paparazzi, they could maybe take invasive photos of other Daily Mail journalists too - Liz Jones and Richard Littlejohn especially.
p18826
aVYou should see this when it comes out: http://www.frontlineclub.com/one-rogue-reporter/
p18827
aVThat looks like something I could get behind
p18828
aVAh Littlejohn, the lover of britain, who cries himself to sleep at night as immigrants, health and safety, and the "workshy"  ruin his beloved country, lives in the good ole USA for.most of the year, so we might want to hire another paparazzi just for him
p18829
aV[deleted]
p18830
aVIt would have to be a quintessentially English cake, like a Victoria sponge
p18831
aVArgh, that bastard Littlejohn.
p18832
aVWhenever I have a chat with my mum about how shite the Mail is, she goes "Oh sometimes Littlejohn says something good" and it depresses me.
p18833
aVI don't even know why she looks at it if she thinks/knows the rest of it is crap.
p18834
aVShe complains about how they post retractions in with small ads in the back of the paper when the original lie was posted in the headline on P1, and still buys the bloody thing.
p18835
aVBut then again, so does my dad (divorced, they don't just both buy the paper haha) and now my cat's dead so I don't even get the pleasure of seeing her having done a big shit on Jan Moir's face every week.
p18836
aVJust the mention of Dick Littlejohn's name makes me angry.
p18837
aVIf we have a nice big smear article about him and send hatemail to him (of the "you're the scum of the earth, you pile of pigshit" variety) then I'm in.
p18838
aVI wouldn't really group those two together.
p18839
aVLiz Jones is just a bit crazy/eccentric.
p18840
aVShe's not an evil bigoted fuck.
p18841
aV[Try here for some better choices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Notable_regular_contributors_.28present.29).
p18842
aVJan Moir is infinitely more hateful than Liz Jones.
p18843
aVTrue, yeah, very true!
p18844
aVSorry to hijack this comment thread, but what's the deal with this Paul Dacre?
p18845
aVCan I help write pithy headlines like "Here is Paul Dacre on holiday: he obviously doesn't care what he is wearing today" if I pitch in for the sarnie fund?
p18846
aVTwo children died today in a house fire in Whitby.
p18847
aVWhere is Paul Dacre?
p18848
aVSunning Himself in Majorca.
p18849
aVWhen asked if he was enjoying himself, he said he 'hopes HE doesn't get BURNT'!!
p18850
aVPolice have yet to deny if he was the cause of the blaze.
p18851
aVHaha!
p18852
aVDo you actually write for the mail?
p18853
aVNo wait you didn't mention immigrants, cancer or Princess Di.
p18854
aVFalse alarm. 
p18855
aVI'm claiming headline rights to any snaps of him looking after young family members.
p18856
aV**Paul Day-care**
p18857
aV&gt;Paedo Paul strikes again
p18858
aVI'm claiming headline rights to any snaps of him looking badly dressed.
p18859
aV**Paul Don't-care**
p18860
aVWith any luck we can get him doing the classic 'hide under a blanket' anti pap manoeuvre.
p18861
aVThen we can headline it as 'Shawl Dacre'.
p18862
aVIf he trips over\u000a\u000a**Fall Dacre**
p18863
aVYeah and take photos of his daughter and comment on how she looks "older than her years" or how she's "all grown up"
p18864
aVAnd how she's 'showing off' when she's wearing a bikini or dress, and how she is 'sizzling' and has a 'sexy toned physique' (or 'curvier frame' if she's a bit bigger or 'trim figure' if she's smaller).
p18865
aVBut bring back hanging for paedos
p18866
aVDoes he have a daughter?
p18867
aVEDIT: Wikipedia confirms he has two sons. 
p18868
aVYeah that doesnt fly so well on the daily mail website.
p18869
aVThat's more of a Parliament thing
p18870
aVWe could still give them the same treatment, highlight the sexism at the same time as the paedophilic undertones.
p18871
aVThat just sounds like a stupid way to be just as bad as them. 
p18872
aVWell, you may be right.
p18873
aVMight not be worth it to lose the high ground, even if it does hurt Dacre more.
p18874
aVYou have to make them questions or you can get sued.
p18875
aVIs the Dacre household falling apart?
p18876
aVCould the look on Mrs. Dacre's face be described as "upset-with-infidelity"?
p18877
aVDon't forget the full Femail treatment, big red circles all over photos of him, highlighting crows feet, fat ankles, cellulite, thinning hair, liver spots, etc , etc...oh, and that he's a cunt.
p18878
aVI know the sentiment behind getting photos of his family, but isn't against the law to pap children?
p18879
aVThe Mail get away with it because of who they are and their ability to pay for lawyers, but Dacre and the government will come down on redditors like a ton of bricks.
p18880
aVA kickstarter wouldn't begin to cover legal fees\u000a\u000aPapping Dacre's fine though, love the idea.
p18881
aVFind a friendly American to run the website and host in America.
p18882
aVFirst amendment motherfuckers! 
p18883
aVAh yes, America, that bastion of digital freedom.
p18884
aVThey are far from perfect, for this type of thing they're a lot better than the UK
p18885
aVFor invading privacy?
p18886
aV:P Yup, I guess they are. 
p18887
aVAs far as I'm aware he is quite the recluse.  
p18888
aV#DailyDacre hashtag with livefeed on the website!!
p18889
aVWith competitions
p18890
aVI'm gonna be playing the role of Buzz Killington here but:\u000a\u000aWon't we be upsetting a lot of innocent parties here?
p18891
aVHis kids shouldn't have to suffer just because their dad is a cunt.
p18892
aVAgreed, which is why the original post I've updated to not include his family in this at all - we won't stoop to his level.
p18893
aVAnd just talk about what he's wearing.
p18894
aV"Looking drab in a pair of brown shoes"
p18895
aVAnd then when he finds out who has been doing it he will do the same to you and publish complete lies about you.
p18896
aVThen you can sue the DM but they won't care because that happens all the time. \u000a\u000a
p18897
aVWould it not be better just to offer a bounty for photos of him?
p18898
aVSay starting at £50 for a simple leaving home snap, then going up in value the more embarrassing and candid the photos are. 
p18899
aV&gt;Would it not be better just to offer a bounty \u000a\u000ayes, now we're talking!
p18900
aV&gt;for photos of him?
p18901
aVOh.
p18902
aV:(
p18903
aVI can't decide if you're disappointed that Dacre isn't going to be murdered, or that you're not getting a tasty coconut chocolate bar.
p18904
aVEither way, I'm with you.
p18905
aV&gt;I can't decide if you're disappointed that Dacre isn't going to be murdered, or that you're not getting a tasty coconut chocolate bar.
p18906
aVYes.
p18907
aVIt wasn't that when you offered me a kit-kat to fuck up Kelvin Mackenzie.
p18908
aV"So, let's see these photos then, buddy".
p18909
aV"...what?
p18910
aV".
p18911
aV"Of course.
p18912
aVYou want proof!
p18913
aV"
aValbum in comments ;)
p18914
aVNow i have image of Paul saying "i'm shy, here's my butthole"
p18915
aVThis is the way to do it.
p18916
aVNot employ someone new, but use the existing paps and buy photos off them.
p18917
aVI will throw a few quid in.
p18918
aVI think the funny part of this is that he will probably hire his own person and take pictures that no one else can get, thus profiting the money we gave him and only taking pictures that he consents to.
p18919
aVThis plan is retarded.
p18920
aVJust go take the damn pictures yourself.
p18921
aVYou are right.
p18922
aVIt won't work. 
p18923
aVBear in mind that the existing paps are probably going to be rather nervous of screwing one of their most important customers.
p18924
aV£1000 on wanking in the bath
p18925
aVI don't know.
p18926
aVI mean, I really like coconut in a chocolate bar, but I think I might need a better payment to stalk the daily mail editor.
p18927
aV£25 for him accidentally dropping something.
p18928
aVWhy not make that paparazzi an Eastern European immigrant?
p18929
aVIt would make Dacre double furious.
p18930
aVA gay Eastern European immigrant?
p18931
aVA gay Eastern European benefit claiming single mother of six
p18932
aVA gay Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benefits because she's also working as a paparazzi.
p18933
aV*In a wheelchair.
p18934
aV*
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair....*who doesn't love britain*. 
p18935
aVEven I'm getting angry now.
p18936
aVI'm assuming you're Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish.
p18937
aVEveryone knows the only appropriate emotion a *true* Englishman feels about England/Britain is a sort of approving sense of mild embarrassment, lest we start getting overexcited and accidentally invade and oppress anyone.
p18938
aVI'm dreadfully sorry but I do have to disagree, I don't think getting overexcited is particularly British either, we'll leave that to those frightfully brash rebels across the ocean 
p18939
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair *who doesn't love britain* and her kids don't speak English and cost the taxpayer £22,000 per year in order to employ a translator for their school work. \u000a\u000a
p18940
aVThat translator?
p18941
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who is fraudelently claiming benefits in a wheelchair *who doesn't love britain* and *her* kids don't speak english and cost the taxpay.....
p18942
aVThe translator is a left-wing Green Party voting, royal family hater.
p18943
aVOooh yeah, anti-royalist, forgot about that one.
p18944
aVTbh we just want to piss the guy off right?
p18945
aVNot give him an stroke.
p18946
aVCan we shoehorn some Muslim in as well?
p18947
aVPlease don't make me type that shit out again, I'm on my phone.
p18948
aVQuite frankly I'm surprised we haven't already.
p18949
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair who doesn't love britain and her kids don't speak English and cost the taxpayer £22,000 per year in order to employ a translator for their school work.....and she's a converted Muslim
p18950
aVAnd she participated in The NHS part of the opening ceremony.
p18951
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair....who doesn't love britain **and** is a cyclist.
p18952
aVWhile causing cancer?
p18953
aVNomadic cancer, the worst kind. 
p18954
aVI have a fuck buddy down south who is literally this so it's not impossible
p18955
aVSerious question - Do you really think that Paul Dacre actually gives a shit about immigration?
p18956
aVThis is something I genuinely feel most people either miss or forget.
p18957
aVI doubt him or any of his writers really feel as they write, but it sells.
p18958
aVAnd as long as it sells, they'll continue to write it and allow those offensive columns.
p18959
aVIt's all about money and nothing else. 
p18960
aVaka Rita Skeeter
p18961
aV[deleted]
p18962
aVI'll do it.
p18963
aVI'll even buy one of those fancy DLSR cameras instead of using my 4 year old phone.
p18964
aVYou're welcome!
p18965
aVSuch heroics deserve more than mere thanks...
p18966
aV[deleted]
p18967
aV[deleted]
p18968
aVWhy is that?
p18969
aVAre lenses the most expensive?
p18970
aVIf you want to pap him from insane distances while he's on the beach £10k is a starting point for the lens..
p18971
aVFuck.
p18972
aVHow do poor people get ahead in life without going into debt.
p18973
aVIt's near impossible. 
p18974
aVLie in gutter with cameraphone, take pictures directly up celebrities skirts, sell to mail
p18975
aV&gt; Fuck.
p18976
aVHow do poor people get ahead in life without going into debt.
p18977
aVIt's near impossible.
p18978
aVI'm confused.
p18979
aVDid you in an instant acquire a dream of being a photographer and then decide its impossible because you need £10k capital?
p18980
aVWe can easily find 1000 people who hate him enough and have a spare tenner - let's have a whip round.
p18981
aVOne word, quadrocopter.
p18982
aVHave a camera drone with a GoPro following the man wherever he goes. 
p18983
aVLenses are "jesus fucking christ" expensive. 
p18984
aVThe only problem is we also need a publication to publish these photos that enough people can see.
p18985
aVSure we can host online but if its something no one would go on the photos would be in vain.
p18986
aVNot that being stalked and photographed simultaneously for your life isnt degrading and inhumane.
p18987
aVJust post it to Reddit, then the Metro will publish it in 3 days time.
p18988
aVDon't forget Buzzfeed and the Independent
p18989
aVAnd the Guardian
p18990
aVErr create a subreddit, twitter, facebook?
p18991
aVNewspapers are dying but maybe private eye?
p18992
aVPrivate Eye can take a couple more court cases for the team... right?
p18993
aVA tumblr would do.
p18994
aVWith a newpapery theme. 
p18995
aVIt could get trending on twitter, that counts as legitimate news, these days. 
p18996
aVI feel like the point is not to make sure people see photos of him, but to give him a taste of his own medicine.
p18997
aVOf course, that means a judge would rule this harassment of some kind without a second thought.
p18998
aVI just posted pretty much the same thing three days later than you and I feel silly now
p18999
aVCould crowd-source it.
p19000
aV#pappauldacre? 
p19001
aVOh God, that's brilliant.
p19002
aVThe kickstarter funds a prize per week for the most invasive photo.
p19003
aVNice, yeah.
p19004
aV£54,000 Kickstarter, offering £1,000 a week for a year to the sleaziest photo of him (or maybe his family too, but I feel like it's teaching his family a lesson for their horrible father/husband etc) OR the person who photographs him the most over the day. 
p19005
aVSomething doesn't add up there
p19006
aVSorry, 52.
p19007
aVEh, you can keep the extra 2k, it was a good idea.
p19008
aVYou'd actually need about 54 anyway because of Kickstarter's fees.
p19009
aVI'd do it for £50k... plus expenses obviously, if he swans off to the carribean, I aint paying that out of my own pocket?
p19010
aVDo you accept dogecoin?
p19011
aVFuck yes.
p19012
aV^To ^^the ^^^moon!
p19013
aVnope - cash only.
p19014
aVSorry\u000a
p19015
aVYou're fired. 
p19016
aVShame, good thing that I kept my dayjob...
p19017
aVDon't quit your dayjob
p19018
aV[deleted]
p19019
aVTake the money.
p19020
aVPay someone else less to continue in lieu of you.
p19021
aVProfit.
p19022
aVDefinitely stay away from his family.
p19023
aVYou shouldn't punish people for what family members do in the hope that it incentivises him to do something.
p19024
aVThey have done nothing to deserve such harassment, and to do so would make you a hypocrite.
p19025
aVAlso, you should add a caveat about the prize not being offered if the Daily Mail stops posting such shots
p19026
aVAs if reddit would pay a paparazzo anything to do anything but punch himself in the groin for 10 hours a day
p19027
aVI wouldn't trust them to follow through much better to pay a couple of amateur boxers and the paparazzi 
p19028
aVWaiiiiiit.
p19029
aV**I'LL DO IT FOR 20,000**
p19030
aVThis is the best post I've seen on this subreddit in ages.
p19031
aVI'll pledge £50 if you get it up and running.
p19032
aVI want my reward to be some exclusive pictures of him looking angry and swearing. 
p19033
aVI have never contributed to a kickstarter before, but this would be very hard to resist
p19034
aV£30k isn't a great salary for somebody required to travel around, especially in and out of London.
p19035
aVWe could up it to £40k, I was thinking of a realistic salary for a paparazzi (we could just get a normal photographer with no experience of paparazzi-ing to cut costs).
p19036
aVAh, then the plan may be in trouble.
p19037
aVPaparazzi are paid per photo, the price of each photo being relative to its rarity, nuance, and popularity of subject.
p19038
aVPictures of Dacre would not be rare, nuanced, and he certainly isn't popular.
p19039
aVA salary is a way to do this.
p19040
aVYou'd just need to factor in additional expenses.
p19041
aVPerhaps crowd sourcing is the solution - start a web page, invite people to take and post pictures of Dacre.
p19042
aVBut he needs people taking photos of him ALL the time - night, day, on holiday, at dinner etc etc.
p19043
aVPaying someone to make it basically their full-time job (on a year-long contract, we can add in travel expenses) is the only way to do it?
p19044
aVThe crowd-sourcing way sounds too unreliable for him to always be stalked by paps 24/7.
p19045
aVOh, 24/7?
p19046
aVThen you'd need 3 people minimum working full time, and 1 part time for weekends.
p19047
aVShit, good point - well maybe not 24/7, but any time he is awake basically.
p19048
aVDamn.
p19049
aVMaybe crowd-sourcing is the better idea - raise money to be able to offer bounties for the juciest, sleaziest photos of him.
p19050
aVThey like to call it papping. 
p19051
aV£30k salary, and they maintain right to their photos.
p19052
aVBusiness consultant in London here.
p19053
aV£30k is what I make.
p19054
aVI thought it was quite good :(
p19055
aVSo what is the typical charge out rate for a £30k business consultant from London?
p19056
aVCouldn't tell you I'm afraid, don't remember.
p19057
aV£30k is just a flat payment from the company, I don't concern myself with their pricing.
p19058
aVIt's probably more than I'm worth though.
p19059
aVWow, this sounds weird to me, a business consultant who has no idea of the business model of the business he works at.. Lol, don't think I am being critical, just curious!
p19060
aVI know the business model, but the price they charge for me is irrelevant to my daily work.
p19061
aVI've seen it, but I couldn't remember the figure.
p19062
aVI've actually spent a lot more time looking at the prices charged for other resources (e.g.
p19063
aVoffshore consultants).
p19064
aVCouldn't remember those either.
p19065
aVI know it when I'm using it, but there are too many different sums to keep track.
p19066
aVAlso bear in mind the rate varies with different clients/projects, there isn't just one general amount.
p19067
aVI also don't really care about consultancy, I'm quitting as soon as I can afford to.
p19068
aVI'd be surprised if less than £750 a day + expenses.
p19069
aVSource: knowing
p19070
aVSome people have little idea of the average persons salary (median is more illustrative than mean, too).
p19071
aV[deleted]
p19072
aVOr, in my case, 30k.
p19073
aVAfter taxes, about £1800 a month.
p19074
aVcame here to say that. 
p19075
aVOne site says "Well-established and hard-working paparazzi can make $500,000 a year" - well this guy is pretty much only in London, will have no pressure to sell the photos, is only stalking one guy, so £30k-40k-£50k sounds pretty reasonable as they're probably working 10% as hard with just one guy and not selling photos.
p19076
aVpretty sure you could have him killed for that ... nam sayin ...
p19077
aVBut you don't want him killed, that'll end his suffering too soon.
p19078
aVYou want him to be driven crazy from the constant papping, literally can't go an hour with any privacy.
p19079
aVEventually he'll be driven so insane that he'll become a recluse living in the mountains somewhere in Asia, or worse....
p19080
aVThinking too small picture here, do this... yes... but once that year's out target some other arsehole and fuck with their life.
p19081
aVGood luck though.
p19082
aV*paparazzo
p19083
aV[Paparazzo](http://slurmed.com/fanart/immortal/023_paparazzi-bender_by-immortal-spider-matt.png)
p19084
aVBoth DacreMail.com and DailyDacre.com are available to host the photos and the SCANDALOUS JUICY GOSSIP about Paul Dacre.
p19085
aVHey, if they can kickstarter a [Potato Salad to make over $70,000 in 6 days,](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad) I'm sure we could arrange this..
p19086
aVI'll do it!
p19087
aVI fancy a change of pace. 
p19088
aVActually I'm kind of surprised some celebrity hasn't already done something like this.
p19089
aVThey certainly have the money.\u000a\u000a
p19090
aVYears ago some comedy programme (I forget which now) got a bunch of people to dress as Lady Di armed with cameras to chase after some paparazzi.
p19091
aVIt was a single sketch rather than a prolonged effort, but the same concept.
p19092
aVThey use them as much as the paparazzi uses the celebrity.  
p19093
aVI would genuinely donate £30 to this.
p19094
aVPart of me hopes this will happen the majority of me as actually seriously concerned that because this is the internet, this could happen.
p19095
aVToday's a strange day.
p19096
aVThis will work really well if you work it out properly - people love kickstarter so if people can chip in a quid or two they'll be happy to do so.
p19097
aVPeople hate the DM like reddit loves bacon.
p19098
aVSome imaginative stretch goals would be good.
p19099
aVPretty sure this would go viral too - more liberal news sources would lap it up - huffington post, vice, Guardian etc.
p19100
aVI'm not sure what the going rate for paparazzis is, but I bet it's lucrative - to get someone who's effective they may cost a lot - doing this will stop them trying to pap massive celebs who are worth tonnes, and also may make them unpopular with other red top papers, who would normally be their source of income.
p19101
aVTL;DR - you may have to pay a LOT to make them bite the hand that feeds.
p19102
aV[deleted]
p19103
aVKickstarter is a little bit more open now and this is completely legal, as illustrated by the journalists themselves.
p19104
aVKickstarter just had a guy wanting to make potato salad for lunch raise $40,000.
p19105
aVThey'd allow this. 
p19106
aVWe could set up our own site using [Selfstarter](http://selfstarter.us/).
p19107
aVWon't work, he doesn't give a fuck.
p19108
aVTarget his family, he will learn empathy pretty quickly.
p19109
aV[deleted]
p19110
aVMy brother is a materialistic bastard but he loves his kids.
p19111
aVTarget his kids.
p19112
aVIt's a fucked up mentality but seeing others hurt, specifically the ones you love because of your actions will harm you more than if you were the target.
p19113
aVSay you have two kids, ideally twins, one of them does something bad.
p19114
aVPunish the innocent party, let them know you are punishing them for the actions of the other.
p19115
aVUnless the offender is a sociopath things will change quickly.
p19116
aVWouldn't actually work on very young kids btw, have to be close to the age of reason, everyones a sociopath until this point.
p19117
aVAs an example look at what feminism does in regard to rape.
p19118
aVIt doesn't attack rapists it attacks other men for allowing them to rape.
p19119
aVI dislike feminism but the punish the innocent mentality amongst them helped them get where they are today.
p19120
aVNow these are pretty fucked up ways of dealing with things and if you use them it may very well say more about you than the scum you are attacking, but regardless they are effective.
p19121
aVI read a TIL not to long ago which involved a hostage situation.
p19122
aVThe russians had an interest in the situation and once one of their people was killed they found the nephew of one of the terrorists, an innocent and castrated him.
p19123
aVNo more russians killed.
p19124
aV&gt; My brother is a materialistic bastard but he loves his kids.
p19125
aVTarget his kids.
p19126
aVYou are Paul Dacre's brother?
p19127
aV;-D
p19128
aVPragmatic but intensely unethical.
p19129
aVI wouldn't be able to be any part in doing something like this.
p19130
aVI share your sentiment and yet the mentality is actually quite commonplace.
p19131
aVHumanity is the most disgusting of animals.
p19132
aVThere are amongst us predators of a cannibalistic type, they feed off their own.
p19133
aVDacre is one of those types, terms like ethics and morality are vague suggestions rather than rules.
p19134
aVInterestingly, they exist in all walks the right, the left, rich and poor.
p19135
aVThey position themselves in places where they can feed from others, much like a peadophile is attracted to schools or any occupation where they can be around the kiddies.
p19136
aVA physiological cannibal will place themselves in areas of influence and they will hide their true self behind an agenda or a job and they will use that as camouflage.
p19137
aVHow interesting would it be to see two of them, same mentality, differing reasoning target each other.
p19138
aVNow imagine this is just how things are, have always been, what kind of world do you think we would live in if rather than punishing people for their actions we punished their loved ones?
p19139
aVI'm not advocating this, but give it some thought, it's really quite interesting.
p19140
aVMaliciously bothering innocent people in protest of doing just that?
p19141
aVBoy, you're a fucking empathetic wizard. 
p19142
aVI'm available for childrens parties and hen nights.
p19143
aVFull pap style, catch them walking out of restaurants ,offices... their home at 7am:\u000a\u000a "fucked any kids lately Dacre?".
p19144
aV*snap snap*
p19145
aVI feel like kind of a prick asking, but is this serious?
p19146
aVIf so, do you have a plan of any kind?
p19147
aVI'd happily chip in a fiver. 
p19148
aVI'd do the job for £30,000 a year.
p19149
aVHow about LetsPapPaul.com as a domain? 
p19150
aV£30,000!
p19151
aVGimme £5000 and I could probably find someone to make him disappear.
p19152
aVI'D DONATE
p19153
aVI'm sure you could hire someone to take shots with something other than than a camera for thirty grand.
p19154
aVThough if we were going down *that* route we'd have to take donations in Bitcoin or something.
p19155
aV[deleted]
p19156
aVI'd stalk the dude for 5 years for £30,000 if you're offering.
p19157
aVThe only thing lazier than kickstarter is asking someone to do it for you.
p19158
aVHe would get a barrister as injunct it in two seconds flat.
p19159
aVCelebs want to be followed, plebs cannot afford to do anything about it.
p19160
aVDid that transgender school teacher want to be followed before killing herself?
p19161
aVSo that would fall into the latter.
p19162
aVI'm in.
p19163
aVlet's do it.
p19164
aVIs fighting hate and spite with hate and spite really the best idea?
p19165
aVLike, are you guys... really serious?
p19166
aVDo you want to just make the world an objectively worse place instead of doing something that isn't going to be met with backlash and negative press?
p19167
aVThis isn't JusticePorn at all.
p19168
aVThis is just fighting harassment with harassment.
p19169
aVYou guys are no better than he is.
p19170
aVLike, think of the ramifications for a moment.
p19171
aVSay word gets back to him that there's a reddit group organizing to harass him.
p19172
aVThink of the all the fucking press power he has -- morons everywhere will start spreading the word that reddit is a hate crime organization bent on petty revenge.
p19173
aVEventually world will spread about reddit's arguably worse sections, like the old jailbait and candid photo whatever subreddits, along with beating/raping/etcwomen that there was all the drama about a few weeks ago.
p19174
aVStraight up?
p19175
aVYou guys are fucking idiots.
p19176
aVAs if reddit needed even worse PR than it already has.
p19177
aVYou wanna make some positive change in the world?
p19178
aVGet him fired.
p19179
aVThat's justice.
p19180
aVLiterally stalking him and perpetuating the idea that paparazzism is okay?
p19181
aVIt's like this idea was invented by someone who doesn't understand the concept of repercussions.
p19182
aVThis is a loose association of redditors with no power beyond money.
p19183
aVThis guy is the editor for a media outlet with hundreds of thousands of regular viewers.
p19184
aVYou're not winning any battles this way.
p19185
aVYou're just poking the bear and making the problem worse.
p19186
aVSeriously, get him fired.
p19187
aVDo what you can on THAT front.
p19188
aVNot this way. 
p19189
aVwhats the back story of this?
p19190
aVwho is this guy?
p19191
aVany why?
p19192
aV- american here
p19193
aV[Here](http://stephen-fry-me.tumblr.com/post/57805910021/the-daily-mail-and-lord-dacre-appeasing-again) is Stephen Fry's take on him:\u000a\u000a&gt; Lord Dacre is himself a frothing autocrat.
p19194
aVAn absolutely foul-mouthed boss, who constantly screams the c word at just about anyone.
p19195
aVHe would have read my Open Letter to David Cameron and yelled that \u201cthat cunt Fry needs another fucking dressing fucking down\u201d \u2014 just the kind of language that his paper would prissily decry of course, there\u2019s the glory in the vile bastard\u2019s hypocrisy.
p19196
aVHe sends his son to Eton, but somehow mocks me for being posh.
p19197
aVHe bullies, swears and shrieks, but presents his paper as having the values and standards of a misty Midsomer Britain.
p19198
aVHe decries indecency on one page and pushes his male readers into a semi over a semi-nude actress on another.
p19199
aVHis cancer scare, miracle cure stories are sickeningly anti-science and the only good thing to be said about his Mail is that no one decent or educated believes in it.
p19200
aVWhich is what you can say about psychics, mediums, homeopathy and the casting of runes, but that makes it, like them, more exploitative and wicked, not less.
p19201
aV&gt; Dacre is, all those who have had the misfortune to work for him assure me, just about as loathsome, self-regarding, morally putrid, vengeful and disgusting a man as it possible to be.
p19202
aVHis power is absolute.
p19203
aVCross him either in private or public and you will be assassinated by his sycophantic squad of columnist minions, all of them infected with his brand of repulsive hypocritical and gleeful spite, ready to vomit out a screed against the BBC (watch this hilarious Vine loop as an example http://entertainment.ie/wtf/Watch-If-you-think-Sky-News-was-bad-with-the-royal-baby-coverage/202884.htm ) or any other institution they hate.
p19204
aV&gt; He absolutely despises me and thinks I stand for everything that is wrong about Britain and I think exactly the same of him.
p19205
aV* I don't think you really needed a bullet point there
p19206
aVI think this is what started Stephen Frys out busts.

aVhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2387093/Why-doesnt-Stephen-Fry-ban-Russian-music-theatre-performing-arts.html\u000a\u000aRead the the daily mail article and [Frys blog](http://stephen-fry-me.tumblr.com/post/57805910021/the-daily-mail-and-lord-dacre-appeasing-again) and make up your own mind.
p19208
aVThe truth is The Sun is far far worse for stalking people.
p19209
aVMost Daily Mail "celeb" photos are staged, consensual events.
p19210
aVThe sun genuinely paps people, has women in a far greater state of undress.
p19211
aVBut no one is brigading against rebekah brooks ( she oversaw the hacking of phones ).
p19212
aVBut the labour shills have a hatred for the daily mail.
p19213
aVNot a week goes by without the Daily Mail trying to spark up a race war.
p19214
aVI've personally researched some of the things they put a racial spin on, and more often than not they have absolutely fuck all to do with race. 
p19215
aV&gt; Not a week goes by without the Daily Mail trying to spark up a race war.

aVThat's not the case at all.
p19221
aVTheir Lawyer could have said 'Your honour, Walla walla bibo balla ding dong' and the title could have read:\u000a\u000a&gt;Girl gang who kicked woman in the head while yelling 'kill the white slag' freed after judge hears 'Walla walla bibo balla ding dong'\u000a\u000aThe real reason for why the Judge was lenient with them is at the bottom of the page:\u000a\u000a&gt;Judge Brown said that \u2018those who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside\u2019.
p19222
aV&gt;But he said he accepted the women may have felt they were the victims of unreasonable force from Mr Moore as he tried to defend his girlfriend, and handed the defendants a suspended sentence.
p19223
aVSo the Daily Mail framed it as a judge letting a muslim off because they weren't used to alcohol when really he reduced their sentences because the victims partner beat the shit out of them.
p19224
aVDisgusting vile newspaper.
p19225
aVAnd in case you think that no one could possibly read the article that way, the top comments are:\u000a\u000a&gt;NO EXCUSE!!!
p19226
aVIf these women were white they would have been jailed\u000a\u000aAnd \u000a\u000a&gt;Don't know how they were able to convince the Judge that they were Muslims when they were in clear violation of the religion by being drunk anyways.
p19227
aVDisgusting behaviour ... if they don't like 'white slags' they can always go back to their country of origin.\u000a\u000a
p19228
aV&gt;But Judge Robert Brown gave them suspended jail terms after hearing mitigation that as Muslims, the women were not used to being drunk\u000a\u000ahttp://thelawdictionary.org/mitigation/\u000a\u000a&gt;Alleviation; abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment im- posed by law.
p19229
aV\u201cMitigating circumstances\u201d are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability\u000a\u000aThere were 2 sets of Mitigating circumstances.
p19230
aVYou can be sent to prison purely for assault - this was mitigated because "they were not used to drinking".
p19231
aVThey escaped near certain jail for kicking the girls head because the boyfriend had used "excessive force" to try and stop them ( that excessive force that didn't seem to deter them - you can see in the vid ).
p19232
aVI understand there is a lot of prejudice against the daily mail but but you are cherry picking one article to make a case for daily mail as racist.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p19233
aVhttps://fullfact.org/factcheck/Muslim_women_spared_jail_for_attack_because_not_used_to_drinking-3179\u000a\u000aYou are wrong.
p19234
aVThe judge didn't take any notice of the 'muslims aren't used to drinking' defense.
p19235
aVAlmost completely fabricated by The Daily Mail. 
p19236
aVhttps://fullfact.org/factcheck/Muslim_women_spared_jail_for_attack_because_not_used_to_drinking-3179\u000a\u000a\u000a "Fullfact.org" gives a contadictory statement \u000a\u000a&gt;We contacted the Judicial Office to find out more details about the case and they told us the judgement was given orally and therefore there was no written manuscript available.
p19237
aVThey did however point us towards an article written in the Leicester Mercury.
p19238
aVThey also asserted that the reference to alcohol had been made in mitigation of the accused and that the role of the victim\u2019s boyfriend was one which impacted on the judgement.
p19239
aVA) There was no written manuscript available ( suspicious in itself ) \u000a\u000aYET\u000a\u000aB) They knew exactly what the judge had said\u000a\u000aGod Bless their eidetic memory.
p19240
aVCouldn't possibly be that the Leicester Court House wanted to save one of their top judges the embarrassment of an unpopular decision.
p19241
aVI would also be very surprised if\u000a\u000a&gt;According to the Mercury, the Judge Robert Brown said, \u201cThis was ugly and reflects very badly on all four of you.
p19242
aVThose who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside, but I\u2019m going to suspend the sentence\u201d.
p19243
aV..was all of  Judge Robert Brown summing up but believe what you want.
p19244
aVIf you read that article you will also see that there are 2 other papers with the same attention grabbing headline.
p19245
aVIs your assertion that it is only racist when the Daily Mail makes a sensationalist headline or are the Metro and the Telegraph also racist?\u000a\u000a\u000a
p19246
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dacre googling things really isn't hard 
p19247
aVno it is no at all but if you google George Bush you will come up with him being a politician and not why a large majority of people don't like him.
p19248
aVIm looking for why people should stalk him not what his occupation is.
p19249
aVdont get cocky. 
p19250
aVRead the part under "Editor of the Daily Mail" you'll see the shit he's done, he's basically a bit of a twat.
p19251
aVAlso what's proposed in this thread by OP is completely stupid and would never happen
p19252
aVAmerican here!
p19253
aVWut?
p19254
aVIt's not hard to understand..
p19255
aVWell!
p19256
aVI never!
p19257
aVHave A levels finished already?
p19258
aVMy thoughts exactly.
p19259
aVThis sub should require people to post their age in their flare.
p19260
aVIt's just such a low effort 'upvote if you agree' type post that marks a clear continued decline in the quality of postings an commenting here
p19261
aVIt depresses me seeing how much my comments on this thread have been down-voted.
p19262
aVYou are down voted for off hand dismissal of an idea due to imagined age demographics. 
p19263
aVI know you're right.
p19264
aVI hate it when people are creative using their imagination as well, as it makes me feel really inferior too.
p19265
aVIt's okay though, we can all raise an eyebrow and pretend we're better than them whilst offering nothing substantial ourselves.
p19266
aVWhen you made that flair of yours did you give your thigh a great hearty slap?
p19267
aVYou boring arse.
p19268
aVFuck off back to middle-England.
p19269
aVPerhaps there should also be a spelling test at the door. 
p19270
aVI think he would probably like it. 
p19271
aVSomeone needs to do this but at least top it up to 60k this poor person will have to follow the guy around the world.
p19272
aVI'm sure some famous person or someone who has been a victim of the daily mail will pitch in.
p19273
aVi.e George Clooney.
p19274
aVHire two for 30 grand each and and 40 hours a week.
p19275
aVThen you could at least have 7 day cover.
p19276
aV60k is too much
p19277
aVSadly, even if this occurred - most people would be too scared. \u000a\u000a
p19278
aVi'll do it for 15k
p19279
aVI'll do it for £14,995
p19280
aVI'll do it for 10K + accommodation. \u000a
p19281
aVBut accommodation in London is waaaaaaaay high. 
p19282
aVI swear to god if this happens i will do it!
p19283
aV!
aVHas he done something more  appallin that normal , or is it just a general idea 
p19284
aV/r/crazyideas 
p19285
aVI'd happily contribute to this! 
p19286
aVI'm in.
p19287
aVI have wanted to do this with the TMZ idiots in NYC for years.
p19288
aVGive me half that, I'll give you pictures of what he ate for breakfast **while it's being digested**.
p19289
aVWhat if he steps down mid-year?
p19290
aVShouldn't the language reflect that the kickstarter would pay for scandalous photos of any Editor of the Daily Mail?
p19291
aVHurry OP.
p19292
aVThis is a novelty and will fade unless you or someone gets on the ball.
p19293
aVI will happily donate 20 quid if this is a thing.
p19294
aVWe shouldn't pay them to take holiday.
p19295
aVIt isn't a privilege to be rid of them.
p19296
aVSet up the kickstarter and we will be there. 
p19297
aVI think this could work as a kickstarter.
p19298
aVIt's an interesting enough thing to get the attention of some news sources, then all you need is a couple of celebs who like it enough to chip in 10k each or something
p19299
aVAgreed - and celebs can donate anonymously (there must be a way to do that) to encourage them to do it, because I bet some would savour the thought that these unethical journalists who write lies about them will suddenly have paps on them.
p19300
aVCan we do this with tom wheeler as well?
p19301
aVDon't they make a lot of money for each photo they grab?
p19302
aVOr did you just mean hire some guy with a camera, not a professional paparazzi?
p19303
aVGruniad shriters are really upset these days?
p19304
aVshotgun day 69
p19305
aV&gt; Also, I think this could be another way to raise funds: "Actually I'm kind of surprised some celebrity hasn't already done something like this.
p19306
aVThey certainly have the money.
p19307
aV" and "I'm sure some famous person or someone who has been a victim of the daily mail will pitch in.
p19308
aVi.e George Clooney.
p19309
aV"\u000a\u000aSimpsons did this already
p19310
aVHow about as a stretch goal, we have him murdered e.g.
p19311
aVat 100k.
p19312
aVAt 500k, we have his whole family murdered as well, in front of him.
p19313
aVPretty sure you can easily hire an assassin for 100 grand.
p19314
aVYou seem to be very confused about how much a professional press photographer gets paid\u000ahttp://www.londonfreelance.org/feesguide/index.php?&amp;section=Photography&amp;subsect=National+newspapers\u000a
p19315
aV£70K per year, then?
p19316
aVThat's well within Kickstarters capabilities.
p19317
aVThat's about 5000 people giving a little over a tenner.
p19318
aVI think the problem would be that to a news photographer/pap this would be career suicide. 
p19319
aVHonestly, if I could do this, enough food to cover whilst working would be enough.
p19320
aVOf course, I'd also set fire to this man for free so.
p19321
aVMaybe don't trust my judgement.
p19322
aVWe really should though.
p19323
aVI'd love to see these people get a taste of their own medicine. 
p19324
aVBTW It should be noted that Darce isn't the editor of Mail Online and only the articles that come from the paper addition have been approved by him.
p19325
aVThe sidebar isn't him. 
p19326
aVMartin Clarke is the editor of the Mail Online and is, imo, a more valid target.
p19327
aV[He looks like the ideal person to get angry on camera..](http://arifdurrani.mediaweek.co.uk/files/MailOnlineMartinClarke.jpg)
p19328
aVWhy not just get someone to stand outside his house and be our insider offering exclusive scoops on his......poops\u000a\u000aOr maybe someone in the NHS can confirm...shock....horror.....he is human after all.
p19329
aVHis own Doctor would obviously only be able to confirm he is a distant relative of a vampire squidd.
p19330
aVYes yes, this is all fun and games but the bigger picture is being missed here.
p19331
aVThe reason newspapers behave in such disgusting ways (Daily Mail or otherwise) is because people buy them.
p19332
aVIf people voted with their wallets on such behaviours, then they would be forced to change or die.
p19333
aVI have no clue how you'd go about fixing the wider problem, however...
p19334
aVWhat is it that Paul Dare did? 
p19335
aVprob be easier to just use the money to offer to buy pics of the guy, then you'd have more than one after him at any given time
p19336
aVif you guys can get me a work visa for the UK, I'll take the job for 30k.  
p19337
aVhow about creating a subreddit and a hashtag called picsofPaulDacre.
p19338
aVPeople like karma almost as much as they like money
p19339
aVI bet a few celebrities would love to contribute
p19340
aVnot really, they depend on each other.
p19341
aVIf a celeb funds this, this might mean blacklist and can't get any publicity anymore
p19342
aVAs a geneticist, can I write the most pseudoscientific bullshit going whilst also teaching a lesson about believing said bullshit?!
p19343
aVTheir "science" articles make my blood boil.
p19344
aVAnd we need something scaremongery and not Dacre related to make it more Daily Fail like...!
p19345
aVWhy not just put a 5k bounty on the most humiliating picture of the guy.
p19346
aVHe will be hounded for the bounty. 
p19347
aV&gt;MOST IMPORTANTLY - I personally don't have the time at all to be able to organise this, as much as I'd love it to happen (hence why I posted the idea on here).
p19348
aVSo if someone does have the time to set-up the Kickstarter and get it up and running, possibly once a full plan is formed, I'll personally donate at least £30 to it (and many people in these comments are saying they'll donate too).
p19349
aVLol
p19350
aVJust give random homeless people £30 and a cheap android phone  to follow him round everyday.
p19351
aVA cheaper and easier idea would be for B3TA to run it as one of their weekly 'tatoshop challenges
p19352
aVWould definitely donate time and money to this most worthy of causes.
p19353
aVI'm a web developer - if there is need of my expertise feel free to shoot me a PM for help :)
p19354
aVIf the purpose is to harass, which it seems it is, then surely this would just be harassment and therefore illegal.
p19355
aVand?
p19356
aVThis is a fantastic idea.
p19357
aVI'm in.
p19358
aVWith the most scandalous photo, get people to vote.
p19359
aVHighest wins money
p19360
aVSince Kickstarter and Indiegogo are out of the question, where's the Bitcoin wallet address we can send funds to?
p19361
aVCome on, this is 2014 and the thread has been around for a day now.
p19362
aVSo is this going ahead or not? 
p19363
aVOne of the problems with this is that to really make the same impact, they need to be published somewhere sensationalist (like the female treatment mentioned already) and widely read.
p19364
aVBut the other tabloids aren't going to bite in case it turns on them next.
p19365
aVA big social media campaign might work but...
p19366
aVI would fully support this.
p19367
aVGuys, This is the perfect project to get funding via Max Keisers crowd funding platform StartJOIN.
p19368
aVThey have a number of politically motivated crowd funding projects including a peoples water cannon that's been funded already.

aVhttps://www.startjoin.com/CannonFodder
p19370
aVWhat happened to this?
p19371
aVAbout the site that you could use to raise the money.
p19372
aVGoFundMe maybe? 
p19373
aVAre you all being serious right now?
p19374
aVI know Reddit's hate for papers like the Daily Mail is pretty obsessive, but raising thousands of pounds to hire someone to stalk someone else literally takes this into creepy stalker territory.
p19375
aVThis is fucking weird.
p19376
aVNo.
p19377
aVIts just a job.
p19378
aVWhere there's demand there's supply!
p19379
aVI'd have to disagree.
p19380
aVI think this is actually genuinely in the public interest for once.
p19381
aVIt just gives me that vibe of 15 year old boys plotting to take revenge on a girl that's been mean to them.
p19382
aV&gt;but raising thousands of pounds to hire someone to stalk someone else literally takes this into creepy stalker territory.
p19383
aVThat's exactly what they do, with legal immunity under the guise of 'free press'.. 
p19384
aVSo?
p19385
aVAnd emulating then makes it right?
p19386
aVNo.
p19387
aVIt just makes you all look like massive hypocrites.
p19388
aVIt's a form of protest, and most of all it's a bit of a laugh. 
p19389
aVIf you're 15, maybe.

aVAm I Missing something?

aVYour solution to someone behaving badly is to behave as badly as them?

aVYou Sir are a genius!
p19394
aVBetter start saving your pocket money guys
p19395
aVI'll throw in a fiver for a photo of his expression whilst squeezing out a large shit.

aVSour cream with roasted vegetables is so damn good.

aVI will always be grateful to an Aussie housemate who introduced me to that.
p19420
aVI dip everything even remotely crisp related in it.
p19421
aVIt's great on a baked sweet potato too. 
p19422
aVYep, I managed to find some in my Waitrose, but until recently not in any of the others.
p19423
aVTesco has now some excellent sour cream in the Polish fridge, but still not in the regular ones.
p19424
aVWait.
p19425
aVA Polish immigrant shopping in Waitrose?
p19426
aVThe Daily Mail was right!
p19427
aVBut I go shopping to TK MAXX sometimes, does that make it even?
p19428
aVWell someone has to.
p19429
aVYeah you can get sour cream in every supermarket here.
p19430
aVI'm not sure why you've been having problems getting it....
p19431
aVI buy at least 2 tubs a week from sainsburys, tesco or the co-op.
p19432
aVThat's odd.
p19433
aVI've never had a problem getting it.
p19434
aVIt's usually with the other creams near the milk and yogurt sections.

aVYes that's it.

aVIf you are buying it from [Waitrose this is it](http://www.waitrose.com/shop/HeaderSearchCmd?searchTerm=soured+cream&amp;defaultSearch=GR&amp;search=)\u000a\u000aI think we call it soured in the UK to differentiate it from milk that has gone off/bad or "gone sour".

aVOne time the delivery guy threw a book in the one puddle of water in our front yard.
p19494
aVIt is like he went out of his way to be incompetent.
p19495
aVedit: I still love the UK by far.
p19496
aVNice people, little to no guns or gang violence, police are friendly, weather is awesome compared to the south, and the majority of people accept evolution as fact. \u000a
p19497
aVTell me about it.
p19498
aV6 months after moving into my flat i get a bill from British Gas for £73(ish) for my gas usage.
p19499
aVNow i was gonna just go straight ahead and pay this without thinking but then i realised...I don't HAVE gas The whole BUILDING isn't connected to the gas mains!?
p19500
aVI contacted them and they said there must have been "a mistake" but they just kept sending these letters out OVER &amp; OVER &amp; OVER, in the end I'd just stuff them straight in the bin, but now I have since moved house and i STILL receive FINAL NOTICE letters from debt collection agencies demanding the above mentioned £73(ish)\u000a\u000a(Just for the record i have never had an account with British Gas, and nore will I be willing to after this ENORMOUS fuck up!
p19501
aV)
aVthe magic word is "disappointed" \u000a\u000ayou call up, and say (slowly, with pauses) : "oh, but I keep getting these bills even though you just told me that it is a mistake.
p19502
aVi am very ... ... ... disappointed"\u000a\u000ai've actually gotten money back for 2 services (netflix and a tesco phone contract) that i canceled 2-3 days too late .
p19503
aV(for the monthly billing) (5 and 15 pounds, respectively)
p19504
aVI was thinking about moving to London from the states.
p19505
aVThink I'll just go on vacation.
p19506
aV....to Paris
p19507
aVScrew London mate, you should come up North..... Tonnes better beautiful countryside, friendly people, decent beer.
p19508
aVCheaper prices.
p19509
aVJust prepare for bad weather!
p19510
aVBut you will love it 
p19511
aVNah, you can always complain about the weather.
p19512
aVDon't forget that.
p19513
aVWhat is this?
p19514
aVComplacency about the weather?
p19515
aVNah complaining about the weather is about as british as it gets.
p19516
aVTo cold.
p19517
aVTo rainy.
p19518
aVTo hot.
p19519
aVNot enougth rain (that one is admitadly a rare complaint only made by folks with a garden or allotment.
p19520
aV)\u000a\u000aIts part of british culture to complain about the weather.
p19521
aVAlso a goto ice breaker subject.
p19522
aV[Bill Hicks used to do a bit about how he likes Britain because it actually has weather and compares it too L.A saying that hot and sunny gets old fast.
p19523
aV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPr9wVqA_RY)\u000a\u000aAlways gave me a chuckle and made me appreciate UK weather, if only for the fact it serves as an amazing conversation piece that saves us a world of awkward silences.

aV&gt;Too cold.
p19526
aVToo rainy.
p19527
aVToo hot.
p19528
aVNot enough rain (that one is admittedly a rare complaint only made by folks with a garden or allotment.
p19529
aV)\u000a\u000aSorry.
p19530
aVNot trying to be a dick, had you fix that. 
p19531
aVForget weather, how good is your boiler contract?
p19532
aVWTF is a boiler contract?
p19533
aVIt's a short term agreement where your boiler promises not to break down during the coldest of months.
p19534
aV&gt; I would just give you a strange look if asked if I want some bloody vinegar on my chips\u000a\u000aHe won me over with that.
p19535
aVSwearing at the level of "slight irritation" using the word "bloody".
p19536
aVYou have to get British points for that.
p19537
aVThanks :) I appreciate the credit.
p19538
aVI do love British way of speaking, always did, together with your sense of humour.
p19539
aV[deleted]
p19540
aVHold on.
p19541
aVThis foreigner only just accepted vinegar on his chips.
p19542
aVTreat him with utmost suspicion, chaps.
p19543
aVThe Dutch have convinced me to put mayonnaise on my chips.
p19544
aVBut I can be forgiven, because I put crushed garlic in the mayo first, and that is something the Dutch have not yet discovered.
p19545
aVadd a bit of dill and some onion powder and you will basically have the "ranch dressing" the Americans dip theirs in
p19546
aVClose, ranch is mayonnaise and sour cream with some spices (at least homemade, we're not sure what the bottled stuff is made of).
p19547
aVMayonnaise with spices would just be "dip", for veggies or potato chips (uh, crisps?
p19548
aV)
aVReal homemade ranch generally has buttermilk instead of sour cream, at least in the part of the country that I'm in.
p19549
aVIs sour cream a regional thing?
p19550
aVI was born here...and i hate salt OR vinegar on my chips.
p19551
aVAm i a suspect, too?
p19552
aVPractically makes you a foreign spy.
p19553
aV*removes red carnation from lapel, goes back to lurking in the shadows*
p19554
aVPoppy, not carnation. 
p19555
aVNo one said he was a good spy.
p19556
aVI'm not talking about the remembrance poppy, more the cliché of spies in black and white movies identifying themselves to fellow spies and informants by wearing a particular flower in a lapel.
p19557
aVEasy to spot, yet inconspicuous.
p19558
aVWho hates Salt on chips!?
p19559
aV!
aVI think more than I am, at this moment.

aV/r/philosophy

aVHe's gone native.
p19562
aVWon't witter on about British taps, barely remembers to slip in sour milk by the end - sounds like a friend of mine who claims to be German on the dubious grounds of having been born and raised in Bavaria.
p19563
aVBut what does he order in a pub?
p19564
aV&gt; But what does he order in a pub?
p19565
aVIf it's a pint of real ale and a bag of salted nuts he gets a fast tracked passport.
p19566
aV(Scampi Fries optional extra, of course.
p19567
aV)
aVTechnically, he has to order a pint of bitter from a pump.
p19568
aVCAMRA membership isn't an absolute requirement.
p19569
aVBonus points are scored if he gets slightly miffed that the local eastern european offie has 57 varieties of bottled lager and one type of canned bitter - *and never mentions it*.

aVTake a stroll through London, rack that up in an afternoon
p19573
aV&gt; Ill people at work.
p19574
aVA common problem.
p19575
aVEmployers seem to think that if they can't see you then you aren't working.
p19576
aVMy partner works in a place where if you are sick more than 3 times a year, you need a doctors note for everything for the next 12 months.
p19577
aVI'm not even sure if the NHS will do this.
p19578
aVSo people come in to work in an open plan office really sick and it spreads, then the management complain about high sickness rates.
p19579
aVMeanwhile if I'm sick I just log in from home and do what I can, nothing quite like attending a meeting from the comfort of bed.
p19580
aV&gt; Education.
p19581
aVA contentious point, but one I feel has validity. 
p19582
aVAs someone who has been a union rep, I've railed against several past employers for hounding people who were sick.
p19583
aVDrives me up the wall.
p19584
aVIf you are well, you work, if you are ill, you stay at home.
p19585
aVIf anyone harasses or bullies you because you're ill, then screw the fucker to a wall with the grievance policy when you get back in.
p19586
aVOnly incident I had that approached this personally, was with a manager asking me, if the "stomach issue I had was serious, or if I could come in anyway".
p19587
aVHad to respond that it was unpleasant, as I kept on having to go to the toilet every half hour or so, and would worry about my discomfort while getting to, coming back from, and while at work.
p19588
aVThe manager replied that they'd need more details than that to 'authorise the absence'.
p19589
aVI gave more details.
p19590
aVSomething to be said for describing a catastrophic bowel movement, noises and and all and then asking your manager to double check if they've spelt the words 'consistency' and 'diarrhoea' correctly in their notes, then reminding them it needs to be filed with HR by close of business.
p19591
aVThey never asked me for 'more details' for further incidents of sickness.
p19592
aV&gt; The manager replied that they'd need more details than that to 'authorise the absence'.
p19593
aVI don't even know what to say to this.  
p19594
aVWell, what I said worked.
p19595
aVUnsurprisingly that it was at that point I joined a union, and decided to get training as a rep, 'cos I managed to get past it with toilet references and a sense of humour - but I've since seen the effect that such managers have on people first hand.
p19596
aVSadly this stupidity is not limited to the UK.
p19597
aVI'm sure it's not.
p19598
aVI just find this particular situation quite ludicrous.
p19599
aVI missed 2 days of work last week because my stomach got destroyed by NSAIDS.
p19600
aVSo I called my boss and said "My stomach is not feeling well, I'm not going to be able to make it in.
p19601
aV"\u000a\u000aI got an "OK" in reply.
p19602
aVWhere I work, if we're off work sick more than 3 episodes in 12 months ( that could be three, one day episodes) we have to have a meeting with our manager.
p19603
aVIt makes us nervous to take time off when we're ill!
p19604
aVWhat in the fuck?
p19605
aV!
aVCan confirm this applies to most companies in uk.
p19606
aV4 being the norm IMO.
p19607
aVIt's weird and invasive but the meetings are meant to 'help you get back to work' and 'understand what we as a company can do to stop you getting ill'.
p19608
aVI had one of these once.
p19609
aVI asked them if they could cure chronic asthma and the common cold.
p19610
aVThey did not see the humour. 
p19611
aV"How can we stop you getting ill?
p19612
aV"\u000a\u000a"Stop making sick co-workers come to the office.
p19613
aV"
aVIt's all about the Bradford Factor, a nasty bit of impersonal number crunching to catch absenteeism.
p19614
aVThe basic version is:\u000a\u000a(No.
p19615
aVepisodes)^2 * No.
p19616
aVof days off over a rolling year\u000a\u000aSo one 10 sickness episode will give you 10 points whereas ten 1 day episodes will give you 1000 points -  the threshold for a Return to Work interview is normally around 500.
p19617
aVThe upshot is if you need to take a day off, might as well take 2 to make sure you are fully recovered.
p19618
aVSource: Provide HR related services for monies. 
p19619
aVI agree with the ill people one - that needs to be dealt with stricter as it makes more people ill.
p19620
aVI cannot disagree enough with the education one.
p19621
aVThe A level system is quite simply one of the best in the world in my opinion.
p19622
aVYes the GCSE's are shite but the A Levels are amazing.
p19623
aVI was talking with my Romanian friend (we are both doing masters in Computer Science) as he said that the courses were easier here, and that is certainly true at the high school level, but at A level (and especially Further Maths) far exceeds what they had studied and is one of the reasons that allows for us to have shorter degrees than the USA.
p19624
aV(Although the lack of students actually taking Further Maths etc.
p19625
aVis an issue)\u000a\u000aIncompetence at services you also get in Germany etc.
p19626
aVand it's a bit silly to let a few experiences be the picture of a whole country - my hairdresser is fine (although ironically she's also Polish...)\u000a\u000aBut seriously the depth of study that A levels offer and the freedom to only study what you want to study is virtually unparalleled except in the Commonwealth nations which copied our system.
p19627
aVI know people like to complain about Britain but that is one system that I think we got right.
p19628
aVFreedom to study what you want is fairly common across Europe.
p19629
aVIn fact, in this respect, I do find the A-levels a bit restrictive.
p19630
aVDepth is very good though, I agree.
p19631
aVI think people's beef with education comes down to inequality of services.
p19632
aVOver the years, I have lived in a few other European countries and nowhere else have I found the variance in quality between schools so huge.
p19633
aVOf course, there are good and bad schools everywhere, but I would say a bad Swedish school will prepare a student better than a bad UK one and a good student at a bad Swedish school will not have a handicap as big as a good student at a bad UK school.
p19634
aVPeople I was acquainted with at university always used to say things like "85% of people from my school go to Oxford or Cambridge" or "I'm the first person from my school to go to Oxford".
p19635
aVAnd I always found statements such as that one quite baffling and, indeed, indicative of the problem I am describing.
p19636
aVNow this comes down to several factors - political system, society, the (comparably) incredible prevalence and prominence of private education in the UK - so it is not easily solved, but this is something that has always struck me as quite strange, considering how generally proud people seem to be of education in the UK. 
p19637
aVI agree that I know the education system only up to the GCSE level here, as my stepson is only starting his A Levels right now.
p19638
aVMy opinions are based on what I have seen till now - and I have seen a general attitude of "I don't have to do anything and I'll pass through the school anyway", kids not held accountable for almost anything, no ongoing assessment of the work the do (or not do), only the "big test at the end" environment.
p19639
aVNot very supporting for ongoing development in my opinion.
p19640
aVThe big problem - and it's been a problem since more-or-less forever - is that GCSEs don't really prepare you for A-levels.
p19641
aVUsually what happens is 16 year old kids come out of school with a number of GCSEs and they're absolutely convinced they're God's gift.
p19642
aVThey then have the shock of their life when they start A-levels; you really have to step up a gear for them.
p19643
aVI can personally attest to that. 
p19644
aVEVERYONE who's done GCSEs and A-levels can personally attest to that.
p19645
aVAs someone who's about to start sixth form, I'm glad that I get to hear this before I begin and fuck up.
p19646
aVGood luck.
p19647
aVIf it's any comfort, if you can manage A-levels you'll find a degree to be a breeze by comparison.
p19648
aVPlus you can legally drink when you're at university.
p19649
aVI dunno up until A levels you barely learn much anyway.
p19650
aVAnd A levels used to have exams at Christmas and in the summer every year, then my Uni did the same.
p19651
aVI went 6 years without being able to relax at Christmas (I did a 4 year integrated Physics Masters).
p19652
aVSo if anything it was like having exams all the time, but I understand that's changed now.
p19653
aVThe issue is that the governments idea to fix education was to make every student pass their GCSE's.
p19654
aVIt was soon realised that making children smarter is hard work and would not ensure this promise be delivered on.
p19655
aVthe solution was then to simply make exams easier and constantly fiddle with the mark scheme so the statistics look good, disregarding what children actually learn from school.
p19656
aVI don't get sick pay.
p19657
aVIf I don't go to work, I don't get paid.
p19658
aVI struggle to eat as it is.
p19659
aVYou buggers can get sick for all I care, I would like to eat at the cost of one days unpleasant illness.
p19660
aVEdit: A lot of helpful people are coming forward to inform me of Statutory Sick Pay.
p19661
aVI do know about this, and yes it is a legal requirement, however it is for 5 days and above.
p19662
aVIf I've got a ~~whooping~~ heaving cough or tonsillitis, that's 1-4 days.
p19663
aVI'm not losing that amount of money just to avoid you guys getting sick.
p19664
aVI'm coming in even if it does spread to the rest of you.
p19665
aVI have to eat. 
p19666
aV&gt; Cheques.
p19667
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p19668
aVIt's XXI century.
p19669
aVI don't know.
p19670
aVI don't remember the last time I used one.
p19671
aVIs someone really asking for one?
p19672
aVI don't know how I'd deal with that.
p19673
aV&gt; And the last one... Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p19674
aVSee point 13.
p19675
aVThere was a plan to switch over to mph (and therefore presumably l/100km) but the tabloids scuppered that by paiting it as a German invasion.
p19676
aVIm about to qualify as a paramedic and I can only pay my registration fees by cheque or standing order.
p19677
aVWAT.
p19678
aVMy fiancee is a competing horse rider, and all the entries to competitions are to be paid by cheques.
p19679
aVOnly Eventing now accepts card payments, but Dressage and Show Jumping as far as I know still require cheques.
p19680
aVLocal riding club wanted a membership fee as a cheque.
p19681
aVWhen my energy company finally repaid me, they did it with a cheque.
p19682
aVBut mostly, when I look at it now, it's horsey people, lol :)
p19683
aVIs the riding club mostly staffed by nice old ladies?
p19684
aVIt does seem to be an age thing in my experience.
p19685
aVOver a certain age, people are comfortable with cheques.
p19686
aVPersonally I hate the things.
p19687
aVI do agree we're a bit behind here.
p19688
aV- in Germany it seems more typical than not to give people an IBAN.
p19689
aVI think you got it right :)
p19690
aVYou get cheques because they can be posted and only you get it.
p19691
aVThey can't transfer money into your account, because its not quite set up like that.
p19692
aVA paper trail in these instances is good.
p19693
aVIts not like they are going to post you cash.
p19694
aVAs for horse club, that just because they have always done that.
p19695
aVI bet school trips for your son would be the same. 
p19696
aV&gt;My fiancee is a competing horse rider, and all the entries to competitions are to be paid by cheques.
p19697
aVThey're riding bloody horses and you're surprised they're behind the times?
p19698
aV!
aVNice post, it's interesting to read perspectives like this.
p19699
aVSome of your points (bad service etc) sound like they're just down to bad personal luck rather than systemic cultural problems.
p19700
aVPeople who litter do exist and are twats but to be honest I'm always surprised by how clean the tube is given the amount of people using it and the lack of bins in stations.
p19701
aV&gt; Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place\u000a\u000aI'm sure plenty of people here will disagree with that one.
p19702
aVMaybe they need some perspective?
p19703
aVThe boiler thing amused me, I didn't realise it was such a thing until I bought my flat and suddenly everyone at work was talking to me about boilers.
p19704
aV(I've got an Intergas combi with a 5 year parts and labour warranty, in case you were wondering)
p19705
aVI think the bad service aspect is a little more endemic than people like to believe.
p19706
aVI've spent my life living in quite a few countries and the one thing I've noticed here is that the service seems a little incompetent when compared to the rest of the developed world.
p19707
aVI've been living in the UK for a year and a half and it's one of the things that annoy me.
p19708
aVI'm studying in Brighton and it's something a lot of international students complain about.
p19709
aVFriends of mine in London don't seem to have as much of an issue with services when compared to friends in other parts of the UK though.
p19710
aVI just finished living out in Kent for a year.
p19711
aVEarly on I got stuck in a weird systemic 'eddy' that I found endlessly frustrating.
p19712
aVTo open a bank account in the UK I needed ID (my Canadian passport) and proof of residence (gas bill or some such), to get into this residence the bank wanted proof of I needed a bank account.
p19713
aVIf I need a bank account before I can rent a flat...but I need a bill from my flat before I can have a bank account WTF am I supposed to do?!?
p19714
aVI also experienced OPs fiasco with the hairdresser.
p19715
aVWent to a local barbershop and gave him the same description I've given every hairdresser I've ever had in Canada.
p19716
aV#3 on the back and sides, leave enough of the front for me to put a little hair glue in it.
p19717
aVHere in Canada, this description always yields [this](http://frenzyofnoise.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Caesar-Haircuts.jpg).
p19718
aVWhen the guy in the UK was done with me, he'd given me [this](http://www.trendirstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/undercut-hairstyle-men-1920.jpg).
p19719
aVJesus, what a difference.
p19720
aVHe's even changed your eye colour.
p19721
aVI don't really care about my hair so I usually give a really vague instruction like, "can you make it shorter please.
p19722
aVBut not TOO short!".
p19723
aVI tend to get roughly what I want.
p19724
aVThis hit me recently.
p19725
aVI've lived in the UK since birth and just realised I've never had a good haircut in my life.
p19726
aVTHIS IS WHY EVERYONE HAS THAT HAIRSTYLE HERE!
p19727
aVI just thought it was popular (and an Essex thing).
p19728
aVI'm bald so had no idea it's all the hairdressers know.
p19729
aVI've also lived abroad for quite a lot of my life (and various places all over the UK) and agree about the services, especially regarding hairdressing.
p19730
aVIt is mindbogglingly difficult to find a competent hairdresser here who will actually pay attention to instructions and then be able to carry them out.
p19731
aVIt took ages to find the one I currently go to and I don't know what I would do if he left.
p19732
aVI can never understand why it should be so difficult for something like this.
p19733
aVPeople working in services just don't seem to give a shit here.
p19734
aVWhat happened to taking pride in your work, no matter what it is?
p19735
aVMy theory is that people in services don't get much recognition from the rest of society in the UK, which is demotivating.
p19736
aVUnlike in places like SE Asia for example, where everyone is entitled to respect even a field labourer.
p19737
aVYes, I've thought about this.
p19738
aVI take the theory that it's not people in the service industry not giving a shit as much as customers being too polite to complain.
p19739
aVPlus a lot of companies feel like once they have your money they are free to give zero fucks.
p19740
aVA utilities company just took 8 months to return £650 to me. 
p19741
aVI think it's because no one directly complains.
p19742
aVThey usually just take the disappointment and move on.
p19743
aVBitch about it later.
p19744
aV\u000a\u000a"Mustn't grumble"
p19745
aVIt's also the reason why stuff gets so expensive, we'll tolerate it and not complain.
p19746
aVBrits are one of the few peoples who are happy on the surface to pay money for old rope. 
p19747
aVHm, I live in Germany and I really miss friendly customer service from the UK - here you're treated like you're a burden, in the UK they at least smile and say hello.
p19748
aVI'd personally rather get my furniture in a complete set with precisely correct amount of pieces required for assembly even if provided by an absolute and utter c*nt.
p19749
aVYou see, I've come to realise in year 10 of my intimate relationship with the UK that service providers at large think that politeness covers for incompetence.
p19750
aVSo I second (and third) everything on the subject.
p19751
aVAs a German American living in the US, I can see both sides.
p19752
aVIn England, they deliver what is fashionable and deliver it somewhat politely.
p19753
aVIn Germany, they deliver what you asked for, but describe exactly how poorly your next social event will go when your friends see what you try to pass for taste.
p19754
aVI'm not exactly sure what I would prefer. 
p19755
aV&gt; service providers at large think that politeness covers for incompetence\u000a\u000aI've found in the U.S. South that folks seem to think being friendly and talking nonstop covers for incompetence and laziness. \u000a\u000a

p19757
aVI fly out for my dental work to Poland anyway.
p19758
aVBetter equipment and way cheaper than private dental work here.
p19759
aVI don't know why you're getting downvoted for that, it's definitely a thing for people here to go on "dental holidays".
p19760
aVNumber 9. is probably partly because we lack bins at railway stations due to the IRA having a nasty habit of leaving bombs in them.
p19761
aVIt doesn't excuse the behaviour, but I previously remember asking a station worker where the nearest rubbish bin was and was told to just leave it by a station pillar/wall.
p19762
aVSince then we are slowly seeing them come back, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as you might expect 
p19763
aVThe modern take on this is to have bins without sides, and clear, see-through bags.
p19764
aVjust hanging from a hoop.
p19765
aVThey look silly, but same logic (making it harder to leave bombs in them)
p19766
aVAlso almost no metal shrapnal from the bin when the bomb explodes.
p19767
aVHaha, it's so interesting to see things from someone else's perspective!
p19768
aVLike the double tap thing, it never even occurred to me it was strange until I went abroad.
p19769
aVThe only comment I can offer is that we love working boilers because cold showers are horrible, and we survive the british winter by taking lots of baths!
p19770
aVYeah, but there are other countries in cold climates.
p19771
aVBritain is the only one to have consistent boiler problems.
p19772
aVGrowing up in New England, I can count on one hand the number of times I had trouble with the hot water supply.
p19773
aVIn three years in England I've lost count already.
p19774
aVI can´t recall anytime that I've run out of hot water, and I live in Sweden.
p19775
aVI´m not even sure whether we even have a boiler in our house, we just have hot water that magically appears through the power of welfare i guess..
p19776
aVCan confirm, I live in Finland and hot water magically appears out of nowhere.
p19777
aVE: Confirm, not corfirm!
p19778
aV&gt; Yeah, but there are other countries in cold climates.
p19779
aVBritain is the only one to have consistent boiler problems.
p19780
aVAnd the only one to have really fucked up windows.
p19781
aVGood half of the places I stayed in still had SINGLE glazing - do you think you live in some fucking Sahara, son???
p19782
aVAnd then complain and moan about rising gas prices - just fix your own house, FFS!!
p19783
aV!
aVI have quickly accustomed to double tap but short taps that even infants wouldn't be able to wash their hands under, are beyond my understanding.
p19784
aVWhat is the double tap thing?
p19785
aVAs in, not a mixer tap.
p19786
aVHaha!
p19787
aVI thought he meant a quick double tap on the car horn rather than a sustained blast.
p19788
aVWas confuzzled.
p19789
aVYes, was also thinking along the lines of Zombieland's double tap.
p19790
aVhttp://www.zombielandrules.com/zombieland-rule-2-double-tap/ (sorry-- am on mobile) 
p19791
aVWhat is the mixer tap thing?
p19792
aVFaucets\u000a\u000aThey mean faucets.
p19793
aVA double tap is one of those dumbass sinks where you can have either hot OR cold, but not warm, unless you fill up the nasty ass sink with water and stick your hands in it.
p19794
aVwhy would you do this to yourself?
p19795
aVThis is masochistic.
p19796
aV... and like every other american, I thought he meant whenever he is shooting.
p19797
aV[the fun double tap?
p19798
aV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_tap)
p19799
aVThat we have hot and cold taps.
p19800
aVAnd other countries mock us for it, saying the hot tap is too hot, the cold tap is too cold...and we should have one tap that you can adjust the temperature of.
p19801
aVBut why don't you?
p19802
aVBecause cultural blind spot.
p19803
aVI got a new kitchen and bathroom, plumber put mixer tap in the kitchen (I'd have been annoyed if he hadn't) but double taps in the bathroom and I didn't even how mental that was until a couple of months later
p19804
aVDouble tab in the bathroom is the worst ...
p19805
aVI want to wash my face with lukewarm water, and I can't just fill the sink with both taps and use that same water for the entire process, since it would defeat the entire washing purpose.
p19806
aVI have to use the bathtub tap, and it feels really silly :&lt; 
p19807
aV&gt; I want to wash my face with lukewarm water\u000a\u000aThat's what the 10-second period from where the water goes from cold--&gt;scalding hot is for!
p19808
aVGood luck getting the soapy water off though.
p19809
aVIt started off because we were one of the first countries in the world to have both hot and cold running water, and it was simplest to have the cold water tap as before, and the hot water one coming from the boiler to a separate tap, and it kind of stuck.
p19810
aVAnd considering the age of a lot of the houses in the UK, they haven't all been updated yet.
p19811
aVMost modern ones are joined though.
p19812
aVI lived in a dorm built in 1992 in London.
p19813
aVIt had double taps.
p19814
aVAlways double-tap.
p19815
aVI'm an immigrant but I lived long enough to forget about the double tap being weird.
p19816
aVNow that I'm reminded of it again, I'll be pissed off next time I'm using one.
p19817
aVI'm so, so, sorry about it.
p19818
aVPlease accept my sincere apologies.
p19819
aVYour use the the word 'bloody' in almost every sentence leads me to believe you've assimilated just fine!
p19820
aVAnd I think I'm way overusing the word 'cheers' in my real life.
p19821
aVI think worrying about over-using turns of phrase is in itself an aspect of British culture!
p19822
aVImpossible.
p19823
aVCheers.
p19824
aVMy girlfriend is Slovak, and was also incorrect like you when it comes to vinegar on chips.
p19825
aVShe's been here 10 years now, and still hasn't accepted her wrongness.
p19826
aVHow can I bring her to the light?
p19827
aVAlso, I really enjoyed reading that stuff.
p19828
aVMore if you have any :-)
p19829
aVWell, I tried it when I moved in and it was disgusting.
p19830
aVI tried it few weeks ago and it was quite good.
p19831
aVNo idea what changed in between.
p19832
aVBecoming a local?
p19833
aV11 years here, still can't accept your soggy chips.
p19834
aVFuck that, I'm going back home!
p19835
aV(this may be a way to reduce immigration - feed everyone vinegary chips at the border and tell them there's nothing else available to eat once you stay?
p19836
aV)\u000a
p19837
aVFun!
p19838
aV&gt;Ill people at work.
p19839
aVI hate this.
p19840
aVA guy I work with hasn't been off ill in 12 years.
p19841
aVHe's ill sometimes and just sits and coughs and sniffs.
p19842
aVMate, your job isn't so important that you can't take 2 days off to get better, and when *I* get ill because you're coughing shit at me, I'm staying home and drinking chicken soup and watching reruns of friends.
p19843
aV&gt;"Do not hog the right/middle lane".
p19844
aVLet me stop you right there.
p19845
aVThere is no 'right' or 'middle' lane.
p19846
aVThere are only 2 lanes - the inside lane, and overtaking lanes.
p19847
aVYou stay on the inside lane if you're coming off at the next junction, if you're a slower moving vehicle (caravans, lorries, wide loads etc).
p19848
aVYou use the overtaking lanes to overtake other vehicles.
p19849
aVThat is it.
p19850
aVIf you're overtaking lorries and you're doing the speed limit and not driving like a mug, then fine, use the passing lane.
p19851
aVIgnore that tosser behind you who thinks he's Mad fucking Max 2014 with his black Audi and LED strips who refuses to use the passing lane to go around you.
p19852
aVIf you're doing the same speed as the lorries but won't move over 'in case you get boxed in', you're being a prick.
p19853
aVIt's context-sensitive, but fyi, INSIDE LANE, OVERTAKING LANES.
p19854
aVHere's the article in the highway code regarding lane discipline: https://www.gov.uk/motorways-253-to-273/lane-discipline-264-to-266\u000a\u000a&gt;Insure EVERYTHING.
p19855
aVIt's a jungle to understand what I really need, and what is just being actively sold to me.
p19856
aVInsurance you *need*: car insurance.
p19857
aVIt's illegal to drive without it.
p19858
aVEverything else is optional.
p19859
aVI insure stuff I could not afford to replace if it broke.
p19860
aVSome people think it's dumb, I don't give a fuck.
p19861
aVI could put away money in a savings account and get stuff replaced, but I don't.
p19862
aVI don't have much insurance.
p19863
aVBut basically, if you think you need it, you should get it.
p19864
aVDo not listen to *anybody* who works for the company.
p19865
aVThey want you to buy it, because you give them a monthly income.
p19866
aVThere are plenty of finance websites/forums/subreddits that can help you with this.
p19867
aV&gt;I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected.
p19868
aVI hate: train tickets price.
p19869
aVWTF, I know someone who spends over 1/3 of his salary just to get to work for a month!
p19870
aVI'm glad the trains are good for you - they suck for me.
p19871
aVRegularly late, cancelled, short, terrible.
p19872
aVIt also costs nearly 1/4 of my salary to get to work each month.
p19873
aVI fucking hate - no, I *loath* the train services.
p19874
aVOurs are the most expensive in Europe I think.
p19875
aV&gt;Daily Mail.
p19876
aVSeriously?
p19877
aVWho buys this... thing?
p19878
aVPeople who blame our problems on the flavour of the month.
p19879
aVSome months it's immigrants, other months it's muslim extremists, other months it's the youth of today, and other times it's because of change.
p19880
aVBasically it's sensationalist nonsense written by sell-outs for traditionalist, conservatives morons.
p19881
aV&gt;David Cameron.
p19882
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p19883
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p19884
aVHow someone like that becomes a Prime Minister, I don't know.
p19885
aVAnd people generally believe what he says.
p19886
aVWhich brings me to...\u000a\u000aCome on.
p19887
aVOl' boy Davey' C ain't that bad.
p19888
aVI could write a 30,000 dissertation on how much of a cunt that guy is and only scratch the surface, but to single him out it's pretty stupid.
p19889
aVNearly all politicians are power-driven, narcissistic, sociopathic maniacs not fit to run a country.
p19890
aVThe problem is, no one normal wants to step up to the plate.
p19891
aVAnd even if they did, they couldn't, because the barrier of entry is huge and complex.
p19892
aVAnd even if they *did* get in, they'd be worse at running it than the politicians are.
p19893
aVWe have 2 hopes - Bob Hope, and no hope.
p19894
aV&gt;Education.
p19895
aVI admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy\u000a\u000aJeez, don't get me started.
p19896
aVWe teach our children to memorise data and information, then regurgitate said information in order to tick all the boxes, so that when they go out to the working world they can do exactly that - regurgitate data and information and put it all into a spreadsheet haha.
p19897
aVNah I think education is fucked.
p19898
aVAs you say, we don't teach self-improvement at all, and a lot of kids feel entitled and thus have no desire to seek out worth for themselves.
p19899
aVI was one of those kids who cruised through school and thought it would all come to me on a plate.
p19900
aVI finished uni, went to work in a job I hate, realised my adulthood would be depressing unless I fixed something, and now I'm actively seeking a new career path - I go away for training in 2 months to France.
p19901
aVJust a quick input on education.
p19902
aVThe quality of the education provided is very dependent on where you live in the UK.
p19903
aVIn some places it is better than others.
p19904
aVAlso parents seem to have forgotten that a child's education is also on them.
p19905
aVI cannot force your child to do its homework properly, you have to do that.
p19906
aVAlso a lot of parents want to change things around because they feel a teacher 'doesn't like' their child so they should be in a different class.
p19907
aVOur education system is actually quite good at not just making people regurgitate what they have learned.
p19908
aVNow they want people to draw their own conclusions, investigate for themselves etc.
p19909
aVYou cant forget that at the end of the day there are going to be lazy children and there will be engaged children who care.
p19910
aVMuch of that is to do with parenting.
p19911
aVIf your parents just skate along then you will be happy to do the same.
p19912
aVTake heart anyway in the fact that our education system is leaps ahead of the US where they really are just taught how to pass a test.
p19913
aVI believe that the main points of "regurgitation of data" is aimed at GCSEs.
p19914
aVThey are almost completely regurgitation in the subjects which allow it, or in the other ones it's "learn the method specific to this.
p19915
aVUse this method, always.
p19916
aV", or at least that's what it's like nowadays.
p19917
aVEven in the sciences, which should be all about the scientific method of how to collect results correctly, there only seems to be regurgitation, especially for the unit 1 (and 2?
p19918
aV) papers, with a bunch of knowledge which you will probably never use, never need to use, and will probably forget as soon as possible (something about nickel and 60°C comes to mind - that's either hardening oils or something to do with "cracking"...
p19919
aVI think the former).
p19920
aVA levels, I've been assured, are much better (and I'm just going into them so I really, *really* hope they are), and also much more difficult (which should be good as it means it'll be more of an in-depth study... Hopefully...).
p19921
aVHowever, GCSEs at the very least are not particularly taxing on the *application* of things, but rather the *memorisation* of things (generally useless or not particularly useful facts).
p19922
aVThey are important, of course, to know, especially if you're going to be working in those sorts of fields, but I think the methods are a lot more important in a wide variety of subjects.
p19923
aVOh, and the English (Literature?
p19924
aV) GCSE seems to be complete rubbish.
p19925
aVRegurgitate complicated words which might apply, and lie through your teeth saying "X" is evidence for "Y", even if you honestly think there is no link between X and Y whatsoever.
p19926
aVSure, the education system is better than a lot of countries, I'm sure, and it's good at and past A levels, so I'm told, but GCSEs really don't seem to be based on learning a topic, but instead memorising facts to the best of your ability (and learning how to pass the test).
p19927
aVOther than the language GCSEs that is, as it's pretty difficult to just memorise facts for those which don't actually help you with the language.
p19928
aVUpvoted for middle lane points.
p19929
aV&gt; Ours are the most expensive in Europe I think.
p19930
aVMaybe, but they\u2019re not as bad as Austria\u2019s.
p19931
aVThis post is pretty interesting to me as I just moved to the UK a few days ago and everything seems a little bizarre to me of course.
p19932
aVI'm from the US and I have a lot of new things to discover and figure out yet.
p19933
aVWelcome to the country.
p19934
aVHave you inspected your boiler yet?
p19935
aVIn case I ever visit a home in Britain is it appropriate to bring a complimentary boiler as a gift?
p19936
aVIn what manner is the boiler to be packed and is it appropriate for the host to unwrap it in front if the guests?
p19937
aVDo I have to look out to not pick a working class boiler for a bourgeoise home?
p19938
aVWhat's standard boiler literature?
p19939
aVThank you for the mental image of you hauling a boiler through Heathrow and onto the Tube.
p19940
aVI rent a spare room from some people so I'll leave that up to them ;)
p19941
aVFrom my understanding, you should get your own.
p19942
aVEDIT: Better two, just in case.
p19943
aVSo he'll need four taps then
p19944
aVWelcome to Yorkshire! 
p19945
aVThanks!
p19946
aVThis post will get drowned, but it'll provide some counter-perspective for you.
p19947
aVI'm an Englishman who's lived in Poland for 10 years, and your country still weirds the hell out of me sometimes.
p19948
aV* Food.
p19949
aVYou have amazing recipes like pierogi, leczo, bigos, big chunks of golonka, and the world's most incredible array of sausages.
p19950
aVIt's like you can turn a pig into a magical meat wonderland of flavour.
p19951
aVAnd the bread?
p19952
aVLoaves stuffed with plums or cranberries, soft or crunchy rolls, dark, grain, rye... it's a baker's paradise.
p19953
aVConsidering these two incredible foodstuffs, can I get a bacon sandwich anywhere in the entire country?
p19954
aVNope\u000a\u000a* Christmas food.
p19955
aVYou celebrate Christmas the night before, by banning all the tasty stuff mentioned above (no meat, no alcohol) and instead punishing yourself with the worst food available.
p19956
aVCarp.
p19957
aVHerring.
p19958
aVBland pasta covered in poppy seeds.
p19959
aVIs this some masochistic torture for all the sinning you've done that year?
p19960
aV* Religion.
p19961
aVApparently, everybody's Catholic.
p19962
aVIf your car breaks down on the street no-one will stop and help you.
p19963
aVOld ladies will spit and curse at you for kissing in public, and everyone cheats each other as much as possible, including never paying any taxes.
p19964
aVPeople really are awful to each other on a daily basis.
p19965
aVBut they still go to Church on Sunday and own a picture of...\u000a\u000a* John Paul II.
p19966
aVYeah, I know, 28 years a Pope.
p19967
aV28 years where he did nothing to help the spread of AIDS in Africa or end the sexual abuse of children in the Church.
p19968
aVDead for 9 years.
p19969
aVBut still many Poles think he's a saint and own a poster/calender/icon of him.
p19970
aVWhat's the new Pope's name?
p19971
aVDon't care, the only Pope is JP2.
p19972
aV* Driving.
p19973
aVBulgaria has worse roads than Poland, and fewer people are killed in car accidents.
p19974
aVThe Lithuanians have worse cars, and kill fewer people.
p19975
aVThe Italians have more treacherous geography, the English and Swedish have worse weather, and the Germans drive faster, and still Poland kills more people with cars than these countries.
p19976
aVWhy?
p19977
aVPolish people suck at driving.
p19978
aVReally, you're awful.
p19979
aVMaybe because you're always rushing around the country on...\u000a\u000a* Holidays.
p19980
aV26 days per year once you reach 10 years of employment (or 3years + 5years of studying).
p19981
aVPlus 12 national holidays, so 38 days off a year, or nearly two working months.
p19982
aVHow does anything get done?
p19983
aVHow, even in the capital city, do shop-owners shut down for the whole of August and still run a successful business?
p19984
aVWhich leads to...\u000a\u000a* Service.
p19985
aVYou'll never feel less welcome than when you walk into a shop and ask the seller for something.
p19986
aV99% of the time the answer will be "no".
p19987
aVThe other 1% the item will be handed to you in awkward silence, with an evil glare for interrupting their peace and quiet.
p19988
aVIn supermarkets, you'll go the entire transaction without hearing a single word from the cashier except...\u000a\u000a* "Do you have any change?
p19989
aV" I'm used to this from homeless people.
p19990
aVNot from the store clerk, desperate to get the 5- and 10grosze coins from my pocket.
p19991
aVThe sale was 49.56zl, I gave you a 50zl note, but you still desperately plead for the 56grosze in change so that you can give me 1zl back.
p19992
aVIn a tiny village shop, ok, I get it, but in massive outlets with 20 cashiers?
p19993
aVThis is retarded.
p19994
aVEspecially in...\u000a\u000a* Home improvement stores.
p19995
aVCastorama, Praktiker, Obi, Leroy Merlin - huge palaces to consumption where you can buy curtains, wood flooring, lamps and bathroom furniture.
p19996
aVFinally, you can decorate your apartment the way you always dreamed, filled with furniture from Ikea or BlackRedWhite.
p19997
aVThese names are confusing, but it's ok: *they all sell exactly the same products for the same prices*.
p19998
aVYou had Communism for 45 years where everyone wore identical clothes and lived in identical apartments with identical furniture.
p19999
aVNow, after 25 years of capitalism it's exactly the same, except it's the people's choice.
p20000
aVAnd Ikea in Poland is more expensive than the UK.
p20001
aV* Bureaucracy.
p20002
aVI'm from the UK; I don't have an ID card.
p20003
aVI don't have one in Poland either, but I do have a unique ID number (PESEL) and a registered address (meldunek) and a tax number (NIP) and a business number (REGON).
p20004
aVI couldn't get an ID card becuase you need meldunek for that, but you can't get meldunek without an ID card.
p20005
aVI worked my way around it to buy a car and a flat, butI can't be registered (meldunek) in  my own flat for more than 5 years because I don't have an ID card, even though I'm listed on the land ownership record (KW) as the owner.
p20006
aVIt takes five different offices to deal with this shit.
p20007
aV* Decograms.
p20008
aVIf I buy ham or cheese I don't buy it in kilos, or grams, but decograms.
p20009
aVWhat the fuck is a decogram?
p20010
aV"20 decos of ham, please.
p20011
aV" Or 200 grams, for normal people.
p20012
aVYou don't use decolitres for beer or vodka, but you'll use decograms for ham, as if you've invented a metric pig.
p20013
aVSo if it's so awful, why do I stay here?
p20014
aV* The weather.
p20015
aVPeople think of Poland as some grey gloomy landscape, like Siberia but with more pork products.
p20016
aVBut it isn't.
p20017
aVIt has 4 very distinct seasons that are all just long enough, and even from my window in Warsaw I can see gorgeous August sunsets shining on the browning leaves of the old chestnut trees over the road.
p20018
aVI regularly stop and stare at the beauty of the weather here.
p20019
aV* The geography.
p20020
aVMountains to the south, sea to the north, a massive lake district and some of the most ancient oak and pine forests in Europe.
p20021
aVThis place is a natural wonderland, achingly beautiful in its wilderness.
p20022
aV* The architecture.
p20023
aVPoland's awful and awesome history means towns are actually distinct from each other, and Lublin is different to Krakow or to Wroclaw or to Gdansk.
p20024
aVThis is unlike Britain, where every town up and down the country has a stone cathedral surrounded by fake Tudor townhouses and a generic high street filled with the same bloody shops.
p20025
aVYawn.
p20026
aV* The people.
p20027
aVOnce people accept you, Poles display a level of genuine warmth that I never experienced in the UK.
p20028
aVThey'll hurl abuse at you on the roads and elbow you in the street without saying sorry, but if you're invited to their house you're an honored guest and nothing is too good for you.
p20029
aVInstead of a bland evening supper of polite conversation and dinner party games (like England) you'll be invited to a three-day weekend at their place in the country with rivers of alcohol and more sausage than a Gay Pride festival.
p20030
aVWhich is how Poles "relax".
p20031
aVA ha ha ha.
p20032
aV* The humour.
p20033
aVA very dry humour prevails in Poland, mixed with a taste for the absurd.
p20034
aVClassic books and movies are either very subtle or utterly outrageous in their weirdness, and once you get that into your head, real life in Poland starts to make sense (in the sense that you know it will never make sense).
p20035
aV* The work/life balance.
p20036
aVThe long holidays and generic product availability is frustrating at first, but then you learn it's how Poles think; Work to Live, not Live to Work like in the UK.
p20037
aVBritishers put in 40-60 hours a week to fill their overpriced house with stupid shit they don't need, so that after 45 soul-destroying years they can die of a heart attack with shitloads of debt.
p20038
aVPoles would rather save save save, pay cash up front for a couple of good products, and make those things last the rest of their life.
p20039
aVPeople at the age of 25 are trying to buy the houses they'll die in, people avoid mortgages and credit cards as if they were ebola, and trade promotion and career prospects for family time with the wife and kids.
p20040
aVAs a result, they have much less stress and more stronger relationships with their family, even if it means they can't afford a 50" TV and three foreign holidays a year.
p20041
aVI think that's a much healthier balance (although it's starting to change).
p20042
aV* Food.
p20043
aVMicrowave and oven-ready meals are almost unheard of.
p20044
aVPeople cook fresh, and cook often (or their mothers do it for them).
p20045
aVIn summer the street stalls are bursting with fresh fruit and vegetables, and beside a few kebab and Asian bars, fast food is almost unknown.
p20046
aVPeople don't really go to restaurants at all, and even Warsaw (a city of 3million people) has a very limited range of places to eat out - not only because of price, but because the stuff made at home really does taste so much better.
p20047
aVIt's also healthier, which leads to...\u000a\u000a* Women.
p20048
aVGirls here are beautiful, not because of genetics but because of style.
p20049
aVThey don't turn into lardbuckets at 25 like their British counterparts, they don't sport horrendous fake tans, buckets of makeup or trampstamp tattoos, or follow the latest retarded fashion trends.
p20050
aVSure, there's always a tasteless minority, but more often than not the women focus on looking elegant or chic rather than Kardashian clones.
p20051
aVIt's beautiful without relying solely on sex appeal.
p20052
aV* You can compliment people.
p20053
aVI can tell the women in the office that their hair looks good today or that I like their new shoes without being considered sleazy or a potential rapist.
p20054
aVMen can say nice things to women (things they honestly mean - those *are* nice new shoes) without the risk of HR getting involved for sexual harrassment.
p20055
aV* More seriously, politics.
p20056
aVPeople here are informed, and the newsagents actually have a choice in weekly magazines on art, science and politics (wprost, polityka etc).
p20057
aVEven the existence of metalist idiots like Kaczynski and Korwin-Mikke helps people have actual debates on what's important for the country, rather than the pathetic dribble of PR quotes that the British hear from Cameron and Clegg.
p20058
aV* Largest apple producer in Europe, and you've only just (last three years) learned how to make cider.
p20059
aVBut it's good cider - clean and fresh.
p20060
aV* Culture.
p20061
aVPeople here have read books, recognise classical music pieces, enjoy attending the theatre and are open to discuss these things.
p20062
aVWater cooler talk is about current events, be it big sports matches or global wars.
p20063
aVIt's not endless asinine bleating about whatever was on telly last night.
p20064
aVEnjoy your time in England; I wouldn't swap places with you.
p20065
aVThe invention of metric pig was our biggest accomplishment.\u000a	\u000a
p20066
aV&gt; Largest apple producer in Europe, and you've only just (last three years) learned how to make cider.
p20067
aVWhat the heck were they doing with all the apples before?
p20068
aVAlso heh at the metric pig :)
p20069
aVExcept for the religion thing, you just also described the Czech Republic too.

aV6.They are overtaking lanes, you should only be in them if you are overtaking as stated in the Highway Code.
p20072
aVNothing pisses me off more than being on a relatively empty motorway and having to move all the way from the inside lane to the outside lane just to overtake someone sat in the middle lane.
p20073
aVEver tried orbiting?
p20074
aVIt can be difficult to find the right conditions, but it's quite rewarding.
p20075
aVSpot your 'planet': a middle-lane hogger who is sitting there with the road open and little to no other traffic.
p20076
aVApproach in your satellite from the rear in the left lane.
p20077
aVMove out behind them as you get closer.
p20078
aVMove to the outside to go past.
p20079
aVGo past.
p20080
aVMove back in.
p20081
aVMove over again.
p20082
aVEase off so you slow down.
p20083
aVLet them move past you.
p20084
aVIncrease your speed, move out and overtake.
p20085
aVKeep doing this until they get the message and move over to the left.
p20086
aVMy record is 6 orbits.
p20087
aVHave fun.
p20088
aVThat sounds technically ill-advised from a road safety standpoint, but also absolutely hilarious.
p20089
aVI'm not sure exactly how it is unsafe.
p20090
aVAnother chap just mentioned he thought it would be illegal, but I still don't see how *exactly*.
p20091
aVFor the record I've only done it the once, when I got that 'score'.
p20092
aVMostly the traffic conditions mean it's not possible even though I might have been tempted.
p20093
aVDoesn't sound too terribly unsafe (although I suppose that depends partly on how tight your orbits are - how close you're passing in front/behind them).
p20094
aVBut it does somewhat fail on the general principle of driving in a predictable/unsurprising way; if they suddenly notice you're doing laps, who knows how a spooked 'planet' might react.
p20095
aVBloody immigrants...coming over here and being baffled by random stuff.
p20096
aV*and* being nice about it.

aVI've never seen anything like that before outside Russia.

aVSlow train moving among the villages of current Ukraine.

aVWith people transporting chickens and a goat.
p20108
aVAnd eating some unrecognizable stuff out of old newspaper and a jar.
p20109
aVI would love to see someone on a UK train with a goat, perhaps in North Yorkshire?
p20110
aVThe train operators don't like taking bikes wonder how they would react to a goat?
p20111
aVI took quite a large hamster on the train once.
p20112
aVnumber 1- all banks should allow you to open a basic bank account which allows you to withdraw your money at an atm and have money paid in (like your salary).
p20113
aVIt won't allow you to have a bank card or set up direct debits though unfortunately.
p20114
aVIf you open one of these for 6-12 months and constantly have salary paid in you will probably get enough of a history to upgrade to a regular current account.
p20115
aVnumber 6- you should always keep as far left as you possibly can when driving, which is why people get annoyed with middle lane hoggers.
p20116
aVYou shouldn't be setting cruise control in the middle lane- overtake the truck, then move back left.
p20117
aVAs an ex financial advisor I can shed some information on this.
p20118
aV(apologies if this has already been answered) \u000a\u000athe banks have very little interest in working for people.
p20119
aVI worked for HSBC (who turned out to be amazingly evil) to leave and go to Natwest (who turned out to be also amazingly evil).
p20120
aVas the two of the top UK banks this is what you can expect and why.
p20121
aVpersonal accounts make a bank pretty much nothing.
p20122
aVThe reason they give 'normal' people accounts is because they use your money to prop up various funds while they play roulette with your money.
p20123
aVTheir bonus comes from charging people.
p20124
aVThey will (and do) plan and make more money off people's charges and fees than they will off gambling with your money.
p20125
aVThey will keep you around and pay lip service to you in the hope you will start incurring charges (which basically equals free money to them)  \u000a\u000atheir account opening bullshittery is directly related to how often they unjustly fucked the average consumer, who then panicked and tried to hide from his life destroying and psyche crushing debt.
p20126
aVThe financial institutions actively seek out people who will need these products in the future.
p20127
aVto start off with this seems innocent or at least a reasonable business practice, but it is far from.
p20128
aVThe banks actively employ staff to sift through their customer data to search for potential at risk customers.
p20129
aVThese customers are targeted as people who will,  with high certainty get themselves into further financial trouble, creating revenue streams for the banks.
p20130
aVThe personal circumstances are rarely considered and the banks pressure all staff from the counter to management  to increase the free services with the bank so you can sell unnecessary services to the customer.
p20131
aVthe prospect of 'free' banking isnt considered anything special to the people who are unaware of the foreign banks charging for most services.
p20132
aVbut when they are made aware this is falsely attributed to the banks being nice to you or some UK claim to financial niceness.
p20133
aVThis allows the banks to pass off their charges as reasonable to the customer considering their lack of charges otherwise.
p20134
aVyou can and will be allowed by all (of the major banks at least) your first two charges back.
p20135
aVThey are instructed to challenged you but if you persist it is (or was last year) a bank policy to refund 'reasonable' requests.
p20136
aVThis is where it goes wrong though.......\u000a\u000a\u000ayou are worthless to the banks.
p20137
aVI don't care who you are or how big you think you, are there are richer and more important people than you, as far as the banks are concerned (it's the bank executives in case your wondering.
p20138
aV)\u000a\u000abanks are shareholder companies and their only concerns are meeting the global share index profit predictions (how much phat stacks they were planning on making off nice people).
p20139
aVto do this they balance their insurance income (basically free money) minus against their predicted payouts to customers for accounts, insurance and interest (several departments jobs are to find any legal way to keep this as low as possible).
p20140
aVTheir stock price gambling income (it's not gambling really, all banks have very successful means of inflating their profits and stealing/robbing money for customers, trading, investments and futures....... or at the very worst they just tell the public to cough up huge sacks of cash.
p20141
aV)  vs their investment debts (usually covered by tax payers.
p20142
aVThis all started again  after banks paid political figures for financial deregulation in the past 20-30 years.
p20143
aVI can only certainly say us and UK for certain.
p20144
aV) \u000a\u000a\u000ayou bank accounts etc are a petty cash fund that takes up the slack.
p20145
aVnow admittedly that's a lot of waffle to get to the pint of why the banks don't give a fuck but you effectively do nothing for them, thus they couldn't give a shit.
p20146
aVThe excess ID is so that if you have the cheek to play them at their own game and defraud them it allows them to hunt you nationally and depending on  the amount of money owed, internationally.
p20147
aVcurrently legislation stands at a 6 yr data limit.
p20148
aVso if you can avoid contact with the banks for what ever reason for 6 years they can no longer chase you for debt or fees.
p20149
aVhope this is helpful \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTL; DL: banks are fuckers and designed to sick money out of you.
p20150
aVOur free banking is just a farce to lull you into debt.
p20151
aVI worked for banks as was at meetings for these ideas to get implemented.
p20152

aVEspecially if you're in a fast food restaurant.
p20163
aVWhat the hell, people?
p20164
aVAre you incapable of cleaning up after yourself?
p20165
aVYou've left your wrappers all over the table, you've left food on the floor, and then you just walk out complaining about the service?
p20166
aVHow about you clean up after your own goddamn self, and then maybe the poor people who are having to clean up after your lazy-ass self can actually get around to serving people?
p20167
aVPlus, people who leave stuff on buses.
p20168
aVOh my God, there is a bin right there.
p20169

aVDon't go to Liverpool then.

aVWe had British gas it took them 4 years and several technician visits for them to stop charging us for two houses *on exactly the same spot* as our house was a new build and a house had been knocked down they simply assumed that we obviously had some kind of parallel universe running where we were in two houses on the same spot at exactly the same time\u000a\u000aEdit:fixing wrong words

p20189
aVPoint 20: There's a good reason for this, from Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom#Wholesale.2C_retail_and_consumer_industries ):\u000a\u000a&gt;The changeover to selling of petrol by the litre rather than by the gallon took place after the Board was wound up.
p20190
aVIt was prompted by a technical shortcoming of petrol pump design: pumps (which were electro-mechanical) had been designed to be switchable between metric and imperial units, but had no provisions for prices above £1.999 per unit of fuel.
p20191
aVOnce the price of petrol rose above £1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the unit price by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps.
p20192
aVPersonally, as someone who's all for the UK finally finishing the metrication program and abolishing the imperial measurement system from our road signs, I wish they'd finally get on with it and do the job properly, rather than half-arsing everything like this.
p20193
aVAs you say, it produces some silly situations where you have no easy way of working out how far the fuel you're putting in your car is going to get you.
p20194
aVReading this makes me want to move to Poland.

aVJust one thing though.
p20237
aVYour complaints about the schools may be due to the specific place your step son is a student.
p20238
aVIn my experience secondary schools in the UK can vary in pretty much every aspect massively.
p20239
aVBy any chance is your step son taking foundation level GCSEs?
p20240
aV(I don't mean that in any offensive way I'm from a family of people who can't complete any kind of exam) I ask because I have family in Italy and my aunt read through some practice papers and kept commenting on how easy exams were here but I had to keep pointing out that she was in fact reading a foundation paper which, when compared to regular papers, are incredibly basic.
p20241
aVSchooling bullshit you say?
p20242
aVBack when I was doing my GCSEs, my school is one of those 'slightly old and a bit posh' ones, and has good grades.
p20243
aVI was a top student then (uni made me understand how wrong the system is cause I can't keep up with all the self-study you really have to do to be ok when I used to be ok just following homework cause the teachers do the reinforcement for you), but I was one of the slightly odd ones, being gay and not exactly getting on with the cruelty of immature teenagers and figuring how to not fancy someone, so naturally I had a bit of a bad time getting on with kids.
p20244
aVWhat did the school do?
p20245
aVPretends to help whilst actually gossiping in staff rooms, ostracising me in the guise of helping, and (maybe not so secretly) wanting me out, which was actually the best idea in the end cause I'll never fit in with the shit they do.
p20246
aVThis is when 'fitting in' is wrong because the crowd is corrupt thinking their 'tradition' of bullying and letting kids do it is acceptable.
p20247
aVGranted I was not the best person, but treating them like a freak is certainly the last thing you should do.
p20248
aVWeirdly I kind of had the opposite experience to you.
p20249
aVI was a top student in primary school but struggled in SATS, GCSEs and completely botched my A levels and now that I'm at uni I actually find it much easier to get decent marks.
p20250
aVPeople are just better equipped for certain things I suppose which I would say is the biggest problem with our school system.
p20251
aVToo much lumping together and tarring with the same brush.
p20252
aVnI'm not an idiot, I just crumble on exams which outside of Maths tend to just be a memory test.
p20253
aVAs for the bullying side of things I can sympathise.
p20254
aVI have a condition which made me stick out from every other student in the school but the teachers there were incredibly supportive.
p20255
aVI suppose these stories just add to what I was saying about how our school vary so much it's kind of misleading to make general statements about so many aspects of schooling in Britain.
p20256
aVWhy do you have a horse?
p20257

p20274

p20314
aVIt's not symptomatic of all services\u000a\u000a13) the daily mail is the residue of a colonial mindset where britain ruled the world for several hundred years.
p20315
aVAs people got less bigoted over time (mostly because older generations were dying off) the niche right wingers who think that AIDS INFECTED ILLEGAL EUROPEAN ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE GOING TO COME OVER AND TAKE BRITISH JOBS AND MAKE YOUR CHILDREN OBESE, require something to voice their backwards and scarcity mindset.

aVI'm sorry but its true.
p20319
aVI have friends of different ethnicities over here that can get around in most towns aside from stoke, inner city london and glasgow no problem.

aV16) people hate self service cash registers because they like not having people unemployed and replaced with automation.

aVAlso it feels like a fucking chore.
p20328
aVSo you're telling me i drive into your store, pick up my groceries, **and** you're not even going to do the bare minimum of processing my goods or bagging them up?

aVFinal points, only in britain will you find a place so at ease with being radically anti-nationalistic that we welcome people taking the piss about us.

aVHumour and self deprecation are part of the national identity.

aVTry that kind of same commentary elsewhere and prepare for all kinds of labelling, shaming and insults from the host community.

aVYou probably don't need most of the insurance they try to sell you.

aVFor 13, the people who buy the Daily Mail are women, probably more so in rich/southern English/Tory areas.

p20356
aVIf you have a lot of Polish friends in the UK it may explain the boiler thing (19).
p20357
aVThe stereotype is that there are a lot of Polish plumbers in the UK.
p20358
aVFor 20, it is probably due to a reluctance to mix metric and imperial.
p20359
aVBased on the fact our distances &amp; speeds are measured in miles but our fuel volume in litres, the most useful mileage statistics would actually be in miles per litre.\u000a
p20360
aVMy bank (Natwest, so *our* bank) just increased the amount you can go over-drawn without having any overdraft set up and get no fees for it.
p20361
aVThey've also removed loads of fees for being overdrawn and generally stopped being colossal dicks about it.
p20362
aVI think it's true that the banks were scumbags about fees certainly during 2000-2010 but have since been beaten into submission somewhat by the govt.
p20363
aVabout it.
p20364
aVNah they are still colossal dicks.
p20365
aVThe approved overdraft amount only changed from £6 to £10.
p20366
aVThey recently added an  extra fee even if you have an approved overdraft.
p20367
aVAs well as charging you around 20% interest, you also now get hit with £6 per month fee too.
p20368
aVThey also decided that the current account that I had, one that i'd had for many years and paid interest was no longer being offered - so they changed me to a different type of current account that no longer paid interest.
p20369
aVJust move banks, it's pretty easy these days. 
p20370
aVPoint 1 is also to serve the automatic overdraft.
p20371
aVIf they cannot find out where you live then you can just drain your overdraft and disappear.
p20372
aVIt's also going to be an immigration thing soon; Parliament just passed a new law that means banks could be fined if they open current accounts for people not legally allowed to remain in the UK, unless they've carried out a background check.
p20373
aVFuck's sake
p20374
aVIf the banks get ripped off by Gypsies or Nigerian princes then everyone will have to pay extra to make up for that.
p20375
aVMore power to the banks to prevent fraud. 
p20376
aVThey shouldn't offer a service that drains money without customer consent.
p20377
aVIf there is no money on the account, they shouldn't allow the transfer and let the payee deal with it with their system of charges, as anywhere else in Europe.
p20378
aVOtherways its just banks charging penalties for non work done, for no cost at all.
p20379

p20414
aV\u000aI agree with all your clever observations except this one:\u000a\u000a&gt;I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected.
p20415
aVsource:  French person who knows what first world rail infrastructure looks like.
p20416
aVWhere have you seen those trains?
p20417
aVI lived 3 years in France and I don't remember this 'first world rail infrastructure' when scnf trains stops because of drizzle. 
p20418
aV\u000aThe TGV held the rail land speed record for commercial trains for decades.
p20419
aVUnlike in the UK, in France I have never been told that the train is at a stop (for 5 hours) because "there are leaves on the rails" (in autumn).
p20420
aVAnd the UK has the most expensive rail in Europe.
p20421
aVTry to go by line J from saint Lazare to mantes la jolie during autumn or winter.
p20422
aVScnf is even worst in this matter since they cancel trains because rails are wet.
p20423
aVSometimes you stack in middle way without alternative transport since there is no taxi or buses
p20424
aVAre there some bad examples?
p20425
aVSure, any system has.
p20426
aVOn the other hand I can get on a TGV in London and be in the south of France in about 5 hours travelling at speeds approaching 300kmh.
p20427
aVYou can't complain about train service in Europe until you have been to the UK.
p20428
aVWhen I lived in Paris, I used to travel by TGV around Europe also to London.
p20429
aVI didnt found any problems with it ever.
p20430
aVI think I had really unlucky to scnf.
p20431
aVI was in august in France, unfortunately last connection around 10pm was always canceled without any reason, I was forced to take other train and walk later quite a long time.
p20432
aVOther time at 10am I was going again out of Paris to Mantes La Jolie, and this train stopped before Poissy and didn't move further for next 2 hours, so I needed to return back to St Lazare and take other train and later walk.
p20433
aVI was in France whole 6 days :).
p20434
aVFrom country where I from trains used to be worst than in France, but in case of break down they always provide some other type of transportation.
p20435
aVFrench don't care.
p20436
aVIn London I used to use underground and trains going to max 3rd zone, so maybe I had lucky, I nvr faced any troubles. 
p20437
aVAnyway, for me comparing trains which competitor are airlines to regular one have totally no sense.
p20438
aVSince I'm not french I always think which people are Scnf hiring to speak through speakers.
p20439
aVI have always feeling that chtis is mandatory for them

aVNot European, can someone explain 7 &amp; 8?
p20441
aV9) Were the guys in suits Russian oligarchs?
p20442
aVAs for 8, in most countries you find a single tap which allows you to get either hot water, cold water or some mixture of both (something like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Aerated_tap_water.jpg)\u000a\u000aIn the UK you always get two separate taps, one with hot water and another with cold water.

p20455
aVThese: https://i.imgur.com/lgEBnHA.jpg\u000a\u000aI'd never seen one until moving to the UK.
p20456
aVMajor WTF moment.
p20457
aVI'm guessing older style of taps with 2 taps 1 for hot &amp; 1 for cold rather than the more modern all in one.
p20458
aVYes It took me a while to figure out too!
p20459
aVWith regard to education: there is no hand-holding, expecting kids to be motivated and self directed from a young age.
p20460
aVAnd working while sick: stiff upper lip prevails, only the weak would stay home, sick days are for when friends come to town.
p20461
aV&gt;Fees for no funds available?
p20462
aVWTF?
p20463
aVIf I do not have money in my account, then do not send the bloody transfer, and let me handle that with my other provider.
p20464
aVYou're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances.

aVI hate to burst your bubble, but quantity =/= quality.
p20470
aV&gt;Special washing up bowls people put in their sink\u000a\u000aOh God, this drives me mental; we have one at home, which my wife swears is relevant, although I've yet to see a single use case that couldn't be answered by just using the fucking sink.
p20471
aVNo need for a separate, smaller sink inside it that just gets in the way the rest of the time.
p20472
aVWhich, since we also own a dishwasher, is most of the time.
p20473
aVUp voted for the passion this topic should receive more often.
p20474
aVGet rid of the nasty, germy washing up bowls now.
p20475
aVYou have nothing to lose except a crowded sink.
p20476
aVupvoted you both as I am also passionate about the subject.
p20477
aVProbably this is why I'm not yet married to my partner of 7 years as he is firmly in the washing bowl camp. 
p20478
aVwe need to start a movement.
p20479
aVwe really do!
p20480
aVmy god...
p20481
aVI've never noticed that the washing up bowl is irrelevant!
p20482
aVit's been a staple of my life for no reason 
p20483
aVMy house has just been blessed by one of these bowls.
p20484
aVI just don't understand them.
p20485
aVAlso have a dishwasher...
p20486
aVIf you have a porcelain sink it makes sense, otherwise you'll end up with broken crockery.
p20487
aVFor normal aluminium sinks I agree washing bowls make no sense at all.
p20488
aVIt's pretty simple -\u000a\u000aFirstly, you don't want your sink getting scratched.
p20489
aVSecondly, you're able to pour liquid down the side.
p20490
aVIf you have a single sink it can be a pain to dispose of the liquid otherwise.
p20491
aVWe use the washing up bowl to wash dishes when bathing a baby, to soak clothes and do the dishes AT THE SAME TIME .
p20492
aVThe thing I love most about going on Holiday to Europe is that when you and your friends fancy a drink, you sit at a table and someone comes and takes your order.

p20505
aVThen another.
p20506
aVThen another.
p20507
aVAll while I'm sitting behind some bloody truck, forced to slow down to 50 or 60.
p20508
aVEVERY FRIGGIN' TIME.
p20509
aVOne thing that really gets on my tits is the way people will ignore your indicator.
p20510
aVNow I'll be the first to deride the arseholes who think that using their blinker means they have right of way.
p20511
aVHowever I am constantly bemused by regular inconsiderate nature from other motorists: those who sit in the middle lane overtaking you by a few mph more and ignore your indicator.
p20512
aVSo you sit there waiting for someone to let you out, but no-one moves into the 3rd lane but just carry on crawling past.
p20513
aVI often wonder if that's one of the reasons why people sit in the middle lane: they know how hard it is to get out of the inside when there's a lorry coming up.
p20514
aVIn other regards I've noticed that sometimes people do let you out by leaving what they think it adequate room.
p20515
aVIt constantly amazes me how few people leave the requisite gap between them and the car in front.
p20516
aVMind you considering how often people think any sized gap is acceptable for them to pull into - the only stipulation apparently being "is it longer than my car?
p20517
aV" - perhaps I shouldn't be.
p20518
aVSorry, but your indicator is to say 'I am moving', not 'I would like to move'.
p20519
aVYou should only indicate when you are actually about to move.
p20520
aV(Remember - 'mirror, signal, manoeuvre' - the point being if you can see in your mirror that there isn't a gap then don't proceed to point 2).
p20521
aVThe reason people drive past you when your indicator is flashing is probably because you're not showing any actual sign of moving, meaning that they probably think you've just left your indicator on by mistake.
p20522
aVWhy are you sorry?
p20523
aVInteresting concept: I do recall mirror, signal manoeuvre.
p20524
aVHowever, as I mention in the comment, often times there is little to no chance of there ever being a (safe) space because people don't appear to move out of the centre lane.
p20525
aVOf course, one could simply stay in the inside in perpetuity but it's not something I think anyone would ever be happy to do.
p20526
aV&gt; Ill people at work\u000a\u000aI've gone to work ill before as my employer only allows 5 sick days in a 12 month period.
p20527
aVThis means that if I was ill all of last week, then I couldn't have one other paid sick day between Aug 2013 to Aug 2015.
p20528
aVI happened to have really bad food poisoning last summer and was off work for 6 days (1 unpaid) and then had the flu/bad cold last winter...
p20529
aVI went into work when I was all in the winter as I couldn't afford to have unpaid leave.
p20530
aVNeedless to say other people in the office got ill around/after the time I was ill.\u000a\u000aWe do have home workers where I work, but the view is "If you are ill you are ill, so can't work from home either". 
p20531
aV&gt;Do not hog the middle lane.
p20532
aVIt's for overtaking, not cruising.
p20533
aVI appreciate the patience with which you have embraced our culture, and agree with you to some extent on all except one point, which is about driving in the middle lane.
p20534
aVThe middle lane is an overtaking lane.
p20535
aVIt is not a cruising lane.
p20536
aVThe left hand lane is for cruising.
p20537
aVIf you are cruising at the speed limit and the car in front is going slower, by all means use the middle lane to overtake.
p20538
aVIf I am cruising, but going faster than you, and I am in the correct lane, I have to cross two lanes to go around you and come back in.
p20539
aVIt is people sitting in the middle lane that makes this very simple system of overtaking fall apart.
p20540
aV1..3: Yeah, banks suck.
p20541
aVThey're dated and need to pull their asses out of the 18th Century.
p20542
aV4: Ill people at work.
p20543
aVThis is partly "stiff upper lip".
p20544
aVAlso, ring in sick and you'll lose a sick day from your allowance.
p20545
aVHave your boss tell you to go home, no frigin way am I taking a sick day cause my boss told me to leave.
p20546
aVThat's like taking holiday because I've been fired!
p20547
aV5: Da fuq else do you do with vinegar?
p20548
aV6: Seriously, drive on the left.
p20549
aVThere is no reason to hog the middle lane.
p20550
aVSimilarly, there is no reason to do 72MPH anywhere on the motorway.
p20551
aVDo 55-70/80/90+ in the respective lanes.
p20552
aV7: Here was me thinking on street parking was pretty limited.
p20553
aV8-9: Taps and messy people, these piss me off as well.
p20554
aV10: Incompetence in services, yeah, see "stiff upper lip" and not complaining.
p20555
aV11: Insurance, I guess so.
p20556
aVVery little is required though.
p20557
aVI don't think I've ever had tennants insurance.
p20558
aVYou can choose to live the polish way and not have pet insurance?
p20559
aVBut what do you do in poland if your pet is injured/ill?
p20560
aV12..14: Agreed on the trains.
p20561
aVAnd the Daily Mail.
p20562
aVAnd Cameron is as bad as both combined.
p20563
aV15: Education, you might have just got unlucky and got a bad school.
p20564
aVOr you might be clinging to some poor examples.
p20565
aVThough I do see the benefits mentality more than I'd like.
p20566
aVI think reflection is why people also think the easter europeans want to do the same.
p20567
aVWe've got a class of people in the UK who do not value themselves or working for themselves.
p20568
aVThis is a sad thing.
p20569
aV16: Phat amaze balls, self-service means I don't have to talk to bored old ladies on the till.
p20570
aVThough, why would you use a walk around self scanner.
p20571
aVI need things, I put them in my basket/trolley.
p20572
aVI don't need a rolling total, I need the things.
p20573
aV17: No road police, but lots of static cameras.
p20574
aVThis bothers me to no end.
p20575
aVI'd far prefer to see road police who can make judgement calls, and provide aid to people, than the fixed cameras we have all over the place causing people to emergency brake.
p20576
aV18: Sour cream has limited use.
p20577
aVOff milk has none.
p20578
aVJust sayin'\u000a\u000a19: You want hot water?
p20579
aVCause boilers is how you get hot water.
p20580
aV20: Because all liquids have to be sold in metric, you damn europe types you!
p20581
aVBut cars run on proper measurements.
p20582
aV16.
p20583
aVHaving a running total is fanTASTIC when you're on a tight budget.
p20584
aVIt's not for everyone, or even every shop, but I've certainly been glad to have one in the past.
p20585
aVThe advantage of the portable scanner is speed.
p20586
aVYou scan all your items when picking them up, and once at checkout you swipe your storecard and pay with your debit card and you're done in less than 30 seconds.
p20587
aVDoes that actually happen though?
p20588
aVI can only imagine the security implications for allowing that.
p20589
aVI was under the impression that the portable scanners only allowed you to keep track of what you'd spent before you got to the till.
p20590
aVThen everything is scanned through as normal.
p20591
aVMy understanding is that the first few times your shopping will be manually checked and then once you've proved yourself you can just pay and leave.
p20592
aVSubject to the occasional random check, and of course all tracked via Nectar / Clubcard etc. 
p20593
aVNeat.
p20594
aVI might look to use them a bit more then.
p20595
aV11.
p20596
aVWe go to the vet and pay for a visit ... what's strange about it?
p20597
aVYou can do that in the UK... just you could, if you wanted, buy insurance to mean that's not so expensive on each visit.
p20598
aVI'm asking why having the insurance available is strange to OP.
p20599
aVI love this guy, about David Cameron I am just as puzzled how he is prime minister as you
p20600
aVI don't want to use the store scanner thing because the self scan checkout is enough of a twat, and if that scanner fucks up halfway around the store I would just leave it there.
p20601
aVAs you might have noticed the UK is a European developing country.
p20602
aVThe Industrial Revolution and democracy began in the UK.
p20603
aVJust saying.  
p20604
aVAll of the bad stuff you listed seemed livable until you got to the education.
p20605
aVIt sounds horrible!
p20606
aVThe education system is fine if the child is motivated by external factors (parents for example).
p20607
aVSchools don't encourage kids to learn or motivate them to put any effort in, they simply make the education available and some kids take it and some don't - largely depending on the home they come from I think.
p20608
aVFor example if the little girl's parents live off benefits, then chances are she's going to aspire to do the same, whereas the child with nurses for parents is going to want to get A levels so he can be a nurse too.
p20609
aVIt seems you're fitting in well in Britain, where complaining is a national pastime!
p20610
aVAnyhow, I'll go over these!
p20611
aV1.
p20612
aVThere's a reason why people are more likely to move house, than to switch their banks.
p20613
aVBanks are a pain in the ass in all senses.
p20614
aVOnly open during the times you're working (or wanting a lie-in on a Saturday, but they close at 12), still charging 'admin' fees for payments and direct debits, in what is ultimately now a pretty much automated business.
p20615
aVIt's nuts.
p20616
aV2.
p20617
aVSee above.
p20618
aV3.
p20619
aVNobody uses cheques, except for my grandma, and she only uses them to send money to other people because she's legally blind and can't use online banking, or get to the bank easily.
p20620
aVEven she uses chip and pin at the supermarket.
p20621
aV4.
p20622
aVThis depends on the company you're working at; mine will regularly ask ill people to go home if they're feeling crappy, for the very reasons you've stated.
p20623
aVThey won't even let you work from home if you're looking bad enough, because they want you to recover!
p20624
aVBut other places are complete bags of dicks about it.
p20625
aV5.
p20626
aVI won't have you sullying my tea and my chips!
p20627
aVStill, it's just a local cultural thing; me, I can't stand black tea, and love some salt and vinegar on my chips.
p20628
aVThey've got to be proper, chunky, and preferably slightly crunchy chips mind, because *fuck fries.
p20629
aV*\u000a6.
p20630
aV(Apologies for the wall of text, Reddit's lists don't allow line breaks!
p20631
aV) This is more of a safety issue.
p20632
aVSlower vehicles move to the left to allow traffic to flow smoothly without jarring changes in speed (remember it's not speed that kills, it's sudden changes in it :P), to provide drivers with the expectation that people will generally only be overtaking them from the right side (which decreases driver stress and improves safety; "undertaking" is actually illegal in some countries, with the exception of certain conditions), and to help prevent the [accordion effect](http://www.ajac.ca/web/resources/article.asp?aid=2); if you're in the middle lane, there'd better be something in the left lane, and if there is, you'd better be moving faster than stuff to the left of you, otherwise why aren't you in the left lane?
p20633
aVYou're all of 20 metres further ahead just to move at the same speed, blocking off a lane that could be used for overtaking by faster traffic.
p20634
aVIf the traffic ahead of you keeps slowing down, use that opportunity to overtake them if it's safe.
p20635
aVYou should be far enough back to see a truck's side mirrors (because otherwise they CAN'T see you), which should give you enough opportunity to manoeuvre.
p20636
aVIn any case, most larger vehicles (&gt;7.5 tonnes) are limited to 60MPH anyway, fitting with the national speed limit for these vehicles, so you should have an opportunity to overtake in most cases on the motorway.
p20637
aVAlso, whilst I understand that you might be doing the speed limit, let the assholes who are speeding pass; it's far safer to let them disappear off into the distance than it is to hold them up and have them then try and undertake you later on.
p20638
aVLet them get caught by the cops/cameras, you're not doing anybody any favours by playing traffic cop deputy.
p20639
aV7.
p20640
aVParking is interesting; expensive in places, but depending on where you live, it is nice to be able to park on the side of the road in places!
p20641
aVYou'll soon find yourself learning the free places to park in busy areas you frequent regularly, try to get there early for a spot, and then cursing the people who got there first as you grudgingly pay for parking elsewhere.
p20642
aV8.
p20643
aVDouble taps?
p20644
aVAs in water?
p20645
aVI didn't even know this was a British thing.
p20646
aV9.
p20647
aVYes, these people are assholes.
p20648
aVIt's not a British thing; assholes are everywhere, even if their behaviours differ by country/region.
p20649
aVDon't be like them!
p20650
aV10.
p20651
aVYep, services can be hit and miss.
p20652
aVIf you don't like it, complain, and take your business elsewhere; these guys don't deserve to remain open.
p20653
aVAs a result, it's not uncommon to rely on word of mouth here: Be sure to ask friends/neighbours for their recommendations!
p20654
aV11.
p20655
aVWell, you don't have to insure everything, I'm pretty sure my car insurance is the only legally required one!
p20656
aVI get medical insurance from my employer, and house contents insurance just in case.
p20657
aVYou're free to take any others as your own risk, but I would definitely recommend keeping animals insured if you have any, because vets bills can be killer, especially in their later years.
p20658
aVBut yes, you can buy insurance for virtually everything, which is good for people who do feel that they need it, but if you don't, outside of legally required insurance, don't feel that you have to buy it!
p20659
aV12.
p20660
aVThe quality of public transport varies greatly depending on your area, but yeah, trains are fucking expensive.
p20661
aV13.
p20662
aVMorons, or people who don't know any better.
p20663
aVIt's a complete rag.
p20664
aV14.
p20665
aVThere are a *lot* of people who'd agree with you; his party didn't even get in with the majority vote.
p20666
aVUnfortunately the other main party didn't either, and their leader has all the presence of a wet rag.
p20667
aVPeople seem to be stuck with voting for one or the other, for fear of voting for any alternatives being a "wasted" vote.
p20668
aVAnd honestly, under the current voting system, it pretty much is as it's lead to the current situation; a shakeup of the voting system is sorely needed.
p20669
aV15.
p20670
aVThis depends on your area too; in some poorer areas, many kids feel that there's no point in trying any harder, whilst in some middle/upper-middle class aras, there are parents pushing their children so hard that they're virtual wrecks before they've even left the education system.
p20671
aVNot sure how to address this one, as I'm not a parent/child specialist myself, and whilst I hate the idea of a benefit state, benefits do need to be there for those who actually need them.
p20672
aVPersonally, I was raised to do my best, but never overly pressured.
p20673
aVI actually ended up not doing so well at A-level (due to some of my own issues at the time), but going straight into work after, then doing extremely well in university a few years later.
p20674
aVNow I'm reasonably well paid at a decent job and have a decent life; I couldn't imagine not working for a living.
p20675
aV16.
p20676
aVSelf-service cash registers are great for small purchases, but Christ, some people seem to have no idea how to use them.
p20677
aVWatching someone slowly scanning their shopping, or failing to understand how it works is something that stresses me out big time.
p20678
aVAt least manned registers have someone on them who just wants to get someone scanned and packed as quickly as possible.
p20679
aVI also use the portable scanners, but they're relatively new technology that not everybody is comfortable yet.
p20680
aVStores also seem to have gotten into the weird habit of having no bags at the cashpoint at the end, or a place to pack properly without holding up the register; I wish they'd fix that, I'd happily wheel my trolley over to a packing zone once I've paid for everything to pack it all up without feeling like I'm inconveniencing someone else.
p20681
aV17.
p20682
aVNo road police that you've noticed; we often get unmarked cars on some of the roads more popular with racers.
p20683
aVI've also heard that we have one of the most stringent driving tests in the world; I'm pretty sure overtaking on a corner would get you a fail, as well as undertaking a driver outside of congestion.
p20684
aVWe have the basics of road etiquette drilled into us as soon as we get into the driver's seat.
p20685
aVYou still get dickwads on the roads, but they're thankfully the minority.
p20686
aV18.
p20687
aVTell me about it.
p20688
aVI love fajitas, but I rarely make them because finding sour cream is a pain in the ass without paying through the nose for it.
p20689
aVThat said, it's easier to find here than it was for me in France, where virtually nowhere stocks it.
p20690
aVLuckily they have much higher quality food otherwise though.
p20691
aV19.
p20692
aVWe live in a very temperate climate with very changeable weather, and not having a boiler in the winter is a nightmare, especially if you live further north - Kent probably has much milder weather.
p20693

p20696
aVRegarding point number 9, the only people I see doing that are immigrants.
p20697
aVno way, immigrants especially from the poor countries are careful not to offend the local sensibilities.
p20698
aVwe take our litter home with us.
p20699
aVnot back home of course ;)
p20700

aVWhere do you go shopping for this wizardry?
p20703
aVThis is great. 
p20704
aV#19.
p20705
aVI fucking *hated* the boiler in my house when I lived in Knightsbridge.
p20706
aVThat mother fucker was fucking with me every fucking day of every fucking winter...it only ever seemed to work in summer.\u000a\u000a
p20707
aVMy only complaint from when I went to London was how 99% of the pubs close at 10/11pm.
p20708
aVIn the rest of the world where these places are open til 2am, that's just when we're getting going!
p20709
aV!
aVPubs =\u005c= bars.
p20710
aVIn london of all places there's are dick loads of places to drink past 11.12.1.2.3 etc.
p20711
aVPubs are to the Brits what coffee shops are to yanks.
p20712
aVA place to hang out with your mates, family, nan etc maybe have a bite to eat too. 
p20713
aVin the centre of london they close early, but a bit further out they are open much later.\u000a\u000a
p20714
aV&gt;&gt;Maybe every country has some?

aVApartment blocks look like something out of District 9 - on the outside.
p20718
aVInside, flats are cosy little palaces.
p20719
aV2.
p20720
aVWashing machines in the bathroom?
p20721
aVI guess it kind of makes sense - there's already water and a drain.
p20722
aVDo you wear ear defenders when you're busting for a poo and its just started a spin cycle?
p20723
aV3.
p20724
aVEvery apartment block seemingly has a) a tanning salon b) an alcohol shop open from 6:00am to 4:00am.
p20725
aVNo corner shop.
p20726
aVDon't people ever need milk or eggs  or Bisto or a lottery ticket?
p20727
aV4.
p20728
aVWinter tyres!
p20729
aVI didn't know these existed before I spent time in Poland.
p20730
aVI asked a friend how people managed to drive so well in freezing conditions - in the UK people slide into each others cars at T junctions at the first sign of a frost.

p20737
aVWhat is it with those ultra-salty twiglet-sticks and dry wafer biscuits?
p20738
aVIt's like crack to software developers.
p20739
aVEvery half hour they'd hit the kitchen to re-salt themselves, then eat two handfuls of dry pink wafers.
p20740
aVThe cupboard under the sink was stuffed with industrial quantities in catering packs.
p20741
aVEdit: more...\u000a8.
p20742
aVEducation.
p20743
aVThe guys I worked with were very well educated, ultra-bright and very academic.
p20744
aVSometimes this caused its own problems, partly I think because there wasn't the same built-in 'commercial awareness' you get in non-ex-soviet Europe.
p20745
aVWe were two days away from a delivery deadline when the development team leader asked me to "Please explain to customer that there is a six month delay and they must pay extra".
p20746
aVHe'd  been having a beer with his University Professor (he'd left university six years before), who had advised that the software architecture we were using was 'incorrect' so we would need to scrap the current build and three months work, design a new framework and recode the solution.
p20747
aVIt turned out that 'incorrect' meant not wrong, not faulty, not less supportable, just 'not perfect'.
p20748
aVWe delivered the original software on time, but it was an immense struggle to get pretty much the whole team to understand good-enough is perfectly acceptable, and that we'd have been out of business in a week if we'd changed to the new 'perfect' solution.
p20749
aVEdit: more..\u000a9.
p20750
aVAllotments.
p20751
aVAllotments everywhere.
p20752
aVTiny ones ingeniously squeezed in between railway signalling equipment with ramshackle sheds, and ones with sheds that have evolved into two-storey mansions.  
p20753
aVWait, are you saying winter tires arnt available in the UK?
p20754
aVOr do you just not pay attention to life?\u000a
p20755
aVNumber 6 - you're saying the guy is "too lazy" to overtake in the right Lane but actually you're the problem as you're too lazy to follow the road laws and always bear left.
p20756
aVJust sayin.
p20757
aVAlso, I hate middle Lane hoggers. 
p20758
aV&gt; Daily Mail.
p20759
aVSeriously?
p20760
aVWho buys this... thing?
p20761
aVThis.
p20762
aVI also wonder the same thing.
p20763
aV&gt; Daily Mail\u000a\u000aThe same people who make Fakt and Super Ekspres the best selling dailies in Poland.
p20764
aVExcept with different accents.
p20765
aVWork in a shop to help pay for uni.
p20766
aVOne thing I noticed is that the Polish love to pile up their money as far away from me as possible when making a purchase so I have to trot allll the way down to the end of the long counter!
p20767
aVBut when I do the same they make that confused Polish face and grunt till I put it in their hand?!
p20768
aVSeriously why?
p20769
aVThis is probably going to sound slightly offensive but I think many of these observations are to do with the area this person lives in and thus quality of schools, restaurants and class of people\u000ahe is hanging out with.
p20770
aVAs a South African who has lived in the UK for more than 6 years and has worked in educational psychology in the UK, I can honestly say that I've never come across many of the things he talks about.
p20771
aVFirstly, the UK has some of the top universities in the world and along with the US has a disproportionate number of top universities relative to it's population size.
p20772
aVIt goes hand in hand with this that it's schools can't be bad.
p20773
aVUnfortunately because the majority of people send their children to state schools the school you end up at depends on the area you live in.
p20774
aVSome schools in areas with high areas of immigrants fall sharply behind because the teachers are teaching children how to speak English while their contemporaries are moving ahead with other things.
p20775
aVWhat is great though is that all schools are independently assessed and ranked and so you can choose what area you live in based on how good the schools are.
p20776
aVSome inner city schools in poor areas have had so much investment from government and charities that they outperform schools in richer areas.
p20777
aVI use to work at one of these schools.
p20778
aVI've never heard anyone talk about their boiler unless the damn thing has unexpectedly broken but I'm sure this would be true of all people who own electrical appliances.
p20779
aVI've never seen dirty plates in a restaurant and I've never been into a place that offers vinegar with chips.
p20780
aVAlthough that is a traditional English thing it seems that in more upmarket areas it has died out.
p20781
aVWhat he says about cars, traffic and driving is largely me same as my experience.
p20782
aVOne other thing is that I find the Englishnto be amazingly unmaterialistic despite the eneonous wealth of many people.
p20783
aVIn many countries people spend a disproportionate amount of money on their cars.
p20784
aVIn South Africa someone with a house worth around £100k will spend £25k on a brand new BMW whereas in the UK people with £1 million houses will be happy driving around in a slightly worse for wear second-hand Volvo worth £12k. 
p20785
aVSomething that often gets left out in these sorts of discussions is World War II.
p20786
aVDuring the war, we had no easy way to replace anything, we were short on food, and the only way we were able to survive (and supply our troops fighting in Europe) was to make do with what we had.
p20787
aVThis culture of making do, and not *really* expecting things to get better, permeates the older generations in our society, many of whom were born into this environment (which persisted for years after the war).
p20788
aVWe're a tolerant people.
p20789
aVWe tolerate inferior products and services.
p20790
aVWe tolerate sub-standard food.
p20791
aVWe tolerate small homes and expensive energy, we tolerate *our consistently miserable climate*.
p20792
aVAnd so on.
p20793
aVBut - this seemingly miserable (but not *too* miserable) situation gives us a fairly unique character that I wouldn't trade for the world.
p20794
aVGreat post.

p20803
aVI take your point about morons who don't know/don't care to help you out in shops, etc.
p20804
aVBut mostly, everything is where it should be, and services are reliable.
p20805
aV5) Agreed, we are the best drivers in the world.
p20806
aVThere ARE haughty, ornery pricks on the road (they are always older, white men with more money than me) but mostly the etiquette behind the wheel is in a league of its own, even amongst European nations.
p20807
aV6) We need to quit this Amercanised, watery frappatino "coffee" bullshit.
p20808
aVBuy a percolator; percolate.
p20809
aVThe Mediterranean way is the only way.
p20810
aV7) I actually think English kids are pretty intellectual.
p20811
aVI have been teaching English for a while in Britain to economic migrants from Spain, Italy, France, etc.
p20812
aVNot one of my students has been able to tell me how old the earth is.
p20813
aVNot one has been able to tell me why drugs are illegal.
p20814
aVNot one has been able to tell me who said "cogito ergo sum" nor what it means.
p20815
aVAnd these are all highly-qualified professionals - engineers, architects, chemists.
p20816
aVI find that strange.
p20817
aV8) That said, we English people are so propagandised.
p20818
aVWe have some education, but our political awareness is pretty low.
p20819
aVMy friends are aware that the queen is a nazi-sympathising vampire with 1/6 of the inhabitable land of planet earth in her possession.
p20820
aVBut most (older?
p20821
aV) people think she's "just a nice old lady".
p20822
aVFuck off.
p20823
aVShe's a thief and a parasite.
p20824
aVAnd Cameron.
p20825
aVCameron, Cameron...
p20826
aVHe's the kind of guy who takes Christmas seriously.
p20827
aVOkay.
p20828
aVNuff for now.
p20829
aV&gt; It's the XXI century\u000a\u000aWho still uses Roman numerals?!
p20830
aV;)
p20831
aVI have a shiny new and lovely condensing boiler!!!
p20832
aVI thought you should know :)
p20833
aVI can't comment on a lot of the things here, but as someone else mentioned, the education thing is very variable.
p20834
aVI went to state school in Cambridge through primary, secondary and sixth form and really enjoyed it every step of the way.
p20835
aVThere was the odd bad teacher, but in general all the staff were helpful and encouraging.
p20836
aVHowever one thing I have noted is that more recently younger kids and early teens are being given less and less freedom by schools and parents and their natural inquisitiveness is being stymied by overprotective parents and schools whose only motivation is to get good grades (as they rely on them for funding).
p20837
aVRegarding point 6:\u000a\u000aNever move to the right lane (in left-driving countries, vice-versa for right-driving) to allow someone to pass.
p20838
aVYou might think you're being a nice guy, but you're doing more harm than good.
p20839
aVOnly move into a faster (righter) lane in order to pass someone in a slower (lefter) lane.
p20840
aVStick to these rules or watch as your roads begin to resemble American roads.
p20841
aVYou don't want that.
p20842
aVBeing from Kent myself, I feel the need to ask, what kind of trains have you been going on?
p20843
aVLast time I traveled Southeastern they provided probably the worst service in the country!
p20844
aVConstant delays, outdated trains, filthy stations.
p20845
aVGenerally terrible all round.
p20846
aVAmerican here who's spent about two months in Yorkshire.
p20847
aVOne thing I can say that the UK does better than anywhere else I've been is MEAT.
p20848
aVYou guys live in meat heaven... with reasonably-priced access to high-quality meats of about any animal you want.
p20849
aVLamb, Beef, Pork, Cod, Prawns, Crab...
p20850
aVThank you England for doing meat right. 
p20851
aVthats just yorkshire really, everyone here is either a farmer, a butcher, a butchers son, or a farmers son.
p20852
aV[deleted]
p20853
aVThat's my tactic.
p20854
aVMy father would pull the e-brake (brake lights stay off) and hope they rear ended him, or at least had a heart attack. 
p20855
aVYour father sounds like an idiot.
p20856
aVIt was the 80's.
p20857
aVWe were young and the world was our oyster.
p20858
aVHe got better. 
p20859
aV6. if you're passing/driving faster than the lorry in the left lane, then you should continue to do that in the middle lane, and ignore the arsehole behind you, and let him overtake you in the right hand lane.
p20860
aVI believe he was saying he sits in the middle lane regardless of what is in the left lane
p20861
aVNope, left lane moves slower.
p20862
aVI added an update to my original post to clarify.
p20863
aVAh the M25, why didn't you say so?
p20864
aVAnything goes on that road mate haha
p20865
aVIf that's the case then he should pull over!
p20866
aVWhat do you mean?
p20867
aVIf you're correct and he sits in the middle lane when there is nothing ahead in the left lane, then when the arsehole comes behind him flashing his lights he should move into the left lane!
p20868
aVAre you saying the guy behind him should illegally undertake if the guy in the middle lane wont move back over?
p20869
aVno the polish guy should move into the left lane
p20870
aVYeah he should, thats what im saying lol\u000aIm always flashing middle lane hoggers im not trying to be a dick but i drive a lorry and im banned from using the outside most lane and its illegal to undertake so you get a lot of people who drive lazy in the middle lane, some move over but a lot of others are busy texting or making a phonecall and their speed is dangerously inconsistent!
p20871
aVI just wanna get to my drop in good time, time is money and i got bills to pay :)
p20872
aV&gt; Banks.
p20873
aVTo open a current account was way too tricky\u000a\u000aYeah.
p20874
aVOstensibly about money-laundering.
p20875
aVI don't understand it either.
p20876
aV&gt; Banks again.
p20877
aVDirect debits?
p20878
aVFees for no funds available?
p20879
aVBanks are greedy, they apply fees for everything until they get told it's illegal.
p20880
aVThen they apply more.
p20881
aVThere shouldn't be fees for standing orders.
p20882
aVDirect debits are different, they represent an outside contract, you're expected to not sign up for one that you can't afford.
p20883
aVThey're required to inform you well in advance of any change to the amount they're billing you.
p20884
aV&gt; Cheques.
p20885
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p20886
aVIt's XXI century.
p20887
aVNobody.
p20888
aVI haven't used one in years.
p20889
aV&gt; Ill people at work.
p20890
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak\u000a\u000aPeople are selfish, they think their sick days are more important.
p20891
aV&gt; Tea with milk and chips with vinegar.
p20892
aV\u2026 I guess I'm assimilated by now.
p20893
aVYep, assimilated.
p20894
aV&gt; "Do not hog the right/middle lane".
p20895
aVOK.
p20896
aVI get it.
p20897
aVBut consider that: I'm going on the middle lane, exactly at the speed limit with cruise control set\u000a\u000aThe lanes in the UK are for overtaking.
p20898
aVIf there are three lanes then two people can be overtaking at once.
p20899
aVYou should be in the inside lane unless actively passing a car.
p20900
aVAlso, other people are selfish assholes.
p20901
aVSee above.
p20902
aV&gt; Parking.
p20903
aVI love British parking!
p20904
aVAlthough it's strange that you just leave cars on the road\u000a\u000aOur garages are full of crap.
p20905
aV&gt; No, I won't be mentioning double taps.
p20906
aVThis horse has been beaten to a pulp.
p20907
aVNeigh.
p20908
aV&gt; But I'll mention the mess people make.
p20909
aVWTF?
p20910
aVI've once seen three guys in suits in a tube, around 8pm, eating (in a very messy way) some McDonalds meals.
p20911
aVAnd they left all the packaging on the seats when leaving the tube.
p20912
aVThese people hate being told off.
p20913
aVTell them off.
p20914
aV&gt; Incompetence in services\u000a\u000aYeah, true.
p20915
aVPatronise the places that are competent, it'll encourage them.
p20916
aV&gt; Insure EVERYTHING.
p20917
aVHere: car, house, house content, tenant's insurance, professional indemnity, bicycle, animals (small), animals (large, I have a horse), animal's third party insurance, dental\u000a\u000ahouse contents and tenant's are usually the same thing.
p20918
aVTenant's is for the contents you don't own.
p20919
aVProf. Indemnity is a very specific thing for people running a business.
p20920
aVThe rest are very much optional, work out if you'd like the peace of mind, but it's *unusual*\u000a\u000a&gt; I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected.
p20921
aVI hate: train tickets price.
p20922
aVWTF, I know someone who spends over 1/3 of his salary just to get to work for a month!
p20923
aVDue to botched nationalisation.
p20924
aVPisses us all off too.
p20925
aV&gt; Daily Mail.
p20926
aVSeriously?
p20927
aVWho buys this... thing?
p20928
aVIt's the world's most popular news source.
p20929
aVFucking idiots.
p20930
aV&gt; David Cameron.
p20931
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p20932
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p20933
aVHe's nowhere near the worst.
p20934
aV&gt; Education.
p20935
aVI admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy.
p20936
aVOr wasn't.
p20937
aVUntil he came here.
p20938
aVSounds like he needs a better school.
p20939
aV:(\u000a\u000a&gt; Self-service cash registers.
p20940
aVI love them.
p20941
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p20942
aVWe dislike people that go always by the book.
p20943
aVIt makes them sound like robots.
p20944
aVA bit of humour and flexibility goes a long way with the British.
p20945
aVMachines can't provide that, so are useful only when we're not feeling social.
p20946
aV&gt; Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code\u000a\u000aLook at the bikes and the taxis.
p20947
aV&gt; Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing\u000a\u000aSour cream is available in most small shops, although probably not newsagents.
p20948
aV&gt; Boilers seem to be a centerpiece of every home\u000a\u000aI only hear this from my parents, nobody else.
p20949
aV&gt; Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p20950
aVBecause people are fucking mad.
p20951
aVI enjoyed your post.
p20952
aVI've been living in the UK for the last 8 year and I can relate to these quirks you have pointed out.
p20953
aV1: Correct me, if I am wrong, but I believe the reason why it is hard(er) to open an account int the UK is due to people who try to beat the system.
p20954
aVExample:Person lands in the UK, opens 5 bank accounts with £1000 overdraft, buys stuff with that money and leaves the next day.
p20955
aVThe bank has no way of finding me.
p20956
aVI think its a security precaution.
p20957
aV3: Cheques are being phased by all banks by 2018 I believe.
p20958
aVExtra note: If you went to USA, you'd be surprised how many people do not even have Chip &amp; Pin bank cards.
p20959
aVMajority still on Magnetic Strip.
p20960
aV11: Agree.
p20961
aVThe insurance malarkey is way OTT.
p20962
aVI would like to add the No Claim Bonus.
p20963
aVAnd it takes months to sort it.
p20964
aV15: I have been through Lithuanian education, completed School, College and University in the UK.
p20965
aVAt first I thought, oh great no homework at school.
p20966
aVHow cool is that.
p20967
aVCollege, what?
p20968
aVYou want me to do homework.
p20969
aVUniversity - give me more homework.
p20970
aVI can relate to your stepson.
p20971
aVI was an average student in LT.
p20972
aVIn the UK I have the highest level degree in Computer Science.
p20973
aVWTF?
p20974
aVI could go on and on about education side.
p20975
aVI feel the same as you - I love living in the UK too.
p20976
aVAnd yes service may be worse in other parts off the island, but its the people that make the difference.
p20977
aVI mean if I can walk down a street and people smile at you and you smile at them (not in a creepy way), walk into any shop - people are polite smiling, if someone bumps into me, they apologise with a smile and life moves on.
p20978
aVI can categorically say that I have not met a rude/unhelpful person (apart form call center adviser) yet.
p20979
aVAll the best.
p20980
aV[deleted]
p20981
aVCheques are still widely used in business and no one has any plans to stop this.
p20982
aVPersonal cheques are certainly being replaced by online/mobile banking.
p20983
aVWhat shop lets you take a hand-scanner round?
p20984
aVI've never seen those.
p20985
aVTesco has them in the Metro ones in London.
p20986
aVI've never got them to work properly, even when the nice lady came around the shop with me to help out.
p20987
aV&gt;What shop lets you take a hand-scanner round?
p20988
aVI've never seen those.
p20989
aVSafeway used to have them.... Don't know if Morrison's took up the baton when they bought them out.
p20990
aVTesco and Waitrose that I know of although not every branch.
p20991
aVOur local Sainsburys has a huge rack of them at the front door.
p20992
aVNever used them of course.
p20993
aVI assume you have to apply and submit to some intensive scrutiny to make sure you're not the type of oiky person who's going to put unscanned stuff in their trolley.
p20994
aVNope, you just agree to T&amp;C on the first use, and then you can be randomly checked every few times you shop.
p20995
aVThe random check is also random, meaning that they just compare five random items from the cart with the contents of your bill.
p20996
aVQuick and easy, you can pack everything into the bags as you shop, in a way that makes sense for you, then you just pay and go to your car.
p20997
aVWhen you put it back, they usually take a handful of items to check.
p20998
aVIf your lucky I'm sure you could probably get the odd free apple every now and then but are you really that bothered about 20p.
p20999
aVThere's a new Tesco somewhere in Lincolnshire that has them (about 15 minutes from the showground).
p21000
aVThey also have the new line of self service checkouts that are too amazing and complex to explain but they're amazing and I can't wait to see them in more stores.
p21001
aVEdit: I found an article about them (excuse the fact it's the Daily Mail) http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2629916/Super-till-supermarket-staff-New-machine-said-three-times-quicker-normal-checkout.html
p21002
aVWaitrose and big Sainsbury's
p21003
aVAll the big ones around me have them: Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury.
p21004
aVThis sour milk you mention...is it like kefir or buttermilk?
p21005
aVWhat should I look for in Polish shops?
p21006
aVI'm a Dutch expat and I really miss my sour milk products.
p21007
aVLook for "zsiad\u0142e mleko".
p21008
aVIt's better than kefir.
p21009
aVHow much does it cost to board your horse in England?
p21010
aVDid you bring the horse with you from Poland or did you purchase it and England?
p21011
aVHow different is the horse scene in England versus Poland?
p21012
aVAt the current place where we keep one of our horses it's £650pcm.
p21013
aVFarrier, vet and supplements on top of that.
p21014
aVThen training with a coach and competitions.
p21015
aVCompared to that, I pay about £380pcm for the full board for my youngster in Poland which includes her being trained by a current Polish champion in Eventing.
p21016
aVSo it's much more expensive here.
p21017
aVBut the possibilities for training and competing are much better here - my fiancee feels that she knew nothing compared to what she learned here after 3.5 years.
p21018
aVAnd she has been riding in Poland for over 20 years.
p21019
aV&gt;1\u005c.
p21020
aVBanks.
p21021
aVTo open a current account was way too tricky.
p21022
aVOh yes.
p21023
aVEven if you live here your whole life you might find it difficult to open a current account if you don't have a good credit history - which baffles me, considering you're not asking them to lend you anything!
p21024
aV&gt;2\u005c.
p21025
aVBanks again.
p21026
aVDirect debits?
p21027
aVFees for no funds available?
p21028
aVWTF?
p21029
aVDon't get me started...
p21030
aVRecently I was moving some money around between accounts and didn't realise I had a direct debit going out for a credit card payment the next day.
p21031
aVThe DD "bounced" and I was charged £12 by the card company and then £10 by the bank.
p21032
aVI made sure I immediately paid the money manually to the card company, before the day it was due, so it wasn't late or anything.
p21033
aV£22 of my money for an honest mistake and it cost the companies *absolutely nothing* - well the cost of an automatically generated letter, which certainly isn't close to that.
p21034
aV&gt;3\u005c.
p21035
aVCheques.
p21036
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p21037
aVIt's XXI century.
p21038
aVCheques are useful if you don't totally trust the person or you need to send payments by post.
p21039
aV&gt;7\u005c.
p21040
aVParking.
p21041
aVI love British parking!
p21042
aVReally?
p21043
aVI have to wonder where you are that you actually like the parking situation.
p21044
aVHere in Kent it's a nightmare - there's hardly anywhere to park for free, even outside your own house a lot of the time - there are parking zones that you have to pay a yearly fee to get a permit for, to park outside your own front door!
p21045
aV&gt;8\u005c.
p21046
aVNo, I won't be mentioning double taps.
p21047
aVAs in bathroom taps?
p21048
aVHonestly it baffles me as well.
p21049
aVWe have a mixer tap in our kitchen but separate taps in the bathroom - WTF?
p21050
aV&gt;14\u005c.
p21051
aVDavid Cameron.
p21052
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p21053
aVWell said.
p21054
aV&gt;15\u005c.
p21055
aVEducation.
p21056
aVWell, just remember that it's not the teachers' fault.
p21057
aVWe rely far too much on some really weird metrics to figure out how well kids are doing in school.
p21058
aV&gt;16\u005c.
p21059
aVSelf-service cash registers.
p21060
aVI love them.
p21061
aVI love them too.
p21062
aVI guess people don't like the idea of a real person being out of a job to be replaced by a machine...but this is the future, we must adapt.
p21063
aV&gt;17\u005c.
p21064
aVAlmost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code.
p21065
aVLove it.
p21066
aVOkay...seriously??
p21067
aVNow I must know where you live.
p21068
aVThe opposite is true around here, to be honest.\u000a\u000a
p21069
aVKent, the same as you.
p21070
aVTonbridge area.
p21071
aVI know that for example Maidstone area is much worse, but here it's a bliss.
p21072
aVAnd averywhere it's fine compared to Poland.
p21073
aV&gt;Education.
p21074
aVI admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy.
p21075
aVOr wasn't.
p21076
aVUntil he came here.
p21077
aVFrom the worst student in his class, he stepped up to one the best in his year.
p21078
aVWhile knowing nothing.
p21079
aVI know, I've been testing his knowledge before his GCSEs.
p21080
aVThe kids here do not have to do anything.
p21081
aVThey have almost no requirements.
p21082
aVThey do not have to improve.
p21083
aVThey seem to have no concept of self-improvement at all!
p21084
aVA girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council.
p21085
aVSo, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14?
p21086
aVAnd if yes, is that intentional?
p21087
aVI was barely in the middle of my class of 30 back in Latvia, then shot up right to the top when my parents brought me over at age 10.
p21088
aVEnded up finishing with 10 A-A* GCSEs and 8 equivalents (BTEC, Nationals...).
p21089
aVI'd say that GCSEs were piss easy for me.
p21090
aVA-levels is where you start having to put in real effort, but I still finished top of the Sixth Form, and I am baffled by how many people struggle to achieve a pass at either level.
p21091
aVAnd yet, I wouldn't consider myself exceptionally smart.
p21092
aVI even think of myself as somewhat intellectually inferior to some of my friends with significantly worse results (Gs and Fs, and so on) than myself.
p21093
aVMore than anything, GCSE are a reflection on how effective your revision system and memory are, with a positive effect on your actual critical thinking/ wisdom if you put some thought into your work beyond memorising facts.
p21094
aVA-levels take some real effort and are actually challenging.
p21095
aVOne thing I would like to disagree with is the notion of "kids not having to do anything/ not having any homework" that is popular among Eastern European immigrant-parents.
p21096
aVI was fed this lie prior to coming to the UK, and much annoyed by it being repeated by my parents for years.
p21097
aVThere is a plenty of homework given to British schoolchildren, and although it may not be as intense as what I experienced as a school kid in Latvia, it is enough to give you enough self discipline and extra practice outside of lesson, if you choose to do it.
p21098
aVAnd put some effort in.
p21099
aVThe biggest difference between the two education systems I've experienced is that there is a bigger workload in Latvia, and you get serious consequences, mostly in the form of a parent giving you a beating.
p21100
aVI think the hogging the middle/right hand lane thing is only really a problem when traffic begins to build.
p21101
aVYou cannot undertake someone who is sat in the middle lane and therefore when there is more traffic it forces everyone (who obeys the law) to be bottlenecked into the right hand lane to legally overtake them.
p21102
aVThis is what can cause huge traffic jams because then people brake to change lanes and the person behind them then brakes harder and so and and so forth until the traffic comes to a stand still. 
p21103
aVWELCOME TO CAPITALISM IN THE WEST, where money is the only thing that matters, and all decisions are based mostly on emotions rather than logic, science and rational thought.
p21104
aVthe U.S. is quite similar in these regards.
p21105
aVI'm not British, but I had to laugh in irony when I read #9 after having experienced the harrowing journey between Prague and Krakow on a Polish train.
p21106
aV&gt;Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code.
p21107
aVLove it.
p21108
aVPoland to the contrary: speed cameras EVERYWHERE, on top of that police catching people with portables in any random place (you meet them almost every day if you drive just a bit), and people driving like CRAZY: overspeeding by 50-100km/h, taking over on the corners, on double lines, doing three-lane slaloms around slower drivers, etc.
p21109
aVCan't understand how the driving works so well here with almost no enforcement.
p21110
aVAfter 3.5 years I'm now scared to drive in Poland.
p21111
aVI had a friend who was a driver, and he got assigned to deliver a package from Denmark to Poland.
p21112
aVWhen we entered Poland we were really surprised by the speed cameras.
p21113
aVThey were in every little road in small towns.
p21114
aVPOLAND EVEN HAVE SIGNS FOR THEM!
p21115
aV"In 100m we're going to test if you obey the traffic law or not.
p21116
aV" Like, how are you going to catch people speeding if you tell them that you're going to do so in 100m :D
p21117
aVMaybe the point is not to catch people speeding but to encourage them to drive at or below the limit!
p21118
aVThat could be.
p21119
aVUs danes wouldn't know about that since our government has a speed ticket budget to keep !
p21120
aV:D
p21121
aVYep, they actually introduced a law here that every stationary genuine speed camera (we also have some fake ones) has to be painted yellow to be clearly visible and have a warning sign a couple hundred meters before.
p21122
aVI really like it because the purpose of placing a speed camera shouldn't be more money to the government from speeding tickets but to actually reduce driving speed in certain spots like pedestrian crossing near school etc.
p21123
aVSour cream is near damn worshipped in this home.
p21124
aV&gt;  If I do not have money in my account, then do not send the bloody transfer, and let me handle that with my other provider.
p21125
aVYou're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances.
p21126
aVThose two statement seems conflicting.
p21127
aVIf you order them to send x amount of your money to person y, and it does that its following your orders.
p21128
aVIf you go under £0 because of that, then thats on you.
p21129
aVIf they refuse to and tell you they won't do it because you don't have money then sure thats *is* telling you what to do with your money.
p21130
aVIf you're not sure you will be able to afford setting to a direct debit, don't set up the direct debit.
p21131
aVAs a customer I would prefer the bank deny the transaction than to put it through and charge an extra fee.
p21132
aVI would too, but i don't think its right to complain that they don't in the same sentence as you complain about not wanting them control over your finances.
p21133
aVI guess we disagree over the meaning of controlling my finances.
p21134
aVIf I don't have the money to do something but try to anyway (because I'm an idiot and I do that occasionally) then loaning me money and charging me a fee for it is more controlling in my opinion than just saying "You don't know have the money to do that.
p21135
aV"  Instead of just saying no I'm now indebted to the bank.
p21136
aVPerhaps you should keep track of your finances better rather than relying on the bank to tell you when you don't have the money for something?
p21137
aVThe bank allow this to happen specifically to avoid exerting control over someones money, if you can't control your own spending you really can't expect someone youre not paying to do it for you.
p21138
aV&gt; Ill people at work\u000a\u000aPart of me thinks it's the stiff upper lip we take pride in.

aVHell, I got off at a small station just after Dorking, and the same there, you have to walk directly across both rail lines to get to the other platform, or leave the station.
p21152

aVOne thing you have not mentioned is our national religion: Health and Safety, more commonly known as 'elf n' safety.
p21162
aVLike any religion, it has good and bad aspects to it, and the extremists seem completely irrational, however, for me it is one of the most wonderfully British things.
p21163
aVLike you, I am an immigrant but I was raised here, and when I see my parents (who were raised in a different country) violate some of the most basic tenets of this religion, it makes me think "are you crazy!?".

aVSo what is the deal with boilers?
p21170
aVI live in a part of the US that has cold winters, really cold, not what passes for cold in the UK, but nobody talks about their furnaces much.
p21171
aVOr is this "boiler" some kind of tea making device?
p21172
aVWhat's a double tap?
p21173
aVBeing an American, a double tap is a specific technique used to fire two shots quickly with a handgun.
p21174
aVEdit: damn you Swype
p21175
aVExactly.
p21176
aVI'm American and have no idea what a double tap is nor a boiler.
p21177
aVBoiler isn't a furnace?
p21178
aVA heater?
p21179
aVI'm in California.
p21180
aVI have central heating air.
p21181
aVEverything runs off electricity and natural gas.
p21182
aVIs there some other way to do it?
p21183
aV'Faucets' are taps.
p21184
aVThere's a completely ridiculous, logically indefensible thing you find with some taps in the UK: they have [separate hot and cold taps](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=uk+separate+taps&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zcv7U_KvGqTN7Aa2hoH4AQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1099&amp;bih=806).
p21185
aVIt's barmy that *new* sinks are built this way.
p21186
aVI think your furnace = UK boiler.
p21187
aVYou can see how they work [here](http://www.britishgas.co.uk/products-and-services/boilers-and-central-heating/new-boilers/central-heating-and-boilers-explained/how-it-works.html).
p21188
aVSolar hot water here in PT, so no boiler talk for me I'm afraid.
p21189
aVI did a little research, this is exactly it, thanks.
p21190
aVSome places in the US do have separate hot and cold faucets, but it's highly unusual.
p21191
aVWhen I come across it and want to wash my hands, I plug the sink and rinse in the mixed water.
p21192
aV(the concept comes from when people used wash basins and were sparing about water use) \u000a\u000aBoilers are still fairly common here, but mostly in older homes and buildings.
p21193
aVRadiators for heat; it works well.
p21194
aVMore modern homes and buildings heat the air itself and force the heated air through the house, relying on both fans and convection to maintain a comfortable temperature.
p21195
aVThis can come from an electric heating element, or a flame from natural gas, propane, or heating oil. 
p21196
aVI've always washed my hands really quickly under the hot tap as it takes a while to go from cold to life threatening, moving to the cold tap when it crosses over into dangerous.
p21197
aVYou see steam boilers a lot in New York City - most older apartment buildings have them.
p21198
aVI don't know how it is done in other countries, but most houses in the UK have a central heating system consisting of a sealed set of pipes running through the property, branching off into metal radiators in each room.
p21199
aVThis is connected to a gas boiler that heats up the water flowing through the system.
p21200
aVThe boiler also provides hot water for the taps (faucets), showers, etc.
p21201
aVI don't know what double taps is referring to though.
p21202
aVSome properties have twin taps (hot &amp; cold), others have mixers.
p21203
aVIt varies.
p21204
aVSeperate faucets for hot and cold water, as opposed to a mixer type.
p21205
aVIt really makes no sense to have these in bathrooms- you have a choice between washing your hands in freezing cold or scalding hot water, or filling the whole basin. 
p21206
aVInterestingly enough, a technique developed by Fairbairne and Sykes, a pair of British policemen, probably more famous for [this](http://images.knifecenter.com/thumb/1500x1500/knifecenter/scorpion/images/SCTACTFSCnw.jpg).

aVSame experience - there's something seriously wrong with banks here.
p21224
aVUltra complected, slow and totally random.
p21225
aVI took me over 4 hours and 6 visits at three branches to open account...\u000a\u000a2.
p21226
aVI don't get that either and the banker couldn't really explain it.
p21227
aVHe admitted that it's probably just to make money (you can even pay them extra to have a service that warns you from them charging you, it's like they sell you protection from themselves...)\u000a\u000a4.
p21228
aVYes, people are really obsessed with face time here.
p21229
aVAnd you're not really allowed to lunch..?!
p21230
aVWhy do they how long I work and which hours as long as I do my job?
p21231
aVSometime I just sit around to look busy even though I could go home because I'm done with everything.

aVIt's like an incentive to work slowly...\u000a\u000a5.

p21239
aVI think it's a cultural thing.

p21262
aVResearch shows that driving enforcement has little to do with how well people drive.

aVThis is part of the British obsession with bureaucracy.
p21275
aVWe tend to design business processes to cross every possibility, even ones that are stupid.
p21276
aVAlso, businesses like to have as much information as possible on who they are dealing with, and the British as a people really don't give a flying fuck about their privacy or their rights- 'I have nothing to hide' is a common sentiment here.
p21277

p21278
aVBanks can charge you when this happens, so they let it happen.

p21282
aVOlder British citizens still use them as, I believe, do businesses.
p21283
aVThat said yeah, they really are totally unneeded in today's world.
p21284
aVHowever the British tend to be loathe to let go of anything in favour of something new if it's been around for a while.
p21285
aVThis is also visible in many other areas of our culture and the way that we do business.
p21286
aVWe are quite retrospective as a society.
p21287

p21288
aVOh god this one.
p21289
aVThe British have the most fucked up set of work ethics.
p21290
aVIn essence, if you're off sick you're deemed to be 'less of a worker'.
p21291
aVIt's seen as a badge of honour to fight through your sickness and deliver a day's work anyway.
p21292
aVPeople who don't do the same are lesser workers.
p21293
aVNever mind if you fucked up the simplest tasks because you couldn't think straight or if you infected the entire office- you made the effort and came to work.
p21294
aVWell done.

aVAs a people we tend to polite to those we can see.
p21307
aVNot so much to those we can't.
p21308
aVSo when you're parking and make eye contact with people, decorum tends to take over.
p21309
aVIn parking you make eye contact.
p21310

aVWe are finally catching up on the plumbing.
p21314
aVMost new bathrooms have single taps.

p21316
aVYeah this is pretty common among a certain type of person.
p21317
aVTypically they're yuppies, but you get cocks in any walk of life.
p21318
aVThe psychology is 'if I'm somewhere else, it's someone else's job to clean it up'.
p21319
aVIt's like people who leave shit on the floor at the station because 'it's the cleaner's job to sort it'.
p21320
aVNo, it's the cleaning staff's job to handle daily wear and tear.
p21321
aVThat said many stations don't have bins anymore because it's too easy to put bombs in them.
p21322
aVSo in many cases you're ENCOURAGED to litter.

p21328
aVBritish management is terrible management.
p21329
aVThey don't have the analytical minds associated with German business, or the charisma and confidence associated with Americans.
p21330
aVThey don't have the loyalty of the Japanese, or the hard work of the Chinese.
p21331
aVBritish management is a fucking disgrace, and it's a shame because the average British worker while they have some screwed up priorities (see sick leave) are generally dedicated and well meaning.
p21332
aVBut without decent managers employees can only do so much.

p21337
aVOur method of privatization just hasn't worked.
p21338

p21340
aVIt seriously needs to be overhauled.
p21341
aV13.
p21342
aVToo many people.
p21343
aVThe average Brit is right wing.
p21344
aVThey often talk like they are left wing and hold left wing values in many parts of their psyche, but certain triggers just turn us into Fox news anchors.
p21345
aVThe Daily Heil has learned to capitalize on that.

p21347
aVWe haven't had a genuinely good leader in a while.

aVLow pass year?
p21355
aVChildren too stupid.
p21356
aVThe real issue is that many children are not taught a subject, but how to pass an exam on that subject.
p21357
aVActual proper education doesn't really start until University.
p21358
aVSadly the right wing element that is so common in Britain favours rote learning and rigid academia.
p21359
aVAs such this isn't going to change soon.
p21360
aV16.
p21361
aVSee Cheques.
p21362
aVPeople don't like new stuff here.
p21363
aVThat and there's also this other peculiar element of the British psyche that helps explain a lot of your observations.
p21364
aVIn essence, a British person would rather spend 10 minutes actively working on a task, than spend 3 minutes doing nothing, followed by 2 minutes of work, in order to achieve the same task.
p21365
aVBasically, we prefer to maintain constant activity rather than do something in a way that would require sitting around.
p21366
aVIn work, this means people tend to favour manually sorting and fucking around with spread sheets than using an automated system to get the same result.
p21367
aVWhen something goes wrong at an automated till, you wait 30 seconds to a minute for someone to help.
p21368
aVThat time is seem as wasted, even though accounting for that time you're still probably ahead of a regular till.
p21369
aVIt's a serious problem with our culture and I feel it holds many people back from realizing their potential.

aVDangerous driving isn't polite.
p21372
aVThat said you will encounter nutters quite often.
p21373
aVCountry roads are filled with people who assume there's no one around and large cities have their petrol heads.

aV18.
p21375
aVWhat?
p21376
aV19.
p21377
aVNever encountered this.

aVAre you living in Worcester?
p21379
aV20.
p21380
aVWe didn't fully convert to metric for reasons I have already outlined.
p21381
aVAnd lots of other reasons of debatable veracity too.\u000a
p21382
aVHaha, I loved reading this.
p21383
aVAgree with many of the points, but I have so much more than you!
p21384
aVAnd I was born there.. You'd think I'd be used to them.
p21385
aVMy biggest gripe about England has got to be the drinking culture.
p21386
aVPut that in the bin, and England stands to gain everything.
p21387
aVWhat is double taps?
p21388
aV?
aVOne hot tap, one cold tap.
p21389
aVFor people who like scalding one hand while freezing the other.
p21390
aVA relic of a past era when people would use the plug to mix some water to wash in.
p21391
aVI read that whole post in a polish accet.
p21392
aV10/10 would read again.
p21393
aVNumber 2 really shocked me--that is, I was shocked that anyplace in the world doesn't do those things.
p21394
aVI live in America, and bank fees are just a fact of life--I seriously never considered that anyplace might not have them.
p21395
aVWhat the hell is a double tap?
p21396
aVAnd why the hell would anyone want sour milk?
p21397
aVThat's when you know it's time to dump it out.
p21398
aVI can't vouch for the UK, but in the US, if you  take three days off sick, you'd damn well better have a doctor's note and enough sick leave to cover it.
p21399
aVPeople work sick because to do otherwise is a severe risk of becoming unemployed.
p21400
aVIt sucks, but it happens all the time.
p21401
aVThose portable shopping scanners sound awesome.
p21402
aVMaybe in twenty more years, we'll have them.
p21403
aVAnd one more:  I feel your pain as to the education.
p21404
aVI have no idea what I will do if my kids ever become unmotivated the way you describe...I'll be completely in over my head, because school systems here, like the ones you're describing, mostly don't give a shit.
p21405
aVIt wasn't always this way--I remember it being otherwise when I was in school--but I was truly stunned when my kids started school a few years ago.
p21406
aVThings have really gone downhill.
p21407
aVDouble tap\u000aIn most of bathrooms in uk you have one tap with hot and another one with cold water.
p21408
aVSour milk.
p21409
aVPasteurized(or UHT) milk is getting spoiled(stinky, disgusting and bitter taste, not drinkable at all).
p21410
aVWhen you will take raw milk mostly it will became sour and more dense, which some people including me likes it a lot, its popular in eastern europe.
p21411
aVIts similar as yogurt in taste, consistence, but more sour.
p21412
aVJust different microorganism are participating during fermentation.
p21413
aVAh, okay.
p21414
aVMakes sense (the sour milk, that is).
p21415
aVAs for the double tap, hmm, interesting...here, you usually have just one faucet, with two knobs.
p21416
aVNot sure if that's what you're describing, or if you mean a single knob (which is how many showers operate here).
p21417
aVTwo separated faucets - one for hot water another one for cold one.
p21418
aVI was just few days in uk and I still didnt found a way to wash hands in medium hot water.
p21419
aVYeah, that was my thought, too.
p21420
aVThe entire purpose in having a single tap with two lines coming in, is to be able to control the water temperature.
p21421
aVAnd I suppose I could get used to this--but what if the plumber accidentally sets the hot water temp too high?
p21422
aVThird-degree burns?
p21423
aV&gt; And why the hell would anyone want sour milk?
p21424
aVThat's when you know it's time to dump it out.
p21425
aVNot if it's done properly.
p21426
aVThen it's [delicious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soured_milk).
p21427
aVBut you won't get UHT milk to do that :|
p21428
aVAs a 20-year expatriate about to move back to the UK, this helped, thanks :)
p21429
aVDid you get the licensing (tax) for your TV yet? 
p21430
aVDon't have a TV, so I can skip that one :-)
p21431
aVI can't say I've noticed people being messy on the underground in general other than leaving their newspapers behind but obviously you'll always get someone who seems to think he can leave his rubbish wheverever he chooses.
p21432
aVIt's certainly not the accepted norm though.
p21433
aVI will say, however, that I've regularly seen Easter European/Russian guys on the underground drinking beer/spirits.
p21434
aVThis is one thing that grinds my gears.
p21435
aVIf it was a one-off that'd be fine but it's quite a regular observation.
p21436
aVI guess I'm more aware of this as I often travel with my daughter on the underground.
p21437
aVExplain the parking?
p21438
aVYou mean you can park anywhere without a ticket?
p21439
aVIt's like that in America.
p21440
aVYou can't just park anywhere you want, but in most places you can park on the street.
p21441
aVIn downtown areas you usually have to pay, but free street parking is very common outside of large cities.
p21442
aVWhere is that not common?
p21443
aVAs a one-time resident in the UK:\u000a\u000a4) Was always amazed by this as well.
p21444
aVIt's really different in this respect from Eastern Europe.
p21445
aVMaybe it's the legacy of Protestant discipline, or something?
p21446
aV5) Always liked tea with milk.
p21447
aVChips with vinegar are still a thanks but no thanks kind of thing.
p21448
aV6) Have found the British to be some of the best (i.e.
p21449
aVleast impudent) drivers.
p21450
aV10) True dat.
p21451
aV13) I like The Daily Mail, I consider it to be the authentic voice of the British people.
p21452
aVThey have really developed the art of clickbait into something approaching a science.
p21453
aVRead The Economist to understand the elites; read The Daily Mail to understand the people.
p21454
aV15) Education:\u000a\u000a&gt; A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council.
p21455
aVSo, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14?
p21456
aVAnd if yes, is that intentional?
p21457
aVHow does the relative ranking of your Polish school compare with that of your son's British school?
p21458
aVBecause that's quite important.
p21459
aVI know East Europeans like to wax all superior about their school systems relative to the Brits or the Americans (I would know, being Russian) but for some reason it isn't getting translated into more productive workers or more innovative scientists.
p21460
aVI suspect a large part of it is accidentally comparing higher than average or merely average schools in their home countries with below average British schools.
p21461
aV18) Yes there's a whole range of East European stuff that's either unavailable or hard to find in the UK.
p21462
aVPersonally, my biggest bugbear is perhaps one of the most basic: These huge, shitty, overly watery cucumbers they have in the UK:\u000a\u000ahttp://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/27/article-1391526-0C4B00E100000578-11_468x286.jpg\u000a\u000aAs opposed to normal cucumbers:\u000a\u000ahttp://pngimg.com/upload/cucumber_PNG2049.png\u000a\u000aIt's also really bad for fermented products in general, which are only available in the more upscale places.\u000a\u000a
p21463
aVThe Daily Mail is NOT the voice of the British people.
p21464
aVIt is a pretty foul newspaper. 
p21465
aV"I like The Daily Mail, I consider it to be the authentic voice of the British people"\u000a\u000aNo, hell no.
p21466
aVThe Daily Mail is the voice of a small, typically small minded, minority.
p21467
aVThere are a hell of a lot of people who hate that paper, it is not the voice of the British people.
p21468
aVDavid Cameron is in power, so I suspect it is.
p21469
aVSour Milk?
p21470
aVConfused American!
p21471
aVIt's not the bacteria free milk that you kept out of the frigde for a year, next to your radiator - sour milk.
p21472
aVIt's the healthier, real milk, that goes through natural process thanks to all the positive bacteria that are usually removed, in order to let the milk have a longer expiration date and to be able to stay open in your refrigerator for many days instead of like 24-48  hours.
p21473
aVAlso, fresh milk does not have a year long expiration date.
p21474
aVYou drink it.
p21475
aVIt's mostly used as breakfast item, like you do with orange juice - we do it with sour milk and other similar items (like the ones made from butter), but it's great at any part of the day, or a fantastic cure for hangover.
p21476
aVIt taste much more like yogurt than spoiled milk that you may know.
p21477
aVMy friend spent a lot of time in the US, and she told me that you don't have the same yogurt culture as in most of Europe.
p21478
aVYour yogurt selections are terrible, and the quality is very low.
p21479
aVIt only changed recently to be a bit better, but I would guess that most americans don't even know the taste of a good quality yogurt and other diary items like sour cream, sour milk etc.
p21480
aVAlso, sour milk and cream are generally disliked.
p21481
aVFor the americans, the concept of putting sour cream on boiled potatos at lunch is horrible, but here in Poland it's almost a tradition and anybody would probably tell you it tastes great.
p21482
aVFor us, (not the present generation of kids), eating "crisps" as a potato substitute (as seen on american tv) for your lunch is just a travesty. 
p21483
aVUgh I've been out the country so long I assumed chips meant crisps and thought we'dcome full circle back to grandma times
p21484
aVLong haired carpets in the bathrooms.
p21485
aVDrafty windows and heaters going full blast (the British don't believe in double glazing - no, really, they *don't believe it.

aVNot just in woodland cabins and caravans, but in fairly modern housing.
p21489
aV[deleted]
p21490
aVOh yeah, the British often run their water pipes on the outside of houses.
p21491
aVI suspect that stems from the same refusal to accept winter.
p21492
aVCreates a continual trade for plumbers, too.
p21493
aVWhat on earth do you want sour milk for?
p21494
aVSounds gross!
p21495
aVBecause it's delicious and healthy.
p21496
aVIt's a part of your complete breakfast, a quick meal when you are at work, a snack, a dietary solution and a great cure for hangover. 
p21497
aVThere's your problems with haircuts lad, your sending him to the hairdressers men go to barbers.
p21498
aVHmm, in Poland they are mostly unisex and if not - it's clearly marked.
p21499
aVSo maybe this one is a case of wrong expectations.
p21500
aVNever trust a Judy to cut your hair.
p21501
aVIn the U.S. depending on the culture of your particular work place, you very well may be expected to work when sick and even get in trouble if you are sick more than a few days a year.
p21502
aVI called out because of the flu back during "the Swine Flu" days.
p21503
aVI was informed that I would need to provide a doctors note or I would face disiplinary action.
p21504
aVThis was not related to anything on my part but moreover a general paranoid suspicion by my employer that thier employees were taking advantage of the swine flue scare.
p21505
aVSo I went to the doctor and waited for 2 hours and when a doctor finaly came to see me she was very angry "Why are you hear?
p21506
aV" asked very agrily.
p21507
aVI replied "I believe I have the flu.
p21508
aV"  and she said "but why the hell did you come here?
p21509
aVyou need to stay home.
p21510
aV"  I said "my employer told me I need a doctors note"  and she said "no you don't.
p21511
aVThey can't tell you that it is illegal.
p21512
aVIf you have the flu, stay home!!!!
p21513
aV"  Americans ~~often like to pretend we~~ have no weakness.  
p21514
aVPoland is fucking mental compared to the UK.
p21515
aVBeautiful, but mental.
p21516
aVWe're just quirky.  
p21517
aV1: US does this too\u000a\u000a2: US does this too.
p21518
aVIt helps them get money, and the bank owners become rich.
p21519
aVIt's not really for your benefit\u000a\u000a3: I don't know, a lot of places seem to require checks (US again... since that's my only source of knowledge) or stuff that is not cash, so that it has a lower chance of being counterfeit or something.
p21520
aV4: You only get a set amount of "sick" days.
p21521
aVA lot of people literally cannot afford to go over the amount of days they are allowed to be sick, or, in severe cases, can be fired simply for being sick too often even if they don't go over.
p21522
aVWhy?
p21523
aVBecause they are costing the company money for being absent.
p21524
aVI am not sure how this translates to Britain though, because the state I'm in has job laws that allow either you or your employer to terminate your employment at ANY time.
p21525
aVOthers force a notice of two weeks.
p21526
aV5: I don't know, this is British people being all British or something.
p21527
aVAlso at first I thought you meant "crisps" because we call them chips, with vinegar, and I was going to comment on how delicious they are.
p21528
aVI could see your version of chips being okay tasting too.
p21529
aV6: Middle/right lane are for faster travelers if I recall.
p21530
aVIt's common courtesy to let the guys who think they need to get somewhere in a hurry go in those lanes, and if you're driving slower to be in the leftmost lane (rightmost if in America or... Australia.
p21531
aVmaybe Canada too...
p21532
aVI think) Also what you described is called a "Douchebag", "Douchecanoe" "Wanker" or "Ass/arsehole".
p21533
aVSorry you come across so many of them.
p21534
aV7: If you visit America you'll find a lot of the same practices from Poland, it seems.
p21535
aVOnly specific areas you're allowed to park on the street for free, and it is not always calm.
p21536
aV8: I'm not following this one, sorry.
p21537
aV(I don't know what you're "on about".
p21538
aV)\u000a\u000a9: People who wear suits for a living are usually the most disgusting of us all.
p21539
aVThey're entitled assholes who treat everything and everyone else as if they are inferior (typically) even if subconsciously.
p21540
aVWelcome to the first world.
p21541
aV10: What the fuck?
p21542
aV....
p21543
aVOkay either you're going very cheap, or something is very wrong.
p21544
aVI don't know what's going on here, but that sucks.
p21545
aV11: In America we are pretty much forced to insure now, seriously...
p21546
aVIt's law.
p21547
aVHouse, Car, Health.
p21548
aVYou can have renter's insurance, phone insurance, bicycles, animals, life insurance, expensive item like tv's/computers.. Everyone wants to make money off you by promising money back if stuff fails, then making you go through hell to actually get some of the money you paid them already for said item.
p21549
aVYAY capitalism!
p21550
aV12: Trains...
p21551
aVTrains.. Oh those things that make my 50 mile commute take longer.
p21552
aVYeah, no.
p21553
aVI have no idea what riding on a train is like because my state is as large as the entire country you now reside in, and it would be woefully inefficient to set up proper mass transit to get from one side to another cheaply and effectively since our population density is far lower.
p21554
aV13: Is that a newspaper?
p21555
aVI have no idea.
p21556
aVThose aren't really circulated as much anymore.
p21557
aV14: Sorry, I don't keep up with politics.
p21558
aVIt just infuriates me, and I get enough of that from working in a call center.
p21559
aV15: Hit and miss here.
p21560
aVGeneral rule of thumb seems to be stay away from large cities with a reputation like milwaukee or detroit if you want to get a good education.
p21561
aVWhat you explain seems to be someone that tries to game the system for a free ride.
p21562
aVThey're not usually intelligent, and seem to think the world exists to support them.
p21563
aVIt can, kind of, but only barely.
p21564
aVThey'll be in crippling debt most likely for the remainder of their life if they stick to that plan.
p21565
aVOr at least that's what would happen here.
p21566
aV16: Technophobia.
p21567
aVOld people that have gradually seen technology rise around them are afraid of it, rather than embracing it, and prefer speaking with an actual person.
p21568
aVMaybe that or we are just sociopaths, since I do the same.
p21569
aV17: I think this has to do with how people are raised.
p21570
aVI assume it's similar where from a young age you are taught to look both ways, be kind or whatnot.. and the government likely advertises or supports driver safety in some way.
p21571
aVAlso I don't know how easy it is to find a very cheap car in Poland, but here it can be very very necessary (reminder: 50 mile commute, one way) so you want to take care of it because you can't afford not to.
p21572
aV18: It may be that I live in wisconsin, but we have a lot of sour cream things.
p21573
aVAlso cheese curds.
p21574
aVYou should try some :)\u000a\u000a19: boilers as in... machinery that heats water to make what comes out of the faucet/shower warm?
p21575
aVYou've got me, I can't imagine why it's so popular.
p21576
aV20: I apologize for the imperial measurement system, even though my country didn't start it, yours did.
p21577
aVWe didn't get the update though and forced it to stay 'popular'.\u000a\u000a
p21578
aVMy two pence as a duel national British American:\u000a1.
p21579
aVBanks are ridiculous.
p21580
aVDon't even get me started on things like mortgages, opening times, online accounts, over drafts.
p21581
aVRidiculous.
p21582
aV4.
p21583
aVIll people at work?
p21584
aVBritish people love complaining, if they stay at home then they can't voice their complaints to as many people!
p21585
aVI'd like to think that complaining also explains point 10 - we secretly enjoy a bad service so that we can moan about it.
p21586
aVMy girlfriend REGULARLY pays £50 for a haircut and ALWAYS complains that they didn't do it right but never says anything to them.
p21587
aVI got so fed up of having shit hair cuts that I started doing it myself and 9 times out of 10 I do a better job than they would!
p21588
aV5.
p21589
aVYou're wrong.
p21590
aVOn both counts.
p21591
aV11.
p21592
aVDon't insure everything.
p21593
aVEnsure your car and building and contents, then everything else is optional.
p21594
aVGetting a mortgage I had the bank trying to get me to buy life insurance for me and my partner teling me it was essential, but upon reading up I found out they just wanted the 25% commission from their chosen insurance company.
p21595
aVScumbags.
p21596
aVIronically, scumbags is also the answer to 13.
p21597
aV14.
p21598
aVWhy stop at DC?
p21599
aVName one politician who isn't a complete wanker, I dare you.
p21600
aV15.
p21601
aVIf you think the British system is bad, take a quick look at the US education system.
p21602
aVGoing from British to US and back to British I can happily say that British is far more advanced but there are some serious changes that need to be made.
p21603
aVHaving an actual teaching in charge of the gov's education department could be a good start... just saying.
p21604
aV17.
p21605
aVAre you serious?
p21606
aVIn London there are cameras ever 10meters.
p21607
aVIn Wales, we have lots of warning signs and no actual cameras though - swings and roundabouts.
p21608
aV20.
p21609
aVOur entire measuring system is flawed.
p21610
aVWe buy milk in pints but Pepsi in litres?
p21611
aVWe measure driving distance in miles but running in meters?
p21612
aVAnd let's not even get onto the subject of cooking... it just goes mental there.
p21613
aVGreat post, made me chuckle and think. 
p21614
aVAs a Brit I kinda agree with a lot of this, and there are some interesting surprises i just thought were "normal" but apparently aren't.
p21615
aVHowever the motorway thing, the rule is "Stay left unless overtaking" So you should always drive in the left most lane possible.
p21616
aVIf you're not actually overtaking anything, but still in the middle lane (speed is completely irrelivant) other drivers will get pissy.
p21617
aVIf you're actually passing something, no one will care that you're in the middle lane, but if that truck up ahead is like 100-200 yards away, but you're just staying in the middle lane to avoid having to change lane later, you're doing it wrong.
p21618
aVSure, they can just pass you, but eventually with so many cars sitting in the middle lane, to avoid changing lanes too much, creates conjestion.
p21619
aVThey actually made it a law recently i think, IIRC you can get points on your license and a fine for sitting in the middle lane when not overtaking.
p21620
aVYou speak better English than most English people.
p21621
aVConglaturation.
p21622
aVHogging the middle lane is standard in Poland, but I'm surprised you haven't learnt to do better over the years in UK.
p21623
aVAnd since overtaking in the outer lane is technically legal in Poland... that's usually the fastest lane as well (at least on 3+ lane roads around Warsaw).
p21624
aVTo chime in as a Kiwi, 4 years now:\u000a\u000aBanks - Agree with the debit thing.
p21625
aVNZ, commonly about 3-5 years behind on most things the US or UK will have (Internet Speeds, TV shows, Fashion, etc), has had EFT-POS for over 17 years (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale).
p21626
aVIt's instant, and declines if you have no money.
p21627
aVYou can also access up to 3 accounts from the one card.
p21628
aVUK, 1 card, 1 account, and it will then take between 2 hours and 5 days for the funds to be taken out.
p21629
aVThen you go into overdraft you didn't authorise.
p21630
aVThe account getting is worse than I think OP is letting on, and the same goes for Utility Bills and anything else.
p21631
aVTo get a bank account, they want a utility bill with your name on it.
p21632
aVThe get a utility bill with your name on it you need a bank account.
p21633
aVYou also need a job, typically.
p21634
aVMost work places won't put through you contract until they have all you bank details for HR and accounting.
p21635
aVTo get the account you need a signed letter saying you have a contract....\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy exactly do I have to remember my National Insurance number, and my NHS number?
p21636
aVThe only reason for the NI number is to contribute to the NHS.

aVOne number should cover both (again, I'm spoiled in NZ with a single ACC number)\u000a\u000aTransport - ok this one's very recent, and probably only for London - but if I have money I should be able to get on.
p21638
aVNow they are all card/Oyster card (travel card) only, but there are only top-up points at tube stations.
p21639
aVWell if I have to get a bus to get to the tube station...\u000a\u000aFood and Drink - Fish and Chips, why do they leave the skin on the fish, it's 15 seconds extra filleting, and you can eat the whole thing.
p21640
aVAlso, pints are served in pint glasses - so unless it's your drink you're buying and you sip it down a bit the moment you get it, you spill the first 2 mouthfuls carrying it away from the bar.
p21641
aVThis goes double for cider.
p21642
aVOther - Celsius when it's cold, Fahrenheit when it's hot?
p21643
aV(Ooh, it'll be down to -2 tomorrow... Oh but today it was in the nineties!).
p21644
aVI love this country and don't plan on going anywhere else at this stage in my life.
p21645
aVAnd the people are fantastic.
p21646
aVAll my little gripes I think could be traced back to some idiot in a very senior position not thinking something through fully before it's released to a whole nation/major city
p21647
aVI don't see farenheit used anywhere!
p21648
aVcelsius always!
p21649
aVMost of the points are fine, but I don't think I've ever seen the skin on fish left on, it's always battered fish in chip shops.
p21650
aVAlso Fahrenheit???
p21651
aVI don't know or remember a time Fahrenheit has ever been used by anyone here :s \u000a\u000aMy biggest gripe is the banks, we have to jump through so many hoops 
p21652
aVJust got my boiler fixed, only problem now is that I can only use the hot water tap for 5 seconds before I get 3rd degree burns. 
p21653
aVThis is amazing!
p21654
aVI lived in the UK for 3 years, in Edinburgh, as a student and in a homestay so most of this weren't things I was directly involved with, but man does this bring back memories.
p21655
aVDid you enjoy your time in Edinburgh, at least?
p21656
aVAs much as I like to nitpick, I enjoyed my time there a lot.
p21657
aVI was homesick (it was my first time living abroad) but whenever I got over it and decided to hang out in the city I had a blast.
p21658
aVOverall review:-\u000a\u000aCity: Awesome, with great public transportation and a preserved old heart.
p21659
aVWould recommend.
p21660
aVPeople: Mostly polite as you would expect.
p21661
aVA bit reserved and maybe with a shorter fuse, but break the ice and you are in for a treat!
p21662
aVIdiots exist though, like anywhere else in the world.
p21663
aVi dunno about the education point, considering out education system is second only to finland (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27314075) , but i do agree that students attitude can be changed a lot, being in a situation myself where i notice how unmotivated my peers are and how unmotivated i am, so it is food for thought
p21664
aVSome of this honestly surprises me, and I'M from the bloody UK.
p21665
aVI think were you live is a big part of it.
p21666
aVThe USA have their states, but this over-populated island has a different flavour with each city.
p21667
aVI loved this.
p21668
aVAs for the middle lane hogging thing- I agree with you.
p21669
aVIf you know you're going to constantly overtaking there's no need to move in.
p21670
aVOne thing that PISSES ME OFF is people taking the law into their own hands.
p21671
aVNo one has the right to tell you to move over- its not their fucking job. 
p21672
aVI enjoyed this post a lot, thanks for sharing. 
p21673
aVWait we have portable scanners in supermarkets?
p21674
aVTesco have them in some stores.
p21675
aVI remember them in Safeway a long time ago, too.
p21676
aVYour English is incredibly good for some one who has only been speaking it fir 3.5 years .
p21677
aVI was speaking it for much longer, this is a de facto standard language in IT.
p21678
aVThanks for the credit though :)
p21679
aVI agree with pretty much all these points as a born and raised Englishman.
p21680
aVEspecially Cheques.
p21681
aVCant stand the bloody things.
p21682
aVI do all my banking online apart from once or twice a year where my Nan still insists on sending her 29 year old grandson a £20 cheque for birthday/christmas.
p21683
aVI know I sound like an ungrateful shit but I'd prefer she didn't bother!
p21684
aVI feel like you just live in a shit part of the UK...?
p21685
aVWelcome to the West, where norm is maximum reward for minimal effort, because our "human rights" somehow means we don't need to earn our keep.
p21686
aVA lot of stuff about this country (and most westernised country) is designed to make as much profit for the company providing them with piecemeal benefits for the user.
p21687
aVOn the other hand, the people of Britain are a lovely bunch and the right cup of tea after a hard days work is to die for.
p21688
aVSo take the good with the bad I suppose, except here the good is really good and the bad really bends you over.
p21689
aVSome people are a real stickler for following the rules and get scared when they stray outside of it, which leads to anger and then things may start to get unreasonable.
p21690
aVAn example of this is middle lane hogging, where people think because they're going faster than the lorries that they shouldn't be in that lane because it's *effort* to change.
p21691
aVTo be honest, if the left most lane is clear you should be in there, it's not the "lorry lane", it's the left lane.
p21692
aVIf you aren't overtaking the people on the left at a reasonable pace then realistically you should drop a few MPH and travel with them.
p21693
aVWith regards to aggressive drivers, don't worry about them, some people aren't the most pleasant.
p21694
aVIf you get someone belting up behind you while you make a manoeuvre, just complete your manoeuvre then let them get on their way.
p21695
aVI usually drive at 80 on the motorways, it's the speed I default to, during the night it's easy, sit in the left lane, there's nobody around.
p21696
aVHowever during the day, this usually means I'm switching between the middle and right lane quite a lot.
p21697
aVI'm cool with the constant switching, if you check your mirrors in advance it's quite a painless experience indicating then switching lanes, but sometimes you will have people come up and start to be aggressive and to be honest, it doesn't really matter.
p21698
aVI usually find making brief eye contact using my rear view mirror to be an effective way to get them to back off.
p21699
aVA lot of people think that just because they're in their car, they are isolated from the world, reminding them that they aren't breaks their pattern of behaviour and all of a sudden they become so sheepish the nearest Welshman would try to herd them in a pen.
p21700
aVI am emphatically NOT a lane hogger btw, but I often suffer aggressive tailgaters in Spain.
p21701
aVLike Michal, I keep to the legal speed or a safe 10% over (speedo shows 130, really 120) and my response to tailgaters is the following:\u000a1.
p21702
aVReduce speed gradually to the marked limit (speedo 120, really 110) by disengaging cruise control.
p21703
aVTailgater then has to slow down.
p21704
aV2.
p21705
aVTilt interior mirror downwards (door mirrors outwards, obviously only if electric) so that tailgater cannot make eye contact with me\u000a3.
p21706
aVIf tailgating continues, repeatedly dab brake pedal sufficient to light up brake lights but without braking.
p21707
aVI obviously get out of the tailgater's way as soon as physically possible and never make eye contact.
p21708
aVWhatever the TG attempts to do (usually gestures and mouthing obscenities) it is totally futile if he cannot make eye contact.
p21709
aVA reaction only spurs them on.
p21710
aV4.
p21711
aVStill working on the hidden 007-style in-car machine gun,bazooka, etc.
p21712
aVMy oh my, what fun I would have with that...
p21713
aVI really really love Polish people and I hate the bad rap they get here in the UK, but this has just confirmed for me that Polish people are the absolute best.
p21714
aVI immigrated to England with my family 8 years ago, the main difference from my dad's point of view is that everyone behaves differently, actually, many of my family members noticed that.
p21715
aVOver here in UK, or England at least, no one hesitates to speak to random strangers or smile at them whether in a shop or out on the street.
p21716
aVMeanwhile in Poland there is none of that, no one says "Hi", or "How're you doing" unless you knew them for quite a while.
p21717
aVThat's pretty varied according to which part of the UK you're in.
p21718
aVYou're in Somerset which must be pretty friendly.
p21719
aVOther parts of the country won't dream of making eye contact with strangers.
p21720
aVWell, it kinda makes sense that in the smaller towns and rural areas people would be more likely to be doing that.
p21721
aVBecause.. You know, less people means that they're closer together.
p21722
aVYou are describing:\u000a\u000a1.
p21723
aVA Risk Society (see Beck)\u000a\u000a2.

aVAfter reading that, some parts of the UK culture is pretty much 'Murican
p21730
aVI have one thing to add - apartments and houses:  \u000a- you can feel a light breeze even when the windows are shut.
p21731
aVEveryone is really cool about this and seem not to care much.
p21732
aV- carpets in the bathroom, covering 100% of the area
p21733
aVThis made me want to move to Poland.
p21734
aVGod I hate UK banking.
p21735
aVPolish banking - you have to pay a fee for everything you do.
p21736
aVThere are no free accounts, as you have to pay a monthly fee for having an account at all.
p21737
aVDid you use vinegar in Poland?
p21738
aVIf so, what for?
p21739
aVI can't think of anything other than chips that I put vinegar on.
p21740
aVlol, vinegar is for salad!
p21741
aVnot chips\u000a\u000a
p21742
aVHaha well that explains it then, salad is not a thing with which I (Scottish) am familiar with ;)
p21743
aVneh, vinegar is for everything here in UK.
p21744
aVchips, crisps, salads, meats, fishes.
p21745
aVvinegar.
p21746
aVvinegar everywhere.

p21752
aVsalads, preserved vegetables

aVYou would love reading Terry Pratchett.
p21754
aVHe pans the quirks of society very well (and he is British).
p21755
aVI already do love Terry Pratchett :-)\u000aAlthough recently I got the Long Earth trilogy from Audible that he's written in collaboration with Baxter.
p21756
aVWow, that was a long and boring experience.
p21757
aVI kept listening with the hope that something will finally happen... Nope.
p21758
aVAnd what did happen was mostly of no consequence.
p21759
aVNot recommended.
p21760
aVIt wasn't even funny like most of Pratchett's writing.
p21761
aVGood to know politicians are bad everywhere. 
p21762
aVNo mention how health care is "free"..........Thought not
p21763
aVyour point about education is very correct, I've been living in the UK for almost three years (I'm european), I am 25 and clearly remember one of my (british) friends telling me he didn't know much about WWII because they didn't study that in school.
p21764
aVI got my MA in the UK so I know universities are not bad at all but high schools look like a total mess to me. 
p21765
aVAre you sure he wasn't having a laugh?
p21766
aVI swear to god I asked him because it looked too strange and he just said they studied a very small portion of history in his hs! 
p21767
aVWow... what a terrible school haha.
p21768
aVYou can get sour cream in any supermarket.
p21769
aVThis was a very good read.
p21770
aVI was starting to give up on Reddit.
p21771
aVAs to the point made about illness: sounds like a typical American thing.
p21772
aVHere in the U.S., the attitude prevails that taking time off for illness harms productivity.
p21773
aVYour treated with suspicion and deemed lazy.
p21774
aVA weak link.
p21775
aVIrksome seeing a coworker shuffling around sneezing... especially if your work place is a restaurant.
p21776
aV&gt; Insure EVERYTHING.
p21777
aVIn Poland: car, house contents, maybe sometimes life insurance.
p21778
aVHere: car, house, house content, tenant's insurance, professional indemnity, bicycle, animals (small), animals (large, I have a horse), animal's third party insurance, dental (WTF, it is covered by NHS, at least partially, why do I need that?
p21779
aV), life, payment protection... name it.
p21780
aVIt's a jungle to understand what I really need, and what is just being actively sold to me.
p21781
aVWith the constant requests for me to insure something I bought to throw away in a year or two I have a simple policy.
p21782
aVI have an account which contains half of every insurance fee I've turned down (among other things, this is my general "what if shit happens" fund).
p21783
aVIt turns out I have more than enough in there to replace anything I might own, including my car.
p21784
aVPersonally my rule is I only insure stuff I couldn't simply replace out of that fund.
p21785
aVThe fund is my insurance.
p21786
aV&gt; Ill people at work.
p21787
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak, and spread germs so the next week half of the office is trying to cough their insides out.
p21788
aVLoss of productivity of you being away for three days is nothing compared to loss of productivity from 10 people succumbing to your flu.
p21789
aVI think this is a problem with the UK in general, being off sick is often seen as a bad thing, like you're letting people down. 
p21790
aV 21.
p21791
aVDoctors.
p21792
aVWhatever your disease is, they will ALWAYS advise you take some paracetamol/ibuprofen.
p21793
aVIf you go to your GP with an open wound, they will tell you to grind some paracetamol and sprinkle it over the wound.
p21794
aVIf you go to A&amp;E (which happened to my fiancee) they are likely to forget about you for about 3-4 hours (but still they will pass you by a thousand times).
p21795
aVJust a point added from a fellow Pole ;).
p21796
aV&gt;But consider that: I'm going on the middle lane, exactly at the speed limit with cruise control set, then some bastard sits on my rear bumper flashing lights\u000a\u000aEasy.
p21797
aVYou're both being cunts. 
p21798
aVI would say that your experience has a lot to do with living in a foreign country rather than living in the UK.
p21799
aVI'm British but live abroad and these things tend to just happen because the system was not designed with you (a foreigner moving to the country in the middle of your life) in mind.
p21800
aVFor instance, I found it horribly hard to open a bank account in Holland but when I talked to my Dutch friends they looked confused that I could find it difficult - it was seemless for them.
p21801
aVTalking to the tax office is impossible and you need an appointment for EVERYTHING, which I find incredibly annoying but the Dutch find normal... do you see what I mean?
p21802
aVAlso, the school your step-kid is in sounds fairly unpleasant- I don't know where you live nor where you came from in Poland but I can promise you that my educational experience was nothing like that, in spite of growing up in the poorest part of [England - which as this source points out is poorer than Poland](http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Cornwall-officially-poorest-area-UK/story-21062714-detail/story.html).
p21803
aVI wonder if you would have a different opinion if you were from the roughest part of Lodz?
p21804
aVBasically what I'm saying is that it's all relative and that a lot of your experiences/annoyances are probably simply caused by being foreign.
p21805
aVNot in a racist way that we hate foreigners but simply because the system is alien to you and not designed with you in mind.
p21806
aVI totally agree and this is more or less what I had in mind when writing this post.
p21807
aVTo share the experience.
p21808
aVAnd you can probably see that there are many things that - even though foreign and strange - I totally love about UK.
p21809
aVYou had trouble with a bank account in the Netherlands?
p21810
aVI only had to have my registration number (city council) and go to the bank (it took a while to actually open it, although something similar happened for me the UK, and yes, I have been an immigrant in both countries)
p21811
aV21.
p21812
aVWhat's up with the dirty tables in every pub/restaurant?
p21813
aVEither cover them with paper or at least clean them once in a while!
p21814
aVTo all the people banging on about choice, or not being allowed the option to bounce payments, what would actually happen in that case?
p21815
aVThe corner shop or petrol station you just shafted now can't get the money.
p21816
aVThey can't pay the wages of their staff.
p21817
aVThey use a recovery service so instead of a £30 bank charge you get a £130 debt collector charge.
p21818
aVThe knock on effect would be horrendous.
p21819
aVWhen you present your card, you are trading money for a service, if there was a significant risk of not getting that money, you wouldn't get the service or goods until the payment had gone through.
p21820
aVChaos would reign.
p21821
aVDogs and cats living together...\u000a\u000aEdit: I realise (somewhat late to the game) that people are actually complaining they would like to be told in the queue at the off licence or petrol station that their payment had been declined, rather than be forced into an overdraft.
p21822
aVI understand now, but I bet you most of you wouldn't actually prefer it really, when push came to shove.
p21823
aVIn Canada we get an "insufficient funds" message (right on the debit machine in the store) if you try to buy something that costs more than what you have in the bank (unless you have a prearranged overdraft at the bank).
p21824
aVIt is very embarrassing but  you can whip out a credit card or use another account to try again.
p21825
aV[deleted]
p21826
aVI was thinking this too.

aVSeriously?

aVWho buys this... thing?
p21834
aV&gt;David Cameron.
p21835
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p21836
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p21837
aVHow someone like that becomes a Prime Minister, I don't know.
p21838
aVAnd people generally believe what he says.
p21839
aVAh.
p21840
aVNow I understand.
p21841
aVI think I'd be quite interested to read something similar from someone who moved to Poland.
p21842
aVIt's probably my most upvoted post ever, which indeed is surprising, but I enjoyed the discussion here :)
p21843
aVMaybe you should try posting an AMA request if you are interested in hearing the opinions of a Brit in Poland.
p21844
aVNever know who you might find.
p21845
aV[deleted]
p21846
aVAbout the money thing, yes you're right.
p21847
aVBut this is a skill you need to learn, as before the whole concept of "tracking a balance" was non-existing to me.
p21848
aVLimits were hard, I kept two accounts open - one for bills, a second one for normal spending, and if I ever slipped I just made a transfer to my provider on the next day, after moving some of the balance between accounts.
p21849
aVHere, especially at the beginning when I had to buy furniture, spend money on rental deposit, learn the optimal ways to get to work, ship stuff from Poland, etc., I had some rough months from the financial point of view - and the way banks work did not help.
p21850
aVWhy have two accounts ?
p21851
aVJust have one and then all your money is in one place and you don't go overdrawn.
p21852
aVyeah maybe set up a savings account and move stuff into that at the end of the month just after you get paid. 
p21853
aVYour looking at it thinking your a customer and the bank should work for you and the UK would be a better place if it worked like that.
p21854
aVI think in the UK we've centred our economy on financial services and they've grown to powerfull.
p21855
aVYour suggestion would not help the banks make profit and we've got so used to thinking of banks as evil that we just accept their behaviour
p21856
aV[deleted]
p21857
aV15 years ago I tried to open an account that didn't have an overdraft facility and wouldn't pay out more money than I had in the account - guess what, there were no accounts like this.
p21858
aVIts a bit of a scam on the part of the banks.
p21859
aVMy bank is pissed off with me.
p21860
aVI opened my bank account 16 years ago.
p21861
aVIt has no over draft and it wont take money out if there is no money in there.
p21862
aVThe bank no longer has this service and whenever I need to go in they always try to get me to upgrade.
p21863
aVI have a savings account so I really don't need anything different for my main account.
p21864
aVI don't want an overdraft so every time I just say no.
p21865
aV[deleted]
p21866
aVIt wasn't a service I wanted, it was a service that was forced on me if I wanted a bank account.
p21867
aVNow the economics of free bank accounts may rely on forcing this service on you but that doesn't change the fact that for some its an undesired service that's pushed upon them.
p21868
aV[deleted]
p21869
aVWhen I have money in my pocket, if I spend all the money in my pocket there is no way for me to spend any more money.
p21870
aVImagine if your pocket had special magic coins at the bottom that were almost indistinguishable from real coins.
p21871
aVIf you don't remember exactly off the top of your head exactly how many real coins are in your pocket (given the multiple transactions you've engaged in over the last few days this isn't easy to do), and you accidentally spend one of the special magic coins, you get stung by a £9 fee.
p21872
aVSo whereas with money in your pocket you naturally regulate your spending, but bank accounts with overdrafts weaken your ability to regulate your spending.
p21873
aVIf you want to know how much money is in your pocket you count it, but for a bank account you have to go to a cash machine or phone up the bank - much harder to keep track of your balance thus much easier to incur accidental overdraft fees you had no intention of paying.
p21874
aVYes its possible to avoid these fees, but the banks have very carefully set it up to make it as easy as possible for you to accidentally pay overdraft charges.
p21875
aVIt doesn't have to be this way\u000a
p21876
aV[deleted]
p21877
aVYou *can*, but its harder to do which means some people fail, and that's all the banks need to cream money out of some people.
p21878
aVYou're coming at this from a personal responsibility point of view and you're right up to a point, but there are two parties involved in this - the bank and their customer.
p21879
aVIts wrong to focus on (and blame) only one party and pretend the other party's decisions have no impact.
p21880
aVI dunno, I can see his point.
p21881
aVIf you come from a country where your bank simply declines any transaction that there isn't funds for, then you would never need to watch your balance like a hawk.
p21882
aVToo much month left at the end of the money?
p21883
aVYou find out when your debit card stops working, not when you get a rude letter through the post saying "You went overdrawn without permission, we're charging you a £25 overdraft fee, a £10/week convenience fee and £30 for writing you this letter".
p21884
aVIt would definitely come as a bit of a shock the first time you got a letter like that.
p21885
aVProbably wouldn't even occur to you that it might happen.
p21886
aVThat's a bingo.
p21887
aVNope, it's the way banks work here that tracking the balance is necessary at all, under the penalty of charges.
p21888
aVThat was a foreign concept to me before, just something that you didn't need to think about at all.

aV[deleted]
p21890
aVThe difference is you cant spend money you dont have in other counties, it just gets declined
p21891
aVYup.
p21892
aVIf we did that here people would say we're forcing people into hardship (so we just do it by the back door, via overdraft fees, instead)
p21893
aVMoney management is one of those fundamental things everybody should know but nobody ever bothers to teach in schools.
p21894
aVChrist knows learning how to properly balance your weekly budget is more valuable information than what deity people half the world away pray to.
p21895
aVI think knowing about different cultures is still very important...
p21896
aVBut you don't learn about different cultures beyond "here's religion X" which is inevitably one of the Big Three.
p21897
aVI learned more about foreign culture in Modern Studies, which actually had a great unit on the Chinese political system.
p21898
aVThe bit you're missing is that the banks here will automatically give you an overdraft.
p21899
aVThe fee is not a "You are a bad person for not tracking your balance penalty", it is an explicit admin charge for them creating a loan for you.
p21900
aVIt's a fucking scam.
p21901
aVTry opening an account in the UK that has no overdraft facility.
p21902
aVYou can get a basic bank account that allows cards, no overdraft, direct debits and standing orders from every bank in the country fee free by law.
p21903
aV[deleted]
p21904
aVExcept you didn't ask for this service.
p21905
aVMany people would prefer that the transaction was declined instead of automatically getting an expensive loan.
p21906
aVAutomatic and non-optional services like that are a scummy business tactic IMO ('You should have paid attention' is not a good response.
p21907
aVPeople who make money by misdirecting people who aren't paying attention are scammers.
p21908
aV).
p21909
aVRight but it's not a service provided because you can't turn that shit off.
p21910
aVIt isn't a service a lot of people want.
p21911
aVI track my money but because I'm student I often have to pay for a bunch of stuff before my loan comes in.
p21912
aVI once got charged £25 quid because a deposit had an admin fee which pushed my overdraft into £0.25.
p21913
aVIt's bullshit, it's not a service, it's a trap.

aVI'll wait.
p21920
aVThat's what I was using a two-account system for before.
p21921
aVHere I was happy I managed to open one account as a newcomer.
p21922
aVMy new company didn't pay me for my first 10 days here (last days of a month), had to wait until the end of next month to get all of that together.
p21923
aVWhile having to cash out for security deposit, more than I envisioned.
p21924
aVI had savings but in Poland and it took a while to transfer them here, while I started to get hit by fees that were at the least unfair and unexpected to me.
p21925
aVI still don't get it, the whole concept is strange to me - zero is zero, you shouldn't be able to make a card transaction that's takes you into the minus zone, and the outgoing transactions just shouldn't happen.
p21926
aVWhy do I have to pay charges for the fact that bank says 'no'?
p21927
aVI get that this is normal to you, but it wasn't and still isn't to me as it just worked in a different way in Poland.
p21928
aVMade my first two months here much more stressful than they should be.
p21929
aVBut if the bank bounces the payment that you agreed to, by using the card, then the shop you bought the goods or services from won't get paid.
p21930
aVThe system breaks down immediately.
p21931
aVIs your complaint with the method of transaction?
p21932
aVIf you only used cash in Poland I could understand, but I doubt that, so what happened to the company you owed money to in Poland when the bank says no?
p21933
aVNothing happens, because you just can't pay/finalize a transaction in such situation.
p21934
aVYou need to have account specifically set up with debit for such minus transactions (but it's not default and you don't get punished for it).
p21935

p21936
aVWhen you move countries, have funds at different accounts, are moving homes, etc it can be hard to keep track.

aVIf anything the declined card would be more useful - if the card keeps working it gives the impression that everything is in place. 
p21938
aVHe's making the point that its his responsibility to know how much he has.
p21939
aVI have a permanent overdraft ready on my account just to save me not getting £30 charges if I let the ball drop.
p21940
aVIf I didn't I would have to keep track properly.
p21941
aVIt's a pretty fundamental part of living in society nowadays I would say, and not being in control by diligence or arranging an overdraft leads to debt.
p21942
aVI understand what he's saying, I just think he's being a bit of a dick and not taking into account how the difference can be strange or how the circumstances might mean you're not 100% on the ball and get tacked with charges that really are a bit scammy.
p21943
aVIt's standard here in England but if it's a service you should be able to choose it.
p21944
aVI haven't had problems since that one time, and it doesn't seem like OP has either, we are just giving our opinion on the attitude of the banks here.
p21945
aVPermanent overdraft is common of course in Poland for accounts, but not turning it on on demand and punishing you for it.\u000a\u000a
p21946
aVWith all due respect, it's you who is missing the point.
p21947
aVI grew accustomed that it IS the bank's job to manage the zero if that happens.
p21948
aVHence it's been weird stuff to me, and stressful on top of that.
p21949
aVIt's not anymore, it took me 2-3 months but I got on top of that in the end.
p21950
aV[deleted]
p21951
aVYou're a prick
p21952
aVAnd the banks are responsible for milking people using overdraft fees (among other nefarious means - PPI, anyone?).
p21953
aVThis isn't rocket science here. 
p21954
aVYou make total sense to me man.
p21955
aVHave one pitiful upvote against the onslaught.
p21956
aVDownvote but don't explain why or counter any points - the new Reddiquette apparently...
p21957
aVSometimes companies fuck up and draw more money than usual, or make a mistake on your bill.
p21958
aVYou could have budgeted perfectly down to the last penny, but if a company makes a mistake and draws more money than they are supposed to - why should the customer get hit with overdraft fees?
p21959
aVyou might say the company who made the mistake is responsible for reimbursing you the fees - good luck with that, also even if they do pay, it certainly won't be very quick.
p21960
aVLast year TalkTalk fucked up and took over £200 more than they should have on my bill, took 3 months to get them to repay me and another 3 months to refund the fees I was charged by the bank.
p21961
aVI'm still waiting for them to repay the interest.
p21962
aVNo overdraft should be an option if you want it with a bank.
p21963
aVGreat observations.
p21964
aVAlot of it comes down to the extremist capitalist plague that revolves around "The" City of London.
p21965
aVIt's a hornets nest for exploitation and corruption with no needs of providing a quality service and just relying on making profit at the expense of others.
p21966
aVUnfortunately, that plague spreads to the rest of the UK.
p21967
aVPeople deny there is any problem with society however.
p21968
aVYou put it great.
p21969
aVI've lived in the UK my entire life and feel much the same.
p21970
aVThe UK can be great in some areas, but for the most, it's an Orwellian shithole of insurance claims and and crap products/service.
p21971
aVThe NHS is probably the one exception i can think of.
p21972
aVThe education system is about conditioning people to accept they only have one way in life, consume and conform.
p21973
aVIt's a preparation for the sick ideology revolving around "The" City of London.
p21974
aVExploit everyone and show no compassion... capitalism woo!
p21975
aVEducation is fucked in this country and the amount of people scrounging of the government and getting away with is mad.

aVIt's the [year 5774](http://www.hebcal.com/converter/)! 
p21981
aVAs someone who moved to the US last year, I'm intrigued by how many of the points are familiar to me.
p21982
aVBanks, parking, the incompetence, the newspapers... in many ways, the US feels very old-fashioned compared to Europe.
p21983
aVIn my case, what I am having problems finding in supermarkets is healthy food that isn't full of sugar and fat.
p21984
aVA favourite European brand of yogurt exists in the US, but has twice the calories and is incredible sweet.
p21985
aVAt the supermarket I see people loading up trolleys with the most incredible things that is supposedly "food": Pop tarts and choco pops and Capri Sun and other stuff I would classify as candy.
p21986
aVIs the UK like that?
p21987
aV&gt; If I do not have money in my account, then do not send the bloody transfer, and let me handle that with my other provider.
p21988
aVYou're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances.
p21989
aVFor some reason I read this in the voice of [Henning Wehn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIR_--eSeoc).
p21990
aVGo to a store such as Whole Foods.
p21991
aVSounds as if you are shopping in Walmart or something. 
p21992
aVWhole Foods isn't very close to me, unfortunately.
p21993
aVIt's also very expensive compared to other stores, and the stress level is worse than most airports.
p21994
aVIf I were close to a Fairway Market I would rather shop there.
p21995
aVComment on #6 - American here:  I've spent time in many parts of Britain and I love the driving etiquette on British motorways.
p21996
aVI would say it is hard to argue which is better, driving on the Autobahn in Germany or the Motorway in Britain.
p21997
aVDriving on British A-Roads was like driving in a ballet.
p21998
aVI was super impressed who people merge in and out almost seamlessly.
p21999
aVSo much better than here in America.
p22000
aVAmericans park their ass in one lane (mostly the fast lane) and go one speed, no matter if you are behind them or not.
p22001
aVKeep up the great driving Britain!
p22002
aVBut, please fix your steering wheel problem.
p22003
aVSomeone put it on the wrong side of the car and I think this has caused people to drive on the wrong side.
p22004
aVThanks!
p22005

aVDouble taps are in the top list of Britain's monsterous inventions.
p22009
aVHate them more than nothing.
p22010
aVI would rather add couple of points too, from non-drivers perspective, I you like:\u000a\u000a- _Buses_:  having ride in bus is a whole culture.
p22011
aVI wonder why bus drivers are so nervous, everytime, especially at night shift they turn even more susceptible to external factors such as plead to open the door, ask the road, or ask for something else.
p22012
aVThere is always some prick in the lower deck who drives the driver nuts.
p22013
aVIn the upper deck there is always a crackhead smoking a pot and halucinating, a homeless having a childish sleep and a group of drunk as fuck teenagers shouting as if they own the whole universe.
p22014
aVDaytime bus shift is all about mommies with their buggies.
p22015
aV-_Big Issue Salespeople in the street_: What do these guys do for living?
p22016
aVFor the last 3 years of living in London, havent seen anyone buying it.
p22017
aVThere are other useless stuff sold on London streets such as cheap watches, used phones and PCs.
p22018
aVWho is going to buy them?
p22019
aV-_Marmite, Kidney Pie and Black Pudding_: Honestly , guys, why?
p22020
aV-Unplanned suspensions in Tube lines and Overground, especially during weekends.
p22021
aV-London Cabs: I don't know what these cars do in the streets, because they are always occupied, and it is impossible to catch the empty one.
p22022
aVOnly way to find a cab is to order one by telephone.
p22023
aV-_No transport to Heathrow terminals at night._  I have spent 5 hours and commuted 4 buses to get from South East London to Heathrow T4.
p22024
aVThis is so foolish.
p22025
aVI understand that there should less transport during the night, but in every major city in the world airport communication works all arounf the clock.
p22026
aVThere must be shuttles every 15 mins going to Heathrow all terminals from Central London.
p22027
aV-_No food after 11 PM_: You cannot buy or even order food online after 11 PM, as if noone works at night, and the whole city dies.
p22028
aVOnly some rare Macdonalds stores work, but they are usually filled with half-conscious drunkards.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p22029
aVWhoa.
p22030
aVBlack pudding is delicious 
p22031
aVWhy the hate for double taps?
p22032
aVI hate how hard is to get the water on spot with single tap.
p22033
aVOn point 15, it's worth noting that much of Britain's education system revolves around a skills-based curriculum (particularly before A-Level or IB) rather than factual recall.
p22034
aVIt may be that he's developing well but your own judgement of "knowing things"  may be rather outdated now.
p22035
aVYes, because "knowing things" is a bad way to became a well educated member of the society.
p22036
aVIt's better to be trained to do menial tasks.
p22037
aVJust like a well trained service monkey. 
p22038
aVNobody mentioned menial tasks.
p22039
aVWe're living in a swiftly changing world where many students of today will enter into jobs and areas of employment that currently don't exist.
p22040
aVPredictions indicate that many of these will also work in numerous different areas throughout their careers as the employment landscape will continue to shift as it is driven by technology.
p22041
aVReciting a poem by heart or recalling the specific dates of certain battles won't serve any purpose whereas critical thinking, problem-solving and effective communication will be vital.
p22042
aVWe are also talking about student life up to the age of 16.
p22043
aVThey've not even specialised in their academic path beyond some broad and basic GCSE options.
p22044
aVIt's hardly logical to begin loading them with factual recall that only suits one specific area when they still have so many possible career routes ahead of them.
p22045
aVOK, first of all, OP is complaining mostly about simple jobs: waiters, hairdressers, simple office workers, etc.
p22046
aVAlso, he is complaining that his son of about average skill and IQ, who struggled with previous education, now is rewarded without putting any more effort into his learning than he used to be, and that his friends don't really have any motivation to expand and learn, besides getting out of school and getting their welfare check or whatever.
p22047
aVHe pointed out that this education system promotes laziness, doesn't require effort and does not award any actuall skills, knowlege and basic IQ.
p22048
aVSomeone respondend that the education system is more focused on training actuall job skills, before basic knowledge and overall academic information.
p22049
aVWhat I meant, is that even me, who has some serious reservations to the education system, understands and agrees with the basic principles of a broader range of basic education.
p22050
aVIt's not to fill your mind with useless and forgetabble dates, definitions and strings of numbers.
p22051
aVIt's to offer every child, teen and adult with a broad field of knowledge, and allow them to learn just a tiny bit of everything in order to let them choose their future career with as much opportunity and options available to them.
p22052
aVNo child at the age of 10, 15 or even young adult of the age of 18 or even 20, despite their former educations being basic or very specific, will be able to fully tell you what he or she is going to be doing in his or her future, or what his best skills are and what type of job or carreer is the best for them.
p22053
aVBecause it's not that simple.
p22054
aVA human is a complicated organism, having a brain with a very large potential does not automatically mean you will use the most of it towards betterment of human species.
p22055
aVSome people, even smart people are very happy with their simple job, simple life and some people, even in their limited options, will always remain unhappy, whatever they decide or are forced to do.
p22056
aVOf course, there are always exceptions to the basic rule.
p22057
aVEducation does not equal future job skills and does not guarantee future employment.
p22058
aVEven if you dropped out of elementary school and went to welding school, it does not guarantee that you will be a welder in your future, as much as if you went to university to study science, does not guarantee that you will become a scientist.
p22059
aVBoth of you might end up flipping burgers or winning a noble prize in the future.
p22060
aVHowever, both of you are a bit more prone to end up in the field of your chosen education.
p22061
aVEducation is not for you to memorize poems, it's to learn history of literature, it's to let you understand poetry, to understand why some people are great at moving the hearts and emotions of millions ,and some people should not be allowed near twitter.
p22062
aVOf course not everybody will understand it, not everybody will appreciate it, but all of them should be given the option to do so, even if it means forcing young children to read boring poems and sometimes memorize them as part of your student activities in school.
p22063
aVIt's not all just gold stars and cheating on tests.
p22064
aVI wen't throug all the classic education.
p22065
aVI remember very little of it.
p22066
aVMy father went through all the classic education.
p22067
aVHe is a very learned, educated, well spoken man, and I envy his wast knowledge on some many fields of science, history, technical and literal skills.
p22068
aVIt just means that not everybody is able to fit in the education system, and for some people, university is not the best option.
p22069
aVNor is colledge, or high school, or technical school or whatever you may call it.
p22070
aVThat is why our education is segmented into parts with multiple options to fit the widest scope of humans.
p22071
aVI do agree, that the system is flawed, that universities fill you up on useless bullshit and studies are clogged up with paperwork, busywork, and copy and paste, memorize and forget type of in and out education.
p22072
aVHowever, I do not need a degree of physics to have a vague understanding on how a tv works or I don't need a degree in literature to be able to discern a good book from a terrible waste of paper.
p22073
aVI am able to do those things thanks to some of my education I took in school, which I didn't really want since I hate physics and I am very bad at it, but that does not exclude my main hobby to be hardware and computers, and does not forbid me from building pc's as a great use of my free time.
p22074
aVI've been building my computers for over 15 years.
p22075
aVI didn't like very much many of subjects I was forced to learn, but I need them to be able to discern bullshit from real science.
p22076
aVTo not believe creationism over evolution, and to not to give my money to solar highway scammers out there.
p22077
aVI need to know how my body functions, to understand how to feed myself and how to dress, and how to function, to discern when I'm sick and when I just have the cold.
p22078
aVThese all things are available to us through common education system.
p22079
aVAnd training us to be programmers or paper pushers or burger flippers does not allow it all.
p22080
aVSaddly, most of people who even are able to make a rational decision about their future when they are in their teens, won't end up in their chosen fields, and it is still mostly luck or connections that allow us to have great jobs, or even bad jobs at all, and not our very specific education, even it you have a very narrow specialization.
p22081
aVI myself for most of my life wanted to be in a specific field, I studied it wih a passion, I still love it.
p22082
aVBut I'm not working in this field, and I  am able to still be happy and to like my job.
p22083
aVNobody, except a very few lucky ones, knows what to do with their life, and even less people will be able to do what they really want to do.
p22084
aVThat is why they need the options to be somebody else, or else they end up unhappy and uneducated with nothing to help them in their unknow and uncertain futures. 
p22085
aVExactly, there's a strong move towards life long learning and as you mention skills and transferrable ideas stick and repeat with much more frequency.
p22086
aVWhether its in technological areas or the realms of literature, it leads to independent thinkers who can make a judgement on their own.
p22087
aVThe exams his stepson is preparing for are publicly administered and respected upon an international scale.
p22088
aVIt's not really possible for his school to lie their way through a child's education.
p22089
aVAlso there's regular, somewhat excessive tracking and checks of progress in all subjects in the years leading up to these exams.
p22090
aVGCSE's are what a school lives and dies by and any management system that fails to address that will be removed and replaced pretty sharpish.
p22091
aVIt's possible his child was the worst in the class before moving but the school has helped him to achieve.
p22092
aVIt's a shame that what may actually be a success story is instead phrased as his peers failing completely to make him look good.
p22093
aVDavid Cameron is a proper cunt though.
p22094
aVHe's bang on the money with that one.

aVAgree with most things except your comments on the "middle lane"\u000a\u000aIt isn't a middle lane it's an overtaking lane.
p22099
aVPeople sitting in cloud cuckoo land in the overtaking lane whilst the inside lane is clear is my biggest pet peeve when driving.
p22100

aVAlso, mythbusters destroyed one in one of their shows and it shot hundreds of feet into the air, destroying a small house on the way. 
p22112
aVI still pay by cheque.
p22113
aVIt's a great way to postpone paying someone, you just make a mistake and send it off to them, then they send it back but have to confirm that the cheque has come in, therefore the payment isn't "late".
p22114
aVAt least, in my experiences. 
p22115
aVBut that tactic makes you a twat.
p22116
aVWhat's the problem with paying someone on time?
p22117
aVBeing skint might be one of them.
p22118
aVStill though, if you don't have the money do not enter into a contract with them then.
p22119
aVThe company I used to work for would not take checks because people would pull this kind of thing.
p22120
aVCash up front if you did want to pay by check we would not do any work until it had cleared.
p22121
aVBefore we introduced this policy I can think of a few cases where we never did get payed, it was not worth taking them to court over the money due the the fact that the cost of doing so would be higher than the value of the money they owed us.
p22122
aVSo in the end we just stopped working on the promise of a check.
p22123
aVWhat is your problem with cheques, they are still really useful
p22124
aVSure, if you're like, 80, or something.
p22125
aV:p
p22126
aVfor ?
p22127

aVHmmm yeah I suppose so. 
p22129
aVwhen I process Attachment of Earnings deduction for our employees, I then need to send the deducted monies to the relevant councils/Child Support Agency etc.

aVAhh ok, business use I understand.
p22132

aVAlthough many companies are pushing towards e-invoicing. 
p22134
aVgovernment bodies are just...backwards :(
p22135
aVThe problems you've pointed out are all pretty subjective.
p22136
aVWhy move somewhere and pick apart it's nuances?
p22137
aVIsn't that what makes a country?
p22138
aVBecause differences between people is what makes life interesting.
p22139
aVThe sheer amount of comments on this post, mostly positive, tells me that people love to see them from someone's else perspective.
p22140
aVI definitely do and a few years ago I was reading with pleasure similar thing from US person who moved to Poland.
p22141
aVwhat the hell is a boiler?
p22142
aV-An American
p22143
aVex-NYer here and the old buildings with steam radiators use gas boilers in the basement.
p22144
aVUS equivalent would be a furnace or water heater.
p22145
aV(Serious) how do you heat your house?
p22146
aVIf your question wasn't sarcasm I shall happily explain to you the blight on our lives that is... A boiler. 
p22147
aVI guarantee we are all serious.
p22148
aVWe use a central air/heating system.
p22149
aVNatural gas heats an element and then a fan pushes the air through the house.
p22150
aVThis is the heater.
p22151
aVSame unit also does air conditioning in the summer.
p22152
aVWe pay for the natural gas to heat the element and the electricity to power the fan from the local utility.
p22153
aVWater heater.
p22154
aV30+ gallon water tank that uses a gas or electrical element to heat the water in the tank.
p22155
aVThen it is fed to the rest of the house via plumbing.
p22156
aVIn this instance, you pay for the water and the gas/electricity from the local utilities.
p22157
aVSome new water heaters use a very small tank (tankless) but those still use gas.
p22158
aVBoilers are sometimes used in large buildings or schools but just for hot water I think.
p22159
aVNot sure.
p22160
aVNot really commonplace here in the US. 
p22161
aVSame in Canada.
p22162
aVI've only heard of boilers in old schools and such. 
p22163
aVAh, I live in southern California.
p22164
aVI've never turned on our central heating unit.
p22165
aVI did once, and it smelled like burning dust.
p22166
aVso never again.
p22167
aVIf it gets a little to cold in december/january I have a little space heater.
p22168
aVIt doesn't boil however.
p22169
aV:D 
p22170
aVThe central heating always smells like burning dust the first time it is turned on in the fall.
p22171
aVIt goes away after an hour or so. 
p22172
aVWater heater for central heating systems and sinks etc. 
p22173
aV&gt;Daily Mail.
p22174
aVSeriously?
p22175
aVWho buys this... thing?
p22176
aVIt's got a crossword, a suduko, and it's cheap toilet paper.
p22177
aV3 good reasons to buy it.
p22178
aV&gt;David Cameron.
p22179
aVNo-one likes him.
p22180
aVNo-one.
p22181
aVCameron is better than the alternative
p22182
aVMillibean?
p22183
aVPossibly.
p22184
aVAt least Ed Millibean gets in the newspapers for things other than his 10 holidays a year.
p22185
aVTo each their own.
p22186
aVI think Cameron has been decent.
p22187
aV&gt;No-one likes him.
p22188
aVNo-one.
p22189
aVHowever, you can't deny that quite a lot of people would rather him than any of Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg or Nigel Farage in Number 10.
p22190
aVI would include myself amongst the people who think he's the best of a bad bunch, yeah.
p22191
aVHopefully BoJo will take his place as leader of the Tories.
p22192
aVIt's a shame that you've got to vote for a politician in the elections...
p22193
aV&gt;No one likes him.
p22194
aVNo-one.
p22195
aVI'm sure his wife is quite fond of him.
p22196
aVNo she thinks he's a ham-faced twat like the rest of us.
p22197
aVBut what about...There must be...Oh, come on, there's....\u000a\u000aGod!
p22198
aVGod loves cockroaches!
p22199
aV\u000aHad a chuckle at number twenty.
p22200
aVSo true yet stupid.
p22201
aVJust to echo what some others have said - cheques are, occasionally, still very useful, generally for paying individuals/small traders through the post, or for ad-hoc amounts that are rather too large for cash.
p22202
aVBACS (bank transfer) is the ideal, but it's not always possible, so I'm glad to have a chequebook available in such instances.
p22203
aV2.
p22204
aVDirect Debits are actually the payee withdrawing money straight out of your account.
p22205
aVSo NPower (or whoever) takes money from your account, but they don't get access to it do they have no idea what the balance is.
p22206
aVAbout the ill people at work, i never miss a day unless i'm dying and thats totally down to how i've been treated in work places by bosses and also the lack of social support when sick.
p22207
aVAny time i've taken days off sick i always got back to a sceptical boss quizing me about my illness and even maybe getting put on all the crappy jobs for a week as some kind of punishment for getting the flu.
p22208
aVAlso when rent and utilities are so high and wages getting so low these days missing days is a real kick in the finacial balls, most i've ever gotten paid for sick days was £12 a day and nothing for the first 3 days, and i'm normally not sick more than 3 days so nothing, just 3 days loss in pay.
p22209
aVThats more than enough reason for me to suffer through work and disregard co-workers wellbeing... sorry.
p22210
aVThe sickness point is a great point, but here's why I go to work when I'm ill. \u000a\u000aWe used to get sick pay for any time we took off.
p22211
aVSome people abused it, so it was taken off us.
p22212
aVNow if we are off ill, not only do we not get paid, we also get grilled on why we were off AND if a redundancy situation occurs you lose redundancy points, making you more likely to lose your job.
p22213
aVTherefore everyone I work with comes to work ill and spreads it around a bit.
p22214
aVThat way the company that decided that the system should be changed because a couple of people had an extra holiday loses production and hopefully the management get to feel lousy too, and at the end of the day I and my coworkers get paid and can still pay our bills, don't get bollocked for being off and have less chance of losing our jobs. 
p22215
aVTo give some context on point number 4, while most people don't consider their jobs "too important to take time off", in a hourly job you won't get paid for sick days, which for some people means they can't afford, financially, to take the time off to recuperate.
p22216
aVAnd in a salaried job, someone who takes time off frequently (i.e.
p22217
aVif they're ill more then the average person) will be top of the list come redundancy time, whereas someone who is in and poorly doesn't get noticed as much as a absence does, even if they do give it to everyone else.
p22218
aVe: Obviously if your off for a extended time for legitimate reasons, you can get a sick note from your GP and get SSP or whatever sickpay your job comes with, but if you have the flu for 3 days and then back at work, it won't help you get money back.
p22219
aV&gt;"Ill people at work.
p22220
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak"\u000a\u000aSadly bosses don't work that way over here.
p22221
aVI have had a few who i'm sure would still demand me to turn up if I lost a leg.
p22222
aVOn education: I think that might be a sign your kid is going to a bad-ish comprehensive.
p22223
aVWhile most schools are about the same in Europe, in the UK some schools are terrible and some are great.
p22224
aVHalf of Oxbridge places go to private school students and they make up 7% of the cohort.
p22225
aVAgree with you on banks - you have to jump through many hurdles to get an account and if you have a bad credit rating you might as well forget it (at least it was like that a few years ago.
p22226
aV)  Also on banks the charges for "bounced" direct debits used to be way higher; my bank charges about £8 now whereas 5+ years ago it was £36 if I remember correctly.
p22227
aVIf payroll fucked up your wages you'd lose a weeks pay when the gas/electric/phone bill direct debits all got returned...\u000a\u000aedit: excellent post btw
p22228
aVThis is brilliant and I think I agree with almost every word!
p22229
aVBut now you're used to it you need to move to the USA.
p22230
aVIt's pretty much everything you've written all over again...but BIGGER!.
p22231
aVI lived only for half an year in London and I agree completely with the points that I personally experienced.
p22232
aVStill can't forget the unknown asshole that laughed on the phone when I tried to explain the problem I was having with their extremely incompetent service.
p22233
aVNo wonder the Brits are so cynnical and edgy.
p22234
aVAs someone who visits UK often and not really living there, I can completely relate.
p22235
aVBanks are the worst.
p22236
aVI had to almost beg several banks to open up my business account because I don't live in the UK.
p22237
aVNot to mention outrageous charges.
p22238
aVFor example: £12 for a "non-sterling service fee" if I buy anything with my bank card in Europe/US.
p22239
aVAre you freaking nuts?
p22240
aVI know your pain.
p22241
aVIt's at times like that that I really wish we'd adopted the Euro in 2000. 
p22242
aVNumber 6.
p22243
aVYou drive on the M20 a lot don't you?
p22244
aV60 miles every day.
p22245
aVI have to say that the M20 &amp; M25 are probably the worst roads in the UK for shit drivers
p22246
aVYou're right about everything.
p22247
aVCareful with number 5 though.
p22248
aVYou knock that you'll get deported.
p22249
aVNumber 10 is a huge problem in this country in my opinion.
p22250
aVIt's as if no one cares about anything anymore.
p22251
aVMakes life extremely difficult when you can't rely on anyone from the person that serves you McDonalds to your doctor that screens you for the resultant cancer you get from eating it.
p22252
aVWhat do you think of the health care service?
p22253
aVI think both countries need to find a middle ground on this one:\u000a\u000a"Ill people at work.
p22254
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak, and spread germs so the next week half of the office is trying to cough their insides out.
p22255
aVLoss of productivity of you being away for three days is nothing compared to loss of productivity from 10 people succumbing to your flu.
p22256
aV"\u000a\u000aI work with a Poland design center daily and 'sick leave' for a week for a sniffle seems ludicrous.
p22257
aVFever?
p22258
aVStomach problems?
p22259
aVSure, stay at home until you feel better.
p22260
aVA little cold?
p22261
aVWe've all had colds and honestly after some meds/tea it's hardly noticeable.
p22262
aVIt's certainly not worth a trip to the dr. for a 1-week sick leave note.  
p22263
aVThe driving was big for me too!
p22264
aVHaving "learnt" how to drive in Africa where road rules are treated as suggestions.
p22265
aVI had to learn how to drive here all over again.
p22266
aVFeels strange having having to adapt every time I go home. 
p22267
aVThe law in our state (over here in the US) doesn't require employers to give sick time.
p22268
aVSo if an employee does not come in, often they do not get paid.
p22269
aVHere's a lot nmore our state doesn't require:\u000a 	\u000a&gt;Neither the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) nor Georgia law require breaks or meal periods be given to workers.
p22270
aVHowever, many employers do provide breaks and meal periods.
p22271
aVBreaks of short duration (from 5 to 20 minutes) are common.
p22272
aVThe FLSA requires workers be paid for short break periods; however an employer does not have to compensate for meal periods of thirty minutes or more, as long as the workers are free to use the meal period time as they wish and are not required to perform work during that time.
p22273
aVOh, or vacation or holiday time.
p22274
aVThe services one is explainable.
p22275
aVBasically anyone who could make a legitimate complains rarely does, meaning problems don't get fixed.
p22276
aVAlso anyone with an illegitimate bullshit complaint will find the nearest employee and scream at them, meaning that employee's will care less and less, even when a real issue arrives. 
p22277
aVAs a fellow Pole , living in London, have an up-vote.
p22278
aVI agree with almost everything and could add few more but those things enrage me more than they suppose to.
p22279
aVDon't agree on driving.
p22280
aVLine hogging is a bad practice, dangerous and not very smart.
p22281
aVIn some countries ,including Poland you can get pulled over for that.
p22282
aVThat would be bad Polish drivers behaviour you ranting about
p22283
aVIn response - \u000a\u000a1.
p22284
aVCurrent accounts are much easier to set up if you have always lived here, you would need a household bill and a passport.
p22285
aV2.
p22286
aVI agree, you have no money?
p22287
aVlet me charge you for that.
p22288
aVThis is stupid.
p22289
aV3.
p22290
aVHow do you pay a tradesman?
p22291
aVMost probably cheque as he can take the payment and give you a receipt right there.
p22292
aV4.
p22293
aVIn my experience, people called in sick too often.
p22294
aVYou stubbed your toe?
p22295
aVtake a week off.
p22296
aVthis was mainly my managers.
p22297
aV5.
p22298
aVThese are great.
p22299
aV6.
p22300
aVYes, if you learnt to drive, you learnt to drive in the left lane, if you want to use the middle lane.
p22301
aVUse the indicator, and signal out, the people coming will move out to the third lane.
p22302
aVDo not sit in the middle lane, this holds up traffic in the left and middle lanes.
p22303
aV7.
p22304
aVParking costs too much here.
p22305
aV8.
p22306
aVI'm not sure I know what you mean.
p22307
aV9.
p22308
aVYeah the tube sucks.
p22309
aV10.
p22310
aVI think this is based only on personal experience, go to different hairdressers for different service.
p22311
aV11.
p22312
aVI have no insurance besides car insurance and home insurance.
p22313
aV12.
p22314
aVThe trains in my area suck, and are also expensive.
p22315
aV13.
p22316
aVNobody, I am sure of it.
p22317
aV14.
p22318
aVYou don't have to vote for him.
p22319
aV15.
p22320
aVNobody likes Micheal Gove.
p22321
aV16.
p22322
aVI used to work in a supermarket a shit tonne of people use the handheld scanners, and as an assistant, they suck.
p22323
aV17.
p22324
aVThere is a fucking load of road police.
p22325
aVA shit tonne of portable cameras, a load of fixed ones too.
p22326
aVYou just haven't experienced them.
p22327
aV18.
p22328
aVSour cream is available in every supermarket.
p22329
aVI am not sure I want sour milk.
p22330
aV19.
p22331
aVThis does seem to be a thing.
p22332
aV20.
p22333
aVI think it is to confuse people into thinking the MPG is really good or something? \u000a
p22334
aVYou still use checks to physically transfer large amounts of money or to pay bills, like rent.
p22335
aVBut yes, people still use checks. 
p22336
aVold fossils maybe
p22337
aVI died laughing at #19. 
p22338
aVDo they still use newspaper to wrap fish&amp;chips or curry in?
p22339
aVThe last time I was in the UK(Northern Wales to be exact) to visit my grandpa in '89 I was severely disgusted by that.
p22340
aVNo, although some very touristy places have cones designed to look like newspapers. 
p22341
aVHeh, I remember the thrills of buying chips as a schoolkid and getting some tits with my chips.
p22342
aVNow they buy in special paper, same stuff as I think they use in off licences to wrap wine in.
p22343
aVDouble Tap?
p22344
aVYou mean a future space tap?
p22345
aVThe education one makes me sad because it's really a problem, a large percentage of young people just don't know anything.
p22346
aVI look at the difference between me in my mid twenties and my teenage brother who has just come out of school (the same one I went to) and I just can't fathom how the disparity between us in terms of knowledge has grown so large in a relatively short amount of time.
p22347
aVI mean basic things like practical skills which you get from Technology lessons like basic food prep, sewing, using a screwdriver, to things like geography and history.
p22348
aVIt makes me worry.
p22349
aVAs for youth general knowledge, pub quizzes should be on the curriculum because you shouldn't underestimate the benefit of knowing who won the golden boot at the 1990 world cup.
p22350
aVI used to work with a polish girl who thought the idea of a chip butty was the most disgusting thing imaginable.
p22351
aVI was flabbergasted.
p22352
aVI smother that bread in vinegar!
p22353
aVOM!
p22354
aVCze\u015b\u0107!
p22355
aVI notice you're from Kent.
p22356
aVI think we're lucky when it comes to road police.
p22357
aVThey are very lenient, calm and understanding when they are there.
p22358
aVI have gone months without seeing a police car on the road at least in the south east.
p22359
aVHowever in other parts of the country I feel the traffic police can be really bad in comparison (and in more plentiful supply).
p22360
aVAs for driving in the middle lane, I completely understand where you're coming from and this is why the problem subsides.
p22361
aVPeople get angry with middle lane drivers, then act in the exact way that makes people not want to use a lane properly.
p22362
aVPersonally the best I find this works is when the average traffic speed is around 80.
p22363
aVWe keep a faster pace and people seem to use lanes properly and it doesn't take too long for spaces to come and go to filter in and out of traffic.
p22364
aVSelf Service is awesome, just not in Morrisons.
p22365
aVWow.
p22366
aVIt becomes a talking point when you can get through using the Morrisons ones without it going wrong at least once.
p22367
aVMy dad buys the Daily Mail.
p22368
aVHe's a white middle class conservative man in his 60s.
p22369
aVApparently the Guardian is for "left wing poofs".
p22370
aVI'd be interested to see the age disparity with Daily Mail readers actually. 
p22371
aVI'm hoping it's like Fox News in American and give it 30 years and their customers will all have been wiped out by old age, and they'll be consigned to history.
p22372
aVNot wishing an early death on anyone, it's just that as a 40something who rarely sees anyone my age or under with any newspaper, I think they're going to struggle more each year.
p22373
aVWait, wait, go back to that portable scanner.
p22374
aVWhat is it and how does it work? 
p22375
aVIt's basically a little scanner you carry with you, scan items and then you take it to a special area where it downloads the data of things that you scanned when you placed the item in your trolley.
p22376
aVhttp://www.tesco.com/scan-as-you-shop/
p22377
aV&gt;I won't be mentioning double taps.
p22378
aVWould you, just briefly?
p22379
aVI have no idea what you mean and google suggests it's use when shooting someone, which is rarely a problem.
p22380
aVInstead of a single mixer faucet in the bathroom, they have separate hot and cold water faucets.
p22381
aVThank-you.
p22382
aVIt's a good thing reddit has taught me what a faucet is...
p22383
aVCan I ask?
p22384
aVIn poland do you generally pay a fee for a bank account or any sorts of charges for your banking facilities.
p22385
aVI suspect that these charges you speak of are subsidising other customers who manage their finances a little better.
p22386
aVThe charges used to be worse and the Office of Fair trading did a big investigation where many people hoped to get those charges reimbursed.
p22387
aVThe office of fair trading didn't really view the charges as unfair but the banks have tended to reduce the charges anyway.
p22388
aVwtf is a boiler?!
p22389
aV?
aVHot water heater I think.
p22390
aVI will accept this answer and remain baffled by the fact that people brag about it.
p22391
aV+1.
p22392
aVFeet on seats
p22393
aVThat's an American thing, we put our feet up on everything, even right now I'm rubbing my socks on your name on the screen.
p22394
aVYou said 'prick' you are one of us.
p22395
aVX
aVBritish guy here.
p22396
aVHave to agree on the service in the UK.
p22397
aVIt's utter shit.
p22398
aVCompanies just want the cash and try to get away with the lowest level of service possible.
p22399
aVProbably because in general Brits are, in my experience, less likely than other nations to complain.
p22400
aVClearly, that's not a good thing but it does comes from a general population that managed to muddle through for large parts of history.
p22401
aVPeople are used to putting up with crap experience and unscrupulous companies take advantage  of this.
p22402
aVAnd rail fares?
p22403
aVYeah, WTF?
p22404
aVSo expensive.
p22405
aVDecent enough service.But I pay the equivalent of about $10 a day to travel 17 miles and back to work.
p22406
aVOh and i dont do milk in my tea.
p22407
aVYuck!
p22408
aVfellow native here, living 7 years in the UK now\u000a\u000acan confirm most of these points but I think I'll never get used to vinegar on chips haha
p22409
aVNo.
p22410
aV2 I agree totally.
p22411
aVWhy in the hell am I being charged for not having money?
p22412
aVJust don't send it out, I'll deal with the guys on the other end.
p22413
aVThe bank has to take your money for not having any money, so they can give it to people as a reward for having loads of money.
p22414
aV:)
p22415
aVnumber 2 ruined me when I was young.
p22416
aVHalf of these baffle me and I'm a native, the education part in particular is scary.
p22417
aVSour milk is called "buttermilk" here so try looking for that.
p22418
aVI've no idea how easy/hard it is to get because it's horrible.
p22419
aVblasphemy!\u000a\u000a
p22420
aVI like the cut of your jib sir, let's be friends. 
p22421
aVnumber 20 drives me nuts aswell
p22422
aVNo.
p22423
aV16, portable scanners?
p22424
aVI have no idea what you are on about?
p22425
aVAnybody?
p22426
aVUnattended photo radar vans that the cops park in random places that snap your pic and send you a ticket, a big one.
p22427
aVIn the US they only work in better areas, when they try and use those in the hood somebody always torches it.
p22428
aVThere was a test run in my local store, essentially you register and collect a handheld barcode scanner, and scan your own shopping as you go, then at the end, put the scanner in a cradle, it tells you your bill, and you pay by card and go.
p22429
aVHas the small problem of people loading up £100 worth of groceries, scanning a single can of coke, and then paying their 49p and leaving.
p22430
aVI imagine they've improved the security angle since I saw it tried and cancelled within a month a good few years ago.
p22431
aVIf you were here before Cameron was in charge you probably wouldn't hate him so much.
p22432
aVI have to agree with your first point, I had to go through all of that malarky with my SO from hungary. 
p22433
aV&gt; Sour milk is only available in Polish shops.
p22434
aVJust sayin'\u000a\u000aOr as we call it, off milk
p22435
aVI immigrated to the UK a few years ago as well - you're spot on on all the weird bits for the most part.
p22436
aVNever had the issue with sour cream, but good peanut butter...\u000a\u000aAlso, had the same problem with cell service and TV/Internet service you had with the bank.
p22437
aV+ Horrible service on top of that...  took like 3 months for me to get internet in my house after I moved in.
p22438
aV3 - old people.
p22439
aVThe last cheque I used was 15 years ago, and the last one I received about 10.
p22440
aV4 - ticking boxes, meeting targets, and ensuring attendance is more important than productivity.
p22441
aV"It's not MY fault we didn't meet target this quarter - my department had 100% attendance.
p22442
aVBob's department had 3 people off sick!
p22443
aV" Yes, this is insane, but in this country a lobotomy is a requirement for any middle management position.
p22444
aV6 - Yes, sadly a large portion of this country, mainly Audi drivers, believe that right of way is determined by who will risk the most to collide with other road users.
p22445
aVUnfortunately modern car safety features have limited the chance for gene pool cleansing in this area.
p22446
aV12 - You know someone who is either in the wrong job, wrong transport, or living in the wrong town.
p22447
aV13 - This is our national shame.
p22448
aV14 - well at least he's not Blair/Brown.
p22449
aVOnly 99% as evil, a 1% improvement.
p22450
aV15 - Yes, living off the back of others is sadly seen as a valid career choice by a significant percentage of the population, instead of a safety net.These unfortunately tarnish the image of the others who genuinely just need a hand getting started in life, or who have fallen on hard times.
p22451
aV16 - Yours must work then.
p22452
aVThe ones here normally involve more interaction with a staff member than the normal checkout line.
p22453
aV20 - Well you see, despite supposedly having gone metric, we still measure road distances in miles.
p22454
aVMeasuring fuel consumption in litres per mile would be mixing metric and imperial units which would obviously be stupid.
p22455
aVHowever because we are mostly metric, fuel is sold in litres.
p22456
aVSo... ok, no.
p22457
aVI can't even pretend to explain this, it's absurd.
p22458
aVRE Schooling: In fairness, I think most British people realise that our GCSEs are a total joke.
p22459
aVTeenagers aren't pushed in the slightest and schools are much more interested in getting students through the exam than actually teaching them anything.
p22460
aVI like cheques.
p22461
aVI never feel comfortable carrying large sums of money; especially when it came to bringing money into school. 
p22462
aV&gt; Self-service cash registers.
p22463
aVI love them.
p22464
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p22465
aVEven better: portable scanners that I can take shopping.
p22466
aVNobody uses them but me.
p22467
aVPeople sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.
p22468
aVPortable scanners ?
p22469
aVNever seen one of those.
p22470
aVWhich shops have them?
p22471
aV?
aVTesco's near me started using them.
p22472
aVIt's just a posh calculator really.
p22473
aVcan you pay from them and thereby avoid the till?
p22474
aV[Here](http://www.tesco.com/scan-as-you-shop/).
p22475
aVIt looks like you scan all your stuff and then give it to a person on a till and they just scan that in, then you pay.
p22476
aVNo need for unloading stuff. 
p22477
aVsounds awesome, can't wait till my local shops get it...\u000acheers!
p22478
aVOur Safeway had them, I believe before it turned to Morrisons....for about a month, then without warning they all disappeared.
p22479
aVI imagine there was not much in the way of security measures and people had been filling their trolley, paying for a packet of chewing gum at the machine, then wheeling out their week's shopping, whistling cheerily to themselves.
p22480
aVNice rant, well done :)\u000a\u000aWhat's the deal with boilers in polish homes?
p22481
aVNever go wrong, or just people don't like to talk about them as much?
p22482
aVCentral heating everywhere.
p22483
aVIn bigger cities(mostly bigger communities), there is central heating.
p22484
aVI have flat in center of city in Pomerania build in 2006.
p22485
aVI have something called 'Junkers' - flow heater for water(doesn't store it as boiler and use cng instead of electricity).
p22486
aVI have also house on country side and we used cng furnace(winter) and solar panels(summer) to make water hot, furnace is also used for heating house during lower temperatures.\u000a
p22487
aVHaha!
p22488
aVBrilliant.
p22489
aVI've forwarded this on to a couple of my Polish colleagues, Micha\u0142.
p22490
aVWhile everything you say is true, finishing with point 20 was the perfect WTF.
p22491
aVI have never even questioned that once in my life.
p22492
aVDaily Mail.
p22493
aVSeriously?
p22494
aVWho buys this... thing?
p22495
aVDavid Cameron.
p22496
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p22497
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p22498
aVHow someone like that becomes a Prime Minister, I don't know.
p22499
aVAnd people generally believe what he says.
p22500
aVWhich brings me to...\u000a\u000aYou're now my friend.
p22501
aVlol 3 lane slaloms.
p22502
aVFavorite kind of slalom.
p22503
aVI need to move to London soon.
p22504
aVThough I spend a lot of my life in England I am somewhat not looking forward to.
p22505
aVOn the other hand, man, it can be great there! 
p22506
aVOP, next time you have fish and chips, make sure you have a cup of tea and some bread and butter too.
p22507
aVIf you're feeling adventurous, you can make a chip butty, but the tea always slips down nicely with a big, greasy plate of fish and chips! 
p22508
aVI got to the bit about boilers and just realised that I sent a snapchat to my mate of the new boiler I just bought, and had a 30 minute conversation to go with it, I like boilers.
p22509
aVWith regards to boilers;\u000a\u000aYes we have more problems than other countries because we take a much different approach (similar to America more than mainland Europe).
p22510
aVBasically Brits like their boilers on the cheap, they consider them to be a one off purchase, a one time expense.
p22511
aVWhereas other cultures take much better care of them, often have a contract with their installer who takes good care of it and services it reguarly.
p22512
aVHere if you can get it put on the wall cheap and leave it alone your laughing.
p22513
aVIt is frankly a naive and inefficient way to manage a product that you rely upon but that is the mentality by and large.
p22514
aVIs it weird for the accent to change very often?
p22515
aVbecause i feel in the UK it varies within tiny distances.
p22516
aVDoes this happen in most places? 
p22517
aVUntil about a hundred years ago or so, France was a patchwork or local dialects until the government forced a single French language on everyone.
p22518
aVThis is probably why they're so sensitive to English words making it into their language without approval from the government.
p22519
aVAnd if you've ever heard a Bavarian German complaining about his Prussian neighbours, well you start to realise that everywhere has its little variations.
p22520
aVFor centuries communities grew with little outside mixing when long distance travel and communication was at a premium.
p22521
aVAccents, slang and dialects abounded and if you moved you gradually adopted the accent and terminology.
p22522
aVBut now we travel further much more easily and communication is unrestricted, we're exposed more to these variations.
p22523
aVIf you move, you'll still find yourself adopting the accent, there's still a lot of linguistic momentum in each region, but there's also now the homogenising forces of the media and the internet, so who knows what'll happen with time...
p22524
aVSour cream is no issue in Canada.
p22525
aVSour Milk I'd not heard of, can't you just buy normal milk and leave it at the window in sunlight for a couple of days?
p22526
aV"One lump or two?
p22527
aV"
aVSour cream for your perogies buh!
p22528
aVhttp://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/jim-the-duck-comic-community-tumblr-monday.jpg\u000a\u000aU should make a bunch of those about uk
p22529
aVI agree with the part about being ill.
p22530
aVHowever work places expect you to be like a robot and having a sick day is only acceptable if you almost died.
p22531
aVWell that's what it feel like most of the time.
p22532
aVAt my place you get a lot of "are you sure?
p22533
aV" and "have you called the doctors?
p22534
aV" and "see if you feel better later".
p22535
aVYes I am sure I am ill, no I haven't called the doctors if it was that serious I would be there and not talking to you on the phone, and if I thought I was going to feel better I'd be sitting at my desk already.
p22536
aVI get it, they don't want people skiving off work, and some people do make more excuses than you could even think.
p22537
aVBut come on, I almost didn't get a promotion at work for having 2 separate sick days, about 8 months apart, and had to have 2 weeks off due to being hospitalised.
p22538
aVThis was over a whole year and it's not even a high paid job.
p22539
aVI loved this!
p22540
aVYou could collect these observations and make a small book out of them!
p22541
aV:))
p22542
aV20- No idea 
p22543
aVHear, hear!
p22544
aVYou clearly haven't lived in London if you're applauding the British parking set up.
p22545
aVThis guy you mentioned who spends a third of his salary on rail fare only to be able to afford to get to work and back?
p22546
aVHis alternatives are spending 3/4 of it on a mix of petrol and London parking fees (with the latter constituting a greater share) or getting a better paid job, a couple of housemates and living in London.
p22547
aVAfter having spent my last 10 years in London I've developed a case of "london fatigue", anyhow, I recommend "Capital" by John Lanchester.
p22548
aVAs for the Daily Mail...
p22549
aVI dabble.
p22550
aVThey all have their uses though.
p22551
aVTake the Guardian, splendid culture reviews and if ever one is short on red wallpaper... ;-)\u000a\u000aPs.
p22552
aVWhich parts of Polska dla Polaków do you hail from?
p22553
aVPPS.
p22554
aVr/polandball 
p22555
aVI swear so many people would be happier on half the wages at an employer 10 minutes away rather than 40 grand for a job in central London and the commuting.
p22556
aV&gt;1.
p22557
aVBanks\u000a\u000a Do they do post office accounts instead though?
p22558
aVNumbers 13 and 14 are my favourite!
p22559
aVCheques are hugely necessary.
p22560
aVLucky you that you have no transactions requiring them.
p22561
aVI wrote my first cheque in over six years the other day.
p22562
aVIt felt like defeat.
p22563
aVBank transfers all the way.
p22564
aVI got teased for referring to the boiler as a furnace.
p22565
aV:( It looks like one! 
p22566
aVThe bank observation is so true.
p22567
aVI recently became self employed and trying to open a business account was a nightmare.
p22568
aVIt felt like I was being interrogated.
p22569
aVI just wanted somewhere to put my money, you would of thought I was trying to rob the place.
p22570
aVI've moved to the UK from poland 10 years ago and I still don't understand  the vinegar on chips and crisps thing.
p22571
aVGreat stuff.
p22572
aVPint or a vodka sometime?
p22573
aV&gt;You're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances.
p22574
aVThis line early on Sec 2. is when I quit reading in a Polish accent and went straight to my best British.
p22575
aVThis dude is already British as shit.
p22576
aVJust in denial is all. 
p22577
aVAs a Brit living in Poland, it 'aint so rosy here mate.
p22578
aVI can relate to number 4.
p22579
aVI am a "temp" at a company (called a temp, but how long a temp actually is and how long a temp should be is quite different where I work) and as such, I am not entitled to benefits like pension, bonuses and sick days.
p22580
aVIf I do not work, I don't get paid.
p22581
aVOu put my feeling for Cameron into tangible words, where as before I'd just say "Fucking Cameron..." And swear a lot afterwards
p22582
aVWherever I do that, the site I commented on subsequently gets flagged as porn due to the language.
p22583
aVHeyooooo
p22584
aVThey still use steam boilers for heat there? 
p22585
aVNope, our boilers don't boil water they merely heat it to a reasonable temperature.
p22586
aVAlso driving directions.
p22587
aVI swear, get three English people in a room and you'll get a turn-by-turn description of every possible route to get there.
p22588
aVHow does GPS sell in this country anyway?
p22589
aVNever really understood the banks charging you for being over drawn when you have no money... Its just an easy way for them to make money!
p22590
aVIts happened to me a few times and every time it has I've rang them and contested it.
p22591
aVWorks like a charm every time, never had to pay over drawn fees! 
p22592
aVLouis CK covered this really 'Hi there, this is your bank calling, we need to tell you that you don't have any money'\u000a'Um, yeah, I know that'\u000a'Yeah, well, that's a problem, and as you don't have any money, we need to charge you $15... which we need to give to a really rich guy as a reward for having loads of money'.
p22593
aVI swear, it sucks when you have to refuse free stuff because you have less than no money.
p22594
aVFuck is a tyre?
p22595
aV- Merica'
p22596
aV&gt; Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p22597
aVBecause there are 4 or 5 litres to the gallon.
p22598
aVSobvious.
p22599
aVHello Michal :) Fellow Polish here, but with a much longer "residency" in the UK (9 years and counting...).
p22600
aVI could add a couple of things to your list, get rid of few, but it is surprising that they are pretty much similar.
p22601
aV1.
p22602
aVBanks - I fully agree with those.
p22603
aVIt used to drive me mad, but since everything can be done online, I simply stopped thinking about it.
p22604
aV2.
p22605
aVI am a freelancer and work at home.
p22606
aVWell OK, anywhere where the Internet is, which is almost everywhere.
p22607
aVWhen I worked at school (6 years - high school and colleges) sick people did not come to teach, because that meant spreading the diseases, so I guess it depends.
p22608
aV3.
p22609
aVTea with milk - god, no.
p22610
aVSalt and vinegar crisps and chips - hell yeah.
p22611
aVI sort of got "infected" with them by my son.
p22612
aVHis fault.
p22613
aVYes, I do like them.
p22614
aV4.
p22615
aVWeather!
p22616
aVIt might be crazy but I love English weather - warm summers and mild winters.
p22617
aVI never want to go back to snow (up to -30 in winter in Poland!
p22618
aV) and scorching sun (+40 in summer!).
p22619
aV15-20 degrees is perfect.
p22620
aV5.
p22621
aVParking and driving in general - It is shockingly easy to drive here (parking - well, if you are confident).
p22622
aVI drove left-hand drive vehicle for 7 years and I have never had any issues with driving, parking or the police.
p22623
aVPeople are generally kind, calm and you never have issues to join the traffic.
p22624
aV6.
p22625
aVCustomer service - sorry, but it is simply incomparable with Polish one.
p22626
aVI spent a week in July in Poland.
p22627
aVNot a single person smiled, looked in the eyes or made me feel welcome in any shop whatsoever.
p22628
aV7.
p22629
aVEducation - again, it depends where you "land".
p22630
aVI am a qualified teacher/lecturer and I have been working in education here for 9 years, so I could write a book about it.
p22631
aVI also have a son who finished primary school and just started high school, so I guess I know a lot about every key stage.
p22632
aVIt is a completely different world - it has advantages and disadvantages.
p22633
aVIf a parent bothers to find a good school and makes a serious effort in the child's education, then it beats Polish education by a mile.
p22634
aVIn fact, it was one of the most important factors of my arrival to UK - to be able to send my son to school here.
p22635
aVOfsted reports will give some basic indication of the school's quality, it is possible to see most schools in action, talk to students and parents.
p22636
aVOK, I'll stop here :)\u000a\u000a8.
p22637
aVI can't praise the paramedics/health care and police enough.
p22638
aVThose few occasions that I had to use the services were shockingly positive.
p22639
aVThe staff was always polite, professional and supportive.
p22640
aVI was never once "sent away with paracetamol" or ignored by the police.
p22641
aVIt was just the opposite.
p22642
aVYes, I am well aware NHS is a bureaucratic mess.
p22643
aVI sometimes do projects for them.
p22644
aV9.
p22645
aVTransport - buses - in my area are terrible -pricey and rare.
p22646
aVTrains - by far my favourite mode of transport but so terribly expensive.
p22647
aVI love travelling by trains!
p22648
aVEspecially to London!
p22649
aV10.
p22650
aVSelf-employment.
p22651
aVOh.
p22652
aVYes, no paperwork.
p22653
aVNo visits to the offices.
p22654
aVNo dealing with incompetent workers.
p22655
aVOh, no one is trying to destroy my company with constant inspections, taxes, forms, fees and whole load of Polish crap.
p22656
aVIn fact, it is just the opposite.
p22657
aVI am being offered help at any time to deal with the tax man properly and efficiently.
p22658
aVThis is beyond comparison with Polish reality.
p22659
aVI will be getting my British passport at some point this year and at the moment, despite quite a few bits that drive me mad (insurance companies!
p22660
aV), I would not change this place for anything else in the world.
p22661
aVI have a fantastic career, own house, friends and family here.
p22662
aVThis is my place too :)\u000a
p22663
aVI'm from the UK and some of what you say is very accurate (banks, boilers, petrol in litres, vinegar on chips).
p22664
aVThe boiler part had me laughing.
p22665
aVThe bank fees and train fares are both ridiculous too.
p22666
aVBut you need to say no to the insurance sellers!
p22667
aVWhat you described as normal in Poland is also normal here.
p22668
aVNot sure about the comments about customer service and attitude to education.
p22669
aVSounds like you're not in a great area?
p22670
aVOn the topic of education, and as someone who's just come out of it, I think you have a fair point.
p22671
aVI disliked school immensely.
p22672
aVOne year I had an attendance rate of 55%, and yet I was still credited as a hard working student for placing in the top three percent.
p22673
aVI did the very bare minimal, just quickly, on time, with a well learned syllabus.
p22674
aVSaying that, when I missed exam days, I would take them when I came in, in another classroom.
p22675
aVWhich class?
p22676
aVThe lowest graded children.
p22677
aVHaving sat through three classes of 30+ children being taught shapes and dimensions in year 11 was mind-boggling.
p22678
aVThey were taught to achieve C's, being drilled the same information for hours and hours.
p22679
aVOn the other hand, adults are constantly telling us how easy we have it today compared to them.
p22680
aVHow our exams are easy, how easy it is to find a job, we're just lazy.
p22681
aVRadio stations for call-in critics telling us how much harder O-levels were, stories of studies where teens fail old O-level test papers.
p22682
aVAt the end of the day, we're teaching kids to study and pursue their own interests, but that doesn't guarantee employment.
p22683
aVI can tell you all about old English authors, of renaissance scientists, the rise and fall of empires, and religions... but changing a light fitting?
p22684
aVI'd have to find a youtube video.
p22685
aVDrain a radiator?
p22686
aVYoutube.
p22687
aVSchool teaches you a little of everything, and then encourages you to specialize, leaving with a narrow set of skills, and a wide birth of inapplicable knowledge that you'll never, ever require.
p22688
aVI believe the system is an irreparable clusterfuck that fuels generation after generations complaints, ultimately achieving nothing.
p22689
aVPerhaps I'm too cynical. 
p22690
aVI have been here for roughly 60 days from the USA and I can say it's been interesting....
p22691
aVI echo the parking.
p22692
aVThe good ol US government gave me a Ford F350 to drive here, in America this is no big deal, but driving that here feels like a damn school bus, with parking designed for motorcycles, haha.
p22693
aVDriving down the street and literally seeing cars scattered everywhere was amusing....
p22694
aVThe cursing here is on a whole different level and I love it.
p22695
aVTrying to figure out the 'level' of frustration in the choice of words was interesting and the use of the "C" word here is unrestricted unlike America..\u000a\u000aRound-a-bouts.... Intially fucking hated them.... Now, huge fan.
p22696
aVI hardly have to stop!
p22697
aVHowever, heavy traffic areas, they blow.
p22698
aVIn america where I live there is like one roundabout in a 200 mile radius and it is a "test".
p22699
aVBikes, what is the obsession?
p22700
aVWomen fashion, I've seen more boob just walking around London here and it's not even attempted to be hidden lol, seem very free here compared to where I live.
p22701
aVPubs, everything seems to be a greene king with a different name?
p22702
aVI truly have enjoyed it here, I have seen very cool sites, lots of history, and Sampled some awesome beers.... With that being said, I leave in a few days... Been fun!
p22703
aVWho in God's name thought that an F350 was a good plan in the UK?
p22704
aVI mean, I've driven large pickup trucks and I've driven in the UK (fortunately, not at the same time), and the thought of putting the two together sounds like a complete nightmare.
p22705
aVAll they had for us , haha.
p22706
aVIt is funny driving around and seeing all the locals stare at us, I can only imagine what they are thinking, haha.
p22707
aVOn the banks thing I have a two fold answer, first and foremost the level of fraud in the UK, from both citizens and immigrants, is rife as fuck.
p22708
aVThe account opening is so intense to try and prevent as much of this as possible.
p22709
aVTrust me it is as annoying for us as it is for you.
p22710
aV(can confirm.
p22711

aV)\u000a\u000aSecond; (from my own personal experience) customers from Poland usually only want a simple account with a card and direct debits ect, totally understandable.
p22713
aVBanks do not want this, this provides no profit for them.
p22714
aVThey want you to take 'the package'.
p22715
aVThis includes a fee paying current account, savings, ISA and a good old insurance policy if you can pull it off.
p22716
aVIf these things aren't set up you get a whole heap of shit from the man upstairs.
p22717
aVBecause of this you will find that the member of staff may try and make you take a basic account (cash-card) or just fob you off to another bank.
p22718
aVShitty but true.
p22719
aVFortunately thanks to the splitting of the FSA and the shitstorm laid down after the recent scandals (PPI, Rate fixing) all of this is likely to disappear.
p22720
aVAnd I'm guessing this is also why banks in the UK are reluctant to open accounts for non-residents?
p22721
aVPretty much yeah, it is possible to open them but usually staff will try not too.
p22722
aVDirect Debits.
p22723
aVA direct debit (dd) is an authority that allows a third party to debit your account for a set amount at a set time.
p22724
aVYou agree that there will be money in the account to meet the payment.
p22725
aVThis isn't a payment sent by the bank; it's a payment claimed from the bank by someone else.

aVCompletely and utterly agree with you in regards to driving.

aVDriving in the UK is an absolute pleasure compared to what I've seen in other countries.
p22733
aVEverything is extremely well organised.
p22734
aVYour points on school is kinda false from my own experience.
p22735
aVIf you don't put in any effort you won't get anything back.
p22736
aVBut then I guess it depends on the school your son goes to.
p22737
aVMy hairdresser is also fine.
p22738
aVCertainly I ballsed up school horribly because no-one could explain the value to me, and then returning to retake GCSEs as an adult, I sure as hell paid attention and did the damn work, and it paid off.
p22739
aVI still think there should be a gap before the last few years of school, where kids have to go do food service or retail for a year.
p22740
aVWhen they return, they'll study their arses off to ensure good grades to never have to stand behind a checkout or a fryer again.

aV15 and 16 seem related.
p22742
aVThe only one I want to call you out on (that is to say the one I object to most - I disagree with several) is the Middle Lane Motorist one.
p22743
aVYou're either going fast enough to over-take the truck, in which case you should get past it and get back into the inside lane, or you're not in which case you shouldn't be in the middle bloody lane anyway.
p22744
aVGiven all those cars go past you, that might suggest a problem with the approach, no?
p22745
aVYou can actually get sour milk from almost all Eastern European shops here in the UK - just saying

aV"to have my custom"\u000a\u000aWhat does that mean?
p22747
aVAccording to Merriam Webster online, Third definition, "a :  business patronage"\u000a\u000aInteresting fact, it is derived from the latin word Consuetudo (Con-sue-eh-two-do), which means a habit.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p22748
aVWouldn't one say "take my business elsewhere?
p22749
aV"
aVThe way he said it was in reference to business patronage.
p22750
aVIt has more brevity.
p22751
aVOne syllable less is brevity?
p22752
aVIt's also dependent on the concise nature of the words.

p22758
aVSure, if I feel like i'm ridden with ebola with one day left to live, I know I will not be able to work properly and I sure as hell don't want to go in, but my boss is a heartless machine.
p22759
aVI've worked in this nearby Co-op for 6 months now and never missed a day, unlike all of my colleges.
p22760
aVI called in the morning, 7 hours before my shift, to say that I was vomiting uncontrollably with diarrhoea to which he responded "That's not my problem" and would not accept my pleas to die in peace.
p22761
aVI couldn't bring myself to go in, in the end.
p22762
aVI was almost fired for it. 
p22763
aVMy place is supposed to have a system, kind of like a 3-strikes system.
p22764
aVWithin 6 months, First time is a "back to work meeting", Your team-leader just asks you why you were off.
p22765
aVSecond is a "recorded discussion", No idea what that atually means, i've personally not been on one.
p22766
aVThird strike is a meeting with HR.
p22767
aVFinal time and you're out.
p22768
aVBut your boss takes the cake, At least my HR ask "are you sure you can't try to come in?
p22769
aV" No, i'm sure, the customer isn't going to be happy about me cutting a phone-call short to loudly die in the toilets.
p22770
aVI feel you on #6.

aVThis happened to me today and is all too often in Canada too.
p22772
aVIt amazes me when I merge out of the fast lane going 120 km/h and people are still able to whip past me. 
p22773
aVThere is only one driving lane and thats the left, others are for overtaking and it keeps the roads running smoothly, time it right and use a signal and most drivers will let you out into the middle to overtake that lorry without losing speed.. Lazy people sit in the middle lane and complacency isn't appropriate whilst driving 3+ tonnes of steel at 70mph\u000a
p22774
aV&gt; I've never seen anything like that before outside Russia.

aVIt always seems fairly clean to me.
p22777

aVBut otherwise, this stuff is brilliant.

p22789

p22791
aVMetric is (or was anyway) very much "imposed" upon the British people, and we've never really got on with it on the whole.
p22792
aVAsk the average Brit how tall they are and they'll tell you in feet and inches, but when you go to the doctor he will measure you in meters to calculate your BMI.
p22793
aVIn general, imperial is used for colloquial everyday measurements whilst metric is used for official figures or where there is a need to be very precise.
p22794
aVOunces for example are hardly ever used because grams is a lot more precise, but equally kilometers are hardly ever used because a mile is a reasonable enough measurement to use.
p22795
aVThe real fun ofc comes when you say something weighs "a ton" since both imperial and metric use the word "ton(ne)" as a unit of mass.
p22796
aV16.
p22797
aVSo you like people not having jobs/replaced by kiosks?
p22798
aV19 is hilarious..and true.
p22799
aVI agree to the last one, totally, Why can't we scrap the bizzare imperial units and purely have metric units?
p22800
aVOh man!
p22801
aVI love the "boilers" one.
p22802
aVYou must have a good boiler or you're no one.
p22803

aVPlease elaborate

p22808
aVI'm sorry but I have to strongly disagree with number 6.
p22809
aVThe middle lane is an overtaking lane, if you're not overtaking then move to the left.
p22810
aVThat's basic highway code.
p22811
aVYea, fuck the Daily Mail.
p22812
aVI will just say quickly that GCSEs are a piece of piss, but A-levels are actually difficult and require application of knowledge to solve problems in many cases.
p22813
aVMany of us go on to do A levels and nearly half of us (I read recently it was about 49% I believe) end up going to uni.
p22814
aVEducation is fucked at the GCSE level.
p22815
aVA-levels were okay but now they're 'reforming them' (read: fucking them up) without fixing the couple core problems first.
p22816
aV[We are ranked (by Pearson) as 2nd for education in Europe and 6th globally.
p22817
aV](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27314075)\u000a\u000aI just wanted to mention this simply because I feel a lot of teens are regularly shat upon by politicians and misinformed adults in the UK, where our exam records go up and up year on year, our students are more motivated than ever - and yet they're still told its because its so easy and 'back in my day we had it harder'.
p22818
aVThat may be true of GCSEs, but everything post-GCSE is *much* harder than it is often given credit for.
p22819
aVYoung people in the UK have it hard enough knowing that their degrees and training won't guarantee a stable job - they don't need baby boomers shitting on them from their positions that they got into with a couple relevant archaic O-levels.
p22820
aV&gt; 3.Cheques.
p22821
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p22822
aVIt's XXI century.
p22823
aVCheques are awesome because they're a physical payment method you can use without fear of it being stolen or misappropriated.
p22824
aVYou can give someone the cheque as you would cash but at the same time you can carry it around and nobody can steal it (well they can steal the cheque but not the money).
p22825
aVThey're also useful if you need to hand over a large sum physically.
p22826
aVRather than a duffle bag full of notes you can write a cheque for £10,000 and be done.
p22827
aVAs long as cash remains relevant, cheques will too - electronic payment isn't always possible or practical, particularly for older people or those without internet access.
p22828
aV&gt; 15.A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council.
p22829
aVSo, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14?
p22830
aVAnd if yes, is that intentional?
p22831
aVSort of.
p22832
aVThe reason people can live off benefits so easily is because the previous Labour government (lasting 13 years) hugely expanded the welfare state (using borrowed money) to the point where it actually started to make sense to live off welfare rather than working, particularly if work was scarce.
p22833
aVThen the recession hit, jobs (particularly better-paid ones) became scarce and so naturally people just sat around at home on benefits instead of going out to work for less than they'd recieve otherwise.
p22834
aVThis issue was perhaps compounded by the open-border with Europe which was also affected by the recession so a lot of people (willing to work for less than most Brits) came here looking for work.
p22835
aVCameron was then elected (well, nearly.
p22836
aVHe needed some help from Clegg) to try and sort the whole mess out and whilst he's made some progress there's still a lot of work to be done.
p22837
aV&gt; 16.Self-service cash registers.
p22838
aVI love them.
p22839
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p22840
aVEven better: portable scanners that I can take shopping.
p22841
aVNobody uses them but me.
p22842
aVPeople sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.
p22843
aVBrits aren't generally huge fans of automation.
p22844
aVWe love technology but we have to be in control.
p22845
aVA good example is automatic cars - you don't see many here, whilst in the US they're everywhere.
p22846
aVBrits like the manual gearbox because we don't trust some newfangled thinkerbot computer to do things for us.
p22847
aVWe know what gear we want, and we're quite capable of changing it ourselves thank you very much.
p22848
aVThis extends to trusting another human more than we trust the device.
p22849
aV&gt; 18.Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing.
p22850
aVIt's considered gone-off or spoiled that's why.
p22851
aVIf milk goes like that we chuck it out, or perhaps sigh disappointedly and decide to make scones with it since that's about all it's good for.
p22852
aV&gt; 19.WTF is it with boilers?
p22853
aVCold, wet country with small homes so the boiler represents not only a major element in the house physically, but also functionally because it's responsible for heating I guess.
p22854
aV&gt; 20.Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p22855
aVBecause some genius decided we should adopt the metric system, but nobody liked it and most people kept using imperial anyway despite it being literally illegal to do so in a lot of cases, so ultimately we arrived at this stupid situation where, as you point out, some stuff is in imperial and some is metric.
p22856
aVGenerally, imperial is used colloquially but metric is used officially - miles are an exception, presumably arising from the fact that the average UK roaduser has almost no idea how long a kilometer really is relative to a mile and getting them used to it would be too much of a ballache.
p22857
aVPersonally, I prefer imperial for almost everything.
p22858
aVI only use metric for scientific work.
p22859
aV&gt;Banks.

aVTo open a current account was way too tricky.

aVdon't forget about schools being on your back if your kids takes a few days off to get over the flu or whatever exotic lurgy is currently doing the rounds and being spread by those who have gone in!

aVAlso no sympathy for periods, even though my girl's passed out from it in the school office before!
p22867
aVFFS, people aren't machines!
p22868
aVAnyway, welcome to  the island - there's plenty more weird stuff waiting to be discovered!
p22869
aVAt least you speak English.
p22870
aVI only use sour milk for scones, what do you use it for? 
p22871
aVwould be pointless to have mileage in kilometres per gallon, frankly.

p22878
aVThat's sounds weird.
p22879
aVI've been to Russia &amp; Poland &amp; Poles are alot messier in general.
p22880
aVRussians are pretty fastidious.
p22881
aVInteresting to compare this to Canada.

aVLOL.

aVYou should try the US!!!
p22885
aVYou would have a heart attack!
p22886
aVYou can get buttermilk (sour milk) in most big supermarkets.

aVThe speed camera thing must be the area you live in?
p22892
aVThey're every bloody mile on most of the roads I know..
p22893
aVOh god, number 19 is so true.
p22894
aVNumber 6.
p22895
aVThere are 2 points here, and it seems that you don't get it yet.
p22896
aVPlease don't read this as a criticism of your driving, but more as an explanation as to why changing your driving makes sense (for you and others).
p22897
aVI enjoyed your post immensely, I miss so much about my home country, other things not so much (I'm talking to you, weather!
p22898
aV) \u000a\u000aThe first point is on safety.
p22899
aVYou may not realise it from your position, but it is exceptionally dangerous in the circumstances when two drivers travelling at different speeds, but faster than you arrive at the same time.
p22900
aVThey both have to judge and so just their speed, looking around unnecessarily.
p22901
aVAt high speeds the potential for driver error (not everyone is an amazing driver, sad fact of life that we have to deal with) is increased.
p22902
aVIt's pointless, just move over, consider others.
p22903
aVWhy do you feel the need to sit in the middle?
p22904
aV(Genuine question, please answer.
p22905
aV) \u000a\u000a\u000aSecondly, you should only really leave the left hand lane in order to overtake, it's the law.
p22906
aVNow, I and many others adopt a more dynamic approach.
p22907
aVYou have stated it seems ridiculous to hassle someone and then overtake at only a couple of mph faster...
p22908
aVBut you wouldn't think this if they were travelling that speed, having not had to get you to move over.
p22909
aVAs for the dynamic approach, I think there is nothing wrong with little burst of gentle acceleration in order to overtake a vehicle that is travelling very slightly slower than you.
p22910
aVYou may well be breaking the speed limit for a couple of hundred metres, you won't be burning in hell for that.
p22911
aVIn this way, you can accelerate into the traffic flow, when there is a reasonable gap, overtaking that Eddie Stobart, pulling back in and settling back to your comfortable speed, leaving the maximum amount of carriageway free for other road users.
p22912
aVThe only reason you would ever get stuck behind a slow coach in the left hand lane and is poor anticipation, particularly on motorways you should be looking round constantly checking mirrors (and blindspots if you need to) and always have a pretty good idea of what the traffic is doing 10, 15, 20, even 30 seconds from now.
p22913
aVParticularly large, slow moving vehicles... You can see them for miles, why not react sooner.
p22914
aVSource: I'm a motorcyclist, poor/inconsiderate driving technique normally translates as dangerous for me.
p22915
aVI'm also a British chap living in Marseille, where I constantly feel like the shoddy attitude of other drivers is nothing short of criminal negligence and downright murderous. 
p22916
aV&gt; 16.Self-service cash registers.
p22917
aVI love them.
p22918
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p22919
aVEven better: portable scanners that I can take shopping.
p22920
aVNobody uses them but me.
p22921
aVPeople sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.
p22922
aVthese things are the BEST I'm really annoyed that only Tescos does the ones you carry around cause I've fallen out with Tescos :/ C'mon morrisons, you gotta up your game here.
p22923
aV&gt; 18.Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing.
p22924
aVSour milk is only available in Polish shops.
p22925
aVJust sayin'\u000a\u000athis bugs me too, there's "sour cream" but it's like.. awful.
p22926
aVWe buy "crème freshe" which is much more like the sour cream I loved in aussie. 
p22927
aVNumber 6.
p22928
aVSitting in the middle lane for no reason is illegal btw.
p22929
aVMight want to read up on uk road rules.
p22930
aVI'm sitting there for a reason - read my update to the original post.
p22931
aVYes in your update you suggest that if you move in you'll be stuck behind a truck.
p22932
aVSo you're not really sitting in the middle lane but using it for passing.
p22933
aVOnce you've passed that truck then you move into the inside lane.
p22934
aVIt's pretty simple really - be in the most inside lane you can be unless passing something.
p22935
aVAlso, cruise control can be increased/decreased so anticipate your surroundings and adjust accordingly to go with the flow of traffic and cause minimal disruption.
p22936
aVSo many road issues are caused by people just not giving a shit about anyone else around them.
p22937
aVHighly entertaining old chap, jolly good.
p22938
aVWhat you do - that's not what "hogging the middle lane" is.
p22939
aVYou're using it correctly.
p22940
aV:)
p22941
aVIt's not just Cameron -- all politicians over here are, in general, utterly out of touch with the country they're governing; no matter the party.
p22942
aVEtonians, Harovians; almost all are educated privately.
p22943
aVThis is, of course, coming from someone who also was educated privately.
p22944
aVAnd why is it that all our politicians are wealthy, privately-educated, and out of touch?
p22945
aVBecause the state education system is, overall, a fucking travesty.
p22946
aVDon't get me wrong, you can find a good state school here and there, but when you look at how we educate our children, you see just how much of a mess we'll be in soon.
p22947
aVWe're failing bright kids.
p22948
aVI say bring back free grammar schools in every county -- we can't keep failing intelligent children.
p22949
aVAs to 15.
p22950
aVIf you want to stay dumb, you'll stay dumb and live your life because you wanted it to be so.
p22951
aVIf you want to achieve something - and are in a good school - then the level of knowledge is much higher.
p22952
aVI was talking to my Polish friend about education etc.
p22953
aVand he has shown me the equivalent of our A-Levels (Maturity exam or something like that?
p22954
aV) and the Maths exam took me a good half and hour, maybe 40 minutes and consisted of everything I was taught in the first year of my A-Levels... okay, maybe a bit of the second year too.
p22955
aVThe difference is that here you gain a lot of knowledge in (most commonly) 3 - 4 subjects whereas he said that in Poland you study extra 5 - 8 that you don't write an exam in but still have to pass.
p22956
aVI can see why Maths (for example) would be hindered.
p22957
aVin other words if you are lucky enough to be in a good school with proactive teachers or have parents who urge you to do well....
p22958
aVProblem is that schools here often do not even bother inspiring kids.
p22959
aVIts all menial.
p22960
aVAnd you end up with generations of people whose career is to farm babies and milk the councils.
p22961
aVNot really, just if you have an ambition and want to do well, I know a lot people who were in 'bad' schools or schools considered to be the worst in the city, and yet they manage to get into a good college / university because they tried hard.
p22962
aVIn every country there is a difference of educational classes in population because a lot of people are contempt with knowing less and living their life 'easy'.
p22963
aVEven if you have a strict educational programme you will not be able to force knowledge into kids/people that don't want to learn it - and quite sadly it is often quite a big number of them.
p22964
aVI have been lucky to attend a really great school where the teachers were - as you say - proactive and comparing it to some other schools it was really strict.
p22965
aVStill, a huge amount of people ended their education there and then and a lot of them didn't achieve awesome grades, just because they didn't want to.

aVMy friend was denied help from her school/college in doing maths.
p22968
aVShe has studied 2 modules on her own with some help from a tutor (and me).
p22969
aVShe herself registered for the two tests and passed them with an A and a B.
p22970
aVThen she re-applied for the second year of Maths and Passed it overall with a B and got into Computer Science at the University she wanted to go to.
p22971
aVAll you need is to really want to achieve and do good.
p22972
aVUnfortunately a huge part of the society chooses the 'easy' way.
p22973
aVI am not denying that there are exceptional people who work hard and overcome the social inertia.
p22974
aVHowever sad reality is for the most part - kids are what we raise them to be.
p22975
aVIf school and parents fail - the kids usually ... well like the OP said about that girl.

aVIf you are not overtaking you should be as far left as you can be, on any multi lane road.

p22981
aV6.
p22982
aVMiddle lane drivers wind me up, you should not be sat in the middle lane, *however*, this mentality is clearly cause by people who don't pull into the right hand lane when the person in the left lane comes up behind a lorry.
p22983
aVIn my opinion, if someone has the courtesy to obey the rules and use the left lane (as I do even though I sit at 85-90mph) then if I see that that person may need to pull out in front of me, I pull over to let them pull out also.
p22984
aVProvided that there is noone coming up behind me in the outside lane.
p22985
aVI hate people that pull out in front of faster moving traffic.
p22986
aVTLDR: Obey the traffic rules, for I am an angry man.
p22987
aV&gt;Dental\u000a\u000a\u000a:(
p22988
aVEven with the charges of NHS dentistry, it's so much cheaper and more affordable than any other option.
p22989
aVA checkup is in the £20's.
p22990
aVYou can get an extensive amount of work done for £45 (Including the initial checkup) and that includes root canals.
p22991
aVIts not perfect, but goddamn, when I hear my friends paying £60 or so for a checkup and then hundreds for any work, I am so goddamn thankful that I have an NHS dentist.\u000a
p22992
aVThe fact that some of your friends can't get an NHS dentist is kind of what I was hinting at.
p22993
aVIt's luck of the draw if you can actually get an NHS dentist where you live. 
p22994
aVNot sure if it is based on location, I live in Nottingham and I have never had trouble finding a NHS dentist is the three areas of Nottingham that I have lived.
p22995
aVNo more than 2, maybe 3 at most phone calls to get on a NHS dentist.
p22996
aVSame here, I've got two NHS dentists within walking distance of home and both of them are actively trying to recruit more NHS patients at the moment.
p22997
aV[deleted]
p22998
aVDepends where you are looking.
p22999
aVThe one I use is on Derby Road (https://www.nhs.uk/Services/dentists/MapsAndDirections/DefaultView.aspx?id=23684) I had no trouble getting on as a patient, and never more than a week or so to get an appointment.
p23000
aVWaiting time there isnt long when there
p23001
aVI use the one at the [university of Nottingham](http://www.crippsdentalcentre.co.uk/crippsdentalcentre/index.aspx).
p23002
aVYou don't have to be a student.
p23003
aVI got seen to and a filling within 2 weeks of first ringing up, would recommend.
p23004
aVThanks for all these recommendations!
p23005
aVI am indeed also in Nottingham and in need of a new dentist.\u000a
p23006
aVI was going to say the same - and I'm in Nottingham too.
p23007
aVEvery dentist I walk past says 'Accepting new NHS patients' or something similar.
p23008
aVMaybe it's a regional issue?
p23009
aVThey never even tried.
p23010
aVTheir family just stuck with a family dentist that was private. 
p23011
aVFuck, it makes you think how much stuff isn't true on reddit because the people telling you the stories don't realize.
p23012
aVIt's precisely why you shouldn't form an idea of any complex system\u005cphenomenon based on anecdotes.
p23013
aVEvery single individual point of view is limited, inevitably biased and lacks context.
p23014
aVWhen you read about a person that received subpar care at an NHS facility, the tale might horrify you, but neither you nor the person in question might now that the substandard care was due to the poor job done by a private contractor, for example, that was forced on the facility by 'liberalization'.
p23015
aVWait...It's hard to find an NHS dentist?
p23016
aVI like in Gateshead and there's more than enough choice in my area. 
p23017
aVYeah, I was thinking the same, theres at least 4 within walking distance of Gosforth, where I live. 
p23018
aVJust depends where you live.
p23019
aVI've lived in:\u000a\u000a* Leicester - plenty of NHS dentists to choose from\u000a* York - was only able to get on a waiting list, all NHS dentists were full\u000a* Grimsby - all NHS dentists full\u000a* Cheltenham - plenty of NHS dentists to choose from
p23020
aVI know people that have to drive 40-50 miles for one and the appointment can be months away.
p23021
aVNHS dentistry in this country is fucking SHOCKING in places and is largely left up to the few practises that can lower themselves to what they believe are criminal rates for NHS work
p23022
aVYou know people in **London** that have to do this?
p23023
aVThey're lying or being incredibly picky.
p23024
aVI got on to my NHS dentist with no hassle at all, and never have to wait more than a week for an appointment.
p23025
aVI don't think there are many in London.
p23026
aVMy own mother was an NHS doctor for many years and despite worshipping the service even now I don't think she has ever been to an NHS dentist- I can only assume that not many exist around here. 
p23027
aV3 near me, West London, two walking distance.
p23028
aVMight be to do with different incomes in London compared to Newcastle, less people want to pay hundreds for dental care and this has run private businesses out of the area, while NHS dentists continue to grow. 
p23029
aVSeems fairly random to me.
p23030
aVI live in lancashire and I can't get an NHS dentist, I pay £12 per month (because I have good teeth so I'm low risk) so it's not bad at all, and if I do need any work it's covered.
p23031
aVHaving experienced both I have to say I'd never go back to an NHS dentist.
p23032
aVMy private dentist is fantastic and I'm a lot more confident that his advice is based on good dentistry and not what eases the strain on the NHS!
p23033
aVI'm pretty sure all dentists have good education on the subject, NHS or private.
p23034
aVI pay £25 for two years, and whenever I need surgery there is no "cost issue" 
p23035
aVEducation is one thing but NHS dentists are under pressure to save money.
p23036
aVTherefore sometimes work that needs doing doesn't get done. 
p23037
aVDon't think it is anymore, I rang up a random one and got straight in as an NHS patient.
p23038
aVGive it a go and you might be surprised.
p23039
aVFor a little perspective, I am being charged **£160** for an extraction at a "low-income" dental clinic here in the states.
p23040
aVDitto.
p23041
aVI paid £250 for a root canal.
p23042
aVIt's finding one (especially a competent one) which is hard.
p23043
aVI signed up to pretty much the only one that wasn't a one person band locally, had them put in a crown, and when it fell out less than a week later they didn't want to know about redoing it.
p23044
aVThus I'm pretty much buggered as there aren't really any alternative local options, and, technically, I don't think I'm even entitled to another check up for X months.
p23045
aVThat really sucks and I'm sorry.
p23046
aVI've been fortunate, that my dentist is very good.
p23047
aVI am glad that NHS dentists still exist (same goes for NHS opticians!
p23048
aV) and I agree the system is far from perfect.
p23049
aVWe should never take it for granted and be fighting for improvements as much as we can.
p23050
aVOh, likewise.
p23051
aVI've had excellent NHS dentists before now, but it's a postcode lottery and they're definitely running the service down.
p23052
aVOr go to France, for £25 you get check-up AND cleaning.
p23053
aVPrivately.
p23054
aVWith no insurance.
p23055
aVThe difference is that in the UK dentists are able to ask for extortionate prices.
p23056
aVI know a french deneist that comes to work to the UK 3 days a week and takes 4 days holidays back in France.
p23057
aVHe still makes more than dentists in France.
p23058
aVBut isn't that because of France's relatively high tax levels?
p23059
aVWouldn't the dentists still have pay a lot in taxes, or is overseas income not taxed in France?
p23060
aVOr do dentists simply not get paid as much as the UK dentists?
p23061
aVI tend to find that French people won't tolerate fucking-stupidly-high price levels, they are a lot better at expressing dissatisfaction than we are.
p23062
aVIf they're not happy with something, they stop using it, they protest or they go on strike.
p23063
aVHowever, this has the aftereffect of making them seem huffy and stuck-up, whereas we insist on politeness, meaning we never complain and just hand over the cash.
p23064
aVOh we complain plenty, always to the wrong people though.
p23065
aVlodging a complaint to the complaint department (while queuing) isn't quite as effective as setting the streets of Paris on fire if you don't get 5 months off a year.
p23066
aVSo you're saying we should be setting fire to Paris instead?
p23067
aVIt'll be just like old times.
p23068
aVAmerican here.
p23069
aVAre you saying you can get root canals done for $77 and this includes the price of the initial check up?
p23070
aVI have dental treatment with a dentist who treats NHS patients.
p23071
aVThey have tiers of payment depending on the amount and the complexity of the treatment you need.
p23072
aVfor £45 (I think?
p23073
aVIt appears to be slightly more now), I had a checkup, 5 fillings (Genetically bad teeth, I swear...) and one of those fillings ended up needing to be a root canal because it was too deep and the root started dying.
p23074
aV[From the NHS choices website:](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1781.aspx?CategoryID=74) \u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; There are three NHS charge bands:\u000aBand 1: £18.50 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice.
p23075
aVIf necessary, it also includes X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment.
p23076
aVBand 2: £50.50 covers all treatment covered by Band 1, plus additional treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth (extractions).
p23077
aVBand 3: £219 covers all treatment covered by Bands 1 and 2, plus more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges.
p23078
aVFuck me, just walking in to see my dentist costs me $25, then fillings are generally in the hundreds of dollars each.
p23079
aVI'm moving to the US for three years next week, I will be very sad to leave the dental, optical and healthcare I have here behind.
p23080
aVI plan on getting treatments/checkups on holidays back here!
p23081
aVUnfortunately unless you maintain UK residency you can't use NHS services.
p23082
aVCitizenship is not enough.. 
p23083
aVIm going to study, so I am still technically resident. 
p23084
aVIn that case I'm jealous!
p23085
aVStill getting over some sticker shock from a mundane health screening which wasn't fully covered by my insurance..
p23086
aVSome employers chuck dental insurance in.
p23087
aVI don't have to pay anything and I can get a fair amount of non-cosmetic treatment covered.
p23088
aVIf I paid some trivial amount toward it I'd get even more.
p23089
aVPlus private dental insurance isn't actually that expensive even if someone else isn't paying for it, if they're paying lots for checkups and work they must not be insured.
p23090
aVI've never used an NHS dentist because it was impossible to find one at the time and I don't really need to switch back now.
p23091
aVMy last checkup and cleaning was £18 total for a 10 minute appointment.
p23092
aVI suppose it helps living up north.
p23093
aVIt took only 10 minutes to clean your teeth? 
p23094
aVI suppose it depends how well you look after them yourself.
p23095
aVI had an appointment earlier this week.
p23096
aVI sat in the chair, he looked and said there were two spots that could do with a scrape, scraped them and I was out inside 5 minutes.
p23097
aVYep.
p23098
aVIf you get a good dentist who does regular cleanings then it doesn't take long.
p23099
aVI went in for a regular checkup, offered a quick cleaning to help reduce tartar, no extra cost. \u000a\u000a
p23100
aVAlso in the north.
p23101
aVMine's £16.
p23102
aVIn and out.
p23103
aVTeeth are good.
p23104
aVIn canada our dentistry isn't covered under OHIP (or whatever province you're in).
p23105
aVNot even a basic check up.
p23106
aVIts really quite sad considering mouth health is VERY important. 
p23107
aVWithout insurance, and with a kind dentist who was also a family friend, I ended up paying $100 for a small cavity filled.
p23108
aVThis didn't include the $60 x-ray though.
p23109
aVIt should have been much more.
p23110
aVThis is in the U.S.
p23111
aVIf in pain dial 111 (while it's still in operation)  they have to find an nhs dentist which is fairly nearby to you to get you out of pain.
p23112
aV£18.50 for a check up.
p23113
aV£50.50 for nhs silver fillings (white on the front)  and root canal or extraction .
p23114
aV£219 will get you a crown or a denture. 
p23115
aVMakes me want to cry - the cuts we've made.
p23116
aVI realise that an aging population and our relative decline in the world order means that we're not able to accomplish as much anymore, but I do question our spending priorities.
p23117
aVSome good had better come out of this bloody great aircraft carrier.
p23118
aVThe amount of money being spent on the new aircraft carrier compared to the amount of money were wasting in other places which are much less important is equivalent to dropping a 10p coin. 
p23119
aVYour perceived decline is not due to the lack of ability or global standing of your country, but due to the exploitation by those who have of those who have not.
p23120
aVA minor bump in taxes on the global super-rich who congregate in London would easily pay for whatever cuts may have been done to the NHS.
p23121
aV&gt; A minor bump in taxes\u000a\u000aDoesn't even need to be that, just the closing of loopholes that allow them to get away with not paying their prescribed share.
p23122
aVIf the government paid half as much attention to tackling this problem as they do file sharing, internet pornography or drug trafficking the country would be ticking along splendidly. 
p23123
aVBut then their rich friends would withdraw support and another politician would take their place..
p23124
aVViva la revolucion!
p23125
aVThe fear, I think, is that taxing the London super-rich will cause them to go elsewhere.
p23126
aVI think that fear is exaggerated, they're not all just going to leave one of the centres of global finance if we increase taxes by a bit more.
p23127
aVEven if the fears are right, it's either live in a poorer more equal society or continue to live in one with large inequalities, I know which one I'd rather.
p23128
aVIt's a ridiculous fear I think.
p23129
aVEither way, where I live is so removed from London (the City of London more so) that 1) people are clamoring for independence from Westminster rule and 2) no one gicea a damn where the super rich go; London or elsewhere. 
p23130
aVIt's also due to the rise of other parts of the world compared to Europe.
p23131
aVThat's OK.
p23132
aVThe global super rich who live in London don't have their money here.
p23133
aVMany of them aren't even UK citizens.
p23134
aVThere is no money for you to tax.
p23135
aVThe only possible thing you could tax would be property values greater than £5m or whatever, but it's unlikely you'd get much from it.  
p23136
aVLondon has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita of any city in the world.
p23137
aVThe amount of money they could squeeze out of them...\u000a\u000aAlso, hej ven!
p23138
aVGodt at se jeg ikke er den eneste Dansker her ;) 
p23139
aVIsn't that kind of assuming they don't congregate in London due to the tax rate there?
p23140
aVI dare say treatment is more expensive too now
p23141
aVTo be fair we got rid of dental and spectacles in 1950 it's not like it was recent and that was only because it was costing more than we had anticipated! 
p23142
aVI would much, much rather take the chance of being able to register for an NHS dentist today, than suffer the level of dental procedures offered back then.
p23143
aVMy gran had all her teeth pulled out at 25 years old and replaced with dentures!
p23144
aVThere wasn't even anything wrong with the health of her teeth, apparently. 
p23145
aVIt used to be a common thing to do, it saved having problems with them later.
p23146
aVI've even heard that people used to have this paid for as a wedding present. 
p23147
aVThat's silly though.
p23148
aVLike, I understand why the military and astronauts have their appendix preemptively pulled out, because that will kill you in a few days with no prior warning.
p23149
aVBut your teeth?  
p23150
aVTeeth cause you immense pain, issues, and expense down the line.
p23151
aVHumans aren't meant to live as long as we do, and teeth degrade fairly early on in current human lifespans.
p23152
aVReplacing them all with artificial teeth is an easy and effective solution to avoiding a lifetime of intermittent teething issues.
p23153
aVI guarantee in the future replacement of teeth with better designed, technologically superior artificial teeth will be the norm.
p23154
aVTeeth that don't chip or break, that have permanent resistance to bacteria etc.
p23155
aVI strongly believe full teeth replacement will be the future of dentistry.
p23156
aVWell taken care of teeth can and should easily last your entire life with the exception of some sort of trauma.
p23157

p23172
aVI don't think it's wise to normalise the fact that it's largely been privatised.
p23173
aVIt paves the way to making further privatisation in the NHS more culturally acceptable.
p23174
aVWe should remember that terrible decision, and remain angry at it.
p23175
aVIt's not as if dentistry has been recently privatised.
p23176
aVHas NHS dentistry ever not been performed by largely private contractors?
p23177
aVGPs have been pretty much the same since day one.
p23178
aVBesides, it's a bit different to pay small private groups to do the work, and paying a faceless organisation like Serco.
p23179
aVThe attitude of "the NHS way is always the best way" is exactly why it won't improve.
p23180
aVI didn't say I adhere to that attitude.

p23192
aVNot that I'm aware of!
p23193
aVBut they did give me rather a lot of titanium to rebuild my ankle, and I'm on my third (copper) IUD, so just in terms of scrap metal they've added value to me (being able to walk is a bonus!

aVJust so you know, Titanium has one of the highest Youngs' Modulus to density ratio with 110GPa:4.5gcm^(-3).
p23207
aVBasically, it's good stuff.
p23208
aVAnd I'll never forget that from my A-level Physics.
p23209
aVSo you like the IUD?
p23210
aVWhy three? 
p23211
aVIUDs have an expiry date, the copper one I think is good for ten years.
p23212
aVThey can also fall out occasionally if not fitted correctly or there's a gap in your cervix.
p23213
aVYou also need to get them taken out to have children, then presumably replaced again afterwards, so you'd go through a few in the normal course of things.
p23214
aVMy (hormonal) IUD is good for five years, free to me on prescription, and in the US costs about $500 USD.
p23215
aVAnd I'm going to get it taken out after just over a year so I can have another child, which would be considered extremely wasteful in the US (I didn't realise the cost of that device til I saw it mentioned on TwoX recently).
p23216
aVThen I'll probably get a series of them afterwards, right up to menopause, since it suits me.

aVThis is not a unique situation, almost all universal health systems in counties are facing these issues.

aVOf all the things that tax money goes towards, the NHS is unquestionably one of the most important, and despite the obsession with 'austerity' meaning reducing spending with no increase in taxes (which nobody has managed to sell to me convincingly), I don't understand why a tax increase at higher brackets and/or savings elsewhere in the budget shouldn't be used to put more money into the NHS.
p23226
aVIt's not as if it's impossible to get the money.
p23227
aVOr money could be moved from the military budget to the healthcare budget, benefiting the taxpayer and limiting the number of evil brown people that the government decides should be killed
p23228
aVWhy is the cost of care rising when the tax base is constant?
p23229
aVAre people going to the doctors more than they did a few years ago?
p23230
aVDid the price of medical supplies increase? 
p23231
aVBecause there are so many more treatment options available nowadays, and a lot of them are incredibly complex and therefore very expensive. 
p23232
aVHah.
p23233
aVWeasel word!
p23234
aV[deleted]
p23235
aVImproved technology means improved care, which means more people living then would have otherwise died, which means more people to treat.
p23236
aVI once heard that the standard NATO bullet was designed to maim, not kill, as it takes only one person to bury a body, but five people to care for an injured man.
p23237
aVThe idea is to make the enemies casualties a burden to them.
p23238
aVThe same principal applies here; the longer people live due to improvements in care, the greater resources we have to find to look after them.
p23239
aVThe solution is clamping down on benefit cheats.
p23240
aVMore money for the economy.
p23241
aVNothing pisses me off more than fat, lazy fuckers who claim job seekers but have never even written a CV.
p23242
aVSome people need help and I'm all for that.
p23243
aVBut I don't respect uneducated, selfish people who only take.
p23244
aVBenefit fraud is a drop in the ocean of tax avoidance. 
p23245
aVBenefit cheats cost the UK government maybe 2 or 3 billion, so I can see why you think how you do.
p23246
aVBut, think about the tax avoidance that Vodafone, Amazon and many other companies go through.
p23247
aVThat costs the UK Government maybe 10 or 15 billion.
p23248
aVSo we would be better off letting the cheats cheat, and simply collect the taxable income that is available to us.
p23249
aVjust print more money
p23250
aVLong live shirking of responsibilities by many of its members of staff and negligence on a larger scale than the general public know!
p23251
aVBut carry on jacking each other off. 
p23252
aVNobody claims the NHS is perfect, but I quite the fact that when my Dad had a heart attack 10 years ago, we didn't need to sell the house to pay for his treatment, like would have happened in the US.
p23253
aVThen there's the reduced price prescription medications that I, my fiance, and both my parents take on a daily basis that would cost us hundreds of pounds a month each in a US-style system and actually cost me nothing and the others £8 ish each per month.
p23254
aVOkay, so it let down my sister a little because it goesn't do well with gender identity disorder, and she had to go private, but I think saving my Dad's life and my fiance's life without bankrupting us is definitely a good thing.
p23255
aVAnd I've been in and out of hospital all year with electrocardio problems and I am thankful that I didn't have to pay for it.
p23256
aVHowever, this sub is ridiculous with the circlejerk over the NHS.
p23257
aVObviously everyone has their own anecdotes, but when you've been in the system as much as I have in my life, you see the inadequacies first hand. 
p23258
aVSaying "happy birthday" to it is hardly a circlejerk.
p23259
aVNo, but the circlejerk is brigading against anything negative.
p23260
aVBut fuck it, if some people think it doesn't need change then I hope you enjoy a privatised health service in a few decades because there are incompetent idiots are running it right now, despite them being incapable to organise a piss up in a brewery. 
p23261
aVYou're constructing a strawman.
p23262
aVNobody is saying the NHS is perfect or "doesn't need change" as you claim.
p23263
aVAnd the only negativity I've seen is yours - which was a straight out attack to begin with - if anything, an anti-NHS circle-jerk approach.
p23264
aVAnd I reiterate: saying "happy birthday" and "the NHS helped me and my family in this way" isn't circlejerk.
p23265
aV*If* people were claiming the NHS were perfect, that would be circle jerk.
p23266
aVThis is not.
p23267
aVI am going on previous conversations on this subreddit and the fact the anything negative is downvoted instantly.
p23268
aVMy missus is a doctor in a hospital, so I hear a lot of shitty stories from her trust, and I am sure it is the same across the country.
p23269
aVAnd I reiterate: it's amazing getting free healthcare, but any counter argument here is stifled, which is a fucking circlejerk.
p23270
aVI've seen no counter-argument, just negativity in a place where it isn't appropriate.
p23271
aVYou want counter-argument, make a thread for it called "let's talk about the problems in the NHS" and *discuss* it, because all it's been here is *attack* not discussion.
p23272
aVStill proud of the NHS, let's not let any current or future government continue to cannibalise it for political gain.

aVAll I know is that out of every Western country I've been in, the grubbiest, dirtiest, shittiest hospitals have been in the UK.
p23344

aVThe way the Commonwealth Fund report was compiled strikes me as very dubious.
p23360
aVThe methodology appendix hardly explains at all how they selected their interview sample.
p23361
aVThe only objective part of the report comes from WHO stats on good outcomes and healthy living which puts the UK at the bottom with the US.
p23362
aVThe Commonwealth Fund is a political organisation to promote insurance free healthcare but it would be quite wrong to suggest that they have massaged their sampling to confirm their bias.

aVWhile I have a big problem with your source being an article from some shit Tory rag (the Tele does not exactly hold the welfare state in high esteem), if we put that aside I think it can still be said that the least this article says is that it would be difficult to actually say what the best health service in the world is.
p23369
aVThe NHS is not perfect, but it is about the very best.
p23370
aVThe absolute best?
p23371
aV- possibly not, and I am sceptical about whether or not we can actually determine what it means for a health service to be the best in the world (very good, better than others, sure, but better than all others by its own merits or the faults of others?

aVMost Tories won't get rid of the NHS, look at the Lib Dems with Students' fees; it would be political suicide.

aVThe NHS just needs an overhaul and streamlining to provide the best service possible: However people are often scared that it will be completely "Privatised" and they will have to pay when this simply isn't the case.

aVAfter being profoundly deaf for 20years, the NHS fitted me with a cochlear implant.
p23474
aVThen two years later, upgraded it, involving a two surgeons, a speech therapist and several audiologists.
p23475
aVIt costs nothing.
p23476
aVI am now functionally hearing (albeit in one ear).
p23477
aVI can use the 'phone, listen to radio plays, and participate fully in everyday life.
p23478
aVIn other places, I'd still be trying to get by on fuzzy noises from the hearing aids I could afford (prfound deafness being a pre-existing condition, natch).
p23479
aVThankfully I live in a civilised society.
p23480
aVI've only ever had good treatment from the medical side of the NHS but, as someone who is currently an inpatient within a general adult psychiatric unit, the mental health side of things is god awful.
p23481
aVThanks for my insulin NHS. 
p23482
aVHappy Birthday, with love from a family who nearly lost a father and husband to cancer. 
p23483
aVThat bit at the end really got me 'Relieve your money worry in times of illness'.
p23484
aVAs a Canadian I just got teary eyed.
p23485
aVI am a US citizen and I am so jealous of the NHS.
p23486
aVTho we got Obamacare recently and things have become much better for our family (we can afford insurance now and check ups are cheap). 
p23487
aVThat's pretty sweet.
p23488
aVI assume your family already had a primary care physician(s)?
p23489
aVI'm having trouble finding one myself, though I've been put on Oregon's version of Medicaid, so that could have a lot to do with it.
p23490
aVAll the places I've called to schedule an appointment "cannot take any more patients at this time.
p23491
aV" Pretty strange, considering one of the points of it was to stop people from using the emergency room as their primary care.
p23492
aVAnyway, hope your experience turns out better!
p23493
aVActually we've never been able to afford healthcare, until Obamacare and its subsidies. 
p23494
aVYou know.. yesterday in America we celebrated freedom.
p23495
aVNow I wake up and see this.
p23496
aVWAY TO KILL MY BUZZ
p23497
aVI'm a Yank.
p23498
aVCan I be welcomed back into the warm busom of the Queen for free health care?
p23499
aVDepends are you going to pay your Tea taxes this time?
p23500
aVAs long as I don't have to pay 241 years of back interest, I guess so.
p23501
aV:(
p23502
aVPlace your guns at the door and we'd be happy to let you in
p23503
aVWell, that's easy!
p23504
aVI don't own any. 
p23505
aVPerfect now you must drink tea everyday and you're officially British.
p23506
aVWhen do i get the complimentary accent and biscuits?
p23507
aVI do enjoy a nice Earl Grey every now and then.
p23508
aVwith or without milk and lemon?\u000a
p23509
aVMilk and a bit of sugar, please. 
p23510
aVWhy do people think this is free healthcare?
p23511
aVIt's quite obviously tax funded.  
p23512
aVQuite obvious because it's mentioned in the article!
p23513
aV:) One might use the term "free" because its cost to the individual can be quite a bit less than in a privatized system.
p23514
aVIt's free in the same way as using the roads is free.
p23515
aVOf course they're tax funded, but you don't even think about the cost in your day to day life.
p23516
aVIt's just there and does it's job and you can use it whenever you need to.
p23517
aVYou grumble about the potholes, or the occasional closed road, but that's it.
p23518
aVAnd when you're at your worst, sick and broken all you need to concern yourself with is getting better.
p23519
aV'Free at the point of service'
p23520
aVIt's free in the sense that a lot of it is funded by the top 10% of taxpayers, meaning the majority of people will get more out of it than they put in. 
p23521
aVCompared to Obamacare, it's basically free.
p23522
aVI left the military recently, and my health care costs were $26 USD/month.
p23523
aVWith this Obamacare at its cheapest for me, is $280/month.
p23524
aVAnd that's a bare bones package. 
p23525
aVNow let's hear what your costs would have been after leaving the military BEFORE Obamacare.
p23526
aVHappy birthday, really appreciate the 6 free metal screws and a plate in my leg
p23527
aVI love the NHS, this almost brought a tear to my eye. 
p23528
aVYou lucky bastards.
p23529
aVThough you did elect Cameron, so I guess we'll call it even.  
p23530
aVAlong with our BBC: amazing.
p23531
aVThe NHS deserves more funding.
p23532
aVSpoils of war done right. 
p23533
aVWith my disabilities, I'm glad I was born here.
p23534
aVHappy birthday NHS.
p23535
aVSuch a shame that by WHO standards you are already privatised.
p23536
aVSuch a Shame that we have a liar of a prime minister who told us the NHS is safe in his hands.
p23537
aVA man that despite our health system being one of the best value health care systems the man states the systems is unsustainable.
p23538
aVAl lies.
p23539
aVWe have a government that is an asset stripping parasite.
p23540
aVwho see the juicy cancer contracts that their mates can profit from.
p23541
aVBut you wont see these companies taking up the less profitable areas, the is no money in it.
p23542
aVWhat we are going to end up with is a patchwork health system that is dictated by private profits.
p23543
aVIts already happening.
p23544
aVTrusts are being driven to the wall by interest on ppi projects.
p23545
aVAnother lie sold to us back in the day.
p23546
aVNEw contracts being entered in to by the people running the service are so punative that should we ever decide to try and find a better deal the penalties again would risk the existence of the service.
p23547
aVWhat we have here is a corporate fascist arrangement that will ensure that our beloved NHS will pay in to the cartel of health care vultures until it collapses and that will be it.
p23548
aVThey will walk away with their pockets bulging.
p23549
aVlike many other government contractors of IT systems schools hospital and other services.
p23550
aVIt not so much Happy birthday NHS as RIP NHS.
p23551
aVAnd if the Trans-Pacific Partnership proceeds sovereignty its self will become the global corporates bitch.
p23552
aVWe will not be able to have our own say as a country as to what deals we do as it will lay us open to being sued by corporations.
p23553
aVWe are being lied to by a bunch of criminals paedophiles and socio-paths.
p23554
aVOur government with out mandate.
p23555
aVSay what you like about the NHS but it's bloody miraculous.
p23556
aVSaved my sister's life on countless occasions. 
p23557
aV[deleted]
p23558
aV&gt; How long are waiting periods in UK for seeing a neurologist?
p23559
aVDepends entirely on the severity of your condition. 
p23560
aV[deleted]
p23561
aVYou can for private care in the UK if you wish.
p23562
aVThat generally means you get to see a consultant straight away. 
p23563
aVNo.
p23564
aVThe NHS is based on the idea of "triage".
p23565
aVBasically, instead of providing aid to whoever has the most money, or whoever asked for aid first, the NHS takes care of those who need it first.
p23566
aVSo if you're bleeding out your anus and need immediate medical attention, you'll get it.
p23567
aVOn the other hand, if you need a liver transplant in a few years' time, you won't be given immediate priority.
p23568
aVIt's quite fantastic. 
p23569
aVJust a slight correction, but triage does not extend beyond your local accident and emergency department.
p23570
aVFor non-emergency treatment the NHS uses Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to measure the value of a given medical treatment.
p23571
aVThis essentially boils down to a quasi-utilitarian cost-benefit analysis of any given treatment.
p23572
aVSay you have a patient aged 58 with abdominal peritonitis.
p23573
aVTreating her would give her 15 more years of life, which for a healthy person would give them 15 QALYS.
p23574
aVThis patient, however, has an unrelated critical illness that significantly impacts the quality of her life, so each year of her life is only worth 0.6 QALYs.
p23575
aVThe treatment would provide her with 9 QALYs at a cost for the operation of £147,000, or a cost per QALY gained ratio of £16,333/QALY.
p23576
aVAnother patient is a male aged 26 with a particularly unusual congenital heart defect.
p23577
aVTreating the defect would give him another 50 years of perfect health, so it's worth 50 QALYs.
p23578
aVHowever, the treatment costs £250,000, yielding cost per QALY gained of £5,000/QALY.
p23579
aVThe NHS would prioritise this treatment over the 58 year old's.
p23580
aVAdvocates of the QALY contend that it's the most effective method of allocating limited resources in a way that maximises their benefit and utility to society.
p23581
aVOpponents of the QALY contend that assigning lower priority to the elderly or unfit is ageist and ableist, and that it's unfair that the elderly who have paid into the system for their whole lives are given lower priority than others.
p23582
aVThe NHS have been accused of chasing "easy QALY wins" and concentrating it's funding on easily treatable and common conditions for otherwise perfectly healthy persons to inflate performance figures.
p23583
aVA great explanation of QALY.
p23584
aVI get people's opposition of ageism and ableism, but I don't see a serious alternative rather than pure cost analysis.
p23585
aVAre they really saying that a 75 year old should get the same share of limited resources as a 25 year old?
p23586
aVI'd like to think that if I were 75 I would see the reasoning behind letting a younger person in front of the queue. 
p23587
aVWhile your explanation is generally correct, using peritonitis as an example to explain the use of QALYs in non-emergency treatment is not as helpful since that **is** an emergency.
p23588
aV&gt;It's quite fantastic.
p23589
aVEspecially when you've been in the A&amp;E waiting room for 4+ hours :(
p23590
aVYou lucky person.
p23591
aVYou must have been pretty well.
p23592
aVIf the hospitals had enough free beds for people to be sent out of A&amp;E it would certainly reduce the waiting time.
p23593
aVIf patients realised that a cough that's been going on for 2 weeks is neither an Accident nor an Emergency, then your waiting time might also reduce.
p23594
aVThat's all I ever think when I see or read stories about the strains GP surgeries are under.
p23595
aVAnd when I hear from friends of their experiences going to the doctors for minor things I personally would just sit out with, I can see why.
p23596
aVI'd like to see everyone in the country presented with a "bill" each tax year, to show the cost/value of the public services they've used for the year.
p23597
aVI think it would help people to understand where they may be over using the system, but also to understand how much value for money they're getting.
p23598
aVOf course, it might cause some people to think "I pay all that tax, and I didn't use anything!
p23599
aV", but I think the benefits would outweigh that.
p23600
aVJudging from the track record of government computer systems that would be close to a pipe dream. 
p23601
aVThat's how the ER works in the US too.
p23602
aVIt's called triage.
p23603
aVYou attend to the sickest person first, not on a "first come, first serve" basis.
p23604
aVSource: did my housemanship in Britain before coming to the US.
p23605
aVI think they use a similar procedure in emergency situations, sorting casualties into different groups.
p23606
aVFuck that.
p23607
aVMy dad would have died waiting for his liver over there.
p23608
aVThank god for private healthcare.  
p23609
aVWell, no.
p23610
aVIf he needed a liver immediately, he would've been placed at the top of the list.
p23611
aVAnd it wouldn't cost a single pound.\u000a
p23612
aVI dunno.
p23613
aVIt's looking pretty grim over there right now from what I can find.
p23614
aVOur Dr specifically told us that the UK and Canadian models would have failed us due to many variables.
p23615
aV"Leading health experts warned yesterday that Britain is heading towards a national "tragedy" where more people than ever will die waiting for organs"\u000a\u000a"The waiting list doesn't include the people who've been turned away and told there's never a chance you'd get it because there are other people who'd benefit more.
p23616
aV"\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/tragedy-of-britains-organ-transplant-patients-8488397.html\u000a
p23617
aVThe problems with organ transplant are solely due to lack of supply.
p23618
aVThe method of funding the health system doesn't come into it at all.
p23619
aVWhich is what I initially said.
p23620
aVMy dad would have died waiting.
p23621
aVThe United States, however, leads the world in actual transplant rates, which Dr. Tom Mone, a past president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, says means doctors can use more of the organs they harvest.
p23622
aV"It's fair to say we're doing as well or better than anyone else," said Mone, who is now the CEO of One Legacy, a nonprofit organization focused on organ donation.
p23623
aV"But we have such a large number of people and a very good chronic care system, so they can wait longer as the waiting list grows.
p23624
aV"\u000ahttp://abcnews.go.com/Health/organ-donation-rates-us-stacks/story?id=19437070
p23625
aVOrgan donation, as the name suggests, is due to people donating organs, it isn't anything to do with the NHS.
p23626
aVIf we went for people having to opt out instead of opting in it would improve things considerably. 
p23627
aVWith respect, how often do you see medical professionals during periods when you're being afflicted by your condition?
p23628
aVI would have expected that management of such a case would not involve seeing a doctor whenever you had an episode, but I do not know much about management of cluster headaches so I could be totally wrong.
p23629
aVIn any case, as Travisdk said, the notion of triage is employed.
p23630
aVNurses are not ignorant of the severity of cluster headaches and would certainly take your pain into consideration in determining the patients most in need of immediate medical attention.
p23631
aVIt is as simple as that.
p23632
aVI am not a nurse, but I would imagine that the management of cluster headaches is a matter of pain relief, while labour pains could imply delivery and the difficulties associated.
p23633
aV[deleted]
p23634
aVSumatriptan injections?
p23635
aV[deleted]
p23636
aVHere patients would be given an injectable form of sumatriptan (which has evidence backing it in the treatment of cluster headaches) that they can administer themselves at home.
p23637
aVThere would be no need to have a neurologist on speed dial.
p23638
aVIn the highly unlikely event that this wasn't effective they would be referred to a pain team that would provide support.
p23639
aVI see.
p23640
aVI was under the impression that management involved self-administered strong painkillers; thanks for explaining the case as it really is.
p23641
aVI do not know where you live, but I have not found in my experience (I live in Australia and use the public health system) that nurses are without empathy.
p23642
aVCould it be that you could find a better standard of service elsewhere?
p23643
aV- anyway, I will not go into that kind of thing just because I am sure you are managing that yourself and in any case have a much better understanding of your own situation; it is not like I could provide any helpful advice on this.
p23644
aVIt might sound rich for me to say because I do not suffer from cluster headaches and have not perceived that kind of pain before, but I do not think that they are deserving of hate for that reason - it is at the very least useless to expend your energy on hating people that are attempting to do a job that is good in itself (whether they are doing it well is another matter, but if they are not then that deserves something other than hate).
p23645
aVAnyway, triage does involve an assessment that goes beyond the visual perception of physical pain by a nurse or doctor.
p23646
aVHowever, it is certainly possible that the improper treatment of people who have not been diagnosed with this condition is a flaw with the system - as others have said, the NHS is incredible but imperfect - and if it is the case that cases like yours go undiagnosed then that is something that should absolutely be rectified.
p23647
aVWith that being said though, I think that the basis of the NHS, which is free healthcare at the point of use, does not conflict with your needs - there is nothing about the NHS that necessitates waiting periods but insufficient funding from mostly Tory but some Labour governments (and even that does not necessitate waiting periods, just more stringent management being necessary to mitigate waiting periods); waiting periods are not synonymous with public healthcare.
p23648
aVI think there was a post on /r/videos that was popular a few months ago showing a woman going through such an attack.
p23649
aVSeems bloody awful.
p23650
aVI'm sorry.
p23651
aV[deleted]
p23652
aVYou can also pay privately for a consultant appointment if you think is urgent but, for whatever  reason, your GP disagrees.
p23653
aVCosts around $100 for a private consultation and you can then get the nhs to pay for what he recommends (with some exceptions). 
p23654
aVIt's doubtful, but is anyone old enough to remember it being brought in?
p23655
aVWhat was the public's reaction?
p23656
aVHarry Leslie Smith does.
p23657
aV[And he's not happy](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/04/coalition-attacks-nhs-return-britain-age-workhouse)
p23658
aVWish them happy birthday now till it becomes privatised and we turn into America with sky rocketing prices for it.
p23659
aVThanks for removing all my wisdom teeth for free. 
p23660
aVAnd the Torys are still trying to fuck it up
p23661
aV[](http://imgur.com/zKs3f8E)\u000aI'm proud of the NHS, overtaken as it has become by politics and bean counters, and when I started out in it I had a youthful ideal of doing good for a great organisation and no thought of money or private practice.
p23662
aVAs a side note, anaesthesia in GB, medicine's secret service, founded it's own association to guide practice 16 years before the NHS was set up.  
p23663
aVfuck it makes me proud to be British. 
p23664
aVIts a Shame how our right wing politicians only see money here in America.
p23665
aVSome demo's too.
p23666
aVHopefully Ill bring my fat American hamburger ass to the UK.
p23667
aVBut let me ask, we hear plenty about America on reddit.
p23668
aVWhat does the UK complain about?
p23669
aVWhats good about over here and bad over there?
p23670
aVI never got to travel much.
p23671
aVId like to visit there sometime.
p23672
aVWe complain about everything, moaning is the national pastime.
p23673
aVJust a word of caution, don't try and join in unless you want to be inundated with a barrage of pithy, wry put downs.
p23674
aVPersonally I wouldn't want to live in America as it is right now simply because I have excellent legal protections as a homo in the UK, I wouldn't feel very safe in most of the states.
p23675
aVBut the things America has better; space, England is small and very densely populated.
p23676
aVMoney, there's just a lot more of it in America which is good if you want to run a business I think (at least in my experience selling to the US.
p23677
aV) Also I prefer America's attitude to freedom of speech, I wouldn't go so far as to say we have heavy censorship here but I have perceived a little bit of a squeeze over the past decade.
p23678
aVTo visit, the UK is great though, come on over!
p23679
aVAw man don't let the internet perception of us stop you from visiting.
p23680
aVWe're not a third world country, you won't be attacked for being gay or even insulted.
p23681
aVHe'll if someone does insult you they will in turn be insulted by every one around them, even in the south.
p23682
aVDon't let internet superstition scare you from something you wanna do.
p23683
aVIf that was the case I would never visit the UK for fear of da mooslims.
p23684
aVI was talking more about living rather than visiting, when I said 'safe' I was talking about the kind of precarious economic situations some gay people are put in in many US states due to lack of legal protections, things that I just would never have to deal with here.
p23685
aVI would *love* to visit America though and stuff myself with some delicious foods.
p23686
aVYeah I'm confused by the legal protections thing, we don't limit you in any way for being gay except for marriage. 
p23687
aVI think someone else posted a link but there are some really useful anti-discrimination laws that protect me in the UK that I wouldn't have everywhere in the US.
p23688
aVI only know about it because sometimes American users on some of the gay subreddits talk about how they daren't be open at work for fear of being fired.
p23689
aVMaybe it's not something that would actually realistically happen to them, but I feel more comfortable knowing that UK law protects me against this.
p23690
aVThere are certainly "at will" states, where you can be fired without giving any reason.
p23691
aVSo you couldn't legally be fired for being gay, but you COULD be fired for "wearing brown shoes".
p23692
aVI don't know about any other discriminatory laws they have in the US, but I've heard about at will.
p23693
aVEh, I'm not gay so I wouldn't know personally.
p23694
aVAnd I know a lot of (admittedly flamboyant) gay people who can get away with more because there gay.
p23695
aVBut I don't know every state law and if you're comfortable in the UK I can't take that away from you.
p23696
aVGood luck than.
p23697
aVBrit who has been to America many times, can confirm.
p23698
aVVery welcoming warm people
p23699
aVThe whole anti gay movement here is pretty much religions last stand with politics.
p23700
aVOnce we vote these old cronies out.
p23701
aVAnd REMOVE the old way of thinking.
p23702
aV(Which will take 20-30 years if not more.
p23703
aV) Things will get better.
p23704
aVIts like the Micheal Bay hate train.
p23705
aVThe movies are still good.
p23706
aVIts just easy to hate on him.
p23707
aVThey just use the bible to fall back on if they are called out as a biggot.
p23708
aVThe whole freedom of speech thing just allows people like /u/sarstan to run their mouth.
p23709
aVAnd give "facts" as he likes to call them from biased websites and articles.
p23710
aVI will make my way over sometime in the future.
p23711
aVCant wait till I get to travel.
p23712
aVBut first I have to make my way out of this close-minded town called Bakersfield.
p23713
aVHAHA.
p23714
aV&gt; What does the UK complain about?
p23715
aVIronically, the NHS :P
p23716
aVUk complains about immigration.
p23717
aVThere is (possibly justified) concern about Muslim extremists trying to infiltrate various things.
p23718
aVThe usual low level grumbling about corporate and media influence.
p23719
aVThe wage gap.
p23720
aVWe do not seem to have anywhere near the problems USA has with the buying of the legislature by corporate bodies though.
p23721
aVWe are all concerned about the NHS to an extent, although this is also affected by the immigration debate.
p23722
aVEurope is a big issue and also the perception that we are losing influence on the world stage.\u000a
p23723
aVMaybe its because other world problems are over shadowing yours.
p23724
aVKind of like, When you do something right people wont notice you've done anything at all.
p23725
aVAnd a seemingly endless wave of once great TV and Radio personalities being hauled off to jail for sex crimes.
p23726
aVIan Watkins, Jimmy Saville, Rolf Harris and Max Clifford to name some.
p23727
aV&gt; Its a Shame how our right wing politicians only see money here in America.
p23728
aVSome demo's too.
p23729
aVPlenty of countries use private health insurance without being accused of being full of greedy bastards.
p23730
aVWhat makes America different is that we have worked out a "compromise" that has created the worst possible combination of private and public.\u000a\u000a
p23731
aVPretty much comes down to the whole employer chooses your benefits type of thing.
p23732
aVAnd you have to abide by it.
p23733
aVCOUGH *hobby lobby* COUGH.\u000a\u000a
p23734
aVExactly.
p23735
aVThis kind of bullshit is caused by entrusting corporations with their employees' health care.
p23736
aVWho wanted this?
p23737
aV?
aV&gt; Hopefully Ill bring my fat American hamburger ass to the UK.
p23738
aV&gt; \u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; But let me ask, we hear plenty about America on reddit.
p23739
aVWhat does the UK complain about?
p23740
aVimmigrants, mostly...
p23741
aVthings we complain about include: bad tea, the weather, people try to talk to you in public, tourists, and football
p23742
aVThe weather! 
p23743
aVPersonally I really can't think of much that America has that's missing or worse in the UK.
p23744
aVI envy the vast size of their country, which means bigger houses, more variety in climate, bigger and more varied wild/open spaces, and cheap food.
p23745
aVAnd on its 67th year can we as a nation start to behave like adults, accept that no players in the political discourse of this nation actually want to get rid of it and stop with the partisan hackery every time any party suggests reform and judge that proposal on its merits alone?
p23746
aVIt's pretty much already gone, a lot of the NHS remains are just branding and being readied for sale.
p23747
aVWe were going to do this in America, but the cost of those leaflets were deemed too much of a burden on the taxpayers.
p23748
aVI've been in America for 15 years now, I miss the NHS.
p23749
aVEven with waiting for care, expensive prescriptions and all the other crap, it's still miles better than anything in America.
p23750
aVOh good, so we're (the US) only 66 years behind.
p23751
aVI moved to Australia 3 years ago.
p23752
aVOh how I miss this beautiful thing
p23753
aVIt looks so simple.
p23754
aVI got I.T.P a few years ago, not too serious a condition but it effects the blood so I've had to go in to hospital a fair bit for tests and treatment over the last 18 months or so.
p23755
aVThe staff at the NHS Hospital are unbelievably good, kind natured people who always seem extremely tired and over worked.
p23756
aVI would of been absolutely fucked had it not been for our free health service and I'm massively thankful for the care I've received.
p23757
aVI'm moving to Canada in September and it will be a real shock having to pay for this kind of stuff! 
p23758
aVIt's a system immediately glad to have absolutely even though I've rarely been in a doctors or a hospital but the few times I have were for some serious issues.
p23759
aVIssues that would of cost thousands privately.
p23760
aVPeople may complain about the NHS but it's good to know it's there.
p23761
aVAn organisation the size of the NHS is bound to have issues. 
p23762
aVBBC Archive: [Birth of the National Health Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/nhs/).
p23763
aVOnly 66.
p23764
aVFor some reason I thought it was much older. 
p23765
aVAmerican here: Damn, I'm jealous.
p23766
aV:/
p23767
aV3 cheers for free medical care.
p23768
aVIt's worth noting that the only reason we were able to afford this is because America gave us a shit tonne of money after we sent Keynes over to get us some aid.
p23769
aVThanks America!
p23770
aVAmerica day was yesterday, you can stop pretending to like them now. 
p23771
aVOh hey, I just get a kick out of the fact they paid for our NHS but refuse to pay for their own.
p23772
aVAlso a ton of profit from winning WW2 
p23773
aVThe war actually put Britain in a lot of debt, we didn't profit from WW2 at all, if my\u000amemory serves me right.
p23774
aVWe mostly just got a lot of aid from America.
p23775
aVWe tried to avoid pushing massive reparations on Germany again, and focused on rebuilding what we were put under control of, rather than stealing what they produced.
p23776
aVRussia stole whole factories from what they invaded of Germany which is one reason that East Germany was so fucked.
p23777
aVBut America dished out wads of cash to all the Allied countries an various other countries in Europe to try and increase American influence and capitalism, as well as make them more stable economically so that they were less likely to fall into communism.
p23778
aVPretty much the entire reason Western Europe is so well of is that we had American aid backing us up.
p23779
aVSay what you will about their intentions, argue over who 'won' the war, there's absolutely no arguing we owe America a lot of thanks for what they did after the war.
p23780
aVThat's exactly what they wanted of course, and it paid off, they still have our political friendship after all.
p23781
aVI realise I've gone off on a tangent here, you could know all this stuff and probably more, but maybe you or someone else doesn't and they find it interesting.
p23782
aVPlease, if I have anything wrong, correct me.
p23783
aVI'm a God-fearing Englishman, and I'm God-damn proud of my government. 
p23784
aVYet you just broke one of the commandments, well done.
p23785
aVIf you're talking about the "Taking his name in vain" one, IIRC that has less to do with "God damn", and more to do with putting words into God's mouth and using his name as a beatstick with your own opinion wrapped around it. 
p23786
aVSounds like he's quoting Lewis Prothero from Alan Moore's V for Vendetta.
p23787
aV&gt;I'm God-damn proud of my government.
p23788
aVWhy?
p23789
aVThe current one is trying to sell it off.
p23790
aVOur nation's finest moment.
p23791
aVKeep it up!
p23792
aVI want this.
p23793
aVIts stretched as thin as it can be with all the budget cuts, but its an invaluable service.
p23794
aVMy wife would, in all likelihood, not be here today if it wasn't for the NHS.
p23795
aVShe has had extensive work on her heart (2 valve replacements and a stent for an aortic aneurysm).
p23796
aVAll at no cost (apart from taxes of course).
p23797
aVI can only imagine what something like that would cost privately.
p23798
aVAnd I give it another decade until it implodes
p23799
aVImplodes?
p23800
aVNo, that assumes internal problems, it'll be torn apart by government vultures and sensible people won't let that happen, we do **not** want to drop to the level of the US.
p23801
aV[deleted]
p23802
aVThe quality of UK healthcare is higher.
p23803
aVMedicine isn't the only part of **healthcare**.
p23804
aV[deleted]
p23805
aV&gt; I'd prefer to purchase insurance and receive healthcare in the United States then be at the mercy of the NHS.
p23806
aVIf you're a stupid cunt and don't buy insurance then that's your fucking problem.
p23807
aVEver heard of social responsibility?
p23808
aVOh, no, you're a selfish sack of shit, you've already pointed that out.
p23809
aVAlso, you know that not everyone can *afford* insurance right?
p23810
aVOh wait, they're just not working hard enough are they?
p23811
aVPoor people should just get less poor amirite?
p23812
aV[deleted]
p23813
aVAnd yet..\u000a\u000ahttp://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148#.
p23814
aVSo much for affordability. 
p23815
aVHAHA, "assumes internal problems".
p23816
aVYou have no fucking idea do you?
p23817
aVThe Government aren't the only bad guy that will make the NHS fail.
p23818
aVDon't let your Guardian copy fool you.
p23819
aV&gt;  You have no fucking idea do you?
p23820
aVI'm open to learning.
p23821
aV&gt; The Government aren't the only bad guy that will make the NHS fail.
p23822
aVForeign and internal private health corporations with agendas are also a huge issue, as well as poorly managed contracting, increasing privatisation and inefficiencies that need to be solved rather than being cut.
p23823
aV&gt; Don't let your Guardian copy fool you.
p23824
aVLet's not start with the silly tribalism now shall we.
p23825
aVI haven't read the guardian in nearly 8 years.
p23826
aV&gt; It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care\u000a\u000aWell, 1 out of 3 aint bad...
p23827
aVWe still get some dental help and if you're poor or at high risk (IIRC) you get dental care free.
p23828
aVNursings still there for most people and you get nursing aid in hospices and hospitals.
p23829
aV&gt; all
p23830
aVSAVE THE NHS. 
p23831
aVFor all the NHS's faults (private purchases of medical equipment, GPs raking in up and indeed over one million quid per year, the hospital death panels that put poor people as young as 30 on the LCP, the drug companies who pay for human experimentation and our doctors who knowingly give you untested drugs purely to see the results, the fact that the biggest killer in the country is death in hospitals from misdiagnosed illness, followed by death directly caused by correct treatment (go and look up the stats for yourself), in fact GPs are the number one cause of death).
p23832
aVAfter all that mess, I still wouldn't want anything else, we now live in the safest country to have a car accident, paramedic training is brilliant, consultants and other specialists are great.
p23833
aVMy brother is very, very senior in the health service and he always tells people to avoid their GP.
p23834
aVIf you think you have something wrong with you go to a hospital, do not visit your GP.
p23835
aVAlso, never under any circumstances take anything other than pain killers or anti biotics prescribed by your GP.
p23836
aVGPs are NOT medical experts, they are General Practitioners - in the medical world they are the equivalent of one of the shop assistants who work in Curry's, they know just enough, but don't let them open up your computer and try to reprogram the hardware.
p23837
aVAfter some of the stuff I have flung at my GPs, I reckon a million quid a year is a bargain.
p23838
aVDoctors McKenzie and Finlay, I salute you.
p23839
aVI am only alive today because of you.
p23840
aVHow do you 'Muricans feel about this?
p23841
aVSeeing as how American reddit user are mostly left wing to a certain extent, I bet most of them are jealous.
p23842
aVI however am a right wing American so I am happy to not have an English quality healthcare system.
p23843
aVQuite right - it is not a charity and we are all paying for it.
p23844
aVIt's a shame that some people seem to forget that.
p23845
aVoh don't worry the daily mail will remind us,... well daily.
p23846
aVI hate my taxes going towards medical help for those in my society who wouldn't be able to afford it.
p23847
aVYeah, what a bunch of bastards.
p23848
aVBeing ill &amp; not rich.
p23849
aV&gt; it is not a charity and we are all paying for it.
p23850
aVMost people already know this.
p23851
aVWhat they mean when they say "free" is "not getting brutally dildoed by ridiculous medical fees as soon as the ambulance turns on to your street".
p23852
aVI don't know of anyone who forgets that. 
p23853
aVThe only people who take "free healthcare" to be anything other than convenient shorthand for "healthcare that is free at point of use" are those looking for strawmen to fight.
p23854
aVEveryone knows it's not literally free.
p23855
aVI find the NHS care appalling and am not sure it's anything to be celebrated. 
p23856
aVHaha...ha...freedom...
p23857
aV[deleted]
p23858
aVThe number of immigrants in this country and their benefit or burden to the UK economy has nothing to do with their religion.
p23859
aVI'd wager a smaller percentage of Muslim immigrants live on benefits than that of 'native' Britons. 
p23860
aV[deleted]
p23861
aVGood job sourcing the BNP.
p23862
aVIs there an ordinance in the holy Koran to move to foreign countries and drain them dry?
p23863
aVThe few muslims I know are the nicest people and I just don't know what part of their faith says "go over there and take everything".  
p23864
aV[deleted]
p23865
aVYou're linking to the bnp site as if it's a *source*?
p23866
aVDon't be so ridiculous.
p23867
aVJust because they can find a 2 year video wirh no context that has someone saying it, doesn't make it true.
p23868
aVHere - have a read of a much more nuanced article that has data and numbers and actual maths in it - www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25880373
p23869
aVLinking the BNP as a credible source- that's even worse than using the Daily Mail for facts.
p23870
aVSo, 5 months later than in my country.
p23871
aV66 years of miserable failure.
p23872
aVBahahaha.
p23873
aVSure.

p23875
aV&gt;the guardian\u000a\u000aget a load of this guy
p23876
aVGet a load of this guy, he doesn't even bother to open the article to find out that the Guardian isn't the source.
p23877
aV&gt;Study by Washington-based foundation \u000a\u000aGood job, mate.
p23878
aVYou cocked up.
p23879
aVSure the NHS has done very little good for me, messing up a few times.
p23880
aVBut then I see how many other people it has helped, and them messing up a few times on minor things is more than made up by someone not being slapped with 6 figure sums of money just because they were selfish enough to get cancer.
p23881
aVThe NHS is great for people who don't know any better, Stop pretending it's the best system in the world.
p23882
aVI have relatives in France and they're appalled by the waiting times I have to endure in the UK.
p23883
aVIn France, for a routine procedure that normally takes 2 to 3 weeks from the doctor's appointment to the hospital procedure itself, I had to wait 1 WHOLE YEAR in the UK and go to 4 different hospitals.
p23884
aVMy file even got lost, I had to help the doctor look for it in his archives room!
p23885
aVAs for the GP I never get to see the same twice, they have no clue and they can't prescribe ANYTHING stronger than aspirine without having to send you first to see all kind of specialists.
p23886
aVWhen I was in France the GP had the authority and common sense to prescribe anything he deemed necessary. 
p23887
aVThat sounds nothing like my experience with the NHS.
p23888
aVI can visit my personal favourite GP several times a month, on the very same day if it's an emergency.
p23889
aVIf he's not available, I can pick from several others who are just as qualified.
p23890
aVAnd he's prescribed me very strong antibiotics among other things without referring me to a single other person.
p23891
aVI've been in and out within five minutes in some cases.
p23892
aVNothing like forcing people to pay for something.
p23893
aVWhat are you trying to say?
p23894
aVThat socialism = communism?
p23895
aVDoesn't matter, already down voted to oblivion by the folks that don't have to pay, but still have the "rights" to receive. 
p23896
aVSo are you American?
p23897
aVOr are you from England, expressing your dislike of the immigrants and benefit claimers that use the system?
p23898
aVOf course he's American.
p23899
aVIn what way does the NHS provide more value...
p23900
aVIn caring for the most vulnerable members of our society or by pissing you off?
p23901
aVI'm not even sure.
p23902
aVYou know, you wouldn't be saying that if you knew someone who was in need of medical help, or it was you. 
p23903
aVThis fear tactic is such bullshit.
p23904
aVIt's like saying, Nobody wouldn't be against gun ownership while they're having their home invaded. 
p23905
aVStay in America then if you don't like it
p23906
aVWhat are you, American?
p23907
aVNah, this is for others who do not know "The queue".
p23908
aVWe have an innate queuing ability.
p23909
aVAh, it's cultural a guide for Johnny Foreigner.
p23910
aVYes, quite.
p23911
aVWhich, if anything, is even more British.
p23912
aVIt's a condescending leaflet for foreign people.
p23913
aVStick a castle on it and we're done.
p23914
aVDoes the castle have a gift shop selling useless tat?
p23915
aVThis is an important question.
p23916
aVPrinted in REALLY LOUD ENGLISH.
p23917
aVWho needs Google translate when you can just use caps.
p23918
aV[Google Translate for Brits](http://imgur.com/ts1guVh).

aVRemarkable.
p23920
aVIn 'Murica this behavior is unremarkable.

p23923
aV!
aVMy parents are over from Germany; this guy from Inverness was talking to them for ages really slowly and clearly today.
p23924
aVThey didn't understand a word, but I thought it sounded very nice.
p23925
aVSurely, therefore, it should read, "Standing in line". 
p23926
aVLook at that nincompoop sitting down comfortably whilst we secure the premiere queuing positions!
p23927
aVIndeed, only those bloody foreigners need these guidelines. 
p23928
aVHey!
p23929
aVNot *all* foreigners.
p23930
aVCanadians also innately know how to queue.
p23931
aVIt must be somehow related to having the Queen on one's money.
p23932
aV"Any violation of these guidelines will resulting in tutting.
p23933
aV" 
p23934
aVAnd an ever so small frown in your general direction.
p23935
aVJust a mere down-movement of the eyebrows, mind you, nothing excessive of course. 
p23936
aVBut, god forbid, the miss-queuing-offender seeing you do this frown.
p23937
aVOtherwise, you yourself will be subjected to severe tutting. 
p23938
aVUnless some bold person who has had three or possibly four cups of Pimms musters up the courage to say "excuse me".
p23939
aVThen shit is going to hit the fan. 
p23940
aVAs a Canadian we'd just keep saying sorry for someone else butting in line.
p23941
aVThat's why you all had to go

p23957
aVreddit unfortunately isn't designed for queuing text.
p23958
aVit's because it's American 
p23959
aVEach comment is voted, and the comment judged to be best is hustled to the top, and comments without the natural ability to shine drop to the gutter and are forgotten.
p23960
aVIn theory, rewarding excellence but in practice largely giving the limelight and the spoils to those who know how to game the system by telling people their own opinions while minority voices are stamped into the ground.
p23961
aVIt's not just American.
p23962
aVIt's the Failure of the American Dream boiled down into website form.
p23963
aVHadn't thought of it like that before.
p23964
aVQuite right.
p23965
aVOoo
p23966
aVouch
p23967
aVOh my goodness, wait till the Americans see this. 
p23968
aVExcellent comment, but still...
p23969
aVShots fired.
p23970
aVTwas a good ice cream though
p23971
aVThis is the least British thing ever.
p23972
aVOthers merely adopted the queue, we were born in it, moulded by it.
p23973
aVWe are the queue.
p23974
aVYou'd be surprised at how many people think they're entitled to just walk in front of you in a queue abroad, it's quite annoying sometimes.
p23975
aVI'm always baffled how in foreign countries people think it's acceptable etiquette to go in front of other's that were clearly there waiting long before they arrived.
p23976
aVHow do countries not fall into anarchy with such bad manners and selfishness is beyond me.
p23977
aVIts the queues for ski lifts that fuck me off the most..
p23978
aVI like to trip the french fucks up with my snowboard as they slide all over my board to push past to the front.. Just no need. 
p23979
aV[deleted]
p23980
aVfollowed up by a le-cock punch.
p23981
aVI never understood how its acceptable to push in front of me in a queue for a lift but if i grab the back of his jacket and drag him behind me im somehow being a dick.
p23982
aVFuck you frog i was here first. 
p23983
aVThat's a fair response.
p23984
aVI'd be tempted to add a ski boot to the family jewels, as coup de grace, too. 
p23985
aVBut it's so much fun.
p23986
aVYou can be obnoxiously loud and obstructively British, when abroad, and it feels good.
p23987
aVWhen I go to France, I take the the French approach to queuing and just skip as much of the queue as possible in order to piss people off in ski lifts.
p23988

p23989
aV&gt; osmosis or some shit\u000a\u000aHave an upvote.\u000a\u000a
p23990
aVThe answer is they do fall into anarchy.
p23991
aVI live in Italy.
p23992
aVThey're so bad at queuing that most places that require a queue (Post Offices, government offices, even the butcher's) have had to institute a number system.
p23993
aVWithout it, it becomes a scrum, and also subject to the people behind the counter serving their mates/relatives first.
p23994
aVAnd *even then* there's always some old tosser who will push in front of you without a ticket "just to ask a question" which then becomes an entire 10-minute-long transaction.
p23995
aVThe minimum time I've ever had to wait in a post office is about 45 minutes.
p23996
aVWatching two lanes of traffic trying to merge here is an exercise in exasperation.
p23997
aVThat's just rude. 
p23998
aVWell, the number system is used all over the place, including the UK.
p23999
aVIt allows you to queue while sitting down - what's not to love?
p24000
aVFor the rest, I assume you're British, right?
p24001
aVAs a Brit who grew up in Greece, I think there's a high chance you simply haven't yet fully understood all the intricacies of the Italian queuing system - there are probably hundreds of unwritten rules everybody but you is following. 
p24002
aV&gt; the number system is used all over the place, including the UK\u000a\u000aIn certain places, but not as frequent, and definitely not in the post office.
p24003
aV&gt;  there are probably hundreds of unwritten rules everybody but you is following.
p24004
aVCould be true.
p24005
aVThen again my Italian girlfriend also gets pissed off when people push in front.
p24006
aVDepends on the size of the post office I suppose...
p24007
aVI have definitely been in post offices in the UK with a number system.
p24008
aVAlso, pro tip: if Italy is anything like Greece, getting pissed off when people push in front is *part* of the system.
p24009
aVYou're supposed to do something about it (tutting and eye rolls don't count), preferably with an air of infinite sophistication and condescension. 
p24010
aVThe post office I used to go to in Leeds had a ticketed number system.
p24011
aVSavages.
p24012
aVIt's why I stopped going.
p24013
aVSomeone should write a pamphlet then?
p24014
aVItalian guide to queuing.
p24015
aVIt could be handed out at the airport.\u000a
p24016
aVThat just sounds... horrendous...
p24017
aVI noticed that in Germany, when queuing to get train tickets - people just pushed in front.
p24018
aVSo I thought, *when in Rome*, and did the same.
p24019
aVI got such ugly stares and comments made in my direction.
p24020
aVI guessed then that the German *pile-in-to-the-front* technique was maybe not as chaotic as it looked - there was some kind of secret etiquette they were all following.
p24021
aVBut they violated my queue, and had to pay for it, godamnit.
p24022
aVWhen I do that now, and get those comments and scowls, I know I'm doing good.
p24023
aVThey'll learn ;-)
p24024
aVI think the rule in Germany is that the rules apply to everyone but you.
p24025
aVI can't count the number of times I saw someone get all bent out of shape after seeing someone break a rule that they themselves had broken mere minutes ago.
p24026
aVDon't get me wrong, I love the Germans, I really do, but that doesn't mean I will ever understand them.
p24027
aVI think they vary so much more than any other nationality I know when as individuals compared to when in groups.
p24028
aVThe British tend to form groups of individuals, while the Germans become amorphous closed groups when out together.
p24029
aVIts fascinating, and I'm not being critical about that at all.
p24030
aVI may even be alone in that feeling. 
p24031
aVEspecially once they've twigged you're foreign.
p24032
aVWhen they spot yellow rear numberplates it's like they're a shark that smells Blood On The Autobahn
p24033
aVI was once told off by a colleague for "doing personal things at work".
p24034
aVI was reading my work email.
p24035
aVHe was on the phone with his wife about childcare.
p24036
aVThe rule is that you're allowed to push but you have to queue.
p24037
aVYou're not allowed to jump the queue, especially if the queue is long.
p24038
aVYou basically have to serve some time in the queue but nobody is exactly keeping track because everyone else is pushing too.
p24039
aVAh, so I stand out too much and become the scapegoat. 
p24040
aVIn the German speaking areas: yes.
p24041
aVBut [Cutting In Line In Front Of Italians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FloeB_fhFSE) might follow different rules
p24042
aVMy female friend was in shock when I went full Malcolm Tucker on a Spanish guy who tried to jump ahead of us at 2am in Barcelona and nick our taxi.
p24043
aVI've since been told I threatened to do things with his toenails. 
p24044
aVSo, who got the taxi?\u000a\u000a
p24045
aVThe Caledonian Mafia never fails lad. 
p24046
aVA German did this to me the other day.
p24047
aVHe appeared extremely upset that I was rude enough to have a problem with this.
p24048
aVThis.
p24049
aVI was in Tokyo a couple of years ago queueing for a ticket machine for the train and no less than three people cut out the entire queue (I think there was only three of us and we were probably all British).
p24050
aVIn NL they are crap at queuing ( three desks; three queues.
p24051
aV)\u000a\u000aI have had to adopt Dutch bluntness to deal with this:\u000a\u000a"Allo!
p24052
aVJa, Allo meneer!
p24053
aVEr is een rij.
p24054
aV"\u000a\u000aTranslation: excuse me.
p24055
aVYes excuse me good sir.
p24056
aVI think you will find there is, in fact, a queue.
p24057
aVSorry to bother you. 
p24058
aVI love dutch bluntness.
p24059
aVBuying a ticket in Amsterdam Centraal once, a guy behind me tried to jump in front when a window became empty.
p24060
aVThe assistant in the window immediately roared, in English, "SIR, THESE PEOPLE ARE IN FRONT OF YOU.
p24061
aVI WILL SERVE THEM AND THEN I WILL SERVE YOU.
p24062
aV"
aVi once was queuing for a cash machine in Amsterdam and a woman stood BESIDE me in the queue.
p24063
aVTerrifying. 
p24064
aV'Queueing' for a McDonnalds in Spain was the most traumatic experience of my life.
p24065
aVIt's just stressful not having a queuing system...
p24066
aVAnd to think, most of the time the queueing system in McDonald's is often just a slightly sporadic crowd of people here in the UK, what you're describing must be how hell feels
p24067
aVAs a foreigner I think British queueing is among the nicest things in this world.
p24068
aVIt makes me feel like the world is not actually such a bad place, with no order or care between people.
p24069
aVWish everyone was British
p24070
aV&gt;  Wish everyone was British\u000a\u000aWe had a pretty good go at that a couple of centuries ago.
p24071
aV[deleted]
p24072
aVand im backing it up with this gun. 
p24073
aVA couple of centuries ago?
p24074
aVIt was at it's height in 1922.
p24075
aVI'm sure if we go again there's still some residual Britishness left over in places.
p24076
aVWe can pick up where we left off. 
p24077
aVIndia has forgotten it all, everything. 
p24078
aVThey're quite good at cricket, it wasn't a total write off. 
p24079
aVIndians have the greatest manners ever, they even developed our social class system to a new level.......maybe not such a good thing on that last point.
p24080
aVGood?
p24081
aVBeing British means being bad at the sports we invent.
p24082
aVYeah, not like a majority of them all speak English or anything.. 
p24083
aVDo they?
p24084
aVThey didn't seem to when I was on holiday their last week.
p24085
aVDefinitely a minority that spoke English beyond basic market selling. 
p24086
aVSorry got that wrong, around 20% do, which is some 125+ million. 
p24087
aVPretty sure more Chinese speak English per capita than Indians, but I take your point. 
p24088
aVNot really surprising, given the difference in literacy rates. 
p24089
aVMore Chinese speak English than Americans do.
p24090
aVBoy, could you speak *American?
p24091
aV*
aVAs with most places in the world those who are the better educated will learn English, usually pretty damned well too, probably better than the average slosh I hear around me in Wales.
p24092
aVIt's an enormous country, language there is certainly regional.
p24093
aVActually a lot more to do with class, ie if you're rich or not and thus how you were educated, rather than regional.
p24094
aVEverything is written in both English and Hindi everywhere, but only a small percentage can read and understand the English.
p24095
aVI'm not sure that 20% is such a small percentage, certainly not compared to China's 0.73%.
p24096
aVAnd overall they're pretty good at it- India ranks 3rd in Asia for English proficiency http://www.ef.com/epi/
p24097
aVTrue, but there are 20 or so "official" languages (IIRC), with over a thousand other dialects and languages.
p24098
aVYou get plenty of places where people don't speak Hindi, but Bengali or Gujarati.
p24099
aVIt doesn't help that every concerted effort to have a national language, has been met with (understandably) fierce resistance.
p24100
aVEnglish is a hangover from our occupation of India, with some of the higher education still being taught in English.
p24101
aVThen in 1776 some englishmen lost their way, started killing other englishmen, throwing away almost eight centuries of tradition and heritage all for the sake of lower taxes. 
p24102
aVAnd so they could keep having those oh-so-profitable slaves for another century or so.
p24103
aVFreedom, what a gimmick.
p24104
aVTo borrow an American phrase...
p24105
aV*ZING!
p24106
aV*\u000a\u000aAhem.
p24107
aVQuite.
p24108
aVOther places that are relatively good at queueing: Ireland, Hong Kong, ~~Japan~~*, [South Africa](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01389/vote2_1389530c.jpg) er... that's it I think.
p24109
aV\u005c* [Apparently not](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28xy4m/possibly_the_most_british_thing_ever/ciflhxh).
p24110
aV\u005c** [Hmm conflicting information](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28xy4m/possibly_the_most_british_thing_ever/cifl6zp).
p24111
aVNow tell me, what do 3/4 of these countries have in common?
p24112
aVYour point.
p24113
aVI see it.
p24114
aVLet's add ~~Australia and~~* New Zealand then.
p24115
aVHow are Canadians at it?
p24116
aVI'm guessing they're quite good.
p24117
aV\u005c* [Man down](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28xy4m/possibly_the_most_british_thing_ever/cifm27y).
p24118
aVOh we're good at it.
p24119
aVMum would never approve if we took too many qualities from our neighbour.
p24120
aVJolly good.
p24121
aVStand down that man.
p24122
aVAustralians don't queue.
p24123
aVThey mill about until the very last minute then everyone tries cramming in or through or on at the same time.
p24124
aVSource: grew up in Australia, was shocked at how orderly the bus stop queues were here in the UK.
p24125
aVBut after ten years of living here I went back to Australia for a visist and was frustrated at the lack of queues.
p24126
aVThat's when I realised I was more British than Australian.
p24127
aVWell that and being asked constantly where in England was I from! 
p24128
aVIt usually depends on where the queue is, I've found (at least in Perth) that people are usually good at queueing for most day to day things except for trains and sometimes buses.
p24129
aVThe bus queues are usually OK unless it's a stand that services more than one route and then it's worse than the 'queueing' for the trains.
p24130
aVEvery holiday I go on someone asks me where in England I'm from, I really need to learn to speak welsh.
p24131
aVI think the problem is that other countries say England instead of Britain.
p24132
aVEven my mum (in Australia) is confused, she says I'm in Wales in England!
p24133
aVYou'd think with the number of places named after us in the world they'd know better :p
p24134
aVdriving on the left, right?
p24135
aVAll of those countries drive on the left
p24136
aVAnd Japan is a small, overcrowded island with a monarchy, former imperial ambitions and a record for politeness
p24137
aVWeren't too polite to the chinese unfortunately...or the rest of Asia a few years ago. 
p24138
aVHence I put "Imperial ambitions" before it.
p24139
aVI think it's the Thais (definitely a SE Asian country...) that have the best system - you leave something of yours in a queue.
p24140
aVOn my fb wall the other day, someone had posted the queue to a yoga session in their gym.
p24141
aVIt was a trail of water bottles and towels.
p24142
aVYou can go off and do something useful in the mean time.
p24143
aVExcellent.
p24144
aVIsn't that the same as the "50p on the side of the pool table" system?
p24145
aV***British***.
p24146
aVAh, quite right.
p24147
aVWe did invent it first after all!
p24148
aVThat is pretty good.
p24149
aVI would enjoy having a go at that style of queuing. 
p24150
aVUntil some bastard comes along and nicks everyone's things...
p24151
aVOddly, I found Argentines to be good queuers.
p24152
aVNot brilliant.
p24153
aVBut good nonetheless.
p24154
aVMaybe that is their real reason for wanting the Falklands: they just want to learn our queuing habits. 
p24155
aVI would say Portugal is pretty good at it as well.
p24156
aVIf you like a British queue, you should try a Japanese one!
p24157
aVFunny you should mention Japan.
p24158
aVI've been in Japan, and while people will queue nicely, it lacks spirit.
p24159
aVThose queues are a bit too cold, and silent.
p24160
aVHere there'll almost be a random person, especially elderly people, who will just chat you up to pass the time.
p24161
aVEven if not with you, then with someone else.
p24162
aVMakes the whole place feel more lively, and human.
p24163
aVFeels great.
p24164
aV&gt;  I've been in Japan, and while people will queue nicely, it lacks spirit.
p24165
aVThis is true.
p24166
aVOn the other hand I find talking to strangers rather un-English.
p24167
aVUnless for a limited range of topics like Where is the bus?
p24168
aVor Lovely grey sky.
p24169
aVThat's why it's usually elderly people.
p24170
aVThey A) don't give a fuck anymore and B) just want someone to talk to.
p24171
aVI live in Japan at the moment, and the amount of fucks old people don't give in comparison to younger people is quite severe.
p24172
aVOld men and women will talk to me all night and day if possible, but starting a random conversation with anyone under 60 is nigh on impossible. 
p24173
aVTIL I'm elderly. 
p24174
aVYou probably learned that yesterday as well but forgot.
p24175
aVSorry, learned what? 
p24176
aVMust be a brummy thing.
p24177
aVEdit : that's where I'm from too
p24178
aVIs brum even English anymore?
p24179
aVI've been talking to random people for at least since I was in my mid-twenties.
p24180
aVI find people who are unable to engage in meaningless chit-chat to be missing what it means to be British.
p24181
aVactually it's very English.
p24182
aVI've been living in Sweden and no one does it here.
p24183
aVAs soon as I touched down, everyone from the guy who checked my passport to the lady I brought water from at the kiosk to the man I brought my coach tickets from, everyone was chatty and nice.
p24184
aVIn sweden, the bare minimum is "hello, that's 230 SEK please, bye.
p24185
aV"
aVRemind me not to go to Hampshire.
p24186
aVOr is it everywhere these days?
p24187
aVI dread to think it's become like that since I left.
p24188
aV[deleted]
p24189
aVMy boyfriend (who is English) goes basically apoplectic when I (recovering American) talk to people on the train.
p24190
aVFair enough.
p24191
aVWhy would you think they'd want to talk to you?
p24192
aVHaha, I've had several times when I've left Chesham and someone has sat next to me and we've talked all the way into London.
p24193
aVThey tend to be older ladies, but I enjoy it.
p24194
aVPeople are interesting and everyone has great stories.
p24195
aVWe're very tolerant of foreigners, I suppose.
p24196
aVMostly we just don't like to cause a fuss or upset anyone.
p24197
aVShort of being stuck next to someone on a cross country train where you're unlikely to see anyone else for the next 8-10 hours I can see no reason to talk to someone on a train.
p24198
aVEven then it would be limited to small talk regarding the lateness of the train or the weather. 
p24199
aVNever talk on trains.
p24200
aVI was showing some ladies (older ladies mind, before my girlfriend reads this) where the train station was.
p24201
aVAs soon as the shuttle pulled up we went silent.
p24202
aVThen talked again when we got off.
p24203
aVEngerlund.
p24204
aVIt is permissable to break into conversation when discussing how late the train is and to crack a joke about the irrelevant announcement from the guard.
p24205
aVThis is very accurate.
p24206
aVI live in Japan, and am British.
p24207
aVThe British queue is way way more amusing.
p24208
aVYou would never ever get anything sociable or in the spirit of fun happening in a Japanese queue.
p24209
aVThey do wait their turn nicely, and hats off to them for doing so (the mother FUCKING Chinese on the other hand; fuck those cunts), but you can't get any banter going at all.
p24210
aVRespectfully, I have to say the British queue beats the Japanese one, but the Japanese certainly put in a decent effort.
p24211
aVPlease don't lump all Chinese under the same banner.
p24212
aVThe former colony in Hong Kong is very good at queuing. 
p24213
aVFormer colony of which who...  haha, 
p24214
aVThis post is even more British than the original post \U0001f604
p24215
aVExcept while you're trying to send a business email from your phone and they relentless go on about the horse racing and how the cost of a pint at the royal legion recently went up to £1.60 like it was a sign of the end times.
p24216
aVAs a Brit, I fucking hate queuing.
p24217
aVI never push in or grumble, but man do I hate queuing.
p24218
aVI'm a foreigner too and I agree that it's very socialised how the British queue instead of the pushing everywhere else.
p24219
aVHowever, sometimes I find it quite annoying that queues are basically used as an excuse for bad service.
p24220
aVTo me, queuing itself is a sign of bad service.
p24221
aVA business shouldn't let people wait, I find it rude.
p24222
aVSure, you can't avoid it completely but sometimes I feel like that the British are more willing tolerate it that the have to wait for everything all the time just because there's a nice queue.
p24223
aVSo... the reason other countries don't do the queuing thing is because service is better?
p24224
aVJeeves, you're sacked!
p24225
aVNot necessarily, my point is more that it seems that I tend to get more upset about queuing than the British while the British get more upset when their isn't a proper queue.
p24226
aVHaving a nice queue is a good thing in my opinion but queuing itself isn't, it's just waiting.
p24227
aVImagine how much everything would cost if we doubled all ticket offices etc?
p24228
aVpffft I'd rather queue for 5 mins
p24229
aVIt's not that the UK is the only country with queues and obviously doubling all the ticket offices would be an overkill.
p24230
aVIt's more that I noticed that people don't seems to border that much if they have to wait but get very upset if someone jumps the queue. 
p24231
aVIt's just impractical to have enough desks/staff as to not require a queue.
p24232
aVLong queues are still hated by all though, just we moan quietly or not at all about it
p24233
aV&gt;  Wish everyone was British\u000a\u000aBNP member spotted.

aVI don't think I ever fully appreciated how brilliant our queuing system is until I went to China.
p24250
aVBloody hell, it's total anarchy.
p24251
aVI'd be halfway through ordering a coffee and someone would push in front and try to order theirs.
p24252
aVOh God, and getting on the plane.
p24253
aVI still have nightmares.
p24254
aVHere's the PDF:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/W14_CH_046_5_Guide_to_queueing.pdf
p24255
aV&gt;If you have chosen to queue overnight, in the morning\u000a(approximately 06:00) you will be woken by the Stewards,\u000aasked to dismantle any equipment, and close up into tighter\u000aformation so as to create space for those joining The Queue\u000aon the day, arriving on the first tube.
p24256
aVHoly shit they capitalise the queue.
p24257
aVAlso, tube. 
p24258
aVIt's 25 pages?
p24259
aVHow?
p24260
aVWe have our standards organization, we are good at lengthy documentation:\u000a\u000ahttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103\u000a\u000aThat's a much more British document in my opinion
p24261
aVOne after the other, tight formation, creating space for those to come via the first tube.
p24262
aVMy guess: years of people travelling there at great expense to then queue in their own interpretation of what queueing means, leading to upset/arguments etc. 
p24263
aVI'm just....
p24264
aVI...
p24265
aVI'm just....
p24266
aVI mean....
p24267
aVI'm just so PROUD!
p24268
aV*wipes away patriotic tear*\u000a\u000aAlthough now we're teaching other nations how to do it, there is a danger that they'll become better at it than we are, as with every other national sport...
p24269
aVSteady there, steady.
p24270
aVQueuing is nothing so base as a sport.
p24271
aVIt is a way of life, a mentality that spreads to every facet of our existence. 
p24272
aVReminds me of a favourite quote from [Georg Mikes:](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/g/georgemike133330.html)\u000a\u000a"An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue of one"
p24273
aVSeeing the queue at my local Waitrose it is surprising how many are bad at it.
p24274
aVThe fast lane checkouts are always busy at lunch.
p24275
aVThat first person who isn't fully inside the queuing area gets to choose where the spill over goes.
p24276
aVThere are three options.
p24277
aVYou can block every till in the store by queuing left (surprising how popular this choice is).
p24278
aVYou can block all motion through the store by queuing straight into the isle behind.
p24279
aVOr you can queue to the right which only blocks the newspapers (this was the least popular choice).
p24280
aVThey've had to put a rope up to try and guide people on how to not queue like a moron.
p24281
aVThere's a Waitrose in Clerkenwell, in the centre of London that I go to a lot, and at lunch every day, a queue forms that circles the entire shop.
p24282
aVSome unseasoned shoppers take one look and leave, but it actually only takes a few minutes to get around as they have all 25 or so tills on at once - it's constantly moving.
p24283
aVI'm sure there'll be others on here who have been to this Waitrose and will know what I mean - efficiency in the highest order.
p24284
aVThis reminds me of the post office prank.
p24285
aVYou get a bunch of friends to form a queue out the front of an empty post office, or other business that won't interfere, and eventually people start forming behind you.
p24286
aVWait for a significant number of people to join in and then leave all at once.
p24287
aVMight not work as well these days but my old man and his mates would get away with it occasionally back in the day. 
p24288
aVSo they're just left queuing for nothing?
p24289
aVThat's brilliant.
p24290
aVThe most british prank ever.
p24291
aVThe queueing system at Wimbledon is actual quite complicated, hence needing a guide.
p24292
aVThere are different types of tickets available each day and different queues for the people that camped out overnight for tickets.
p24293
aVI have queued once for Wimbledon where I camped in the nearby park for 2 nights in order to get centre court tickets for mens quarter finals day.
p24294
aVWhen you get to the park, you get a 'queue ticket' which guarantees your place in the queue for that day.
p24295
aVThe next day you can either use that queue ticket to get in line for tickets that day or get a new queue ticket if your staying another night.
p24296
aVThe different types of tickets are the 3 (or maybe 4?
p24297
aV) show courts and then ground passes.
p24298
aVThere are limited numbers for each.
p24299
aVIf your staying overnight again, you're issued a new queue pass with a different number and it means you're now further in front of the queue as some people have gone in to the grounds that day.
p24300
aVYou also have to move your tent and keep it in line depending on your queue number.
p24301
aVAll that being done, the day you finally decide to cash in your queue ticket, you pack up your tent and line up ridiculously early.
p24302
aVStewards come down the line and exchange your queue pass for a wristband depending on what type of ticket you want i.e.
p24303
aVCentre Court, Court One etc.
p24304
aVOnce a certain wristband runs out, thats it, tickets for that court are up for the day.
p24305
aVAll the people that come early on the same day to get into Wimbledon join the back of the queue of the people that have camped out.
p24306
aVThen you all move in line to the ticket office at the entrance to the grounds.
p24307
aVShow your wristband and buy the ticket you want.
p24308
aVYeah, we like queueing. 
p24309
aVIt's televised you know?
p24310
aVThe most British thing I have ever seen was a Air Cadet Squadron who copied the performances of the Red Arrows (where feasible) whilst pushing red wheelbarrows around, calling themselves The Red Barrows
p24311
aVSurely this is the least British thing ever, True Brits know how to Queue instinctively and require no guidance other than the tutting of their Queue mates.
p24312
aVBravo
p24313
aVThis is absolutely the most Chinese thing ever.
p24314
aVThose fuckers can't queue worth a shit. 
p24315
aVPDF of the guide to queueing...\u000a\u000ahttp://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/W14_CH_046_5_Guide_to_queueing.pdf
p24316
aVI saw a badger eating a cheese sandwich once which was pretty British 
p24317
aVSounds like something Karl Pilkington would say...
p24318
aV/r/BritishQueuing is now a strictly private affair.
p24319
aVShould you wish to apply please have the correct forms in triplicate and join the appropriate line.
p24320
aV&gt; line\u000a\u000aSorry, I don't speak foreign.
p24321
aVYou'll need to talk to the supervisor then.
p24322
aVYour ticket number is 76.
p24323
aVWhich documents will you accept as proof of address? 
p24324
aVNone of the ones you have easily to hand.
p24325
aVI found out earlier in the year the only birth certificate my mum has for me is the short form one..... which only proves I was born at a time in a place.
p24326
aVnothing else.
p24327
aVworthless for anything that requires a birth certificate
p24328
aVBut what about applying to get your birth certificate?
p24329
aVI recently sent off for a copy of mine. 
p24330
aVI've never actually needed it and only searched it out recently.
p24331
aVhow much does it cost to get it?
p24332
aV£9.95 apparently https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate\u000a\u000a
p24333
aVDeath certificate?
p24334
aVha.
p24335
aVCongratulations, you've finished!
p24336
aVOooh, it's up from £7 a couple years ago.
p24337
aVIn fact, I was able to request them to send me my grandparent's "original" birth certificates, now, funnily enough, bilingual (English/Welsh), so I could prove their birth to another government agency.
p24338
aVPassport, two recent utility bills, and a Blue Peter badge ( any level ).
p24339
aVMy Blue Peter badge is still registered under my maiden name - will that affect my application? 
p24340
aV&gt; Passport\u000a\u000aSo basically you're shut for next 6 months
p24341
aVAnd yet, when a new till opens at the checkout in Sainsbury's, and the queues re-jig to fill the gap, it is every man for himself - fastest to the till gets to the front, no question.
p24342
aVThere is absolutely no social agreement that the people who have been queuing the longest should be allowed to the front.
p24343
aVNo way!
p24344
aVI got here first, now *fuck off*!
p24345
aVIt's so unusual to me, a Singaporean, that people around the world have to be instructed to queue.
p24346
aVWe are natural queue-rs. 
p24347
aVThat's good.
p24348
aVQueuing is polite and civil.
p24349
aVAhh, but that is not just any queue, it is The Queue.
p24350
aVThe Queue at wimbledon is a formal managed entity/structure.
p24351
aVThere is a prequeue to get a ticket to get into The Queue.
p24352
aVTo get into the prequeue you may have to camp out the night before or be there before 6am.
p24353
aVOn joing the prequuee you get a "Queue ticket" that lets you join The Queue to get a "real ticket".
p24354
aVIf The Queue is longer than the number of "real tickets" (+ a few reserves for people who either give up or get the front and fail to pay properly) then you will not be allowed to join The Queue.
p24355
aVAlso The Queue has different sub queues for the different tickets.
p24356
aVEdit QueueTickets are actaully wristbands so you can't change places with people in "The Queue"
p24357
aVIs this an actual thing?
p24358
aVIt's handed out to everyone who queues for Wimbledon.
p24359
aVSource: I'm queueing for Wimbledon. 
p24360
aVHow's the pamphlet working out for you? 
p24361
aVGoing for a show court or just a ground pass?
p24362
aVDidn't queue early enough for show courts.
p24363
aVPeople have been camping since yesterday for those.
p24364
aVAt least I'm in the first 3000 though! 
p24365
aVYeah my girlfriend and I queued in 2009 from 6pm ish the night before; Ordered a pizza, played some cards &amp; had a great time &amp; we got onto Court 1, but only about 40/50 places behind Centre Court (but C1 matches ended up being better anyway :) )\u000a\u000aMy advice is to either camp from 5pm ish, or just rock up on the day and get a ground pass like you've done - there are plenty of decent matches on outside courts
p24366
aVHi Kendo!
p24367
aV#
aV:(
p24368
aVI genuinely said the same thing to my dad yesterday!
p24369
aVIf you don't mind me asking, how is the queue working out?
p24370
aVI'm considering campaign overnight in Friday with my girlfriend and some friends 
p24371
aVI'm not sure how the overnight queue goes, we got here at 5:50 and we're in the first 3000 (first 5000 guaranteed).
p24372
aVThe people queueing for tomorrow's show courts (centre and no.1) are pitching their tents now (9:30am).
p24373
aVIt should be noted that "queuing" in this context doesn't just mean a standard queue.
p24374
aVYou queue the night before and have special cards for your place in the queue, you select a wristband based on your place to get into certain courts and you have to be there at a certain time.
p24375
aVSo "queue" in this instance is a bit more complicated.
p24376
aVhttp://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/W14_CH_046_5_Guide_to_queueing.pdf
p24377
aVDid you have a good day?
p24378
aVThe guide is needed for the Germans.
p24379
aVBoy, do they need to learn how to queue...
p24380
aVDear Brits, I see you have guidelines for queueing.
p24381
aVAre Brits very likely to queue into random lines that form at a given place?
p24382
aVMy German countrypeople used to stereotype themselves as queue lovers.
p24383
aVAnywhere a line forms, you'd queue in just to not miss anything.
p24384
aVIt's our national sport!
p24385
aV^^and ^^the ^^only ^^one ^^we ^^stand ^^a ^^chance ^^of ^^winning! 
p24386
aVWas actually expecting a picture of myself.
p24387
aVI was out walking my Victorian bulldog, in my Liverpool shirt, with a football.
p24388
aVHaving said that, it was a world cup football, so maybe it wasn't THAT British... :(
p24389
aVDidn't bite anyone did you? 
p24390
aVI'm more of a Gerrard (9 years ago) guy myself.
p24391
aVYou were beating up DJs at a club!
p24392
aV?
aVMaking it rain disappointment!
p24393
aVWell 9 years ago he won the champions league.
p24394
aV(God I hate myself for pointing that'd out)
p24395
aVThat's what I meant, then accidently referred to the present.
p24396
aVI moved over here a few weeks before the London Olympics.
p24397
aVI bought a ticket to a few of the football matches at St James' Park, and needed to queue to pick up the tickets.
p24398
aVI arrived to find a well-organised queue, snaking single file across the carpark.
p24399
aVIt was then that I knew that I was truly in Britain.
p24400
aV... and then it started drizzling.
p24401
aV... but I had brought a brolly with me.
p24402
aVMeant for johnny foreigner who seems oblivious to principles of queuing.
p24403
aVIn fairness, it isn't just a stupid guide to being in a normal queue - at least it wasn't when I did it a couple of years ago!
p24404
aVI queued overnight and there's lots of info about when you have to get up/get a move on, what to do with your stuff, what size stuff you can take, ticket prices (knowing you might not get what you want) etc.
p24405
aVVery British though.
p24406
aVSomeone got in front of me in a queue about a week ago, and I ended up tutting twice, then gave a sigh before he turned around.
p24407
aVI raised my eyebrows in disapproval, and he moved to the back of the line.
p24408
aVKids are getting horrible these days =/
p24409
aVI dont see a tea bag...needs a tea bag...
p24410
aVThe queue actually seems to be dieing out in some places of the UK - well, in central Manchester and London anyway WRT public transport.
p24411
aVMy bus has become a free-for-all.
p24412
aVQueue jumpers will get stern looks and perhaps even a talking to!
p24413
aVJust need the 'moaning at a bus stop' leaflet next.
p24414
aVThey need to make pamphlets for the Mainland Chinese!!!
p24415
aVThey don't/can't queue for shit!!!!!!
p24416
aV!
aVOne of the funniest things I've ever heard was in a World of Warcraft game session.
p24417
aVSomeone mentioned that the 'kway' was taking too long.
p24418
aVIt took me a solid minute before I realized that he'd butchered the word 'queue'.
p24419
aV^^Disclaimer:  ^^both ^^individuals ^^are ^^American.
p24420
aVI love Brits. 
p24421
aVI don't understand queueing or what the deal is, its just standing in line isn't it?
p24422
aVYou're comfortable with your use of the word "possibly"?
p24423
aVSuch a shame that most of the queue system is just abolished within London.
p24424
aVBritons wouldn't need a guide on how to do it.
p24425
aVTrue, but there are a lot of foreigners who may not know how to avoid upsetting the natives.
p24426
aVThe post office is the worst.
p24427
aVIt's literally the last place anyone wants to queue, so when someone just walks straight to the front, you're guaranteed to hear more than a few tuts.
p24428
aVTIL, British are not born with a 6th queuing sense.
p24429
aVThe Brits need no instruction on the subject, this is obviously for visitors.
p24430
aVI'm sure they must print many in French.
p24431
aVI went to a conference full of people of many different nationalities and come coffee break time the queue was the most abysmal tragedy I've ever seen.
p24432
aVI just gave up and went and sat down.
p24433
aVThey need to implement these in the village and town as well.
p24434
aVWhen the Tennis is on they get packed with tourists as well who all seem to have no concept of queuing, especially in the pubs.
p24435
aVI had to stare, tut and murmur under my breath 3 times earlier today whilst getting pints in. 
p24436
aVI was reading the AMA earlier with the owner of the Harris hawk that they use to scare of the pigeons at Wimbledon.
p24437
aVTurns out even the hawk has Wimbledon approved headwear.
p24438
aVI like that even the birds of prey have to dress appropriately when attending tennis. 
p24439
aVWhen I was at Disney world, people didn't que in single file for the monorail.
p24440
aVIt irked me.
p24441
aVI sometimes feel like everyone on Reddit has been brainwashed by Americans to believe we're obsessive about being in queues.
p24442
aVWe're not.
p24443
aVNobody likes it, people DO cut in and generally queue like cunts all over the country.
p24444
aVCan we stop propagating this idiocy and stop pandering to American Reddit?
p24445
aVYeah I don't get why Brits on here keep trying to play up to the tea-and-crumpet polite-queueing thing, it's kinda sad.
p24446
aVThere's so much ridicule of Americans for their ignorance but sometimes this place looks like it's just a bunch of American teenage girls roleplaying what they think British people are actually like.
p24447
aV"Oh yes, we drink tea all day and tut, God Save The Queen!
p24448
aV"
aVIt's just a circlejerk, like the Canadian's being polite.
p24449
aV[deleted]
p24450
aVI thought that was taking cheap shots at Americans and bad teeth
p24451
aV~ SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT QUEUING YOU UNFUNNY CUNTS ~
p24452
aVQueueing. 
p24453
aVSettee: A sofa/couch
p24454
aVOk thanks :D
p24455
aVQuick tip for the future - use google voice search, and put on your best over-exaggerated British accent
p24456
aVI'll try that!..
p24457
aVGuv'nor :D
p24458
aVThis has bought so much joy to my day
p24459
aVIt's true then.
p24460
aVIgnorance is bliss :D
p24461
aVOP is learning English and he's got wittier responses than me.
p24462
aVDamnit.
p24463
aVJust don't use Siri or it'll come up with "I didn't understand that, did you mean Teepee?
p24464
aV"
aV"Speak American dangnamit!
p24465
aV"
aVOh it's not even northern slang as I thought it was, weird that I hadn't heard it before then.\u000a
p24466
aVNorthern slang?
p24467
aVIsn't Micky Flanagan a massive cockney?
p24468
aVOh - you're right.
p24469
aVI mistook it for northern due to my danish ignorance.
p24470
aVProbably because the only other time I have had a hard time understanding someones show, was when I watched Peter Kay.
p24471
aVIt's not like anyone in the UK can tell the difference between an Åarhus accent and an Esbjerg accent so I wouldn't worry about it.
p24472
aVÅarhus?
p24473
aVIs that the one in the middle of the street?\u000a\u000a
p24474
aVMate - you're pressing your 'A' key too hard and forcing bubbles to form at the top! 
p24475
aVIt was our castle and our keep

aVWe would hitherto sleep there on occasion

aVUnderrated comment of the year contender.
p24478
aVOutstanding.
p24479
aVlol'd so hard
p24480
aVIt is if you live on Tyneside..
p24481
aVI cringed so hard at that I almost turned into pre-surgery Renee Zellwegger.
p24482
aVår hus, i mitten av veien, år hus.
p24483
aVSpeak for yourself.. nah I'm kidding I have no idea :P\u000a\u000aRoskilde was nice though.
p24484
aVThe biggest difference in Danish accents is Copenhagen and Jutland iirc
p24485
aVActually each region in denmark has its own accent.
p24486
aVEven though in modern day it is blanded out due to TV, a danish person can tell the difference between sealand, fyn, southern/northern jutland and bornholm.
p24487
aVIt used to be really distinct.
p24488
aVI remember, as a kid, going to visit my fathers side of the family in jutland and not understanding much of what they were saying because we live on sealand.
p24489
aVIt's a shame TV has caused accents to become less distinct.
p24490
aVEven the Geordie accent up in Newcastle isn't quite what it once was any more :(
p24491
aVWhen I was a kid, we used to go from South London up to my Dad's family in Yorkshire, then across to my Mum's lot in Manchester.
p24492
aVI didn't understand a word from the moment we left home.
p24493
aVMy partner thinks it's bizarre that I can sing On Ilkley Moor all t' way through.
p24494
aVI love how the unofficial anthem of Yorkshire is a cautionary tale about how going out without a hat can cause you to catch your death of cold.
p24495
aVAccording to my old English teacher from back at school, regional accents are actually becoming stronger in inner city areas.
p24496
aVSo there's that!
p24497
aVI can still tell village by village the accents of people from sussex.
p24498
aVAnd then there's streets in Durrington with their own distinctive phonological ticks.
p24499
aVApart from that bloke who narrated Big Brother who got more Geordie every year - not sure if he still narrates it, I stopped watching it years ago
p24500
aVIt was Marcus...something.
p24501
aVTodare in the Big Broova Harrs... 
p24502
aVI wouldn't say people finding it easier to communicate is a bad thing.
p24503
aVDevil's advocate: at the expense of their identity.
p24504
aVIt is if it's with Geordies. 
p24505
aVPrepare for possible confusion if you ever come to Tyneside.
p24506
aVThe Northern accent there is incredibly similar to the cadences of Danish.
p24507
aVThe words are different, but spoken in the same way (if that makes any sense...) To the point where I can't sit in the same room whilst my other half watches subtitled Danish dramas, as it sounds like people speaking nonsense in my own accent.
p24508
aVI often confuse The Killing with Byker Grove. 
p24509
aVHahaha that is funny :D
p24510
aVThe further north you go in the UK, the more likely you are to hear us using the proper pronunciation of 'house' and mouse' aka, the way that's also Danish :P
p24511
aVThere's a moose loose aboot this hoose
p24512
aVThere's northern words left over from Danelaw like "laik" for play.
p24513
aVI know!
p24514
aVJust couldn't think of any.
p24515
aVBairn (I think its barn in danish?
p24516
aV) for a young child/baby as well - pretty much everyone I know in the north east uses it.
p24517
aVYes!
p24518
aVI can never remember which words are Danish and which are just random northern words.
p24519
aV&gt; The further north you go in the UK\u000a\u000aI was in Inverness last year and everyone seemed to have an English accent.
p24520
aVTV must be a very powerful accent diluter  ;)
p24521
aVAt that point, you've gone too far and come out the other side.
p24522
aVSpent two years in Aberdeen which I can only describe as Glaswegian and Geordie had a bastard love child called Doric.
p24523
aVFoods ya doos.
p24524
aVOur friends were bemoaning the lack of Highland accents any more :(
p24525
aVYou don't have to go far outside of Aberdeen before the locals need subtitles though.
p24526
aVYou may find http://www.vox.com/2015/3/3/8053521/25-maps-that-explain-english interesting
p24527
aV"go home" in Geordie is *gan hyem*, which I think is very close to the Danish way of saying it. 
p24528
aVGo home in danish is "Gå hjem" so yes, it is closer :)
p24529
aVFucking Vikings.
p24530
aV*Bloody Vikings...
p24531
aV*Bloody Vikings ;)\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/4Zp8jHvsepk
p24532
aVAnd some of the NE dialect has equivalents in Scandinavia as well.
p24533
aVI think 'Ah's gannin hyem' is perfectly good Danish/Norwegian (can't remember which). 
p24534
aV[Prosody is the word you are looking for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_%28linguistics%29)
p24535
aVAhhh that might explain why I find the nordic dramas agreeable to watch, whilst the Italian ones irritating.
p24536
aVFrom the thing Mrs Pope was watching last night:\u000a\u000a&gt; "Snurblah ivva wentley gannin at a giraffe bead like y'kna?
p24537
aV"
aVIt's easy to think that any broad/difficult to understand english accent is a northern one.
p24538
aVAccent is a class distinction as well as a geographical one, and most english accents you're likely to hear abroad are middle/upper class ones.
p24539
aVCockney is a dying accent, unfortunately!
p24540
aV\u000a\u000a&gt;Cockney is a dying accent, ~~un~~fortunately!\u000a\u000a
p24541
aVGarlic bread?
p24542
aV! 
p24543
aV'Garlic Bread' - bread spread with butter and crushed garlic and heated in the oven, often served as a side dish.
p24544
aVThat's quite a rude thing to say.
p24545
aV"The North" is getting bigger\u000a\u000aWE'RE TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK!
p24546
aVIt's a Victorian word for a very specific type of seat, but over time can now be used to refer to any kind of sofa or couche. 
p24547
aVIt is considered more working or lower middle class.
p24548
aVA lot of people around Britain say it, but more in Norther England which has a correlation with socio-economic class.
p24549
aVMy university made a dialect map in which you can see where settee is used.
p24550
aVhttp://projects.alc.manchester.ac.uk/ukdialectmaps/lexical-variation/furniture/
p24551
aVI must be weird, I use them totally interchangeably.
p24552
aVDon't worry, that's normal, a lot of people do that.
p24553
aVIt's called code-switching.
p24554
aVEveryone changes their language slightly depending on the people and situation they're in.
p24555
aVYou probably grew up with family and friends who all might have used different words and nobody corrected you or stopped you from saying either.
p24556
aVDue to media/globalisation, boundaries between accents and dialects are broken down more and more.
p24557
aVE.g.
p24558
aVCouch is considered American and due to their influence on media, it's used more frequently.
p24559
aVQuite possibly the most adorable thing I've ever seen asked on this Sub.

aVI know, I've got a big grin on my face just reading through this thread.

aVAnother\u000a\u000ahttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fu0ulzS7M\u000a\u000aGiven the Putin news this song is relevant...
p24588
aVNope, we never had that one.
p24589
aVSing Hosannah is the only other one I remember. 
p24590
aVMy name sounds like Hossanah, people used to substitute my name with it during that song in their mornings.
p24591
aVMy favourite post on this sub now
p24592
aVAny post that doesn't involve death, corruption, politics (ok it's election time fair enuff... but still), and basically - just corporations/people being dicks - is extremely welcome.
p24593
aVYeah, I was shocked to see something that wasn't about politics 
p24594
aVTories are trying to outlaw the use of the word "Settee", and enforce the use of "Sofa" to make Great Britain sound more world traveled.
p24595
aVSouthern tories sit on a chaise longue.
p24596
aVIt was a couch round ours.
p24597
aVFunny we have at least 3 words for the same piece of furniture.
p24598
aVWe're like Eskimo's and Snow.
p24599
aVA chaise longue is actually a specific variation though: it's like a sofa missing half the back and an armrest so you can lie down on it.
p24600
aVBut it is silly we have sofa, couch and settee which all do mean the same thing.
p24601
aVIs that because of the corporate mates at Sofa Workshop?
p24602
aVThose damn Tories!
p24603
aV!
aVI was wondering wtf this post had 1500 upvotes for.
p24604
aVI get it now.
p24605
aVThis week I'll settle for any post that isn't about Clarkson
p24606
aVCock in the hole, though..
p24607
aVMore expensive than a set D but cheaper than a set F.
p24608
aVG plan is where it is.
p24609
aVHard to come across though.
p24610
aVF-plan all the way!
p24611
aVSet A all the way
p24612
aVAh, but we can't all relocate to Birmingham, can we?
p24613
aVGenius 
p24614
aVI got a Set X off the market once, not as nice looking but it does the job.
p24615
aVTake your set F and LEAVE!
p24616
aVhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314910/SET_F___06-14.pdf
p24617
aVBut the point of a set F is that you don't leave.
p24618
aVAlso, why is it an indefinite stay for children, when children usually become older than 18?
p24619
aVMore importantly, it says "children over 18", but I'm pretty sure that the definition of child is an under 18.
p24620
aVKiwi guy once asked me what "more-ish" meant.
p24621
aVHe guessed it was how we describe food brought over by the Moors (like Othello!
p24622
aV), or maybe from the Devon/Cornwell region, but there didn't seem to be a similarity in the type of food being described.
p24623
aVIt was very funny watching him come to terms with the degree to which he had over-thought the expression!
p24624
aVBilberries are both very moorish and very moreish.
p24625
aVDo you have any other words we can help you with? 
p24626
aVNot off the top of my head, but I will say it's really confusing watching Peter Kay the first  time because apparently tea = food and brew = tea :D
p24627
aVTea = dinner (evening meal) and yes brew = tea (hot drink) for northerners 
p24628
aVAnd dinner = lunch.
p24629
aVConfused the hell out of me with my northern housemate mixing those up. 
p24630
aVIt's why you have dinnerladies at school......
p24631
aVShit it all makes sense now.
p24632
aVWe called them lunchladies because dinner is an evening meal.
p24633
aVI don't know what to believe anymore.
p24634
aVWow.
p24635
aVTIL
p24636
aVYeah.
p24637
aVi used to confuse the hell out of americans by having dinner and tea instead of lunch and dinner when I worked there.
p24638
aVWhen I was on German exchange, I asked (in English, of course) my host: "what's for tea"?
p24639
aVThey looked confused and said they didn't understand.
p24640
aVI tried to clarify by suggesting chicken, gravy, potatoes...
p24641
aVIt's when they looked horrified that I realised how annoyingly ambiguous this language is.
p24642
aVDamn Germans, turning their noses up at some good ol' chicken gravy tea. 
p24643
aVAre you an outlander?
p24644
aVThat's fairly well known even down South.
p24645
aVYes.
p24646
aVI'm a BOTC.
p24647
aVFinally turned citizen.
p24648
aVBring Orangutans To Court?
p24649
aVHaha.
p24650
aVBritish Overseas Territory Citizen.
p24651
aVOh thanks, I was genuinely curious!
p24652
aVOoh, you're one of them fake brits :P.
p24653
aVI like to call it: descendant who found his way back home.
p24654
aVDo any Northerners know of the word 'favver' meaning 'to look like'?
p24655
aVLike if someone is skinny you might say "he favver's Jack Skelington!
p24656
aV" for example.
p24657
aVApologies for the tangent.
p24658
aVNo idea, I'm a southerner (as southern as they come!
p24659
aV) and I've never heard of it.
p24660
aVSome Yorkshire people said they use favour to mean resemble.
p24661
aV'He favours his dad' for example.
p24662
aVIn my neck of Lancashire it has evolved into a separate word!
p24663
aVUsed it many times, and is quite common up north
p24664
aVThere's a local ale near where I'm from called Tea too.
p24665
aVAsking for a pint of Tea is always interesting. 
p24666
aVNo problem with a SportsDirect mug.
p24667
aVAm using one now.
p24668
aVCan confirm.
p24669
aVDouble Bagging is required, however.
p24670
aV...technically its T.E.A.
p24671
aVGood stuff though.
p24672
aVTetley's is also tea and a brand of bitter.
p24673
aVConfused the fuck out of me when I was a nipper.
p24674
aVTea is an evening meal, and also a brewed drink as in "green tea".
p24675
aVOr.. Just tea.
p24676
aVThe latter was meant to refer to the fact that northerners will say "brew" instead of "tea".
p24677
aV&gt; Oh, I'd love a hot brew right now.
p24678
aVSome southerners do, but it's much more rare.
p24679
aVUnless they're ultra northerners...
p24680
aVThey have Irn Bru, which is made from girders but is drank.  \u000a\u000a
p24681
aVDo people ever refer to Scottish folk as 'Northern'.
p24682
aVMy mate is Scottish and refers to me as Northern, which I always thought was a bit odd.
p24683
aV[Unpronounceable, too...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvkByxe33ZM)\u000a\u000a
p24684
aV&gt;ultra northerners\u000a\u000aBbbut London is in France, aye?
p24685
aVYup.
p24686
aVIt's not strange for people to call a bear/cider a brew either.
p24687
aVDid someone say [bru?!
p24688

aVParticularly for  Carlsberg's "Special *Brew*" (ideally with a slug of Buckfast for good measure.
p24692
aV)
aVAlso a steep little hill going down to a river!
p24693
aVNot OP but perhaps you could help me with brit bar culture though.
p24694
aVAnd tipping culture in that context as well.
p24695
aVSpecifically when am I expected to sponsor drinks etc
p24696
aVDo you mean buy other people drinks?
p24697
aVUsually people will take turns getting rounds in, and also you might be with people who play games where the loser has to get the next round.
p24698
aVBut usually its taking turns, I'll get everyone a drink, then Steve does, then you do, etc.
p24699
aVAs for tipping, its not usually done.
p24700
aVIf you're getting excellent service like lots of complicated cocktails served well, or drinks brought to your table, you might tip then but we dont normally tip for standard bar service. 
p24701
aVTips for bar staff usually go in a shared pot next to the till to be shared equally among the bar staff at the end of the night.
p24702
aVWhen paying for your drinks you can offer a tip by saying "and your own" or "and yourself" as you hand the cash over.
p24703
aVThe bar tender will then take 20p or so from the change and put it in the pot.
p24704
aVThats LetterWang.
p24705
aV/that doesn't quite work as well.. :-/
p24706
aVIf they ever make a remake they need to call it that.
p24707
aVWell there is [Wordwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHktd1VrGY)!
p24708
aVSCRABBLE!
p24709
aVI'm a little late to this party, but I did read a book called [Watching The English](http://www.amazon.de/Watching-English-Hidden-Rules-Behaviour/dp/0340818867) by [Kate Fox](http://www.sirc.org/about/kate_fox.html).
p24710
aVShe explains how to determine which 'class' somebody is by the words they use for things, and Settee is one example:  \u000a&gt;**Settee**  \u000aOr you could ask your hosts what they call their furniture.
p24711
aVIf an upholstered seat for two or more people is called\u000aa settee or a couch, they are no higher than middle-middle.
p24712
aVIf it is a sofa, they are upper-middle or above.
p24713
aVThere\u000aare occasional exceptions to this rule, which is not quite as accurate a class indicator as \u2018pardon\u2019.
p24714
aVSome younger\u000aupper-middles, influenced by American films and television programmes, might say \u2018couch\u2019 \u2013 although they are\u000aunlikely to say \u2018settee\u2019, except as a joke or to annoy their class-anxious parents.
p24715
aVIf you like, you can amuse\u000ayourself by making predictions based on correlations with other class indicators such as those covered later in\u000athe chapter on Home Rules.
p24716
aVFor example: if the item in question is part of a brand-new matching three-piece\u000asuite, which also matches the curtains, its owners are likely to call it a settee.
p24717
aVIt's an excellent book!
p24718
aVMade me aware of parts of English culture that I really would never have thought about, as well as the astonishing number of ways in which I (and my family and friends) conform to 'Englishness' without realising it.
p24719
aVDon't suppose anyone knows of a link to it online... You know... For free...
p24720
aVPlease?
p24721
aV:)
p24722
aVMate if you just google "(book title) + pdf" you'll find something 9 times out of 10. 
p24723
aVThanks, you're right - I was just on mobile last night :)
p24724
aVWhat a load of shit that is
p24725
aVShe pisses me off.
p24726
aVShe seems to think working class people don't understand irony.
p24727
aVIf a middle class person does something tacky, it's ironic.
p24728
aVIf a working class person does it's sincere. 
p24729
aVOh my god I'm reading that very book right now.
p24730
aVI'm like "Hahaha who the fuck does th.... oh me.

aVPiping yes into commands is reserved for the sysop who's just stopped caring. 
p24735
aV    yes | sudo rm -fir * /\u000a\u000aYes, I like to watch the world burn.
p24736
aVBrutal 
p24737
aV-f and -i are the opposite of each other.
p24738
aVYou could just do `rm -rf` instead of `yes|rm -fir`.
p24739
aVOr you could do `rm -irf`, which works because the command line arguments counteract each other in the order given, if that makes sense.
p24740
aVRight you are.
p24741
aVI was decaffeinated at the time...
p24742
aVyou want to know what a poof is?
p24743
aVI (a gay man) went to stay at my Mancunian friend's place and I said I didn't mind where I slept and not to make a fuss and her mum said \u201cShall we put the poof in that corner over there?\u201d\u000a\u000aHow we laughed.
p24744
aVDid you go?
p24745
aVOn the Isle of Wight the word queer is very common.
p24746
aVI nearly spat my tea out when I was first heard someone got a bit queer.
p24747
aVIs the Isle of Wight real or is it in an Enid Blyton book?
p24748
aVThe Isle of Wight is in a different time zone to the rest of the UK - 1956
p24749
aVFunnily enough the only people I know who live there are a very hot, modern gay couple. 
p24750
aVYou know me and my partner?
p24751
aVWow.
p24752
aV;)
p24753
aVIt's the only place in the world where there is still a whimpy's
p24754
aVTIL my local high street is stuck in 1956... And so is the next nearest one after that.
p24755
aVPlease note that the one in the Isle of Wight had to close for some time in the early 00's as the person occupying the flat above died,  rudely didn't tell anyone and proceeded to leak through the ceiling
p24756
aVWell where do you live?
p24757
aVWelling, London.

aVOne in Eltham too, always looks reasonably busy.
p24761
aVMust be a South East London thing. 
p24762
aVYeah that third link seems to show that hey're much more common in South East London than anywhere else.
p24763
aVThey're also in Woolwich, Lewisham, Deptford, Dartford, East Wickham, Beckenham and Sydenham.
p24764
aV"Queer" is still common to describe something as odd.
p24765
aVYep.
p24766
aVGot detention as a kid for using it in that context.
p24767
aVDidn't know it had an alternate meaning, so naturally the teacher wasn't too please I called him queer.
p24768
aVWhen my family moved from South London to Bournemouth, my Nan went from calling it a \u201cpoof\u201d to a \u201cpoofèt\u201d.
p24769
aVMy family calls it a "tumptey".
p24770
aVI am fairly sure that my family are alone in this as we have a ridiculous "language", but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. 
p24771
aVNope!
p24772
aVThis lovely word has seemingly been erased from history except for [this old Victoria Wood/Julie Walters sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEtqRjRBj3A).
p24773
aVNo way that's amazing! 
p24774
aVDo you know the word 'favver' meaning 'to look/be like'.
p24775
aVI thought it was 'If ever he is as' all smushed up into two syllables but it turns out its an old word in itself.
p24776
aVI think it's just favour, if person A favours person B it just means that A looks a bit like B. \u000a\u000a
p24777
aVIts pronounced with the a in hat, not the a in hate though.
p24778
aVAlso I've never heard of 'favour' to mean 'resemble'.
p24779
aV&gt; Also I've never heard of 'favour' to mean 'resemble'.
p24780
aVThats definitely a thing - "he/she favours his dad" means they look more like their dad than mum.
p24781
aVcool, never heard that.
p24782
aVWe have 'favvers' which is pronounced distinctly different from 'favours'.
p24783
aV'Favvers' must be derived from an old pronunciation of 'favours'.
p24784
aVIt's still used in parts of Lancashire, particularly by the elderly - definitely derived from "favours".
p24785
aVYon babby proper favvers ees dad!
p24786
aVSource: lived in Wigan for several years, heard many weird and wonderful pronunciations, and learned that steak pudding is often referred to as "babby's yed".
p24787
aVI say it, as do all ym family.
p24788
aVBut I didn't know if it was a single word or a slurred-together phrase.
p24789
aVWe mostly use it as a stock joke to liken something to something else.  
p24790
aVCheese pooféts?
p24791
aV&gt; https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314910/SET_F___06-14.pdf\u000a\u000aI thought my family were the only ones in Bournemouth to call it a "poofèt" \u000a
p24792
aVIn London people used to call them poufées too ...
p24793
aVI don't know if they still do because I haven't heard anyone mention the item in question for a very long time
p24794
aVI hear DFS has a sale on them at the moment, such a rare occurrence. 
p24795
aVDon't forget it's ending soon!
p24796
aVYou're lovely!
p24797
aVCome and stay in Britain with us!
p24798
aV!
aVI was in Denmark last week.
p24799
aVI didn't want to come home.
p24800
aVAwesome place!
p24801
aVThat's very nice of you to say!
p24802
aVI was in scotland when I was younger and to this day I still think if I become a millionair I will buy a secluded house in the highlands and live there in the summer.
p24803
aVThat is my version of paradise :)
p24804
aVI'm glad you like the Highlands!
p24805
aVI drove up there just over a week ago and it's beautiful, even when it's dull and rainy. 
p24806
aVYeah it was dull and rainy when I was there too, and I loved the view from the tour bus, but I imagine it's nicer to be outside in the summer, and still beautiful :)
p24807
aV"Summer"
p24808
aVThe rain is slightly warmer, and falls vertically instead of horizontally.
p24809
aVScotland have "Summer"?
p24810
aVThe east coast does.
p24811
aVFor 2 hours on the third Sunday in July. 
p24812
aV&gt; I will buy a secluded house in the highlands and live there in the summer\u000a\u000aIt seems a bit excessive to buy a house that you'll only be living in for three days of every year...
p24813
aVUnfortunately my only connection with Danish culture is watching The Bridge but as a Scot I noticed several similarities in dialect.
p24814
aVFor one, the characters would often say "braw" meaning good.
p24815
aVWe say that in eastern Scotland.
p24816
aVAlso "noo" for now.
p24817
aVI believe the Norwegian for child is "barn", which is where we get "bairn" from in Scotland.
p24818
aVI would love to go to Denmark.
p24819
aVYou and all the bitey beasties.
p24820
aVHad a cracking holiday on Skye, walking and climbing.
p24821
aVWeather was pretty good.
p24822
aVThought I would lose weight, but I'm sure I put on a couple of pounds just from breathing in midges.  
p24823
aVI could do a whole thread on the funny Danish slang I've heard.
p24824
aVI am a Londoner that has been living in Denmark 10 years to the day today.
p24825
aVThis thread made me chuckle a lot.
p24826
aV:D
p24827
aVSounds like a good idea!
p24828
aVHe was probably talking about a settee which is effectively a couch/sofa
p24829
aVset e is Settee.
p24830
aVIt's a sofa / couch
p24831
aVI'm wondering how the "can I come in your ass/house?
p24832
aV" joke worked for you.
p24833
aVI got it :)
p24834
aVGood.
p24835
aVIt's one of my favourites!
p24836
aVMy South African friend takes full advantage of his acccent when buying cubes of frozen water for parties:\u000a\u000a "D'you sell Ass?
p24837
aV/ How much is your ass?
p24838
aV"\u000a
p24839
aVMa ass iss free for you, my friend!
p24840
aVSeems like a good place to ask:\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat's the difference between a settee, couch, sofa and a suite? 
p24841
aVSettee = Couch = Sofa  \u000a  \u000aSuite is the collective term for comfy sitting room furniture  \u000a  \u000a(I am basing this on 5th hand knowledge, passed down from father to son for generations in the BombTV blood line) 
p24842
aVSettee, couch and sofa are all used interchangeably.
p24843
aVCouch is a little more American but I have plenty friends who use it.
p24844
aVTo me, settee and sofa imply squishy comfort.
p24845
aVA suite is a matching set of sofas and armchairs, eg a 3 piece suite could be a 3 seater sofa, 2 seater sofa and an armchair (or a sofa and two armchairs or whatever).
p24846
aVI *think* a three piece suite is always a sofa (of indeterminate seats) and 2 armchairs.
p24847
aVMight be wrong.
p24848
aVAlmost always.
p24849
aVI've certainly come across a few stores over the years selling a *two settee + one armchair* package as a *three piece suite*.
p24850
aVIn her excellent book "watching the English" Kate Fox argues that what we call our furniture is a surprisingly good indicator of social class.
p24851
aVIn fact she includes it in a list of 7 words that she thinks are the most reliable indicators of lower social class (along with 'pardon', 'toilet', 'serviette', 'dinner', 'lounge' and 'sweet').
p24852
aVShe writes:\u000a\u000a&gt;Or you could ask what your host calls their furniture.
p24853
aVIf an upholstered seat for two or more people is called a couch or a settee they are no higher than middle-middle.
p24854
aVIf it is a sofa, they are upper-middle or above.
p24855
aVI'd recommend the book, incidentally, it's very good.
p24856
aVMade me aware of parts of English culture that really would never have thought about, as well as the astonishing number of ways in which I (and my family and friends) conform to 'Englishness' without realising it. 
p24857
aVBoom!

p24896
aVCan someone explain?
p24897
aVEd Balls joined twitter, and then he (or an aide) typed his name in the wrong box and made his first tweet Ed Balls.
p24898
aVThat's literally the whole thing.

aVNot heard of this before but it's pretty funny!
p24910
aVI think it's fucking hilarious.
p24911
aVIt's not just because he typed in the wrong box, but because it shows he was actually searching for himself.
p24912
aVI think he said he was just going into Asda and someone (staff member) texted him that a story had been done about him so he'd better read it and so he was trying to find it but typed in the wrong app.

aVGod, I fucking love Charlie Brooker.
p24964

aVBit of a long shot.

aVDito
p24968
aVI'd say more along the lines of *painful*, or *cringe-worthy*..
p24969
aVReally?
p24970
aVI thought it was an interesting observation of generational differences and stuff.
p24971
aVIn a weird way Jon held his own.
p24972
aVI guess I'm too familiar with generational gaps and IT.
p24973
aVThe thing that was most cringe-worthy here is he's clearly being fed questions via headset, so he has no idea what he's asking, nor does he listen to the answer.
p24974
aVThat was really emotive to watch, Jon was so dismissive, although he did do a good job of representing the general publics view of computer games.
p24975
aVCouple of point I think Brooker could've brought up,\u000a\u000a&gt;Whats the point in playing computer games?
p24976
aVWhats the point in reading a book?
p24977
aV&gt;It's violent and horrid.
p24978
aVNo more than Bugs Bunny or Tom and Jerry, but those cartoons have been accepted by mainstream media in a way that hasn't yet occurred with games.
p24979
aVPapers Please was an excellent game to cite though.\u000a
p24980
aVI thought Brooker really undersold gaming in this, he said so at the end himself.
p24981
aVThere were several times when he could have easily replied with the points you listed, as well as the poor explanation of how a typical videogame progresses.
p24982
aVIn films you might have a prologue before the title appears; in books, the same.
p24983
aVVideogames typically have an opening cutscene and a tutorial level, especially a game like Lego Marvel.
p24984
aVAlso people DO meet and get married and stuff through gaming.
p24985
aVThere are many examples across the world, whether it be meeting each others avatars in an MMORPG or meeting in real life at a gaming event, of which there are many.
p24986
aVThere was so much that Charlie missed out on talking about, even though Snow was, perhaps purposefully, very difficult to talk to about it.
p24987
aVHoly shit, this is fantastic
p24988
aVI lost a lot of respect for Jon Snow watching this.
p24989
aVHe wouldn't let Charlie finish any of his answers; he just steam-rolled right over him and refused to accept anything that he didn't agree with.
p24990
aVAnd the stuff about female gamers?
p24991
aVWhat the hell, Jon Snow?
p24992
aVI cracked up at "Somebody tell me how to eject the disk!
p24993
aV"
aVBeing a female gamer, Charlie Brooker has risen a few levels in my esteem, whilst Jon Snow's esteem has slipped a few!
p24994
aVEdit: But this was funny!
p24995
aVCan't be coincidental, surely...
p24996
aVNo, he's aware of the connection.
p24997
aVHe interviewed Kit Harrington a while back on his show so this is tongue in cheek.

aVI found his name added to the hilarity.
p25132
aV&gt;One version of the sign features the village name with an additional sign beneath it, with the words "Bitte \u2013 nicht so schnell!
p25133
aV" ("Please \u2013 not so fast!").
p25134
aVThe lower sign\u2014which features an illustration of two children\u2014is meant to advise drivers to slow down, but tourists interpret it, in conjunction with the "Fucking" sign, as a double entendre.
p25135
aVThis is my new favourite thing ever

aVBUT IT ISN'T EVEN WIBBLY WOBBLY
p25154
aVMaybe not spatially, but temporally it's super wibbly wobbly.
p25155
aVNOBODY SAY IT! 
p25156

aVMost people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction.
p25169
aVBut I have seen the face of time, and I can tell you: they are wrong.
p25170
aVTime is an ocean in a storm.
p25171
aVYou may wonder who I am or why I say this.
p25172
aVSit down and I will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard.
p25173
aV...
p25174
aVRight?
p25175
aVPeople assume that time is a strict progression from cause to effect, but actually, when you look at it from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff.

aVGOD DAMMIT 
p25177
aVI'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
p25178
aVThat sounded like Russell Brand's attempt at being a quantum physicist.
p25179
aVOMG Russell brand for the next Doctor who!
p25180
aVIf Russell fucking Brand is the next Doctor, I will personally assassinate him so that I'm not obligated to watch his smug, self-centred, arrogant, pseudo-intellectual, politically idiotic face ruin one of my favourite programs.
p25181
aVI would have to say, on the whole, the average thing Russell brand says is smarter than the average plot of a doctor who episode.
p25182
aVYou can count on me to help you with a plea of justifiable homicide
p25183
aVEven more awesome is the "mini beach" you can get to from about half way down the road :).

aVGreat place to sit with a few mates and just chill out.

aVMakes sense that it's a dead-end.
p25196
aVAye, there's one in Oxford like this called "Turn again lane.
p25197
aV"
aVRight next to the building where I did my PGCE!
p25198
aVThat's crazy, I've walked within 5 metres of that sign many a time and not realised the road had such an awesome name
p25199
aVIs it full of Hobbits?
p25200
aVWhere the fuck is this?
p25201
aVI live in BS8 and have never seen it.
p25202
aVNot one of the lanes down towards Hotwells is it?

p25204
aVIve drunkenly pissed down that lane dozens of times and never realised what it was called 
p25205
aVTypical Honey Badger.
p25206
aVNo way, I used to live right by there!
p25207
aVI think I hardly ever went down that road.
p25208
aVHas the road been there a while or is it recent since the films?
p25209
aVLooks like its been around since at least [1995](https://www.flickr.com/photos/marianthipop/4453316551/)
p25210
aVHey, that's on the road from Luton to Hitchin, isn't it?
p25211
aVI used to pass that semi-regularly on the Birmingham to Stansted National Express service... ^/r/notinteresting
p25212
aVYup on the A505 about halfway between offley and hitchen (more /r/notinteresting)
p25213
aVHitchin-ite here.
p25214
aVWell let it pass just be glad you didn't misspell St Ippolyts/ St Ippollitts, a village just off Hitchin...
p25215
aVThey have brawls over the spelling of their village 
p25216
aVHey man, as a native of St. Ippolyts I'll tell you it's serious business of the highest order!
p25217
aV(honestly I don't give that much of a shit, although I do prefer the spelling I used as it has less Is and Ls and is easier to remember) 
p25218
aV:s my excuse is I haven't lived there for years and Hitchin is a bit dull :P. \u000aDoes the swimming pool still have the hilariously (if you are 12) modified sign itchin wimmin entre?

aVMy personal favourite is [No Name Street](http://www.itraveluk.co.uk/photos/data/549/medium/no-name-street.jpg) in Sandwich.
p25226
aVOdd street name and silly town name in one.
p25227
aVShort Street just round the corner also puts a smile on my face, being very short.

aVThen there's the classic [Ham Sandwich](http://i.imgur.com/EkHCiwb.jpg) sign.

p25233
aVsounds like it could be.
p25234
aVBugger.
p25235
aVNow everyone knows that I, Jim BurgerKing, am dating Miss Leicester.
p25236
aVAwkward.
p25237
aVX and Y are unusual names for streets, but they've got to be super rare for people.
p25238
aVAnd then for an X and a Y to get together: what are the odds? 
p25239
aVI wonder if they also listen to awful Coldplay albums.
p25240
aVLOL Dover, what jokers.
p25241
aVi enjoyed Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate when visiting York
p25242
aVEven more fantastically, there is an address on that street between 1 and 3 which is not 1a, but 1½.
p25243
aVSeriously.
p25244
aVOne and a half Whip-Ma-Whop-Ma-Gate.

aVThis is probably a more appropriate one for Reddit...

aVI had lunch at No Name Bistro once, it was pretty good.
p25248
aVThere's also the Royal Mail [Sandwich Delivery Office](http://m.imgur.com/0Qt8XKM)
p25249
aVOh wow really never expected to see this here!
p25250
aVThis round the corner from me, between Hitchin and Luton on the A505.
p25251
aVI play football on a Sunday in Pirton so use this road on many weekends.
p25252
aVIt is actually quite an undulating country lane so I assume thats why it got its name.
p25253
aVI believe they changed the name because people kept stealing the sign. 
p25254
aVAha wow never expected to see Pirton on reddit, I live here.
p25255
aVI visit there a bit.
p25256
aVHave family on Burge end lane down the road from The Fox pub.

aVMeppershall checking in:) 
p25259
aVHitchin reporting in.
p25260
aVThis won't fix that, surely.
p25261
aVTo be honest its only anecdotal information im providing there from people I know in Pirton, that might not be the reason they changed it.
p25262
aVIf that indeed was the issue then it has worked because I dont recall the sign being missing since I started going past it regularly which was probably about 10 or so years ago.
p25263
aVThe sign in the picture is certainly how I have always seen it. 
p25264
aV[Rowley Regis has a pretty good one](http://i.imgur.com/IMire0q.png)
p25265
aVwe're becoming too americanized, calling our wibbly wobblys 'Carters'
p25266
aV&gt;americanized\u000a\u000aWe're too late.
p25267
aVZ is Oxford spelling, with an s is Cambridge.
p25268
aVBoth are acceptable.
p25269
aV(Is the opposite of a grammar nazi a grammar communist?
p25270
aV)
aVNo, the opposite of a Grammar Nazi is a Grammar Nasi
p25271
aVMagnificent. 
p25272
aVIn fact, it goes back further than that.
p25273
aVThe suffix -ize is the Greek way of verbali*z*ing a noun.
p25274
aVe.g.
p25275
aVnoun: American\u000a\u000averb: Americanize\u000a\u000aThe problem came about because uneducated people didn't know when a word was supposed to end in -ise and when it should end in -ize.
p25276
aVe.g.
p25277
aVsurprise vs criminalize.
p25278
aVCriminal becomes a verb by adding -ize, but surprise isn't derived from a noun, so it ends in -ise.
p25279
aVTwo different words but with the same *sound* at the end.
p25280
aVhttps://grammarcops.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/verbalized/
p25281
aVSort of.
p25282
aVIt's a rule that was made up, stating that if a word comes from a Gk root it should use z, and if from Latin, it should use s since Latin has no z in the alphabet.
p25283
aVHowever it's not as though the "ise" or "ize" words in English are taken verbatim from either language, and the z convention for words with a Gk root has never been common.
p25284
aVCool.
p25285
aVThanks for clarifying!
p25286
aVPunctuation for the people!
p25287
aVno, Cambridge is the only acceptable.
p25288
aVZ is Oxford English Dictionary spelling, s is everyone else - it's not as though Oxford town or Oxford University follow the z convention.
p25289
aVThe OED is great for etymology, but has some odd and prescriptive ideas about spelling which just don't reflect how people do it.
p25290
aVI remember spelling books in primary school (in the 80s, Northern Ireland) listing words which could have either ending.
p25291
aVI remember my spelling wasn't too hot back then so I settled on -ise for convenience.
p25292
aVAlthough, many of my older teachers in secondary school used the -ize endings.
p25293
aVWas it a maybe a generational thing?
p25294
aVWas -ize the British way but we changed recently and now think it's only American.
p25295
aVI actually quite like the -ize endings, but don't use them since it looks like no one else does.
p25296
aVThe OED rule is to use z for words derived from Greek, and s for words derived from Latin.
p25297
aVIf this were to have worked in the past, the general population would have to know a fair amount of Greek or memorise the aberrant spelling of thousands of words.
p25298
aVEither seems a bit unlikely.
p25299
aVAlso I haven't noticed "ize" as being common in 19C editions of books, of which I have a few.
p25300
aVSo overall, I don't think that this was a generational thing.
p25301
aVI feel like when you're using that word a Z is appropriate
p25302
aVPersonally, I enjoy Agent Carter's wibbly wobblys...
p25303
aVI don't think it compares to what is now [Grape Lane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gropecunt_Lane) in York...
p25304
aV&gt; Gropecunt ... appears to have been derived as a compound of the words grope and cunt.
p25305
aVThanks captain obvious-pedia. 
p25306
aVI think whip-ma-whop-ma-gate is one of the better street names out there while we're in York.
p25307
aVWhat about mad Alice's lane?
p25308
aVThere was a Gropecunt Lane is Bristol at some point, as well.
p25309
aVThere was a gropecunt lane in most towns I think 
p25310
aVAnother one [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie_Lane,_Oxford).
p25311
aVI regularly drive past a Fanny Hands lane and often wonder if it's a cleaned up variant of Gropecunt lane. 
p25312
aVMy guess is that it compares *exactly* to it.
p25313
aVAt one time there was a fashion for renaming Gropecunt Lane or its local variation, but there was a law requiring that the former name also be displayed.
p25314
aVTo get around this, they would rename a lane, then rename it again after only a day.
p25315
aVSo my guess is that it was only Wibbly Wobbly Lane for a day.
p25316
aVNo, I live round there and it was Wibbly Wobbly lane for as long as I can recall.

aVIt would be even better if it had been called Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey Lane.
p25383
aVProbably the reason they changed it in the first place was due to Doctor Who fans stealing the road sign.
p25384
aVThat makes perfect sense, wouldn't surprise me.
p25385
aVMight make sense but unfortunately it's not the reason, that sign has been there since long before David Tennant was the Doctor. 
p25386
aV[deleted]
p25387
aVHe's not saying that you said it was named after the Who quote, but that the name change to Carters Lane predates the reference and so is not "the reason they changed it in the first place.
p25388
aV"
aVSorry if I misunderstood but I thought you meant "It may have been changed as Doctor Who fans kept nicking it due to the resemblance to the quote".
p25389
aVAnd thus my reply that "It was changed long before the quote existed and therefore that couldn't be the reason" makes sense.
p25390
aVDo we know the reason?
p25391
aVDid the residents just not like the name?
p25392
aVPossibly false advertising.
p25393

p25397
aVIs /r/RejectedTeletubbieNames a subreddit yet?
p25398
aVI imagine the people of Offley Bottom Farm, Wibbly Wobbly Lane, were tired of people thinking their address was a pisstake.
p25399
aVNo idea, I grew up round there and as far as I can remember it has always had the sign as pictured (I am 30).
p25400
aVI seem to remember a blog post which asked a local councillor who also said they didn't know the exact reason.
p25401
aVMy guess is that Wibbly Wobbley was just a local name and never official, and when they started putting road signs up in the area they added the local name to the bottom to avoid confusion.

p25430
aVPlus in the UK, giveaways are taxed higher than competitions
p25431
aVCompanies run the risk of running illegal lotteries unless they can demonstrate skill is involved within the competition.
p25432
aVHowever, these companies want as many people as possible to enter so lower the barrier of entry to such a degree that the result is amazingly obvious answers such as these.
p25433
aVAnd it works.
p25434
aVWasn't it settled a while back that these questions were considered a lottery and thus subject to the laws regulating them?
p25435
aVI don't think so, i've made a bunch of these (recently) and they're all obvious answers.

aV2 is just plain stupid 3 is too obvious to be correct.
p25475
aVI do not know, but I would hope so, as that would mean common sense would have prevailed. 
p25476
aVI think this applies to Ireland
p25477
aVSo how does it work with shows like the gadget show where they just say "text gadget to..." \u000aIs that not just a lottery? 
p25478
aVPretty sure it's only friends and relatives of the production crew that win the Gadget show stuff, there was a post on here a while back about it.. 
p25479
aVLink?
p25480
aVI'm sure it's legit, I know someone who won it.
p25481
aVLucky bastard 
p25482
aVWasn't that the case with another channel 5 show many years back, Brainteaser, where, although anyone could apply (and was encouraged to) to go on the show during and after every show, only the people that were connected in some way with the people running the show were ever chosen and it was, subsequently, cancelled and taken off air.
p25483
aVShame, I actually liked that show.
p25484
aVNah, that was one of the few not doing it on channel 5.
p25485
aVIt is possible that as fives owners, northern and shell operate the healty lottery, hoops have already been jumped through and it is easier to license.
p25486
aVHow the fuck has the gadget show not been bought by an actual good channel is beyond me.
p25487
aVHave you ever heard anyone say "oh that show on channel five was really good" in the last 5 years to anything but Gadget Show?\u000a
p25488
aVThe side effect is that stupid people think they're being clever by getting the right answer.
p25489
aVAnd some people still get it wrong, which is what they use a evidence of accused of running a lottery. 
p25490
aVIt's more complicated than that.
p25491
aVIf you run it as a giveaway, it is legally classed as a lottery.
p25492
aVWhich means you need to jump through a whole lot of licensing hoops.
p25493
aVMost of those hoops go away if you introduce some element of skill, turning it into a competition. 
p25494
aVI presume this was the same thing that the BBC ran foul of a few years ago?
p25495
aVwhen they had to cease all competitions?
p25496
aVThat was different.
p25497
aVMostly fake winners from the production team were used, usually to make up for technical difficulties with phone ins.
p25498
aVIn some commercial shows like Richard and Judy on Channel 4 the winner was selected while the phone lines were still advertised and open.
p25499
aVDon't forget ITV
p25500
aVThere was also an issue with people who called competition phone lines after they'd closed, heard the same "your vote has been accepted" message - but, as the line now goes, "your vote won't be counted and you may still be charged".
p25501
aVIIRC they'd not bothered to properly close the phone lines when they said they would, so there was a small window where people could still call and *think* they'd entered.
p25502
aVThen there was Channel 5's Brainteaser show.
p25503
aVAha, good to know.
p25504
aVStill, yet more reasons not to ever phone in for these things.
p25505
aVIt's actually more complicated than that.
p25506
aVThis falls under the prize competition and free draw part of the gambling act 2005.
p25507
aVI'm pretty sure they could replace that question with 'contact us now for your chance to win £10,000' and they still require no licensing, because they have the 'free' option of the postal entry and it becomes a free draw, Free is defined as normal rate in this instance, so a stamp is the normal rate to send a letter so the entry is classed as free.

p25511
aVDidn't know this.
p25512
aVExplains a lot.
p25513
aVStrictly speaking, would they not be considered a lottery if all people had to do to enter was pay a fee (via text)?
p25514
aVI believe that's the reason why the questions are so simple.
p25515
aVYou can enter all the ITV ones for free on the website.
p25516
aVI do a few every week but have never won.
p25517
aVWouldn't surprise me if they didn't even include website entries when picking a winner but as there are so many entries I'll never know.
p25518
aVI would like to know whether they include web entries too, or if I've been wasting my time for the last few years.
p25519
aVAnd hello fellow Cornish dweller.
p25520
aVI assume they have to if they are saying it's a form of entry.
p25521
aVThey do.
p25522
aVBut you're one in one hundred thousand.
p25523
aVThe chances of winning on these is ridiculously small.
p25524
aVIf each message is £1 and they are giving away £2500 cash, your chance is a *maximum* of 1/5000 since they have to earn the prize plus the cost of running the thing plus profit.
p25525
aV--edit-- i are gooder at words
p25526
aVNot to mention the gadget show.
p25527
aVThe competition they run everyweek will cost them like 15k, but probably make them 100k
p25528
aVDidn't they run afoul of this a few years ago though?
p25529
aVIf I can recall they got into serious trouble over their phone in competitions.
p25530
aVEveryone did, because it turned out that if you called after the end date you still got charged, but had no chance of winning.
p25531
aVHence the disclaimer "please don't call after the lines have closed as your vote won't count and you *may* still be charged".
p25532
aVHello and this is Dickinsons real deal and for today's competition we will sell this 1960s vase and whatever it sells for we will give that away!
p25533
aV*vase sells for £34*\u000a\u000a\u000awell that's no good!
p25534
aVlet's round that up to 40, stick a "0" on it, x4 and divide by 2.
p25535
aVyou can enter Loose women and Real Deal compos through their websites though
p25536
aVthanks captain obvious.
p25537
aVI remember a show years ago that had the question "what is the phone number you have to dial to enter this competition?
p25538
aV".
p25539
aVThis Morning doesn't even bother with a question, so even the *really* dumb housewives can enter.
p25540
aVThat's actually fairly honest.
p25541
aVIt's not like the question is a barrier to entry, it's about creating an illusion of a barrier to stop the half-interested brain from realizing the astronomical odds and comparing them to the prize.
p25542
aVThen again, there is that story about the text line that had Yes/No/I don't know options, and received thousands of people voting "I don't know".
p25543
aVSo maybe daytime TV is just watched by lots of thick people.
p25544
aVI was always under the impression it was for legal reasons.
p25545
aVIf you have a question then it is a "contest" with lots of winners, one of whom is chosen randomly.
p25546
aVIf you don't have a question then it is a lottery and is regulated as such.
p25547
aVThe question is so simple because they don't want anybody not to know the answer and not call.
p25548
aV&gt;That's actually fairly honest.
p25549
aVIt's not like the question is a barrier to entry, it's about creating an illusion of a barrier to stop the half-interested brain from realizing the astronomical odds and comparing them to the prize.
p25550
aV&gt;Then again, there is that story about the text line that had Yes/No/I don't know options, and received thousands of people voting "I don't know".
p25551
aVSo maybe daytime TV is just watched by lots of thick people.
p25552
aVIt's a legal matter.
p25553
aVIf you have a question, it's a quiz with a prize so no requirement for a license.
p25554
aVIf there's no question then you need to pay for a license as it would be a lottery.
p25555
aVAhhh, of course.
p25556
aVWell, the argument for it stands.
p25557
aVMaybe...
p25558
aVWas that The Haunted Fishtank?
p25559
aVThey always had hilarious questions.
p25560
aVYeah, pretty sure it was, came here to post this but I guess I got beaten to it.
p25561
aVEven saves you the bother of sorting the right answers from the wrong answers. 
p25562
aVSurely it's better to have a slightly challenging question.
p25563
aVOne that tricks the watchers into thinking they will get the answer right and have a good chance because other people might not know it, yet one that remains actually easy enough to get a lot of entrants.
p25564
aVIt's because these types of competitions are lotteries, but they're not allowed to run them as such (without a licence).
p25565
aVSo they have to throw a bad question on it to make it seem less so.
p25566
aVIt's the same with all these types of 'competitions'.
p25567
aVYep, sadly this is the right reason.
p25568
aVAnother of our silly Laws...
p25569
aVI suspect it's more to do with psychologically making people more likely to enter ("I know the answer so I have a better chance of winning").
p25570
aVI'm pretty sure they avoid the anti-lottery law by having the free entry option, notice the option to send in entries by post.
p25571
aVNope, they have to have an element of 'skill' to avoid being a lottery.
p25572
aVHence those "tell us in 25 words or less" competitions.
p25573
aVThat way they can pretend they're not just pulling it out of a hat.
p25574
aVThe "tell us in 25 words or less" competitions have another justification too: There's a well established psychological effect that gets people to align their beliefs with statements they make.
p25575
aVIf you write 25 words about how you *love* some product, some proportion of people will actually come to believe some of what they write, so it helps to improve brand loyalty.
p25576
aVIf it was just the skill bit, they'd just pick a stupidly simple multiple choice question like the TV competitions tends to do.
p25577
aVIt's something to do with it being a "test of skill" that sets it apart from a simple give-away.
p25578
aVIt's has to have an element of skill, if it's entirely chance based it's considered gambling (which i think would be illegal on tv).
p25579
aVGambling on TV is illegal?
p25580
aVAlso, it would be considered a lottery if it had no element of skill involved which would mean it would need a license.

aVI remember one a while back (seem to remember it being Tim Lovejoys chat show) taking the piss, with phone in questions like "which of these answers have played football for Scotland and cricket for England?
p25585
aVA) Kenny Daglish  \u000aB) Denis Law  \u000aC) Graeme Souness and Ian Botham"
p25586
aVIs the idea that someone can't play for two different countries or that one person can't play two different sports? 
p25587
aVPeople can play two sports, or for two countries.
p25588
aVIt's just that none of those 4 did. 
p25589
aVSo how can anyone answer it?
p25590
aV...
p25591
aVThe third one has two people in the answer.
p25592
aVOne who played football for Scotland, the other who played cricket for England. 
p25593

aVnone of those four did *both*.
p25595
aVOne did football and the other did cricket.

p25597
aVMaybe I didnt word the question exactly how they did, it was years ago.
p25598
aVyou got the gist of it though surely?
p25599
aVI thought these were illegal now, and you have to make it an actual challenge. 
p25600
aVThe one on BGT got me, it said what overlooks the houses of parliament, so I thought straight away, the queen as she oversees all of parliaments actions, but that answer didn't come up and Buckingham palace did, so I assumed it was that\u000aAnyway, the answer was Big Ben :/
p25601
aVThe Queen isn't a what and Buckingham palace is a couple of kilometres away from parliament... 
p25602
aVI think he'd confused overlook with oversee.
p25603
aVI know but I was sure it was talking about how our parliament works 
p25604
aVA small oversight

aVKilometres?

aVWe have an imposter, lads!
p25607
aV&gt; a couple of kilometres away from parliament\u000a\u000aIt's actually just about exactly 1 km from the visitor's entrance facing Parliament Square to the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace.
p25608
aVJust thought that was interesting.\u000a\u000a
p25609
aVThat probably is a challenge.
p25610
aVYes, for a very select few, but still a challenge nonetheless. 
p25611
aVThe only people this is a challenge for are blind with the TV stuck on mute, and they've still got a good shot at it!
p25612
aVStatistically, by not entering you're going to be better off so I suppose you could argue that the real challenge is deciding not to bother. 
p25613
aVNow that's wishful thinking.
p25614
aVI don't think so, This Morning doesn't have a question, it's just 'call to enter'.
p25615
aVIt is a challenge for the main viewer base of Dave.
p25616
aVThese things are just prize draws, you cant ask difficult questions these days due to the amount of information everyone has available to them because internet.
p25617
aVThey could ask how many times per weekend do Dave show Red Dwarf marathons that finish just after I realise they're on.
p25618
aVYou can't find that on the Internet!
p25619
aVIs it all of them?

aVIt is in fact, all of them.

aVYou win a luxury spa getaway for none, and a £5 giftcard for Harrods.
p25622
aVGreat!
p25623
aVDo i have to collect them in person from some random location in the west country?
p25624
aVYou have to book 184 weeks in advance, by which time said spa has changed ownership and won't honour previous bookings.
p25625
aVEnjoy your relaxing day!
p25626
aVThe giftcards have just expired, you didn't spend them in time.
p25627
aVOr how many episodes of Top Gear they've shown that week.
p25628
aVThey did try that once, but their systems crashed because they couldn't cope with processing numbers that high.
p25629
aVHow many times a week do they show that episode with the amphibious car, and why do I watch it every single time?

aVThe last time I saw The Gadget Show, they had abandoned the question altogether for their ridiculous prize draw - they just gave you the number to call or text.
p25648
aVFor the past series or two of The Gadget Show they haven't even bothered with a question at all.
p25649
aVRealise, they dont care about how many people get it right, they just want everyone to use the premium rate phone line to enter, the draw will run for a few weeks, maybe even months,people will think having the right answer gives them a chance, the reality is its a lottery and the phone call is the entry fee.Ask people to enter a lottery,they are less likely than a competition.
p25650
aVPlus gambling regulations and fees to deal with

p25656
aVFor the kind of person who spends money calling these phone lines, it probably is quite a challenge to answer that.
p25657
aVBetter question: [What do Americans think of when they hear the phrase "Dave TV"?

aVI remember on Heart they had a question that went along the lines of\u000a "In the 1966 world cup, what year did England win the world cup?
p25662
aV"
aVIs this Dave trying 'witty banter' again?
p25663
aVAlso, this seems a good place to mention how awful those Alpen adverts on Dave are.
p25664
aV"Character has eyes in the back of its head!
p25665
aVHello mountains.

aV" or something like that.
p25667
aVThey are so stupid.
p25668
aVThe one on BGT got me, it said what overlooks the houses of parliament, so I thought straight away, the queen as she oversees all of parliaments actions, but that answer didn't come up and Buckingham palace did, so I assumed it was that\u000aAnyway, the answer was Big Ben :/
p25669
aVEvery time this broadcaster comes to my attention, it makes me think of the video to David Lee Roth's *Just a gigolo*.

aVI think this was supposed to be a joke.
p25676
aVcolour is spelled with a 'u' in England.
p25677
aVzebra is pronounced in a ridiculous way in America and river is river.
p25678
aVIt's a little stab at American culture. 
p25679
aVAs a ridiculous American... How is zebra pronounced in the UK?
p25680
aVIs it like zeh-brah, where we say zee-brah?
p25681
aVI do remember the frustration long ago from some UK friends learning HTML when &lt;font colour="#ff0000"&gt; did not work.
p25682
aVI still sometimes trip over the American English in HTML/CSS.
p25683
aV"Why Isn't my text centre aligning?!
p25684
aVOh, {text-align:cent**er**;}".
p25685
aV[Spiffing CSS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7410915) can solve that though.
p25686
aVNice!
p25687
aVI have to imagine that Sir Tim was royally pissed off when some computer geeks in Illinois added a bunch of American English spelled words to his glorious HTML 2.0.\u000a
p25688
aV&gt;Is it like zeh-brah, where we say zee-brah?
p25689
aVIt is, yeah.
p25690
aVz is pronounced zed, so where you say zeebra we say zebra.
p25691
aVNow I'm wondering about other ze words.
p25692
aVWhat about zeppelin, zenith, zero, zest?
p25693
aVI (we) say zeh-pellin, zee-nith, zee-ro, zeh-st.\u000a
p25694
aVZee-nith?

p25710
aVAs poor as this is and indeed, it being just a rudimentary 'skill test' so that it's a quiz and not a lottery... at least it's not as bad as those late night call in quiz shows that went on for 8 hours and led to usually no-one winning anything, because the question was 'fill in the blanks to this phrase - THE ______ '\u000a\u000aOr the answer would be something no-one had ever heard of, so after six hours of people throwing money at RED ____ with alert, light, devil, rooster, etc... you'd find out the missing word was ecosystem or something.

aVMy granddad said "I bet someone either got fired or promoted for that"
p25714
aVI feel like TV contests have been like this for as long as I can remember (though this is an extreme example, I suppose).
p25715
aVBut stupidly simple questions for phone-in contests is definitely not a new thing.
p25716
aVThey have to have *some* kind of question to make it a "contest" rather than just a "giveaway" (there's probably some kind of legal distinction that means they'd have to pay more tax or something otherwise), but they still want as many people as possible to enter.
p25717
aVI mean, they get money every time somebody dials that number.

aV[Dave Station] (http://youtu.be/fFR0ZTxX9Vs)

aVThe questions they had at the end of CSI on C5 used to be questions related to the show you just watched.
p25720
aVThen they became questions that were just general knowledge.
p25721
aVThen they actually scrapped the question altogether - because "Which country is New York in?
p25722
aV" was too difficult - and made it simply "Ring this expensive number and give us your money and you might win something"
p25723
aVNone of the above.
p25724
aVThere is no singular 'America'.

p25743
aVThank you!                  
p25744
aVThe thread itself was funny enough but right about here is where I lost it.

aVBeen crying with laughter for the past 10 minutes....

aVglad to be of service. 
p25747
aVNone of the above, it's secret answer "D: Wearescammingyou"

aVSwiss/Belgian here, I cannot express in words how thankful I am that you have such amazing healthcare.
p25749
aVI slipped and fell on an outdoors stairwell on New Year's Eve this year in London (thankfully after I had partied enough), which left a big bleeding gash in the side of my head.
p25750
aVI passed out momentarily, a doorman hailed a cab, who got me to a hospital in a flash, and a few hours later I was out of the hospital with the wound patched up.
p25751
aVBest part: zero bills, zero hassle with my insurer.
p25752
aVHow are things different in Belgium/Switzerland? 
p25753
aVWell, in Switzerland, health insurance is mandatory, and my insurer only reimburses payments already made (which means that if I get hurt in the US, I get to pay myself first and then get reimbursed later).
p25754
aVI suppose a foreigner getting hospitalized in Switzerland would have to get their insurance involved, but I'm not 100% on it.
p25755
aVI don't think the patient would have to pay if they're uninsured, though.
p25756
aVDoesnt Belgium use a similar system to the French?
p25757
aVThe state is responsible for 2/3 the cost of treatement, the remaining 1/3 is provided by insurance, this leads to competition to lower prices while standards are maintained.
p25758
aVBelgium has one of the highest cancer survival rates in the world, my dad still goes back for his treatment there after having throat cancer 10 years ago.
p25759
aVI have no idea about Belgium's system, sorry.
p25760
aVI haven't lived there in the last twenty years, I only keep an eye on the political system from time to time.
p25761
aV&gt;  (which means that if I get hurt in the US, I get to pay myself first and then get reimbursed later).
p25762
aVSo what would happen if, say, you were in America and something went *badly* wrong?
p25763
aVLets say you ran up a £200k medical bill and you don't happen to have £200k lying around to pay the hospital with.
p25764
aVWhat happens then?
p25765
aVMy understanding is that the government funds healthcare for people with low incomes or certain disabilities ("Medicaid") and the elderly ("Medicare").
p25766
aVHospitals that receive government funding through those programmes (i.e., most of them) are required to provide emergency treatment to anyone, regardless of ability to pay.
p25767
aVIf you don't fit into any of those categories and can't afford treatment, then I think you just have to wait until your health problem turns into an emergency.
p25768
aVPretty much, yeah.
p25769
aVBut although they have to provide emergency treatment to everyone, that doesn't mean it's free (that'd be silly and socialist!).
p25770
aVInstead, they will bill you after the treatment.
p25771
aVIf you can't pay it, they will sue you for it, typically ending up with a payment plan based on your circumstances (perhaps at a much reduced, yet still difficult to afford price).
p25772
aVI'm Swiss and my sister used to work at a hospital and this is not an uncommon situation.
p25773
aVBasically they only help you to the point where your life is save and you're not really suffering too badly anymore.
p25774
aVThey won't let you ran up a 200k bill unless you can proof that you're with an insurance recognized by the hospital.
p25775
aVOtherwise you have to bring the cash upfront.
p25776
aVThe other side is the terror of needing to navigate another country's health system, perhaps in another language, while needing healthcare. 
p25777
aV&gt; I suppose a foreigner getting hospitalized in Switzerland would have to get their insurance involved, but I'm not 100% on it.
p25778
aVYes, sometimes insurance isn't enough because the hospitals don't recognize all insurance companies.
p25779
aVI think the insurance need to have a legal entity or partner company in Switzerland that gives a guarantee.
p25780
aVAs the costs for treatments can be very high and the hospitals don't have the capacity to track down insurance companies all over the planet, they're usually quite strict and require an upfront payment, bank guarantees or so.
p25781
aV&gt; I don't think the patient would have to pay if they're uninsured, though.
p25782
aVWithout insurance or upfront payment, they won't treat you beyond the point where your life is save.
p25783
aVAnd you will have to pay for that too.
p25784
aVSure, if you don't have any money at all, at some point they will have to let you go and it would be very hard for them to get your money back once you're back in your home country, so you could get away with it.
p25785
aVBut this is a rather exceptional situation.
p25786
aVUsually foreigners have to pay their bills before they can leave.
p25787
aVIf you are a UK citizen, the NHS will pay for any treatment abroad once you come back to the UK. 
p25788
aVDo homeless people have to pay or are they a burden of the state?

aVALSO all billing codes are different which is a nightmare.
p25793
aVTravel insurance WILL cover you and then once you're back they will try to get it back from your insurer.

aVhaving bills is a waste of time, you need to employ accountants and stuff do actually deal with money, it is much better for you to just get fixed up and sent home, it is the most efficient way. 
p25801
aVThe provider will then bill the CCG though.
p25802
aVJust because the patient doesn't get a bill doesn't mean there isn't accountants and finance. 
p25803
aVof course there will be accountants and finance, but there is a lot less so than there would be if every patient had a bill and insurance paperwork
p25804
aVTotally agree!
p25805
aVFuck yeah.
p25806
aVSo much this.
p25807
aVI love the NHS.
p25808
aVSame here, I refuse to vote for any political party that tries to break it by making it more "private".
p25809
aVNot the main three then... And certainly not UKIP!
p25810
aVWho do you vote for?
p25811
aVI haven't voted recently, but I wanted to (I won't explain in detail, but tldr; mistakes and fuckups).
p25812
aVSince I knew I wasn't getting to vote, I haven't thought about who to vote for in a while.
p25813
aVNext time I actually get a valid polling card I'll think about it.
p25814
aVLast time I voted for the Lib Dems though, and well..
p25815
aVI was a student at the time.
p25816
aVAs you can probably imagine I'm not going to vote for them again for a while.
p25817
aVAlso, UKIP run exactly counter to everything I stand for.
p25818
aVI absolutely abhor the scum.
p25819

p25838
aVWell, Walter's motivation for making money (at least initially) wasn't to pay for medical bills.
p25839
aVHe was a teacher and would have had excellent health insurance through the teacher's union and would have only paid for a miniscule portion of his medical care.
p25840
aVHis motivation was to leave a monetary legacy for his family, which ultimately mutated into leaving a legacy to the world that would show them what he was truly capable of.
p25841
aVBut the reason he needed to leave that money was because of the cost of payment - it would have eaten up savings/pensions so he needed to replace it.
p25842
aVInstead of those long scenes of the family eating dinner it would be him sitting in the waiting room.
p25843
aVFrom previous discussions on the NHS vs the US systems, waiting times are quite similar and depend far more on the individual hospital/service than country.
p25844
aVAye, it's very noticeable there.
p25845
aVLots of other forums are similar too.
p25846
aVFor example, with cochlear implants, its a similar thing.
p25847
aVThe problem is that the NHS falls down on specialist care, if you can pay in America you have much better odds for cancer than you do here. 
p25848
aVI was under the impression from this post that the US don't have better cancer healthcare than the UK do.
p25849
aVThey do if you can pay for it.
p25850
aVTo be fair, if you go private, so do we.
p25851
aVThere are some treatments which are very expensive and are not available on the NHS
p25852
aVOh right I see.
p25853
aVI'd assume that for he people who can get it it's better in America...but a lot of people can't afford treatment, so that brings down the average quality...because they get 0 quality
p25854
aVNo they do not.
p25855
aVSpecialist care on the NHS is as good as anywhere.
p25856
aVThey start to refuse when people go in asking for boob jobs.\u000a\u000a
p25857
aVIt just isn't.
p25858
aVCancer care is terrible here, the drugs are just too expensive. 
p25859
aVThen how did two members of my family get cured of cancer by the NHS?
p25860
aVYou're talking bollocks mate.
p25861
aVCancer care on the NHS is good.
p25862
aVHow come I know four who died.
p25863
aVIt depends on the type and location of the cancer.
p25864
aVFor example bone cancer and pancreatic cancer are virtually untreatable using current NHS drugs.
p25865
aVMany palliative drugs (perhaps with good reason) are withheld because they are deemed "to expensive" for the extra months they give people. 
p25866
aVI don't know why you're getting downvotes this is accurate.
p25867
aVPeople try and make the point that Breaking Bad couldn't happen in the UK because Walt wouldn't have the pay for his treatment.
p25868
aVThe whole point was that he went to a specialist oncologist that cost more money.
p25869
aVThere are lots of treatments/drugs etc that NICE deem not worth spending NHS money on, in the US you'd pay a huge insurance premium and be able to get those.
p25870
aVI rather the UK system but it's crazy to make out that it's not without its downsides. 
p25871
aVYeah, pretty anything experimental is happening in the US, especially in prosthetic research.
p25872
aVDid you see the article on the bionic hand?
p25873
aVProbably the biggest breakthrough is the advanced mental sensors, you could control a wheelchair or one of the upcoming exoskeletons even if you are totally paralyzed.
p25874
aVUnfortunately this is all prohibitively expensive for the NHS at the moment. 
p25875
aVKey thing is, it is also prohibitively expensive in the US.
p25876
aVIf you get private insurance in the UK you can get drugs the NHS won't give you, and its basically the same in the USA.
p25877
aVAlso, most of the advances in myoelectric prosthetics are coming from [Europe](http://www.intorobotics.com/three-advanced-bionic-hands-designed-with-the-sense-of-touch/) with the UK currently leading the way.
p25878
aVThat's why we also have BUPA.
p25879
aVAfter being diagnosed with type-1 diabetes a couple of years ago, I was pretty shocked by the culture of US-dominated diabetes forums.
p25880
aVThere's a very stark divide between the haves and the have-nots: loads of people use insulin pumps (which cost several thousand pounds a year and are not normally funded by the NHS), while many of the rest are constantly worrying about insulin prices and sharing tips on where to get it cheap.
p25881
aVSad to see a lot of "but if you can afford it, you can get the best medical care in the world!

aVYeah but poor people are poor for a reason, right?
p25885
aVThey must be *super lazy* - said the rich person who inherited millions of dollars.
p25886
aVI find it stupefying how a lot of Americans still defend their current healthcare system.
p25887
aVI think a large part of it is that too many people are easily manipulated into believing that a universal healthcare system is socialism, and that socialism is evil. 
p25888
aV[this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/28ci0q/us_health_care_ranked_worst_in_the_developed_world/) is pure gold.

aVIt's like eating a mars bar in front of a starving African child refuge. 
p25894
aVRampant individualism and the American Dream - they genuinely believe that people achieve what they deserve in life.
p25895
aVTaxing the rich to pay for the healthcare of the poor is taxing the deserving to give to the undeserving.
p25896
aVThe best bit is when some of the poor have been brainwashed so much that even they are outraged at the idea of commie free healthcare.
p25897
aVThat's some impressive big brother shit right there.
p25898
aV\u201cSocialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.\u201d
p25899
aVIt's not strictly true though.
p25900
aVSocalism and even communism were pretty big there at the beginning of the 20th Century; there was a large and aggressive labour movement which helped introduce many of the protections and benefits of which Americans still enjoy a (smallish) proportion today.
p25901
aVFor example, they were the "armed wing" which provided the threat that helped the trade unions push for the New Deal.
p25902
aVIt was the Cold War and McCarthyism which ultimately did for them (Stalin didn't help of course).
p25903
aVThat is a great quote.
p25904
aVWhere is it from?
p25905
aVEither a paraphrasing or misquote of John Steinbeck by Ronald Wright in 'A Short History of Progress'. 
p25906
aVAmericans have a greater fear of government than we do,  they hate the idea of the government controlling their health care and reducing their choice on what they can get.
p25907
aVI don't think it's a great system at all but they do develop a lot of medical technology and have access to the best care in the world even if it does cost a fortune. 
p25908
aV&gt; they hate the idea of the government controlling their health care and reducing their choice on what they can get\u000a\u000aThe funny thing is, I'm sure nobody over there is advocating the abolition of all private healthcare, just the addition of a single payer, tax-funded system.
p25909
aVAn extra option - more choice, more freedom.
p25910
aVWhat's interesting is they actually spend more on healthcare than we do.
p25911
aVThe USA has the worst of both.

p25916
aV)
aVI live in the US so talk about this a lot.
p25917
aVOne big hurdle I feel is that so many people think national healthcare is all about helping poor people get something they haven't worked for.
p25918
aVI try so hard to explain that national healthcare does benefit the poor... but it benefits the not so poor, the middle classes, the upper classes - basically everyone except the very richest who can pay for cancer treatment in cash.
p25919
aVEvery single person I discuss it with would save money, have less stress and better outcomes with national healthcare, but they're too busy making sure poor people don't get something for free.
p25920
aVIt is because their state run services get the worse of both worlds.
p25921
aVThey pay the inflated prices the drugs companies can charge when not faced with a national monopoly.
p25922
aVThen they get all the problems of the state.
p25923
aVThe US actually spends per person as much on state health care as we do.
p25924
aVIt only covers 50m or so people.
p25925
aVI can understand them being sceptical when their state health care is 6 times the cost of ours per person it actually serves.
p25926
aVReforming the system in the US is much more involved than going single payer.
p25927
aVOn the surface they are simply right when they say having the government pay for everything won't fix the problems.
p25928
aVThey need reform of IP rights and stronger protection from drug monopolies.

aV[deleted]
p25930
aVIt depends on what you mean: public spending or overall personal healthcare expenditure.
p25931
aVWhen it comes to public spending (money spent by the government), the US is about equal to the UK on per capita terms.
p25932
aVThe really disgusting stat is the overall healthcare expenditure: Americans spend around *three to four times* what the British/most Western European nations do.
p25933
aVIt might be.
p25934
aVIIRC it was about 10% of their GDP goes on Medicare and similar.
p25935
aVThey spend a further 8% on private healthcare.
p25936
aVbut medicare only covers 15% of the population\u000a
p25937
aVThat is about right yes.
p25938
aVThey spend as much per person (across the whole population) as we do on the NHS but it only covers 15% of their population.
p25939
aVI don't have the statistic right now, but I remember reading somewhere that it was like 18% of the US GDP
p25940
aV10+8=18
p25941
aV18% is for their whole health system.
p25942
aVThat's exactly what it is.
p25943
aVAlso a lot of Americans are seemingly bonkers.
p25944
aVAmericans think what they're told to think.

aVPride keeps them from doing anything with any degree of honesty with themselves.

p25947
aVHealthcare and Education are two things that should always be out of the hands of the Free Market and I will be willing to fight Torys, Lib Dems and UKIP every step of the way to keep it that way.
p25948
aVSince when do Lib Dems want to privatise NHS?
p25949
aVAs am I but the only way we can stop the recent spur in NHS privatisation is to repel the 2012 health and social care act which I'm not sure any of the ConLibLab parties would do. 
p25950
aVLabour have committed to repealing it.
p25951
aVAndy Burnham also wants to roll the care sector in to the NHS to create a national care service. 
p25952
aVI don't disbelieve you, but can you provide a source for this?
p25953
aV[It's only a partial repeal](http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/policy/burnham-sets-out-plans-for-repeal-of-health-act/5063697.article#.U6AEOPldUpg) but Labour has committed to repealing the clause which allows for competition with the NHS.

aVJust knowing the words to search for helps a great deal!
p25956
aVThe labour party that was happy to have private involvement when they were in power.

aVNo one knows exactly what UKIP wants, as they prefer to rely on their branding to carry them, rather than actual content.

aVUKIP's policy is they'll fix everything and make it free market while keeping the service nationalised and not making any specific promises.
p25975
aVPolicy is usually horse shit, doesn't matter what party.
p25976
aVWhen a party get in they get in they do what they want, not what they promised.
p25977
aVProblem is UKIP hardly even have that, so how can we judge what they'll do?

aVThe catering is run by Branson (essentially), the cleaning is done by a private firm.
p25995
aVIf they do it in little bits like that, people on the whole don't generally notice.

aVYou missed out 'naively leftist'
p26025
aVBetter naively leftist than naively rightist.
p26026
aVBoth have led to tyranny, mass death and war in the past.
p26027
aVTo argue one is objectively worse than another seems strange.
p26028
aVThe naivete of communists in believing in collectivisation led to almost ten million deaths in Russia, and tens of millions of deaths in China.
p26029
aVThe naive belief amongst fascists that they had a right to takeover 'lesser' countries led to tens of millions of deaths as well.
p26030
aVPerhaps the leftists have better intentions.
p26031
aVBut in practice the reality has often been just as brutal.  
p26032
aVBecause taking the extreme points as your comparison misses the reality of the mainstream politics.
p26033
aVThe conservative governments of the UK (and Aus, USA, Canada etc) are despicable anti environment big corporation supporting, welfare hating, racist, xenophobic rich white men who have no desire to make the world a better place.
p26034
aVMeanwhile, the Labour/Democrat governments are just a little bet less than of all of that than the Conservative governments.
p26035
aVMost people's ACTUAL political position is far more left than what governments implement, so we should be voting between Labour and Greens in order to get what we want.
p26036
aVWhy does you party always have to be right, and the right-wing always wrong?
p26037
aVI could just as easily argue that those right wing governments look past the naivete of the left and attempt to free economy and business to grow so we have a chance of catching up to and/or staying ahead of Asia and South America in the global economic race of the 21st century.
p26038
aVI could just as easily say that pouring billions into inefficient environmental programs would be a colossal waste of money at a time when our governments are deep in debt and other countries are catching up.
p26039
aVI could just as easily argue that allowing mass immigration is damaging at a time when many are still unemployed.
p26040
aVI could just as easily argue that many Green policies, for example, such as their transaction tax or their nuclear policies, are so laughable from an economic perspective that they would damage our countries' finances for decades if they were implemented.
p26041
aVWhy are you the arbiter of righteousness?
p26042
aVWhy do you get to decide who people can vote for?
p26043
aVAnd as to your point about people being Left of governments, that's only partially true.
p26044
aVMany would like to see rail and power nationalisation, certainly, but they would not be for further authoritarian leftist laws on political correctness, or banning/restriction on junk food or sugar levels, for example, not to mention much higher taxes or further immigration.   
p26045
aVBecause you only need to compare USA to Scandanavia.
p26046
aVAny politician trying to move us more towards the USA is fucked, and any politician keeping us generally on the track of the scandanavian countries is doing alright.
p26047
aVThe UK is largely doing alright..it has plenty of issues, every country does, but it has welfare and medical cover for everyone.
p26048
aVMedical cover once again shown to be one of the best in the world, just like Aus (where I'm from), but I'm sure your conservatives are trying to take money away from your great system and make you more USA like...the worst system on the planet (considering their outcomes vs cost).
p26049
aVSo while you want to think that the right ring parties "can just as easily argue", I've seen enough of those 'arguments' to know that they are purely ideological spouting, and very sparse on the actual evidence.
p26050
aV"freeing up the economy" sounds like a great idea, except that it results in boom-bust cycles, and scams/rip offs/cons by the wealthiest who lack regulation (GFC anyone?
p26051
aV) and abuse of the poorest.
p26052
aVHooray, the rich get richer, and the poor get fucked some more.
p26053
aVBut the GDP has gone up, right?!
p26054
aVToo bad the rising number of poor people mean more crime and more theft.
p26055
aVDon't worry, the rich can afford personal guards, they'll be fine!
p26056
aVToo bad about the middle class though.
p26057
aVThey keep being robbed, and attacked by the poor.
p26058
aVAnd now the middle class are getting poorer thanks to no minimum wage and ongoing abuses and scams by the banking class.
p26059
aVNow we have no middle class.
p26060
aVOh shit, now there is no one for the rich to sell their shit to.
p26061
aVAnd the whole system collapese.
p26062
aVDon't worry.
p26063
aVYou can blame it all on immigrants and the poor though.
p26064
aVIt was probably their fault for wanting to live good honest meaningful lives.
p26065
aVNo.
p26066
aVI'm not buying it.
p26067
aVConservative politicians are ideological arseholes with no real connection with reality.
p26068
aVThere's nothing more naive than a right-winger.
p26069
aVThe huge gaps in the reasoning of a true right-wing person just defy all logic.
p26070
aVI'm reading Friedrich Hayek's "Road to Serfdom".
p26071
aVApparently, Hitler was a socialist (despite his professed belief that he was saving Germany from socialism) and all "progressives" are closet communists.
p26072
aVI started reading it because it's supposed to be the great monetarist work which underpins Thatcherism.
p26073
aVI was hoping it would change my views in some small way.
p26074
aVBut it just comes across like partisan politics raving against any who dare oppose the supremacy of unbridled capitalism.
p26075
aV&gt; Hayek\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; monetarist\u000a\u000aI though Hayek was more Austrian school?
p26076
aVMilton Friedman loved Hayek, and based a lot of his monetarist thought on Hayek's ideas.
p26077
aVYes, I believe Hayek would have described himself as Austrian school, but that label is not really relevant today, while monetarism (which is received with reference to Hayek) is.
p26078
aVI wanted to start with the beginning.
p26079
aVFriedman was heavily critical of a lot of Hayek's economics though.
p26080
aVHis review of Prices and Production is famously very negative.
p26081
aVBesides things like:\u000a\u000a&gt; based a lot of his monetarist thought on Hayek's ideas\u000a\u000ais hardly unique to Friedman.
p26082
aVA lot of mainstream economics outside of pure monetarism has adopted a lot of Hayek's ideas (price signalling for instance is a mainstream position). 
p26083
aVHaving been born after Thatcher left office, yet wanting to find some degree of understanding of the economic landscape surrounding the changes Thatcherism has wrought upon this country, I see Hayek as the beginning.
p26084
aVThatcher herself slammed a copy of "the Constitution of Liberty" onto a desk and declared to her cabinet: "This is what we believe!
p26085
aV"\u000a\u000aMy academic background is physics.
p26086
aVI don't have the time to go back all the way to someone like Adam Smith and study the whole of economics.
p26087
aVFor the economics of the UK, reading Keynes and Hayek seems like the logical starting point.
p26088
aVNo that's fair enough, I didn't mean to come across as critical.
p26089
aVI would probably recommend *A Monetary History of the United States* if you are interested in the reasoning behind monetarism, which did seem to be applied to an extent in the UK given the emphasis on the control of inflation in the 80s.
p26090
aVThe thing with Hayek is that things like *Road to Serfdom* will tend to be more political science rather than pure economics.
p26091
aVWhich of course is not a reason to rule them out, but if you want an *economic* summary may be slightly tangential.
p26092
aVAlso, read some of Hayek's other work- it's not all strict capitalism.
p26093
aVHe seemed to be in favour of a UBI/negative income tax (Friedman also favoured the latter) as I commented elsewhere. 
p26094
aVThanks for the pointers.
p26095
aVOf course Hitler was a kind of socialist, he was leader of the National Socialists after all.
p26096
aVSocialism isn't a monolith, it incorporates a vast array of often contradictory ideologies.
p26097
aVNazi style groups often tend to have collectivist policies -- after all they do advocate total state control.
p26098
aVToo much power to the private sector would undermine them.
p26099
aVThe political spectrum is better thought of as a circle, the extremes of left and right often look as alike as the centres. 
p26100
aV&gt; The political spectrum is better thought of as a circle, the extremes of left and right often look as alike as the centres.

p26106
aVA lizard.
p26107
aVFascism was originally considered "the third way", since it is neither laissez-faire nor communism.
p26108
aVTo his credit, Hayek does explain the idea of socialism as alternatively describing a means and an end: an end which everyone agrees is a good thing, but a means which he to be discredited.
p26109
aVHe describes the means as "centrally planned state economy", which Hitler's National Socialist party clearly did not institute.
p26110
aVPrivate ownership was alive and well in Germany, [with most corporatists toeing the line and profiting directly from slave labour](http://archive.adl.org/braun/dim_13_2_forgetting.html#.U6ALrPldUpg).
p26111
aVAll that said, I certainly wouldn't consider the NSDAP to be "right-wing", since that represents laissez-faire economic freedom.
p26112
aVThey are the perfect example of an authoritarian centrist party.
p26113
aV&gt; Fascism was originally considered "the third way", since it is neither laissez-faire nor communism.
p26114
aVAt the time of the rise of fascism and nazism, socialism/communism, liberalism and conservative ideologies were already well established.
p26115
aVSo third way?
p26116
aVFourth if we're being generous, but in reality the ideological landscape was already vastly more fragmented.
p26117
aVYou may be thinking of Third Position, which was an extreme right, ultra nationalist set of related ideologies that could be seen as proto-fascist/nazist.
p26118
aVTheir argument was that they were against both socialism and capitalism, and took ideas from both.
p26119
aVHowever Third Position groups are generally ultra-nationalist and pro-racial segregation, and while they are notionally "anti capitalist", they were/are "anti-big-capital" and "anti-capital-owned-by-brown-people" rather than against all forms of capitalist economy.
p26120
aVSome refer to Third Position as a precursor for Apartheid, for example, as it is probably the closest an actual government has gotten to Third Position politics.
p26121
aVIn the UK, Third Position split out of National Front to form "Official National Front" (and later went through a number of renamings) at some point in the 80's I believe.
p26122
aV&gt; He describes the means as "centrally planned state economy", which Hitler's National Socialist party clearly did not institute.
p26123
aVThe idea that socialism requires a planned economy is an idea one often finds drawn out of a lack of knowledge of socialist ideologies - not even authoritarian socialist ideologies like Leninism/Stalinism are intrinsically tied to a planned economy, and many libertarian socialist ideologies are specifically either opposed to it, or contradicts it in principle (as many libertarian socialist ideologies takes Marx' discussion of the "withering away of the state", ironically made most famous by Lenin's discussion in State and Revolution, seriously, and sees the dismantling of central power as a vital).
p26124
aVA centrally planned state economy was something the Bolsheviks didn't intend either.
p26125
aVIt became doctrine as a result of the wartime economy put in place because of the European powers supporting the White's in the civil war.
p26126
aVSpecifically, the original policy of central planning was called "War Communism" and was the official Bolshevik policy until 1921 and was a pure "survival mode" to keep things running during the civil war.
p26127
aVIn 1921 it was replaced by "New Economic Policy" which remained in force until Stalin replaced it with increased collectivisation in 1928.
p26128
aVNew Economic Policy actually *loosened up* on the government control of the economy (Lenin described it as "state capitalism"), and Lenin intended it to last for decades to help develop and prepare the economy.
p26129
aVThe full step back to central planning was supported mainly by Stalinists and Trotskyists.
p26130
aVMany other socialist ideologies explicitly favour the use of markets for resource allocation.
p26131
aVBut in the SSSR, non-authoritarian socialist ideologies were either already outlawed, or about to get you executed, towards the end of NEP.
p26132
aV&gt; All that said, I certainly wouldn't consider the NSDAP to be "right-wing", since that represents laissez-faire economic freedom.
p26133
aVThey are the perfect example of an authoritarian centrist party.
p26134
aVThat requires employing a rather novel left-right wing axis.
p26135
aVLiberal and libertarian ideologies started out to the left of conservative groupings by the original left/right grouping: The left were originally those that supported republicanism in the French parliament, while the right where monarchists.
p26136
aVIn fact, in several European countries you find this even reflected in party names.
p26137
aVIn Norway, for example, the liberal party is name "Venstre" (literally "Left") and the conservatives are names "Høyre" ("Right").
p26138
aV*Some* laissez-faire parties get placed on the outer right - generally certain forms of right wing populist parties where the main draw of laissez-faire is tax-cuts.
p26139
aVLaissez-faire first came to start being associated more with the right after 1848 when the capitalist part of the European left sought out the monarchist right to forge alliances against the working classes, which is how we came to get the right-wing libertarian construction of being for the reduction of government interference *except* in the enforcement of property rights.
p26140
aVThat Laissez-faire is seen as a "right wing" thing is a modern phenomenon, because "our" modern right consists of a merger of the original monarchist right and parts of the centre-left, while libertarian socialist ideologies were marginalised from the early 1900's until after the fall of the Soviet Union.
p26141
aVHitler *did* on occasion talk about taking parts from socialism, but then again he was in good German right-wing tradition in doing so: The worlds first "proper" welfare system was introduced by Chancellor Bismarck.
p26142
aVHe was "accused" of being a socialist by other parts of the right over it, but made the argument that it was a necessary means to undermine the socialist parties, by giving just enough to pacify the working classes, and then he adopted the "slur" his opponents had used against his policies by explicitly referring to his policy as "state socialism".\u000a\u000a
p26143
aVThank you for this post, it makes a lot of things extremely clear for me.
p26144
aV&gt;You may be thinking of Third Position, which was an extreme right, ultra nationalist set of related ideologies that could be seen as proto-fascist/nazist.
p26145
aVApologies, I have no formal economic education so the jargon is a little hard for me to grasp at times.
p26146
aVThis proto-fascism of racist capitalism sounds very familiar to me when I read accounts of National Socialist economic practices.
p26147
aV&gt;The idea that socialism requires a planned economy is an idea one often finds drawn out of a lack of knowledge of socialist ideologies \u000a\u000aI don't necessarily disagree, but your position here diverges rapidly with the position stated by Hayek in TRTS.
p26148
aVAs I'm sure it's clear, my thoughts on what socialism "is" are not in agreement with Hayek's.
p26149
aV&gt;That requires employing a rather novel left-right wing axis.
p26150
aVI would smugly argue that the left-right axis is a poor comparison of different views of political though, in an effort to avoid having to defend something I know relatively little about.
p26151
aV&gt;Laissez-faire first came to start being associated more with the right after 1848 when the capitalist part of the European left sought out the monarchist right to forge alliances against the working classes, which is how we came to get the right-wing libertarian construction of being for the reduction of government interference except in the enforcement of property rights.
p26152
aVI see, but is this appropriate when one is attempting to consider the modern, post-1848 right wing where laissez-faire is usually the rule and not the exception?
p26153
aV&gt; He was "accused" of being a socialist by other parts of the right over it, but made the argument that it was a necessary means to undermine the socialist parties, by giving just enough to pacify the working classes, and then he adopted the "slur" his opponents had used against his policies by explicitly referring to his policy as "state socialism".
p26154
aVDoesn't that return to my original objection, that Hitler cannot be accurately described as a socialist?
p26155
aVThese words are really just labels, not religious dogma, so surely they only hold value based on how accurately they describe ideas.
p26156
aV&gt; I don't necessarily disagree, but your position here diverges rapidly with the position stated by Hayek in TRTS.
p26157
aVI'm not surprised.
p26158
aVFor a consideration of how silly the idea of socialism as requiring state control, consider that during the period of the First International (the International Working Men's Association), exactly the issue of the role of the state was the foundation for a major power struggle in the organisation, between Bakunin and Marx.
p26159
aVThe main difference between Bakunin and Marx was that Bakunin saw the destruction of the state as an immediate goal, while Marx saw the state as a temporary tool for restructuring society, until it would "wither away".
p26160
aVBakunin explicitly rejected state power as too dangerous, and this is now one of the defining characteristics of anarchism - both socialist and non-socialist forms.
p26161
aVBut Bakunin was clear that he was a socialist _and_ anarchist.
p26162
aVThus even before considering that major tendencies within Marxism either explicitly rejects central planning, or is open to decentralised or market methods, one of the two major factions in the first international socialist organisation explicitly wanted to make centralised planning impossible by removing any central authority.
p26163
aVIf one assumes that Hayek is talking about "Soviet socialism", his argument may be reasonable, but then it also applies only to a small subset of socialist ideologies, and even within "Soviet socialism" it only really applies with Stalin onwards.
p26164
aV&gt; I would smugly argue that the left-right axis is a poor comparison of different views of political though, in an effort to avoid having to defend something I know relatively little about.
p26165
aVThat we can agree with.
p26166
aVThe left-right axis works best if you simply treat it as an indication of the historical development of ideologies.
p26167
aVWithout that, it gets messy very quickly.
p26168
aV&gt; I see, but is this appropriate when one is attempting to consider the modern, post-1848 right wing where laissez-faire is usually the rule and not the exception?
p26169
aVPretty much none of the dominant right wing parties in Europe are strongly laissez-faire, so I think so.
p26170
aV"Social conservatives" in particular tend to not stomach laissez-faire very well, since it would involve stripping away most laws founded in moralistic concerns where they interfere with business.
p26171
aV&gt; Doesn't that return to my original objection, that Hitler cannot be accurately described as a socialist?
p26172
aVThese words are really just labels, not religious dogma, so surely they only hold value based on how accurately they describe ideas.
p26173
aVThat part we agree on.
p26174
aVI just disagreed with details about why, and had a strong urge to procrastinate ;)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p26175
aVThanks for your posts.
p26176
aVGood luck with whatever you're procrastinating away from!
p26177
aV&gt; Of course Hitler was a kind of socialist, he was leader of the National Socialists after all.
p26178
aVThat's a ludicrous argument.
p26179
aVBy this line of reasoning, North Korea is a democratic state.
p26180
aVAfter all its name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
p26181
aVThe name in itself is just a label.
p26182
aV&gt; Socialism isn't a monolith, it incorporates a vast array of often contradictory ideologies.
p26183
aVHere we agree.
p26184
aVCase in point: In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels devoted a whole chapter to bitching about forms of socialism the did not agree with, ranging from utopian socialists (Fourier, Owens etc.
p26185
aV), to "reactionary socialists" that argued for the use of socialist policies, often either out of morality and/or as a means of pacifying the working classes, while propping out feudal power structures (Bismarck and his social welfare program could possible be argued to fit into this category).
p26186
aV&gt; Nazi style groups often tend to have collectivist policies -- after all they do advocate total state control.
p26187
aVThere's nothing about collectivism that makes an ideology more or less socialist.
p26188
aVMany socialist ideologies are explicitly individualist.
p26189
aVMore relevant to evaluating nazism this way, nazism explicitly put the protection of private property rights high on their agenda.
p26190
aVIf Hitler was in any way "socialist", it was in the way a feudal lord was "socialist": He subordinated society and its members to the state.
p26191
aVWhen you belong to the state, rather than the opposite, the state has a vested economic interest in providing a certain level of care for you: You're an asset; if you die or stay sick you can't meet your duties to the state.
p26192
aVIf you use the word "socialism" the way Marx used it, it may not then be unreasonable to describe this as "reactionary socialism".
p26193
aVBut Marx' point with this classification was to tear them a new asshole by pointing out that despite the superficial similarities, these ideologies were actually actively damaging to the economic and political interests of the working class.
p26194
aVOf course pretty much nobody uses "socialism" that way today anyway - the meaning started shifting already in the 1840's and 1850's.
p26195
aVThe NSDAP were explicitly trying to capitalise on the word to draw in working class voters, while at the same time appeasing other parts of society with Hitlers insistence that "their socialism" had nothing to do with Marxist socialism.\u000a\u000a
p26196
aVAccording to that type of ideology the main political conflict is not seen in the traditional left/right way, for them it is seen as individualism vs collectivism.
p26197
aVThe Road to Surfdom is primarily an argument against any Type of total collectivism (fascism, socialism or communism).
p26198
aVOne of the problems I see with Serfdom's reasoning is that it equates fascism, socialism and communism, in essence as well as outcome.
p26199
aVIt equates them in practice.
p26200
aVIt's the same as when a Marxist always tells you that no states were ever really Communist etc... and of course that's true.
p26201
aVBut that clearly suggests that the system doesn't work if out of 30+ attempts, none have succeeded.
p26202
aVHayek looks at the concepts both in theory and (perhaps more significantly) their implementation in practice (ie what the layman considers communism or socialism to be), and that is more relevant imho to real life. 
p26203
aVBut that begs the question; "does process matter less than outcome?
p26204
aV"\u000a\u000aThere is so much variation within both ideologies that the two do not have equal implementations in practice: does China today look like the Soviet Union under Stalin?
p26205
aVBoth claim to be socialist states.
p26206
aVThey certainly do not provide the same lifestyle for the common man. 
p26207
aVCertainly there are differences.
p26208
aVI would argue modern China rejected Socialism of any sort (either national socialist or marxist socialist) the moment Deng Xiaoping stood outside and announced that 'to get rich is glorious' or whatever it was he said exactly.
p26209
aVMao was ideologically very Marxist, far more so in fact than Stalin or even Lenin in many ways.
p26210
aVBut that fervour died with him in many respects, China today is just a good old fashioned oligarchy run by a Party Elite.
p26211
aVIf one was to look at the political scale as  'statist' on one side and 'liberal' on the other, then China (due to its economic freedoms and the fact that you can leave if you want) is significantly further to the right than Stalinist Russia (or Maoist China for that matter).
p26212
aVBut it is nowhere near as liberal as our own democracies.
p26213
aVWhat I am arguing is that on said scale, both Fascism and Socialism in practice tend significantly towards the left hand (or statist) side.
p26214
aVThey both stand for government control of society and to a degree, the economy.
p26215
aVBy contrast, the far right hand side of the scale would be dominated by Anarchism and Libertarianism.
p26216
aVTwo ideologies that are quite different in their relationship with property, for example, but share a fundamental distaste for the State.
p26217
aV(I often find, quite humorously, that my Anarchist and Libertarian friends have more in common than they might at first think).   
p26218
aVMarxism wasn't the only form of socialism.
p26219
aVHitler hated Marxism, which he saw as dominated by Jews and Intellectuals.
p26220
aVHe also hated "Bourgeois Liberal Democratic Capitalism", which he also saw as dominated by Jews of a different sort (ie bankers).
p26221
aVHitler and Mussolini both disliked Capitalism, but they saw it as useful in terms of organisation and distribution in order to win the great war of expansion they planned.
p26222
aVMussolini coined totalitarianism in saying that everything should be under the State.
p26223
aVHe and Hitler simply saw it as being taken over on a longer term basis than on the day they took power, as the Marxists did.
p26224
aVBut in many ways they were very similar.
p26225
aVBoth National Socialism and Marxist Socialism are fundamentally based upon the collective will of the people executed through the total control of the state.  
p26226
aVWhich is usually all their beliefs are pinned on- the idea that 'Well, I've done ok out of this system, and I'm going to bloody well agree with it, because of my subjective preference for maintaining the status quo, or perhaps even tipping it further in my favour'.
p26227
aVWhen that is the true root of all your beliefs, expect a lot of your opinions to be coated in bullshit.
p26228
aVHayek actually had some rather radical ideas though.
p26229
aVFor instance I think\u000a\u000a&gt; The assurance of a certain minimum income for everyone, or a sort of floor below which nobody need fall even when he is unable to provide for himself, appears not only to be wholly legitimate protection against a risk common to all, but a necessary part of the Great Society in which the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of the particular small group into which he was born\u000a\u000awould go down quite will with the UBI crowd. 
p26230
aVShame that part was ignored.
p26231
aVMuch like religious texts, people will just use academic works to back up their own agenda rather than listen to everything they have to say.
p26232
aVGetting lectured by a Leftist on logic, hahahahaha.
p26233
aVBrilliant.
p26234
aVLet's give full socialism another pop guys!
p26235
aVIt's only killed hundreds of millions of people so far!
p26236
aVWhen did I imply I wanted to begin a faux-communist dictatorship?
p26237
aVI'm not aligned to anything, but anyway, the NHS is socialism, and it's one of the only good things left in our country that hasn't yet been fed to the parasites.
p26238
aVYou claim to possess logic, but then you take the word 'privatised' which in this context means 'privately provided', and interpret that to mean privatised as in pay at the point of use.
p26239
aVThis is dumb as shit at best, and dishonest at worst.
p26240
aVThere have been no hints at people even paying for crutches.
p26241
aVNo where have the Conservatives said anyone pays directly for anything.
p26242
aVSo the medicine is still socialised.
p26243
aVIt doesn't need to be provided by a huge monolithic institution to be free at the point of use.
p26244
aVYou must surely know that even state-owned does not mean automatically free at the point of use.
p26245
aVWhen the state owned trains we all paid for tickets still. 
p26246
aVYou must be on some other plane of anti-logic, because you seem to be defining the words 'privatised' and 'privately provided' when their meaning was not being debated, and now telling me about crutches.
p26247
aVSorry, what?
p26248
aVIf you had learned to read properly, you might have read that I simply said the NHS was a socialist system, because at present, it is.
p26249
aVI also said I was not aligned to anything. 
p26250
aVSo you bleating on about how Right wingers are inherently anti-logic is you being unaligned with anything.
p26251
aVRiiiiight. 
p26252
aVBeing blindly pro-capitalist (in the modern sense) and all the bigotry that comes with being right wing (in most cases) means I don't agree with many things that right wing people say.
p26253
aVI have plenty of opinions, and those opinions are shared by people from lots of different political ideologies.
p26254
aVI don't really stand by any set of ideas 100% and the world would be better if more people did that.
p26255
aVThey seem to be fairly rooted in the idea that the healthcare itself is the best in the world and it's just the finances which are screwing them over.
p26256
aVAre some of them just completely ignoring the table in the article?
p26257
aVThe United States didn't come first in *anything*.
p26258
aV&gt;Are some of them just completely ignoring the table in the article?
p26259
aVNo, their position is the care is first-class for the *have*s, and they want to ignore the *have-not*s
p26260
aVAnd yet if you mention that their system is far from the best anywhere on reddit you get bombarded with "Anti-American circlejerk" and "It's the best healthcare anywhere ever, it's just expensive" comments until you want to delete your account.
p26261
aV"but you pay taxes" is the one I get bombarded with whenever healthcare comes up in discussions. \u000a\u000a
p26262
aVUS citizens pay a higher %age of GDP to cover the cost of Medicare &amp; Medicad than we do for universal health care for everyone.
p26263
aVSo, in tax terms they all pay more than we do already
p26264
aVI'm a fan of that one also.
p26265
aV"Hurr durr you pay taxes so it's not free healthcare" Yeah, still get my healthcare cheaper than you do.
p26266
aVAnd all the cretins saying:\u000a\u000a"I don't want to pay for all the moochers.
p26267
aV"\u000a\u000aOr the classic:\u000a\u000a"I'm a fit and healthy 18 year-old.
p26268
aVWhy should I have to pay for other people's medical bills?
p26269
aV"\u000a\u000aCrazy doesn't begin to encapsulate such lines of thought.
p26270
aVIt's selfishness at the root of it.
p26271
aV&gt; "I'm a fit and healthy 18 year-old.
p26272
aVWhy should I have to pay for other people's medical bills?
p26273
aV"\u000a\u000aThat's as loopy as saying, "I've never needed to call the Police, so why should I pay taxes to maintain the service?
p26274
aV"\u000a\u000a
p26275
aVYep.
p26276
aVAnd the crazy thing is, a bunch of people would actually agree with that statement.
p26277
aVMy favourite part is how some of them are trying to save face by saying we have the worlds biggest obesity crisis and stuff.
p26278
aVAs someone who has been with the German the French and the UK system, I'm not supprised.
p26279
aVNot because the others are bad, far from it, but the NHS always struck me as particularly effective and efficient.
p26280
aVSuer there are parts from the continental services that I would have liked to have, but the same goes the other way.
p26281
aV10th in healthy lives ffs - go for a run you fat fucks!
p26282
aVRunning to the chippie now...
p26283
aVUsed to run to the video store but no need for that anymore.
p26284
aVNo need to run anywhere with the internet.
p26285
aVAll I do is stay indoors on the internet and then kill myself on a treadmill running nowhere... indoors.
p26286
aVThe obesity epidemic in the UK is actually embarrassing.
p26287
aVI am generally annoyed that we have so many fat people here in the UK.
p26288
aVPeople being lazy, greedy fucks costs us [billions a year](http://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/obesity_and_health).
p26289
aVI do believe that if you're fat enough to need extra NHS support or even hand outs from the gov and you're doing nothing to tackle your weight then you should be ashamed of yourself. 
p26290
aV&gt; I am generally annoyed that we have so many fat people here in the UK.
p26291
aVSorry.
p26292
aVWhat annoys me more is when people claim that 'diets do not work', rather than looking at the actual reasons why people put on weight after dieting.
p26293
aVIt's a lack of willpower.
p26294
aVAll people have to do to lose weight is eat less.
p26295
aVIt's not difficult to eat what you want and still lose weight, but the amount of people I know who jump onto the latest fad diet, like the 'juice diet', lose some weight and then immediately rebound back is ridiculous.
p26296
aVYou don't need to sacrifice all the food you enjoy to lose weight, and it shouldn't feel like punishment, but I suppose years of stuffing their faces full of cake, pies and sugar means they know more about this subject than I do.
p26297
aVPhysics dictates that you cannot gain weight if you take in less energy than you require.
p26298
aVThis is a very basic 'formula' that a lot of people seem to think is bullshit.
p26299
aVAnd all this is disregarding the fact that obese people are known to over-report the amount of exercise they do, and under report the amount of calories they take in ('I only eat 1000 calories a day but I keep gaining weight').
p26300
aVIt's generally good advice to disregard what someone says about their own body when it comes to calorie intake:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454084\u000a\u000a*The failure of some obese subjects to lose weight while eating a diet they report as low in calories is due to an energy intake substantially higher than reported and an overestimation of physical activity, not to an abnormality in thermogenesis.
p26301
aV*
aVA surprising amount of people have an unhealthy relationship with food - bordering on an addiction.
p26302
aVIndeed certain foods activate the 'pleasure centres' in the brain [\u005c[1\u005c]](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2013/06/26/ajcn.113.064113.abstract?sid=44ef5031-b040-4501-8e93-af85301d69c6) , in a similar manner to addictive substances.
p26303
aVIt seems a little unfair to chalk this up to just a 'lack of willpower', and say 'just eat less'.
p26304
aVDo you think telling an alcoholic to 'just stop drinking' works?
p26305
aVI may have worded it poorly.
p26306
aVOne of my points is that dieting doesn't need be the removal of every type of food you like.
p26307
aVCake isn't inherently bad for you, but having 6 large cakes a day wouldn't be a great diet.
p26308
aVWhen you want to lose weight, you could eat McDonalds every day and still lose weight (but this would introduce temptation, I admit).
p26309
aVIt's not so much about what you eat, but how much you eat.
p26310
aVAgain, this type of addiction can be improved by weaning yourself off slowly.
p26311
aVAs you take a few snacks out per week, you'll slowly stop gaining weight, and then as you become more proactive about portion sizes, you'll gradually lose weight.
p26312
aVThe real problem is when you switch from having 10,000 calories per day from sugary sweet foods, to eating small salads every meal.
p26313
aVYes, it is effective at losing weight, but our bodies are conditioned over time.
p26314
aVJust as you put on weight over time, your appetite can be conditioned.
p26315
aVThe problem with proper obese people is that they become seriously psychologically addicted to food.
p26316
aVMost of them understand very well that they are massively unhealthy.
p26317
aVBut it's that cliched spiral of being unhappy because you're fat, and food being a quick fix that makes you happy again.
p26318
aVSimilar to drug addiction.
p26319
aVWe should just give them free NHS heroin and be done with it.
p26320
aVYou won't eat much when you're smacked-up.
p26321
aVIt will balance itself out eventually.
p26322
aVProbably cheaper than a gastric band.
p26323
aVYes I am a doctor.
p26324
aVThis is a problem for a lot of people.
p26325
aVPeople focus on carbs, protein fat unnecessarily.
p26326
aVA lot of people base their food choices on fat content rather than calorie content because they misunderstand their roles in weight gain.
p26327
aVThey also tend to buy into crap like "no carbs after 7pm" and other such nonsense.
p26328
aVSo they end up focusing on the wrong things, then complain that diets don't work and give up.
p26329
aVObviously some simple research would clear this up for them but they seem to be averse to that. 
p26330
aVI just came back from living the Netherlands, now I can't help but notice how unhealthy the average person in town looks. 
p26331
aVEveryone in the Netherlands looked really healthy and glamorous when I went last year.
p26332
aVBig difference compared tot he UK\u000a
p26333
aVTerribly dressed, though.
p26334
aVSeriously, I don't understand how the Dutch have such an epidemic of awful dress sense.
p26335
aVIt's astonishing.
p26336
aVreally?
p26337
aVIt's certainly different but I wouldn't say awful.
p26338
aVBut saying that, I'm studying Physics so my views on fashion sense are probably opposed to that of the general population...
p26339
aVThey have all taken power clashing to heart.
p26340
aVThey all wear those shiny black puffer jackets.
p26341
aVWhat's that about?
p26342
aVI saw someone wearing one in Bristol the other day and bet my partner they were Dutch, and they were.
p26343
aVSo strange...\u000a\u000aEdit: [Picture, for reference.
p26344
aV](http://www.footasylum.com/images/products/medium/049405.jpg)
p26345
aVYeah exactly, they all do things on the weekend too.. things other than shopping I mean.
p26346
aVIt's really refreshing, I plan on moving back there asap. 
p26347
aVWeird thing is that they get fed up on lots of milk products as babies.
p26348
aVOh man, that's what I'm missing the most.
p26349
aVYogurt drinks galore, not like we have them here - I'm totally addicted and having dairy withdrawals.
p26350
aVAlso, its totally normal for a couple of old men to be sitting around a cafe bar drinking glasses of milk at 8 in the evening.
p26351
aVSounds like a work for the Netherlands tourist/dairy association...\u000a
p26352
aVWe would see many taking milk with their lunch (kaas, of course) in the office cantine.
p26353
aVWe would joke about the baby nederlanders being contamined with Bovine Growth Hormone from all that dairy, hence growing to 185cm and above.
p26354
aVThere might be an awkward truth in that, it would explain a lot! 
p26355
aVTheir tendency to cycle everywhere helps a lot, and having the best cycling infrastructure in the Europe in turn encourages that.
p26356
aVAbsolutely.
p26357
aVCycling is much more popular in the UK now, probably thanks to Bradley Wiggins, we just need some intercity cycle paths now so that they don't all get run over! 
p26358
aVjust go into any town and the take aways are always rammed\u000a\u000alike chicken places are always so full\u000a\u000aAs a country we have a problem with food.
p26359
aVThey do cost more whilst they are alive but they also die earlier which I believe balances out the cost more.
p26360
aVLast time I was in hospital I'd say 9 out of the 10 people on the ward were 70+.
p26361
aVThe guy in the best opposite me had been in for a year!!
p26362
aVThey were having a big gathering for him leaving and the nurses were crying and stuff.
p26363
aVSo yeah, the biggest problem we're facing in terms of NHS budget is old people.
p26364
aVWe should be encouraging people to smoke and over eat!
p26365
aV(not entirely serious there, but you know, dying early saves the NHS a lot of money). 
p26366
aVYeah there are huge savings to be made just from stopping everyone being so overweight.
p26367
aVAs someone who recently lost a fuckton of weight, I can also attest to the fact that losing weight is really really easy.
p26368
aVLike I was embarrassed at how people were saying how good I looked because literally all I did, was only eat when I was hungry.
p26369
aVWhich was easy.
p26370
aVCurious question, are you a bloke?
p26371
aVFor women, it's generally much harder to lose weight this way.
p26372
aV(Our bodies seem to be obsessed with holding fat to prepare for potential babies) I say generally, because some people are different.
p26373
aVI eat much like you do but although I'm very slowly losing weight I'm not having drastic losses or anything.
p26374
aVWhy would you want to eat when you weren't hungry?
p26375
aVPeople are obsessed with eating three meals a day right?
p26376
aVWell basically, and I'm not saying this would work for everyone, but if I wake up in the morning and I'm not hungry, I don't eat anything, if by 11 I'm a bit hungry I'll eat something small, see how long it takes for me to get hungry again, then I'll just have a sandwich or something for lunch, but in the evening I won't have a massive meal I'll just eat something small again, to stop me feeling hungry, but sometimes if I've gone out for lunch or something I won't be hungry at all so I won't eat anything.
p26377
aVbut the key is I just eat to stop me being hungry.
p26378
aVOther than that, I don't eat and I don't eat more than I need.
p26379
aVI find eating a small amount stops me feeling hungry for several hours, so yeah...
p26380
aVBoredom. 
p26381
aVBecause food is fucking amazing.
p26382
aVunhappiness
p26383
aVBoredom.
p26384
aVIt's always boredom.
p26385
aVErr because cake is amazing?
p26386
aV&gt; People being lazy, greedy fucks costs us billions a year\u000a\u000aNo, they die at a younger age, saving money on pensions/benefits, and I suspect it mostly balances out.
p26387
aV(A lot of fat people are heavy drinkers - so that's loads of alcohol tax going to the government too)\u000a\u000aPeople just love to hurl hate at fat people, as it's too socially unacceptable to hurl it at anybody else these days.

aVIt's a finger pointing epidemic.
p26390
aVEveryone wants to be able to blame everyone else for their issues.
p26391
aVOur bodies are cruel, and they're all different.
p26392
aVYou just have to work with the cards you've been dealt.
p26393
aVIt is not impossible for anyone to lose weight, but obese people would rather blame companies whose sole purpose is to sell their food.
p26394
aVIt's ridiculous frankly.
p26395
aVThere was an article about this, where a doctor called Coca Cola hypocrites for funding an anti-obesity campaign.
p26396
aVHypocrites?
p26397
aVThey never said to drink 5L of coke a day until you get obese and/or diabetic.
p26398
aVIt's sad when those who are supposed to be logical abandon all logic.
p26399
aVI don't really like defending big companies, but they are trying to sell their products.
p26400
aVSaying that their product made you obese is just another way of saying that you have absolutely no fucking willpower. 
p26401
aV&gt;I don't really like defending big companies, but they are trying to sell their products.
p26402
aVSaying that their product made you obese is just another way of saying that you have absolutely no fucking willpower.
p26403
aVPersonally, I can say that I have resisted cocaine and heroin and have even managed to avoid tobacco.
p26404
aVWhen companies are using teams of psychologists to try to sell stuff to you, it is much harder.
p26405
aVWe are evolved as opportunistic eaters to like sugars and fatty foods (our ancestors didn't always have plenty).
p26406
aVIt isn't surprising that a percentage of people are caught by this.
p26407
aVI agree that they use increasingly devious tactics to sell their products and make us want them, the thing is that until we turn into lifeless drones, we do have control over our actions.
p26408
aVGoing cold turkey is also not a great way, it just gives an even more intense craving.
p26409
aVMy main problem with obesity is when people say it's due to genetics and such, as well as blaming companies for selling their products.
p26410
aVI hate to sound like a self help program, but the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting it.
p26411
aVIf one believes it is not one's eating habits that has caused one to be obese, then this person will never change his/her eatings habits and go in search of other people or things to blame.
p26412
aVBut essentially, I agree with what you've said.
p26413
aVI think we basically agree, but I do feel that perhaps the companies themselves have a role to play, or at least regulation.
p26414
aVYes, in the end it is down to the individual but once addicted, it really is harder to break that habit, whether crack or sugar.
p26415
aVAnother of the problems the left refuse to address is the class issue.
p26416
aVThere was a post on this sub the other day that i cant currently find due to reddits shit searching system but it was about us having the fattest women in Europe.
p26417
aVThat article at one point essentially said 'is it class related?
p26418
aVYes, but we're not going to address that'.
p26419
aVNow you could argue that those who earn less cant afford healthier foods, but is everyone below the poverty line obese?
p26420
aVNo.
p26421
aVIf some can stay healthy then im sure the others can.
p26422
aVThere is a culture of ignorance in the UK and thats especially when it comes to staying healthy. 
p26423
aVIt's more about education than social inequality.
p26424
aVIt's also about food being one of the few things poorer people have to reward them selves.
p26425
aVYou can't afford a holiday, or a nice car, or a nice house, or a new pair of shoes, or to go to the cinema, so a fish supper it is then.
p26426
aVWent out with six friends the other night, I was the only one not overweight.
p26427
aVTwo of them are currently suffering from joint problems because of their weight, and the NHS (rightly) won't provide treatment until they lose the weight.
p26428
aVNo sympathy for them.

p26445
aVDidn't work out so well for Rik Mayall.
p26446
aV:-(
p26447
aVIt's actually surprising to me, considering how much TV and media we consume that demonises being fat, that we are still all so unhealthy.
p26448
aVEndless TV shows about losing weight with tables full of a week's worth of terrible foods aimed at shaming this episode's victim into going for a jog and yet there's no change in society.
p26449
aVCelebrity Fit Camp, Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat *et cetera ad infinitum*.
p26450
aVIt's on the news all the time; there can't be any person who isn't aware that being fat is unhealthy, a growing problem in the country (pun absolutely intended) and what to do about it...and yet people don't do anything.
p26451
aVThe best way for the NHS to save money is to make the country healthier.
p26452
aVThe Department of Health needs to invest money into health campaigns to keep people out of hospital thereby killing 2 very overweight birds with a single stone. 
p26453
aVI think many people just think 'fuck it' in the face of unachievable self-image.
p26454
aVNot sure this is a particularly sophisticated point I'm raising, just noting that certain nigh unobtainable aesthetics aren't necessarily aspirational.
p26455
aVMy gym is doing a biggest loser thing, with diet plans, fitness programmes, etc for £15
p26456
aV&gt; It's actually surprising to me, considering how much TV and media we consume that demonises being fat, that we are still all so unhealthy.
p26457
aVSo maybe it's time to reconsider the pervading wisdom that the best way to deal with obesity is to make fat people feel shit about themselves, then?
p26458
aVYou may think that is a lot, but what is much, much more pervasive are adverts showing beautiful, shiney, delicious food.
p26459
aVEVERYWHERE.
p26460
aVIt is in every ad break, billboard, magazine, it sponsors every sporting event, music event, general gathering of people to some description.
p26461
aVAlso you have to remember that most of us work at very boring sedate kind of jobs, and we tend to think about food more when we're bored, so people graze and snack without realising. 
p26462
aVMore emphasis on P.E in school.
p26463
aVIt should be every day, not once or twice a week.
p26464
aVThere should also be investment in after school sports teams.
p26465
aVNot enough emphasis is put on physical activity and education surrounding health was at least bare bones when I was at school.
p26466
aVEvery day?
p26467
aVMy school didn't have the time/space for that.
p26468
aV1 hour PE lessons were phased out however once they realised it gave us about half an hour or less of actual PE between set up and getting changed.
p26469
aVBut I agree, PE needs reforming.
p26470
aVWe need more non-competitive things as well.
p26471
aVI'm not going to enjoy a game like football if I can't compete at all, especially when everyone else takes it so seriously.
p26472
aVSeriously, sports clubs, sports day and other PE related things are dominated by a small minority of students who are very good at it.
p26473
aVI'm not advocating the "everyone gets a medal" mentality but I kind of gave up on most of PE when it became clear that I was a detriment to whatever team I was on and would get excluded by others for being so shit.
p26474
aVBest PE for me was hockey with this one teacher who was a complete cunt.
p26475
aVHe shoved everyone who wasn't good in his eyes to one side and ignored us, playing with the others.
p26476
aVMost fun games I've played without that prick breathing down my neck.
p26477
aVIn primary school we had PE every day, 1-2 hours.
p26478
aVIt was probably because they didn't have anything better for us to do but it did make for a healthy class.
p26479
aVPE was horrible.
p26480
aVIt put me off sports for life.
p26481
aVAnd yeah, I'm a fatty now.
p26482
aVSchools need to give kids a chance to learn to *enjoy* sport, not force them to play rugby in the rain after being bullied in the changing rooms.
p26483
aVAnd there is more room for improvement.
p26484
aVI am not criticising the NHS, more the people who run it.
p26485
aVThe staff and doctors are demoralised and confused every few years when a new system comes in, whether it be hierarchical structure, training systems or accountability and all of this wastes money.
p26486
aVThe second problem is with those people who criticise it, this totally demotivates and demoralises the workers leading to poorer care and a worse system.
p26487
aVI think that the NHS is a wonderful institution but the half of my family that work for it say that change needs to be made about how it is perceived in the public and that a change in system doesn't always equal improvement.
p26488
aVEDIT: Rephrased to make the point clearer
p26489
aVITT: People using anecdotes to claim the statistics are wrong...\u000a\u000aThat great British pass time of never accepting that we're ever good at anything.
p26490
aVMost of the complaints can be nullified by pointing out we were ranked 3rd in timeliness and 10th in healthiness (only 1 above the US).
p26491
aVApparently the good heavily outweighs the bad...
p26492
aVImagine if we spent an extra $1,000 per capita, like France...
p26493
aVI think that 3 in timeliness would go up a bit :p
p26494
aVThe NHS is an excellent institution that I will fight to save from Tory and Lib Dem destruction. 
p26495
aVNo matter who is elected in the next general election standards in the NHS will suffer.
p26496
aVIt's not about left/right or ideology.
p26497
aVIt's about economics.
p26498
aVWe have an aging population.
p26499
aVIn order to maintain standards, the NHS budget will need to be heavily increased.
p26500
aVHowever we also have an enormous debt, and we continue to run a large deficit.
p26501
aVSo far the current government has halved it.
p26502
aVBut if we wanted to break even as a country, we'd need to see the other half of the deficit removed as well.
p26503
aVEvery single one of the main stream parties has committed to tackling the deficit.
p26504
aVNone of them will fund the increase that the NHS needs to maintain care standards.
p26505
aVWhen you blame individual parties, as much of this thread does, then you are missing the big picture.
p26506
aVWhen you indulge in petty point scoring, you are standing in the way of really understanding the serious problems the UK faces, and should your favoured party win the next election, they will inevitably disappoint you.\u000a\u000a
p26507
aVYou realise that it was Labour who began the process of privatising the NHS?
p26508
aVIf your idea of fighting for the NHS is voting for Labour, you are in for a nasty surprise. 
p26509
aVThe survival of the NHS is a healthcare issue, not a party political one.
p26510
aVWhilst it is reasonable to brand the coalition with wanton destruction of [the wonderful NHS](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/06/16/once-again-u-s-has-most-expensive-least-effective-health-care-system-in-survey/?tid=rssfeed), and also to blame New Labour for getting the ball rolling, it remains a healthcare issue and trying to reduce it to a mere argument about how one behaves at the ballot box is a bit shallow.
p26511
aVI agree only to an extent, only because no matter who gets in out of the big 3 parties, the NHS is set to be flogged off for the profit of unaccountable entities.
p26512
aVThis is a highly political issue, health provision always will be.
p26513
aVI totally agree it is a highly political issue, but styling it a *party* political issue is missing the point a bit.
p26514
aVHence my argument that the debate should be about healthcare, not voting intentions.
p26515
aVSadly, I also agree that political and financial expediency means that Lib/Lab/Con are all likely to shaft the NHS :(
p26516
aVthe culture that brought about PFI is to blame.
p26517
aVThe NHS is dying by a thousand cuts of privatisation.
p26518
aVI heard a really interesting idea a little while back.
p26519
aVSomeone suggested that the NHS should be made separate from the government but state owned, like the bank of England.
p26520
aVHopefully this would keep actual senior healthcare workers in charge of the NHS, rather than politicians who tend to have a pretty tenuous grasp on healthcare at the best of times. 
p26521
aVWow, that would be great if they could do that for education too!
p26522
aVNo more Gove-travesties.
p26523
aVI really know quite little about what the coalition has done with the NHS, can someone explain to me what it is they've done that causes people to say they're privatising it?
p26524
aVLike most voters of all parties these days.
p26525
aVNEW Labour.
p26526
aVThe rebrand was more than a name change, it was a lurch to the right to try and and soak up all voters that had previously put Thatcher into no.10 3 times.
p26527
aVLabour under Ed Milliband is more of a brownite old labour party, which if you want to keep the NHS safe, is an infintely better choice than the lib dems and Tories.
p26528
aVI'm not against private if it is proven to be more beneficial.
p26529
aVWhat I am against is the biggest top down reorganisation of the NHS ever just so it is setup for ypur mates to tender for the profitable bits of our NHS.
p26530
aVIt was a smash and grab and left community care decimated.
p26531
aVIt will take years to recover from it, but I have faith in the commitment of NHS staff to see it through, as long as the voters recognise the urgency.
p26532
aVI used to work in NHS Blood and Transplant and I doubt that a single person didn't think that reorganisation was needed.
p26533
aVWhether what they are doing now is right or wrong, there is so much wastage and unnecessary middle-management in the NHS which deserves to be cut.
p26534
aVI don't mean doctors and nurses and hospitals, just the bureaucracy and pencil pushing.
p26535
aVLarge institutions are always in need of some sort of reform.
p26536
aVIt doesn't matter whether it's a large business, bank or the public sector, some vast part of it will be crap and inefficient.
p26537
aVThe important question is if it's effective in it's entirety.
p26538
aVGiven that the OP's graphic shows us spending the second least amount of money to give the best healthcare, the NHS is absurdly efficient.
p26539
aVBeing more efficient than others doesn't mean that you are 'absurdly efficient'.
p26540
aVThere's always room for improvement.
p26541
aVThe NHS is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but from spending a week in an institute you can see  money bleeding out of the walls which could be saved.
p26542
aVThe reorganisation didn't cut waste.
p26543
aVIt created whole new bureaucracy in the CCGs and CSUs.
p26544
aVIf anything it's costing more, they made everyone redundant and hired the back on higher grades.
p26545
aVIt's a mess that isn't being reported. 
p26546
aV[deleted]
p26547
aVIt's more difficult I think when these decisions have a human at the end of the with life and death at stake.
p26548
aVPeople tend to be more risk averse I these situations.
p26549
aVI'm not saying it's right but I can understand it.
p26550
aVI have been a couple of times in the German system:\u000a\u000a&gt;there is so much wastage and unnecessary middle-management in the NHS which deserves to be cut.
p26551
aVYes, the NHS may have room for improvement, but imagine an environment where every aspirin has to be billed to a patient and that bill cross checked by an insurance company.
p26552
aVGovernment meddling isn't going to solve the problems of unnecessary bureaucracy and middle management though is it?
p26553
aVIt's like putting Weightwatchers in charge of helping anorexic people...\u000a\u000aA huge top-down reorganisation is exactly what the NHS didn't need, surely?
p26554
aVYou don't get rid of bureaucracy by creating more...Top down policies are what RESULTS in bureaucracy and time-wasting exercises.
p26555
aVIt's not like the culture of box ticking came from the cleaners or regular nurses, it came from the higher-ups...
p26556
aVIf you want to get rid of waste, the workers at the bottom should be making the decisions.
p26557
aVThey work in the sector, they know what's a waste of time and what isn't.
p26558
aVThey know which managers do fuck all and which are actually doing an important job.
p26559
aVUnfortunately bottoms-up reorganisation doesn't result in huge government contracts going to party donors/politicians, so it isn't going to happen.
p26560
aVIf the government is too shit to improve the NHS they should stay out of it altogether. \u000a
p26561
aVThere are at least 70 Labour Lords and 14 Labour MPs who have interests and Investments in companies that would benefit from greater NHS privatisation. 
p26562
aVThe chances are, most people with savings indirectly have "investments in companies that would benefit from greater NHS privatisation".
p26563
aVIf those companies stopped growing/being profitable then their banks/investment managers would just put their money elsewhere.
p26564
aVThere are all people who have direct investments or links with private companies who would gain from NHS privatisation, such as Owen Smith, who was a former lobbyist for Pfizer, or Frank Field, who is a director of Medicash Health Benefits Ltd, a private health insurance company.
p26565
aVI judge someone by their actions not by what they own.
p26566
aVSo you condemn Tory and Lib Dem members for:\u000a\u000a&gt;the biggest top down reorganisation of the NHS ever just so it is setup for ypur mates to tender for the profitable bits of our NHS.
p26567
aVBut not Labour members for the exact same thing? 
p26568
aVYou have a somewhat rational stance, however it may also result in you remaining more than just a few steps behind those with interests that negatively impact yours.
p26569
aVConflict of interest is a shield to protect not a preventative measure; once certain choices and actions have been made it can otherwise be difficult to reverse them.
p26570
aVYou just sound like you don't want to say anything other than Labour is good for the UK.
p26571
aVLabour is better than the Torys for the NHS.
p26572
aVThat's all I'm trying to say.
p26573
aVOk, better.
p26574
aVBut they're still not good for the NHS.
p26575
aVNo party is.
p26576
aVthere is no way private will be more beneficial.
p26577
aVbillions of pounds will be drained out of the system in dividends and bonuses.
p26578
aVand then when it breaks, the government will foot the bill, because it is a necessary service.
p26579
aVlook at what happened with G4S and the olympics .
p26580
aVfirst - due to budget cuts, you send some policemen home, thank you for you service etc.
p26581
aVthen you need more security for the Olympics, so you pay a third party A LOT  of money to hire under-qualified guards.
p26582
aVincluding iirc 250M in management bonuses.
p26583
aV(as opposed to the iirc 500M management overhead - because hiring 10000 minimum wage wrkers for three months doesn't cost anywhere near the money G4S  got.
p26584
aV)\u000aTHEN they screw up and the police and my are called to fill the gap for a cost that greatly exceeds the original budget cuts.
p26585
aVwould you say that you are in favour of privatizing the police or the judicial system?
p26586
aVhow about the fire brigade ?\u000a\u000a
p26587
aVI'm not in favour, I'm just not counting it out as an option.
p26588
aVI like to consider as much as I can.
p26589
aVThe idea of a profit motive where life and death is concerned do go against my gut instinct though for reasons you mentioned. 
p26590
aVWell labour are the only main party committed to ending the current privatisation of the NHS. 
p26591
aVThey cannot.
p26592
aVWe have already agreed to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal, which Labour supported, and which opens up  NHS contracts to bidding from private firms from both the EU and US.
p26593
aVHow do Labour propose to end any further privatisation while we are still bound by this deal? 
p26594
aVSimply not true.
p26595
aVNo deal has been made and Andy Burnham said that any Labour support depends on an NHS exemption.
p26596
aVhttp://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/02/andy-burnham-nhs-must-be-exempted-eu-us-free-trade-agreement
p26597
aV&gt; Andy Burnham said that any Labour support depends on an NHS \u000aexemption.
p26598
aVSince when has Labour stuck by it's pre-election promises?
p26599
aVThey have a hard enough time meeting their manifesto commitments, yet alone isolated statements by individual spokesmen.
p26600
aVIndividual spokesman?
p26601
aVHe's pretty much the architect of the party's health policy and has been stuck on repeat for the last 3 years in saying that the first thing a Labour government would do is scrap the reforms.
p26602
aVJust google 'burnham scrap nhs reforms.
p26603
aV' \u000a\u000aIf you think the party would let their principle member on the issue be this categorical without having the intention of backing him up, then I don't think you understand how political PR works.
p26604
aVLabour heavily trades on its reputation as the NHS custodian. 
p26605
aVThe last labour government hardly stopped the march of privatisation, they embraced it.
p26606
aVJust like how they didn't renationalise the railways after promising to do it. 
p26607
aV&gt; has been stuck on repeat for the last 3 years in saying that the first thing a Labour government would do is scrap the reforms.
p26608
aVJust google 'burnham scrap nhs reforms.
p26609
aV' \u000a\u000aI suspect they will scrap the NHS reforms.
p26610
aVIsn't it traditional whenever a new minister comes into power, from any party (even the same party as his predecessor) to scrap half the current policies and then replace them with a whole set of new ones?
p26611
aVHowever we were talking about TTIP, and I haven't detected nearly the same level of commitment in this area.
p26612
aVThe Labour party broadly supports the treaty, and is beholden to many of the same vested interests that created it.\u000a
p26613
aVSeeing as Labour was the party who started the whole privatisation process, I have my doubts that they will do much to stop it now. 
p26614
aVI very much doubt that the Shadow Health Secretary would make statements like this one:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/political-news/burnham-promises-labour-will-repeal-health-reforms-in-first-queens-speech/20004431.article#.U6AU8ZSwJuA\u000a\u000aif he then had no intention of following through on it.
p26615
aVLabour left the NHS in pretty good shape and the protection of a universal health service is far too important to the party's reputation for them to go back on the kind of promises being made.
p26616
aVThe TTIP has not been finalised.
p26617
aVIt's still in the the negotiation phase, and after that it will have to be ratified by individual parliaments.
p26618
aVHowever I agree that it represents a threat.
p26619
aVWe haven't agreed to it yet, it can be repleased.
p26620
aVCheck 38degree as of yesterday for the current campaign
p26621
aVAll 4 of the main parties will privatise our NHS
p26622
aVThe Greens certainly wouldn't? 
p26623
aVBut they're 5th
p26624
aVAnd they are represented in the Commons and they run a council.
p26625
aVThey are the fourth most powerful party. 
p26626
aVI'm not really out to disprove that, just the way I view it altho green did better than lib dem in euro recently, lib dem are still in power, and ukip definitely did better than green\u000a\u000aBut this is all semantics.
p26627
aVOf the 5 parties, only greens won't privatise NHS.
p26628
aVThey are the only party to vocally oppose ttip
p26629
aVWell Labour have vowed to repeal the health and social care act, the only argument against that is 'I don't believe them', which can be used against any party on any issue. 
p26630
aVBut even then, its only greens that we can't cite a reason why we don't believe them as they haven't been in power and ignored their pledges
p26631
aVWell you could say that every other party had reneged on pledges so the Greens probably will as well.
p26632
aVThe point still stands that of the three main parties, if you don't want the NHS to continue to be privatised then Labour are your only choice. 
p26633
aVAll other parties have so greens probably will, well they are separate for the right reasons there\u000a\u000aAnd yeah if you omit green from the equation then labour are your least worst choice
p26634
aVAgreed.
p26635
aVThe NHS has saved the lives of three of my family.
p26636
aVI owe it to the NHS to fight for it.
p26637
aVSaved my life three times and I'm only 30!
p26638
aVThe NHS is our greatest monument to the WW2 generation.
p26639
aVThat generation went thru the war, and came out wanting to create a better, fairer Britain, and the NHS is a cornerstone of this\u000a
p26640
aVI'd argue that the only organisation comparable in it's impact is the BBC.
p26641
aVThe NHS is why I vote 
p26642
aVIt is the media you want to fight.
p26643
aVEven now we'll get the usual bullshit about "well it isn't perfect so we should obviously emulate those nations doing worse than us".
p26644
aVWhat are the Lib Dems doing about it?
p26645
aVSomething something Clegg Clegg student betrayer Tory Judas orange booker turncoat literally thatcher rabble rabble rabble 
p26646
aVUnbelievable bravery.
p26647
aVYou are aware that the Tory's didn't start the decline of the NHS right?
p26648
aVOr that it is in decline?
p26649
aVWe've gone from 3rd of five to 1st of 11 in ten years.
p26650
aVI do wonder how much of that is us improving vs everyone else getting worse.
p26651
aVEither way we come out on top. 
p26652
aVNot worth a lot if the UK standards have just fallen the least.
p26653
aVThat's a very shallow victory.
p26654
aVYes they did, during the eighties.
p26655
aVand the fact pfi's came into effect in '92.
p26656
aVSpose that's Labour's fault too.
p26657
aVYes they did.
p26658
aVThey defunded it heavily under Thatcher.
p26659
aVThe NHS was barely functional in 1997.
p26660
aVAs a premature baby just after the thatcher era, seemed to work well enough for me. 
p26661
aVYes not everyone who touched the NHS in that time period died.
p26662
aVThis doesn't alter the fact we did have one of the worse systems in the world in 1997.
p26663
aV[deleted]
p26664
aVYes they did.
p26665
aVI've watched it happen from the inside and out.
p26666
aVAdmittedly the Lib Dems were the enablers, something I will never forget.
p26667
aVHave you now?
p26668
aVIts funny because I also work in the NHS and from where I'm standing we're no worse off than we were under Labour.
p26669
aVEven when you take the different economic situations into account.
p26670
aVAnd where do you work?
p26671
aVClearly not at ward management level, or in service provision.
p26672
aVSurely you're not asserting your ward mirrors all other wards in the country?
p26673
aVMy 'ward' is maybe 100 different wards spread over the East Midlands region.
p26674
aVThey aren't enablers, on healthcare many of their members are more right-wing than the Tories.
p26675
aV&gt;You are aware that the Tory's didn't start the decline of the NHS right?
p26676
aVThere is no decline because we are #1!
p26677
aVSo suck it UKIP and Tory scum! 
p26678
aVNot for long.
p26679
aVThe effects of tory rule are starting to really bite now.
p26680
aVI work at a financially sound hospital trust but this year we are starting to have to make redundancies and making choices over things that is introducing unnecessary risk.
p26681
aVThis NHS has had to make billions in cuts every year, sorry not cuts silly me, the "Nicholson Challenge".
p26682
aVCall it what you like but cuts are cuts.
p26683
aVAlso it must be considered that inflation in health is much higher than normal inflation so to freeze or cut budgets for years has a much more devastating effect than first considered.
p26684
aVThe NHS is creaking.
p26685
aVIt needs investment.
p26686
aVWe need to vote out those who are blindly and ideologically opposed to this notion or we will lose our greatest peace time achievement.
p26687
aVIn the time of an aging population we need it now more than ever. 
p26688
aVI agree that healthcare inflation rises faster than broader measures of inflation.
p26689
aVSo, let's have it your way.
p26690
aVNHS budget increases in line with "healthcare inflation".
p26691
aVSo in 2015 the budget increases by 6%.
p26692
aVAnd in 2016 too, and every year for 20 years.
p26693
aVAll of a sudden the NHS eats all the money in the country, Parliament disbands itself, the monarch abdicates and we rename the country The UK of NHS.
p26694
aVYou can't keep increasing the proportional amount of money the NHS gets.
p26695
aVIt has to be balanced with reality.
p26696
aVNot everyone gets to live, not everyone gets to be healthy, the NHS will not get access to all the things it wants.
p26697
aVThe Tory's aren't opposed to investment.
p26698
aVYou're just against how that investment would get there.
p26699
aVFurthermore if you do work at a trust, you know a big problem is wastage and bureaucracy.
p26700
aVWithout those we could probably extend the life of the NHS for years to come.
p26701
aVMillions of pounds are wasted on trivial things like paper, labels.
p26702
aVMillions if not billions on bigger equipment.
p26703
aVCut down salaries like our head of infection prevention (who's job is to essentially say wash your hands upon entering a ward) who is on, get this, £120,000 a year.
p26704
aVThat's one position in one trust who is not doing a particularly essential service.
p26705
aVIts incredible.
p26706
aVA MRSA infection cost the NHS about £40,000.
p26707
aVInfection control pays for itself if it prevents three additional infections a year, let alone all the additional adverse events that will be prevented at the same time.
p26708
aVI really want the best person possible in the infection control job, and I'd be prepared to pay serious money for them to work at the NHS and not some bank somewhere.
p26709
aVFor what its worth, it's a nurse who worked her way up to that position.
p26710
aVI've seen what her job entails and given the amount of work other employees put it on far less money, it is nothing short of a joke.
p26711
aVI don't disagree there - the work some of the nurses and HCAs put in for an absolute pittance should shame many hospital directors on £100k+ salaries.
p26712
aVI guess what I'm saying is that while £120k/year is cheap for good infection control, £30k/year for an excellent mental health nurse is practically exploitative and I'd love to see a substantial pay rise for the workers on less than a Band 7 pay scale.
p26713
aVIn theory I agree.
p26714
aVIn practice however I've been told that our trust is one infection away from breaching the quota so its getting worse this year compared to previous years.
p26715
aVYes and no.
p26716
aVThe HCAI targets have been decreasing year on year.
p26717
aVLast year, our Trust target was 1, this year it's 0.
p26718
aVEven though we did breach with 3 total last year.
p26719
aVAnd it's so low because historically we've had very low serious infections - but that's no reason to set such an arbitrary 0 for the year now.
p26720
aVStupid system.
p26721
aVI'm not suggesting there is no waste.
p26722
aVI am suggesting we are on the brink of losing the NHS.
p26723
aVOnce profit becomes the driving motive it will be a massive net negative for the majority of the population.
p26724
aVParticularly an aging population like we have.
p26725
aVInvestment is needed. 
p26726
aVThere are no plans to make the NHS for profit.
p26727
aVYou are confusing allowing competition to reduce costs of specific procedures will the NHS or organisations linked to it making profits.
p26728
aVIf a company rises a cost to try and make money off the NHS, and another company offers it at the original cost, then the NHS is obliged to switch provider.
p26729
aVAt all times safety is Paramount and switches aren't made just for economic reasons.
p26730
aVYou are aware that government decisions don't necessarily have immediate visibility, right?
p26731
aVOf course, but that likewise means you can't judge a government until said changes are visible.
p26732
aVWhich is exactly what the OP did.
p26733
aVYou can infer from the policies a government is enacting that ruin is impending.
p26734
aVThis government's policy takes us closer to being the American system, and just look at that league table and see the results.
p26735
aVThat table is the result of the Labour party's increased NHS funding (which the Conservative party once promised to match, pound for pound).
p26736
aVNo you cannot infer before data even exists.
p26737
aVYou hold an untenable, speculative position.
p26738
aVSo you think governments should always get a second term, because the effects of their first term may not be completely evident?
p26739
aVEven when there is clear evidence of policy which has demonstrably poor performance in other countries?
p26740
aVIf yes, should they get a third?
p26741
aVA fourth?
p26742
aVAt what point do you say "No, I believe the other guy's policy and track-record with the NHS is better"?
p26743
aVYou're arguing a straw man argument.
p26744
aVI never said that they should get continual terms because the evidence hasn't yet emerged.
p26745
aVI'm saying you can't call a policy piss poor until you've seen its caused problems.
p26746
aVIe common sense.
p26747
aVYou can't compare selling ineffective **parts** of the NHS for specific things to the wholesale private market in the US, for example.
p26748
aVYou cannot reasonably demonstrate, yet (or perhaps ever), that this policy is causing harm.
p26749
aV&gt;You're arguing a straw man argument.
p26750
aVThat you accuse me does not make it so.
p26751
aVVoting is necessarily speculative, as the voter has to infer from policies they believe will benefit the nation.
p26752
aVI am therefore asking you, where a term of office is not sufficient for full numerical analysis (an obvious impossibility irregardless), how long should we wait before forming of opinion?
p26753
aV&gt;I'm saying you can't call a policy piss poor until you've seen its caused problems\u000a\u000aI quite agree.
p26754
aVThat is why you should observe the complaints of the medical professionals in this very thread.
p26755
aV&gt;You can't compare selling ineffective parts of the NHS for specific things to the wholesale private market in the US, for example.
p26756
aVYou cannot reasonably demonstrate, yet (or perhaps ever), that this policy is causing harm.
p26757
aVNow, that *is* a straw argument! 
p26758
aVIn 2004, this same study put the NHS 3rd overall, now it's 1st.
p26759
aVThis bollocks that gets thrown around saying the Tories are destroying the NHS is just uninformed, party-politics fueled crap.
p26760
aVThere's a delay in these effects.
p26761
aVLeft unfunded for longer and all the labour improvements made to the NHS will be lost. 
p26762
aV[deleted]
p26763
aVIt's right to vote for what you believe in. 
p26764
aVYou know that an Independent Scotland will have a smaller health budget to work with than it does now, if anything you wanted Scotland to stay devolved. 
p26765
aVIf the current government was doing a bad job, why did the UK rank first?
p26766
aVStop unnecessarily politicising an otherwise positive story.
p26767
aVThe NHS was not set up by the current government, in case you weren't aware.
p26768
aVIt takes many years to build or destroy an institution as large as the NHS, and most other developed countries have also recently seen a rise in popularity of right-of-centre political parties that have similar policies on health care funding.
p26769
aVWhat next, crediting the fall of the Soviet Union to Cameron?
p26770
aVIf the current government was doing a bad job in foreign policy, why is Poland in the EU and not part of the USSR?
p26771
aVCheckmate.
p26772
aVI wasn't crediting the creation of the NHS to the current government, in case you weren't aware.
p26773
aVI was crediting the fact that the NHS is still working during the recovery from a devastating recession to the current government.
p26774
aVThis is Reddit, not chess.
p26775
aVGet over yourself.
p26776
aVIs it positive?
p26777
aVThis is what I read in the [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html) in the Independent about the same thing.
p26778
aV&gt;Britain slips up marginally on its \u201ctimeliness of care\u201d and **ranks a shocking second to last for the \u201chealthy lives\u201d indicator, which had looked at life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.
p26779
aV**\u000a\u000aFunnily enough everyone is swarming over this post to circlejerk about the NHS, instead of the one that actually at least mentions in passing the problems with the NHS.
p26780
aVYes it is positive.
p26781
aVIt's certainly not perfect and there are elements which need desperate improvement, such as life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.
p26782
aV&gt;The UK has short waiting times for basic medical care and nonemergency access to services after hours,\u201d it says.
p26783
aV\u201cThe UK also has improved waiting times to see a specialist and now rates fourth on this dimension with the US ranking third.\u201d\u000a**Overall, it was said that the UK provides \u201cuniversal coverage with low out-of-pocket costs while maintaining quick access to specialty services.\u201d**\u000a\u000aOverall this is a positive story and I would certainly argue that there are services and areas which are in need of improvement.
p26784
aVThat's why these studies and reports are necessary and so is healthy debate. 
p26785
aVExcept nobody apart from you and one other person has even acknowledged that the part there the NHS scores badly is a problem and needs improvement, they just use the rest of it to talk about how fantastic the NHS is without caring about death rates and outcomes.
p26786
aVI bring it up people just say things like "oh, well it's probably because Brits are overweight and drink a lot".
p26787
aVWhenever I tell people about the mistreatment I faced which actually made my health worse (permanently, I have to live with it for the rest of my life), they just say "well you can't know if it would be different in another country (I can, I'm in another country now, it has been better here the moment I landed), or start going on about how "do you want to privatise it?!
p26788
aVdo you hate the NHS?!".
p26789
aVThe NHS seems immune from criticism, even as the problems are discussed in newspapers (even the Guardian), which scares me.
p26790
aVAccess and costs are important, but it is a *healthcare* system and I'm worried about the standard of healthcare provided.
p26791
aVBut at the end of the day, if people don't want acknowledge the problems and try to fix them then they're the ones who have to face the consequences.
p26792
aV(I haven't said anything about privatising the NHS, I don't want it to be, especially not by handing out contracts on monopolies the way the Tories seem to believe.
p26793
aVI just want it to work, for patients.
p26794
aV)\u000a\u000aWe have "quick access to specialty services" but the second lowest "healthy lives", which covers death rates for conditions treatable with medical care - just above the US where many people can't see specialists.
p26795
aVThat doesn't seem right to me.
p26796
aVAnd with all the talk about how great access is, there is nobody discussing the huge regional variations in the standard of care you relieve, the "postcode lottery".
p26797
aVEven if the NHS is amazing and does work properly in a few areas, that doesn't justify people suffering unnecessarily in other areas solely because they live in the wrong place.
p26798
aVIt should be good in all parts of the UK, as a *National* Health Service.
p26799
aVHealthy debate is very important, but there is very little about the NHS.
p26800
aVThe NHS is something to be proud of it, but it also has significant problems.
p26801
aVOkay, what's the plan?
p26802
aVVote for a party not ideologically against the very idea of socialised health care.
p26803
aVContact your MP.
p26804
aVProtest where you can.
p26805
aVCounter the Daily Mail propaganda.
p26806
aVThat's a start.
p26807
aVGood luck with that under FPTP.
p26808
aVApparently we needed new maternity units- not an alternative voting system. 
p26809
aVI have a lot of respect for the NHS, but are we all really just ignoring the fact that we're second from last in the 'healthy lives' row?
p26810
aVArguably outcomes are more important than efficiency, especially to the individual.
p26811
aVFrom the report:\u000a\u000a&gt; The U.S. ranks last overall with poor scores on all three indicators of healthy lives\u2014mortality amenable to medical care, infant mortality, and healthy life expectancy at age 60.
p26812
aVThe U.S. and U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from conditions amenable to medical care than some of the other countries, e.g., rates 25 percent to 50 percent higher than Australia and Sweden.
p26813
aVOverall, France, Sweden, and Switzerland rank highest on healthy lives.
p26814
aVHow much of that is to do with the NHS though?
p26815
aVWouldn't factors like diet, inequality (linked with the last one I guess) and other externals play a bigger role than provision of healthcare?
p26816
aVAnd Scotland.
p26817
aVLet's not forget Scotland is still in the UK.
p26818
aVAfter they leave our Healthy Lives ranking should rise a few points :)\u000a\u000a(just kidding Scotland, we love you really, please stay!
p26819
aV)
aVScottish NHS isn't in as much bother as England, the devolved government has refused to carve it up.
p26820
aVIt has its problems but it's a damn good system.
p26821
aVYeah, but it's paid for using general taxation (ie.
p26822
aVpartially funded by English taxes).
p26823
aVIf it had to be funded purely off of Scottish taxes it'd probably be a very different service.
p26824
aVWell that's debatable in that it's funded by the money Scotland gets back after it contributes to the UK.
p26825
aVI think it's currently something like Scotland contributes 9.4% (not including Oil, Gas and a few other revenue streams) and gets back 9.3%\u000a\u000aThis whole "English tax payers pay for healthcare and free prescriptions in Scotland" is a narrative started by Red Top papers and disingenuous politicians.
p26826
aVIt's perpetuated by people who should really know better.
p26827
aVThen again from the other comments some people seem to think that all of Scotland is a minority Glaswegan caricature.
p26828
aVCome on man, you're living in the past.
p26829
aVMost people have grudgingly come around to the fact that Scotland pays it's way.
p26830
aVThat myth comes about by the fact that THE ENTIRE COUNTRY runs on a deficit i.e.
p26831
aVthere is not as much money coming in as there is going out.
p26832
aVSome bright sparks twisted that fact to make Scotland look like it spends more than it gives, ignoring the fact that the entire country does the exact same thing.
p26833
aVActually all countries do, except maybe Norway and a few others.
p26834
aVThe truth is that Scotland actually runs on a surplus, giving more than it gets back.
p26835
aVLondon is the only other region of the UK which also gives more than it gets.
p26836
aVIn case of independance it may change but I don't believe it would, I would rather not get into an independance debate in /r/unitedkindom.
p26837
aVThe point is the government is wanting to move to a more American model of healthcare, one which is clearly shown to be more costly and less efficent. 
p26838
aV[deleted]
p26839
aV&gt; which in my personal view you should\u000a\u000aYeah, same here.
p26840
aVIt's possibly the only way that an independent Scotland would be financially viable in any case.
p26841
aVI don't know how realistic the 90% figure is though.
p26842
aVIs it really the case that 90% of North sea oil in Scotland's waters (as Salmond would suggest)?
p26843
aVIf it is then fair enough, that should be Scotland's.
p26844
aVNot going either side here on the whole independence thing because frankly there are more important issues than subsidies, but Scotland generally pays more tax *in* than it gets out (if I had to take a guess it would be to do with oil).
p26845
aVOn top of that the formula they use to calculate these things don't take into account projects like the Olympics which hugely benefited London but not so much Scotland\u000a\u000ahttp://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/28/would-scotland-be-economically-better-off-it-was-independent\u000a\u000amore neutral article: \u000ahttps://fullfact.org/factchecks/will_an_independent_scotland_be_better_off-28889
p26846
aVThats blatantly untrue, it has just the same problems as the english system, if not more.
p26847
aV[deleted]
p26848
aVFor the most part they are the same system, they share common problems.
p26849
aVHowever, the elephant in the room is that the NHS in England is being privatised, services being sold out to health contractors.
p26850
aVConsidering the complete clusterfuck we have seen of public service contracts being given out to private entities (I'm thinking ATOS and G4S olympics security) how do think this is going to turn out?
p26851
aVScottish parliment has refused calls to privitaise parts of the NHS in Scotland, it is a completly devolved matter.
p26852
aV&gt;  However, the elephant in the room is that the NHS in England is being privatised, services being sold out to health contractors.
p26853
aVThe "business opportunities" involved with outsourcing are essentially being cherry-picked by contractors.
p26854
aVThe contractors rely on there still being an NHS to do the "heavy lifting" (expensive emergency surgery).
p26855
aVOnly if you ignore all the problems that are being created
p26856
aVWould you care to elaborate?
p26857
aVWhat are you slebbering about?
p26858
aVI'm trying to find the article I read about free personal care.
p26859
aVI'm sure I read somewhere that it looks like it is going to have to be scrapped because of the rising costs. 
p26860
aVI think he means that the Scottish are really quite unhealthy regardless of the NHS, which brings down the UK average
p26861
aVI dunno.
p26862
aVI can imagine that deep fried mars bars and heroin probably constitute the highest quality of life imaginable.
p26863
aVI know Scotland are meant to be famous for deep fried Mars bars, but from what I've seen, England eat them just as much.
p26864
aVI've lived in Glasgow all my days and have never seen one.
p26865
aV*Or* anybody else eating one for that matter.
p26866
aVReally?
p26867
aVWhere?
p26868
aVI've only ever seen them available in Whitby in England.
p26869
aVNice to know if I can get one without having to visit Glasgow.
p26870
aVPretty much every chippie van I've seen has them, but those have all been in Hampshire and the East Midlands.
p26871
aVWhere are these chippie vans with deep fried mars bars in Hampshire?
p26872
aVWinchester, Andover, Southampton.
p26873
aVMate just go into a chippy and ask them to batter a mars bar and deep fry it.
p26874
aVI'm far too middle class and terrified to do that.
p26875
aVDeep fried Wild Alaskan Salmon supper.
p26876
aVDo it.
p26877
aVJust once.
p26878
aVYou'll probably not be able to get past two bites, but it is heavenly.
p26879
aVThen feel really bad about yourself as you throw the rest away.
p26880
aVThis post momentarily gave me the most stupidest of thoughts...
p26881
aVIf deep fried Mars bars and heroin are considered Scottish,  would deep fried heroin be the most Scottish of national dishes?
p26882
aVAnd the most moreish.
p26883
aVHeroin is sort of fried.
p26884
aVIf you smoke it on a foil, some of that is definitely some sort of oil because it leaves behind a sticky mess.
p26885
aVAnd injecting users have to heat it up in a spoon.
p26886
aVSo it's already perfectly Scottish as it is pal!
p26887
aVThis is by far the biggest problem in UK healthcare.
p26888
aVThe amount of money, time and effect to be saved if everyone stopped being such a fat bastard is enormous.
p26889
aVI read in the BBC the other day that they want to introduce tomato pills.
p26890
aVJust eat a fucking tomato dickheads! 
p26891
aVIf you spend every day in a hospital you will see that the majority of the patients in there are not fat, they are old.
p26892
aVThin people live longer.
p26893
aVOlder people have more health problems.
p26894
aVOlder people spend more time in hospital.
p26895
aVHospital care is expensive.
p26896
aVFat people die of the same things that older people do (stroke, MI, cancer) but at a younger age, saving us 20 years of caring for them.
p26897
aVTomatoes are expensive.
p26898
aVGranted, the overall health of the nation has some impact, but as per the quoted text: 'The U.S. and U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from **conditions amenable to medical care** than some of the other countries'.
p26899
aVSo I think this is showing what we already know: reform and budget cuts are driving ever increasing efficiency at the expense of point-of-care quality.\u000a
p26900
aVIt's difficult to make any sense of this chart.
p26901
aVFrance scores badly on everything and yet comes top in healthy lives, whereas the UK is completely the opposite.
p26902
aVI can only conclude that the the health of the nation is inversely correlated to the quality of health care. 
p26903
aVThe two things are largely unrelated I think.
p26904
aVI imagine to determine 'healthy lives' they looked at dietary, exercise and sedentary lifestyle type things.
p26905
aVThe healthcare is how good the country is at healing the sick, the healthy lifestyle is how good the country is at not getting sick in the first place?
p26906
aVI don't know.
p26907
aVNo, as it says in my quoted text: 'The U.S. and U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from **conditions amenable to medical care** than some of the other countries...'
p26908
aVCultural factors too.
p26909
aV"Don't want to make a fuss" etc.
p26910
aVGiven the way the French drive, drink, smoke and eat I'm sure I don't know either!
p26911
aVFor such an efficient service, the only obvious way to improve outcomes would be to increase funding for additional or expanded services.
p26912
aVFunny how coming out on top in something important like this is sort of ignored compared to if 11 of our men were able to win the world cup.
p26913
aVFunnily enough, England winning the World Cup would increase general feelings of happiness, making people feel more healthy. 
p26914
aVAh, but the longer we stay in the World Cup, the more alcohol-related injuries there will be.
p26915
aVFunny how if we're good at something we'll focus on something else and moan about that instead, although its completely unrelated. 
p26916
aVAs a Canadian I can never understand why people complain so much about the NHS.
p26917
aVEven though healthcare is technically free in Canada the system is much better over here, and I didn't need to worry about figuring out insurance while I waited for it to kick in after I moved here.
p26918
aVAlso, dental care is so much cheaper, which I greatly appreciate.
p26919
aVAgreed.
p26920
aVI like how it also includes prescription medication.
p26921
aVOne of my inhalers cost over $100 in Canada (not that I actually ever paid that much though, with workplace insurance), but here it only costs £8.05 or whatever the flat rate is now.
p26922
aVI just paid for my drugs in Germany myself as I am pushed into the private system there.
p26923
aVCost \u20ac470 for 100 days.
p26924
aVI will have it réfunded but the cost in the UK would be about £34 (if it is still pay per type).
p26925
aVThey complain because The Sun and The Daily Mail have been driving home for years how abysmal the NHS is.
p26926
aVIt isn't.
p26927
aVI really think 'Healthy Lives' and general obesity problems are driven far more from socioeconomic factors than healthcare provision (although there's problem an argument that very good healthcare provision should try and seek out and change these factors, something which the NHS has tried, but is extremely difficult).
p26928
aVTo make a massive generalisation, when I spend time in a wealthier area I see a MUCH higher percentage of people out jogging/exercising.
p26929
aVIt's a marked difference.
p26930
aVI'd wager that gym memberships are more common in wealthier areas.
p26931
aVSimilarly, go to a Waitrose in a wealthy area, and a Tescos in a poorer area and compare what's in peoples trolleys. 
p26932
aVVery sad that people support UKIP when UKIP want to sell the NHS to the highest bidder and let people die in the street whilst they quaff champagne.
p26933
aVUKIP are nothing but sociopaths.
p26934
aV&gt; when UKIP want to sell the NHS to the highest bidder\u000a\u000aSource?\u000a
p26935
aVHis website seems to be down for some reason but Paul Nuttall wrote that he wanted to privatise the NHS on his blog.
p26936
aVThis is a quote:\u000a\u000a&gt;Dear Editor,\u000a\u000a&gt;I would like to congratulate the coalition government for bringing a whiff of privatisation into the beleaguered National Health Service.
p26937
aVThe fact that successive governments have undertaken what they call \u2018substantial\u2019 changes to the NHS should tell us all we need to know: there is something fundamentally wrong with how we treat the ill in our country.
p26938
aV&gt;The NHS is the second biggest employer in the world, beaten only by Walmart, but as with all state monopolies, it is costly, inefficient and stuffed with bureaucrats.
p26939
aVIn New Labour\u2019s NHS, for every nurse there is a manager and vital workers, such as midwives, are falling in numbers.
p26940
aV&gt;The problem, however, goes far deeper.
p26941
aVI would argue that the very existence of the NHS stifles competition, and as competition drives quality and choice, innovation and improvements are restricted.
p26942
aV&gt;Therefore, I believe, as long as the NHS is the \u2018sacred cow\u2019 of British politics, the longer the British people will suffer with a second rate health service.
p26943
aV&gt;Paul Nuttall MEP\u000a\u000ahttp://samedifference1.com/2014/05/18/paul-nuttall-ukip-mep-on-the-nhs/
p26944
aVUKIP members all seem to say different things due to being such a rapidly growing party that maybe lacks a little bit of organisation/consensus on issues not related to the EU or immigration.
p26945
aVIn the case of outsourcing parts of the NHS, I have no doubt /u/SmashUKIP heard that at some point, from a TV interview or whatnot (Or maybe even in their 2010 manifesto, I don't know).
p26946
aVRight or wrong, it's not the official policy of UKIP until we see it on their manifesto (Even if it came from Farage's mouth), so he can't provide a source. 
p26947
aVJust look at the party members and their general ideals.
p26948
aVIt'll come out in the next proper manifesto I'm sure
p26949
aVHoly shit.
p26950
aVI never knew that. 
p26951
aVI voted UKip, will do in the general election.
p26952
aVOur government doesn't want to address immigration.
p26953
aVThe fact that there are huge ghettos of people in the UK where there are a lot of immigrants, but also council houses/estates...
p26954
aVI think is msadness, an that those people shouldn't be in the UK.
p26955
aVOne of the managers in our work however is from South Africa, if his greencard expires or he needs citizenship I'd be the first to sign forms/have an interview to keep him here.
p26956
aVHe is an absolute beast at what he does and his teams sales have gone through the roof.
p26957
aVHe is genuinely a benefit to the country as the majority of ppl here do not have that work ethic/drive.
p26958
aVAnd guess what?
p26959
aVI don't think ppl in the UK should die if they cant afford healthcare.
p26960
aVI just don't want ghettos in the UK, think that poorer European countries in the EU should sort themselves out and it shouldn't be my taxes that do, as they should be spent in the UK.
p26961
aVSo I think we're getting a bad deal and want out of the EU as well.
p26962
aVIt doesn't matter how left or right wing people are, if theres a problem it needs fixing.
p26963
aVGhettos in the UK are a problem to me.
p26964
aVThey exist because our immigration laws are severely inadequate. 
p26965
aVIf someone wants to come live in a ghetto from another country because it's a better way of life for them, I'm all for it.
p26966
aVRisking the chance of the NHS being privatised, and jeapordising my own health is not worth there being less foreign people living in areas of our city that I never even see.
p26967
aVWell, that's where we differ.
p26968
aVI don't want any ghettos in our country at all and believe we should invest heavily in them, ie knocking down older terrace houses and building more modern estates, giving these areas huge facelifts and relocating people towards more middle class areas.
p26969
aVImmigrants shouldn't be confined to ghettos, creating poorer areas and cultural divide across the country.
p26970
aVA lot of people are upset about immigration and feel government isnt tackling it.
p26971
aVSay for example half a million immigrants come over and live in ghetto areas.
p26972
aVThese people are getting a better life for themselves so I don't resent them, everybody does whats best for themselves.
p26973
aVBut I don't want them here in ghetto communities, I think the UK shouldn't have any areas like this and that we should sort out our immigration rules so we only take in skilled people we need, people who won't move to these areas... and then invest heavily in regenerating them.
p26974
aVI'm not alone in thinking this, many millions of people across the country think the same.
p26975
aVWhich is why we vote UKip.
p26976
aVwhat is "Healthy Lives" and why do we suck at it?
p26977
aVToo many fat fucks
p26978
aVlegit.
p26979
aVThis is from the Independent [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html) about the same thing.
p26980
aV&gt;Britain slips up marginally on its \u201ctimeliness of care\u201d and **ranks a shocking second to last for the \u201chealthy lives\u201d indicator, which had looked at life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.
p26981
aV**\u000a\u000aAnd we should be very concerned about it.
p26982
aVsounds slightly like we are just encouraging survival of the fittest to me, it's not like we have a lot of space.
p26983
aVHardly the 'best healthcare system' for people's health which such poor outcomes, is it?
p26984
aVno, but I never said it was.
p26985
aVSorry, I didn't intend to aim that at you personally.
p26986
aVI'm just very frustrated and disappointed with the treatment I've received, I had mistreatment actually make me worse and cause more damage, and not only do people seem willfully blind to the problems but many will also go out of their way to attack anyone who criticises the NHS, no matter how legitimate the criticism.
p26987
aVIt's unsettling, blaming the people that suffer rather than acknowledging there are problems as well as positives.
p26988
aV"We're number one!
p26989
aV*not with healthcare outcomes, but we save so much money!
p26990
aVso efficient, having people die or unable to work"
p26991
aVI come from a family of NHS workers so I understand that the NHS can often be blindly defended from criticism, and it is a very flawed organisation, but it really does excel at some things.
p26992
aVHonestly I feel like the Health Lives statistic is partially low due to many British people's stubbornness and reluctance to seek help for illness until it is too late, but that could also be down to the NHS not prioritising early diagnosis, which puts people off.
p26993
aVYou may have had bad experiences, but there is no way for you to know if your experiences would have been better in a different country.
p26994
aVLast Saturday I had appendicitis, turned up at the hospital at 9 o'clock in the morning in severe pain, they had diagnosed, operated and fed me by \u000a9 o'clock in the evening at which point I went home.
p26995
aVJust in time to do all my exams Monday...
p26996
aVSounds like we have one of the world's most efficient health care systems.
p26997
aVI'm happy your life was saved. 
p26998
aVI have been a patient in Germany and the UK.
p26999
aVI recently discharged myself early from a German hospital who were quite upset with me for doing so even though, medically it would have just been for a follow-up.
p27000
aVAs a private patient (I can't take public insurance), they wanted to keep me for a week longer than a public patient.
p27001
aVI had checked the NHS brochure on care and quoted that back at them.
p27002
aVThe young doctor was annoyed and started telling me how the NHS was killing people with poor care...
p27003
aVI left.
p27004
aVThe German hospital was good and very well equipped.
p27005
aVHowever the German system is disjointed.
p27006
aVIt was up to me to organise follow-up checks and so on as it is all different organisations.
p27007
aVThe NHS collects and builds on the expertise of its staff which increases its efficiency.
p27008
aVIn Germany staff share knowledge, but this is not institutionalised.
p27009
aVFor example, the NHS statistics may indicate that certain treatments are more effective than others but Germany doesn't gather the same data.
p27010
aVThe NHS administration has been in the past exceptionally "lean".
p27011
aVIn Germany, every aspect of looking after a patient must be billed and the insurer must check the bill.
p27012
aVDifferent insurers may have different treatments on their lists.
p27013
aVThe administrative overhead is eventually paid for by the end user.
p27014
aV[deleted]
p27015
aVThe NHS is very poor at treatment continuity I find.
p27016
aVThat is to say, I've never had a single person who appeared to say "Hey, I'm taking on this problem, and I'm with you 'till it's fixed".
p27017
aVHaving sufferred from two chronic conditions in my life, in both cases it was pretty much just a case of "Go here and see this person and try this" or "Wait a bit and see if it improves" - so I think you've got a point, for long term issues the NHS can be pretty poo.
p27018
aV[deleted]
p27019
aVYeah,the NHS is top of the line if you've got something straight forward or short term.
p27020
aVWhile I've found them more than willing to do very expensive referrals for things, the problem can be that if no-one fixes your problem there's not someone in the picture who says "Hold on a minute, no-one fixed this, what are we going to do for this guy?".
p27021
aVInstead the final person in the chain inevitably says "See how it is and come back in 3/6 months" and that's basically them saying "Can't fix it, see ya".
p27022
aVNot where i fucking live.
p27023
aVAnd there is the US, 11th in cost-related problems.
p27024
aVi don't understand this ranking in light of the fact that the uk has the lowest survival rate for many diseases, but particularly cancer, in western europe and that the u.s. has the highest survival rate.
p27025
aVi would have thought that that would have been reflected in the 'effective care' column.
p27026
aVfrom the NHS website\u000a["Researchers say the main reason for low survival rates in the UK seems to be delayed diagnosis, underuse of successful treatments and unequal access to treatment, particularly among elderly people.
p27027
aV"](http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/12December/Pages/UK-cancer-survival-rates-below-European-average.aspx)\u000a\u000afrom the BBC onsurvival rates\u000a["There were also large regional variations within the UK, which were linked to differences in access to care and ability of patients to navigate the local health services.
p27028
aVBoth are directly linked to deprivation.
p27029
aV"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7510121.stm )
p27030
aVCancer is a funny one, because the usual stat which is reported - 5 year survival rate - depends in an obvious way on when the cancer was diagnosed.
p27031
aVSuppose we have a cancer which automatically kills you after six years, and we can diagnose it immediately.
p27032
aV100% of people survive 5 years, so our healthcare system looks really good.
p27033
aVBut then someone in the NHS goes 'You know what, this test we're doing to screen for this cancer isn't actually adding any healthcare; people are still dying six years after catching the disease, we're just diagnosing it earlier'.
p27034
aVSo the NHS switches to a cheaper test which only catches the cancer two years after it appears.
p27035
aVNow our five-year survival rate is 0%, but everyone is exactly as healthy as before.
p27036
aVThis is what happens in real life; the Yanks spend a lot of money on fancy diagnostic equipment that catches cancers earlier and earlier, and this leads their five- and ten- years rates to be much better than ours.
p27037
aVBut the average age of death for most cancers is statistically indistinguishable between the US and the UK, suggesting our care is about equivalent.
p27038
aVIt's just another example of the confusing world of hospital statistics
p27039
aVThe problem with your vignette is that treatment will tend to be more effective at earlier stages of cancer.
p27040
aVIn fact you didn't mention it at all, which seems a little odd.
p27041
aVWhile there may be some statistical artefact to the overall survival rate, I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that it explains it entirely.
p27042
aVAlso:\u000a\u000a&gt;  But the average age of death for most cancers is statistically indistinguishable between the US and the UK\u000a\u000adoes not imply that the care is the same quality.
p27043
aVTo go for another toy example, in the UK I have 10 people who die at age 70 from stomach cancer.
p27044
aVIn the US I have 10 people diagnosed with stomach cancer, of whom 5 die age 70, and the other five die later from *something else*.
p27045
aVClearly the care is better in the US, but the mean age at death is the same because you are ignoring the fact that people survive to die from another cause.  
p27046
aVYour first point is very valid; I only didn't mention it because it won't relevant to the point I was trying to sketch out in the toy example.
p27047
aVIn reality, if treating early makes a difference it would show up in both the survival AND mortality rates.
p27048
aVIf we see a difference between the survival rates but not the mortality rates for two countries, we can conclude treating early makes no difference to age of death, and we shouldn't pay for earlier diagnosis.
p27049
aVYour second point is also quite interesting; in the UK we typically under-treat prostate cancer compared to the US.
p27050
aVThis is because prostate cancer is slow-growing and most people will die of something else before they die of prostate cancer.
p27051
aVIn the US, prostate cancer is aggressively screened for and treated with chemo.
p27052
aVThis means that in the UK, slightly more people die of prostate cancer than in the US (23.7 per 100,000 compared to 23.0 in America), but almost none of those 23.7 people will have had debilitating chemotherapy, and so will go on to live longer on average.
p27053
aVBasically, the UK system always tries to maximise the number of healthy life-years people live, even if that means doing odd things like deliberately setting up the population to die of prostate cancer more often.
p27054
aVThe US system competes in a much shorter time frame, so the 'appearance' of good medicine is more important (for example aggressively treating everything that might be a cancer, including benign lumps).
p27055
aVSo I don't disagree with you - standardised mortality rates aren't everything - but don't be fooled into thinking they tell you nothing either.
p27056
aV&gt; Basically, the UK system always tries to maximise the number of healthy life-years people live, even if that means doing odd things like deliberately setting up the population to die of prostate cancer more often.
p27057
aVI would like to read more about this sort of thing.
p27058
aVDo you have any references - books, articles, etc - that you could point me to?
p27059
aVIt's a bit dry, but this is what a QALY is and how it is calculated:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I don't know any centralised reference for the weird effects which this construct generates, but there are a lot of philosophical papers on the implications with regards to (for example) disability and age discrimination.
p27060
aVExcellent comment, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNiORew3uRY) a video.
p27061
aVThe *big* problem with the NHS, in my experience is that you really have to be proactive in pushing your treatment forward, you often have to ask to be referred, follow up on tests/scans etc and make sure that you don't get lost in the system.
p27062
aVIf you're paying for your healthcare you do this automatically because you're a customer, so you expect what you pay for, in the NHS its easy to assume that the system will just guide you through, unfortunately, it generally will not.
p27063
aVFor example, you have abdomen pain, you go to your GP, he prescribes you painkillers and refers you for an ultrasound, it comes back clear, well at that point you could just leave it, and many people do, but actually you need to go back to your GP and be like 'hey!
p27064
aVWTF is with this pain?
p27065
aVYou need to refer me so I can get this shit sorted!'.
p27066
aVIf you do that he'll probably refer you to a specialist, but if you leave it as 'meh, scan was clear, I'm happy' he'll probably just carry on prescribing painkillers.
p27067
aVI think this is how a lot of people slip through the net.
p27068
aVCouple that with the good old British 'stiff-upper-lippedness' that means we don't even go to the doctor until we're doubled over in pain, means things don't get diagnosed and treated as soon as other countries. 
p27069
aVI had a problem like this with my wrist.
p27070
aVIt's been really sore at the joint for about 5-6 years, and every time I saw a GP or went to a clinic I was told to rub some joint cream on it, and try not to move it.
p27071
aVI finally had enough last year and went for a private consultation, and after a single 30 minute session I now knew there was genuinely something wrong with it.
p27072
aVSince *then* the NHS service has been outstanding, but trying to get through to people was the biggest hurdle.
p27073
aVYeah, basically you need to be really brutal with the doctors and just be like..\u000a\u000a'look!
p27074
aVThis has been going on for 5 years, you've given me cream and told me to rest it before, and it hasn't improved.
p27075
aVPlease can you refer me to a specialist now as this is a serious problem for me, and I need for it to be treated!
p27076
aVEverything you've advised me to do, hasn't worked!
p27077
aV'
aVThere's obviously far more to healthcare than cancer treatment.
p27078
aVIt makes me so thankful to live in the UK.
p27079
aVMy husband and I realised the other day as we were watching Breaking Bad that we were less traumatised by the gangs and violence, but more the insane hospital bills.
p27080
aVIn the last year...\u000a\u000a- I was in a car crash, X-rays, A&amp;E, ambulance, everything.
p27081
aVLuckily the insurers paid for physio but my GP also offered it, with a 3 week waiting list on average.
p27082
aV- I've also had to seek psychological help for an issue that was affecting me, went to GP on 10 May, assessment was end of May, first weekly session of cognitive behaviour therapy starts next week.
p27083
aVPretty impressed by that.
p27084
aV- had an issue with putting on weight and a few lady issues.
p27085
aVBlood tests/gynocologist visit and got it sorted.
p27086
aV3 week waiting list to be seen.
p27087
aVIf I'd have had that year in America I reckon I'd be around $40,000 worse off.
p27088
aVYou would be a lot worse off then $40,000.
p27089
aVUK is #1 bitches!
p27090
aVMost efficient and effective healthcare service in the world! 
p27091
aVNow let's not fall prey to arrogance.
p27092
aVGlory To the NHS!

aVGlory to the Queen!
p27094
aVGlory to our empire!

aV!
aVBut last in dentistry
p27096
aVThere's absolutely nothing wrong with UK Dentistry or the teeth of the population.
p27097
aVYou're confusing healthy teeth/gums with the vanity of perfectly straight teeth Americans are obsessed with.
p27098
aVAnd oh look how much that costs you, I wonder if the social pressure for it was started by a private dentist!?
p27099
aV&lt;\u005csarcasm&gt;
p27100
aVI'd say there is something wrong with dentistry here; the cost.
p27101
aVI don't have to pay to see my doctor, but yet I do to see my dentist.
p27102
aVThe NHS isn't so good at providing dentistry though.
p27103
aVGetting on the books of an NHS dentist is a lot easier than it used to be (we tried 10 years ago, gave up and went private) but it isn't universal.
p27104
aVSomething to do with crap conditions being imposed on dentists, leading to them deciding to just take private work instead.
p27105
aVThankfully private dentists and insurance aren't totally unaffordable. 
p27106
aVActually Britain is a middle-ranker when it comes to dentistry, and we have good records when it comes to things like tooth cavities and extractions.
p27107
aVIn this respect, the Guinness Book does not constitute as a 'good record'

aVFor example I remember that we had some of the fewest cavities in the EU. 
p27110
aVSome stereotypes we're stuck with :(
p27111
aVI think part of that is due to America being obsessed with completely straight white teeth.

aVThe NHS is incredible.
p27122
aVI've heard a lot of horror stories about the NHS, and so I dreaded having to go into hospital when I cut my finger open with a bread knife, severing the tendon.
p27123
aVBut yeah, I had surgery done the next day and was out the day after, and I was booked in for physiotherapy the next week.
p27124
aVOnly problem was the godawful hospital food.

aVI have two members of my family that have worked for the NHS all their life(a GP and a surgeon).
p27140
aVOne believes that the NHS should be "humanely euthanized" the other is quitting due to the horrific treatment they get by the NHS as an employer.
p27141
aVI just don't understand why myself and everyone close to me is trapped in some bizzaro world where we get such bad treatment.
p27142
aVReally just how bad is it everywhere else in the world for this to be the best?
p27143
aVThe only way for me to see my GP is to mass dial at 8 in the morning.
p27144
aVAfter about 30-40 minutes I might be lucky and I'll get an appointment for that day only.
p27145
aVIf my doctor isn't in that day or they're full?
p27146
aVTough luck.

aVTry going through that every day when you've had a stroke.

p27150
aVIt's not just you.
p27151
aVI had to leave the country because of the mistreatment I received from the NHS.
p27152
aVI'm not going to go into details because people start trying to justify it, when I'm the one who suffered and is suffering, and it's not good for my mental health at the moment to discuss it with strangers who don't know me and will insult me for questioning the NHS.
p27153
aVThings are much better for me now in Australia, but I will have to live with the consequences of what was done to me for the rest of my life.
p27154
aVThe "healthy lives" measure in this report, where the UK comes second last, that measures things like death rates from treatable medical conditions and life expectancies.
p27155
aVWhat this report says is that the UK is the most 'efficient' and cheapest, not that it provides the best healthcare.
p27156
aVThe NHS is horrific, for patients, things are better in most other developed countries.
p27157
aVI'm sorry you have to go through this, you are not imagining things.
p27158
aVI will fight for the rest of my life to save the NHS.

p27165
aVThe US isn't the norm in private health care.
p27166
aVOF course.
p27167
aVMy family actually use BUPA in the UK which is private.
p27168
aVI just think that healthcare and education are the two founding staples of soceity.
p27169
aVBoth should be free.
p27170
aVThough I'm delighted to see the NHS come out so well, and I am very glad to live in country that has it, I wonder if the changes that made it move from 3rd to 1st were really just changes that allow it to do well in these sorts of surveys.
p27171
aVIt seems to me that the recent NHS changes have been driven by cost/benefit analysis.
p27172
aVInstead of trying to be perfect for everyone (which was the unwritten goal before), treatments are allocated by its cost, the number of people it serves and (I hate to say it) how "important" those people are to society.
p27173
aVI honestly believe there is eg systemic ageism in the NHS, where the elderly who provide less economic benefit, are ranked below younger people who are (or will soon be) employed and tax-paying.
p27174
aVI am sure it isn't deliberate, but is rather emergent behaviour from the way NHS resource decision making is set up.
p27175
aVSo the end result is that more people see cheaper treatment and the cost to GDP is lower (not necessarily a bad thing at all).
p27176
aVErgo we do well in the surveys.
p27177
aVGenuine question.
p27178
aVWhat would be average cost of this set of procedures if they were done in US ?
p27179
aV:   UK- 5 visits to general doctor, x-ray, MRI scan, 2 orthopedist consultations,1 day in hospital, 5 days phsiotherapy, 20 TABLETS CODEINE, Artrhroscopy, 4 weeks off work, fully paid (this actually varies per employer but it usually being refunded by NHS to some point) ?
p27180
aVUK- 0.00£
p27181
aVAmerican here.
p27182
aVHard to answer simply.
p27183
aVIf one had good insurance, was employed by a decent company with good benefits and went to doctors "in network" for the insurer, the out of pocket costs for what you describe might be only a few hundred dollars ($20 per visit co-pay for the consultations and physio sessions, probably full coverage for the hospital and surgery and a small co-pay for the drugs).
p27184
aVAs for sick leave, if you were with an employer with good benefits, you'd probably be placed on short-term disability (covered by separate insurance) and receive 60-80% of your salary.
p27185
aVHowever, if one had shitty or no insurance and worked for a company with no or shoddy benefits, it could *easily* run $25,000 to $50,000 with no paid time off (except perhaps state short-term disability payments--NY provides around $170 per week).

aVOne thing that always concerns me about our great healthcare is whether or not it would be possible to apply it universally.
p27203
aVAs in, if the US adopted an identical service tomorrow, would we all be able to support it or would the medical industry collapse from the strain of selling only to governments at a fair rate?
p27204
aVIs universal healthcare something we can feasibly apply everywhere or can in only exist in a stratified world market where our care comes at the cost of other people on the other side of the world?
p27205

p27232
aVThis measures peoples opinions, not actual performance of the NHS.
p27233
aVIt further explains possible reasons that opinions might have changed so drastically.
p27234
aVIt even argues against the point you are trying to make:\u000a\u000a"Interestingly, other recent surveys (Care Quality Commission, 2012a, 2012b; Department of Health, 2012b) have not recorded a decline in the public's actual experience of the NHS.
p27235
aVKey performance data collected on waiting times and  health care-related infections have also generally been good (Appleby et al., 2012).

p27237
aVOne day you might take the blinkers off, listen, absorb  and see the world beyond your own mind.\u000a
p27238
aVI wish you could see the irony of your statement.
p27239
aVI did in fact "take my blinkers off" and actually read the source you posted claiming that the figures are not good, only to find out that it was an opinion poll, which is what my comment was pointing out.
p27240
aVI have no idealogical view in regards to how the NHS is run, unlike others who believe that it being fully state run is the only answer.
p27241
aVI just want the best results, if it turns out that private tenders can improve results, then we should use them where appropriate as long as it stays free at the point of use.
p27242
aVThe reality is that the NHS is creaking and will struggle despite what any government is able to do, due to medical  inflation being higher than we can afford to currently spend/ increase spending and a massively ageing population.
p27243
aVIf we are to be realistic and overcome this, we need to admit a few things, firstly the NHS will need to change drastically to cope in the future.
p27244
aVPersonally, my opinion is that technology will be the driving force of efficiencies needed and the private sector generally has a better track record of bringing in technology to drive efficiency and improve results.
p27245
aVThe second is that in the short term at least it will either need more money or people will have to go without.
p27246
aVWe can either continue ploughing money into it like Labour did and continually increase taxes until we are bankrupt and have no NHS or we look to Europe and other developed nations and try and find other solutions that work.

aVGPs sometimes aren't brilliant with ears, however saying "it's fine from the outside" *is* the correct thing to say in the case of an earache.

aVYou really can't get inflammation of the inner ear and if there was an infection there it wouldn't hurt - it would send you deaf and the room would be spinning.
p27312
aVIn terms of pain it's usually the middle ear cavity building up with fluid that causes the problem and this will show as a distended eardrum when viewed from the outside.
p27313
aVIf there's an earache coupled with no change in hearing and an outer ear that looks okay, it's sometimes not the ear that's the problem at all.

p27355
aVThe triage system will shunt you for an earache or minor injury and you will most likely not see a doctor as it is a waste of their time. 
p27356
aVShe went to the emergency because the doctor's appointment was really, really far away and she was in pain.
p27357
aVAh, most GP's are moving to on the day appointments now.
p27358
aVAlthough if you don't want to sit through A+E waits most pharmacists now will deal with stuff like that.
p27359
aVYou mean pharmacists can diagnose and treat inner ear problems?
p27360
aVNext time I guess I'll go to the barber if I need my tooth to be looked at.
p27361
aV(Sorry for the hostile tone; I got a bit pissed off with the reactions here.
p27362
aV)
aVThey can diagnose some things, and supply antibiotics.
p27363
aVThis is so wrong on so many level, I cannot even start addressing it.
p27364
aVWe are talking about an inner ear issue, which needs a specialist DOCTOR (not even a GP, but someone who studied all of his/her life to diagnose ear issues), not a nurse with google or a pharmacist.
p27365
aVNot to mention the issue with antibiotics... they are not vitamin C. They should be only used when needed, and not on the discretion of a nurse of pharmacist.
p27366
aVToo many multidrug resistant bugs are running around already.
p27367
aVAre antibiotics proscription now?
p27368
aVAlso a GP would know what is wrong in a general way and who to refer it to, that's the whole point of them. 
p27369
aVA&amp;E for earache?
p27370
aV!
aVYeah, no wonder they just told her to go away.
p27371
aVThat's what your GP is for.
p27372
aVYou know, perhaps your condescending attitude would go better if you weren't such an ignorant prick.
p27373
aVSince her appointment was in the next month and she was in insane pain, she went to the emergency.
p27374
aVI'm so relieved I have some idiots online telling me things without knowing what happened, though. 
p27375
aVPeople are only going off information that you yourself have provided.
p27376
aV---\u000a\u000aOut of interest, which GP surgery took a month to get an appointment?
p27377
aV(feel free to name &amp; shame them)\u000a\u000a...was it a month?
p27378
aVor was it four months as you'd said previously?
p27379
aVYou also said that prior to seeing a doctor she'd only been seen by nurses and that they'd prescribed antibiotics.
p27380
aVNurses can't prescribe *any* drugs, even asprin.
p27381
aVSo that doesn't make much sense either.
p27382
aV---\u000a\u000aMaybe if your posts were more consistent in the information you're providing about the situation people wouldn't add to the confusion.
p27383
aVPeople are rushing to conclusions and being generally assholes, it seems.
p27384
aVI have no clue who the GP was; she is in Golders Green, so one of those places.
p27385
aVHer first appointment was asked in March, and she got to see a nurse around the beginning of April.
p27386
aV(In between the emergency room visit.
p27387
aV) She actually met her in the beginning of June, so fuck me, I was wrong.
p27388
aVIt was only three and months and a week.
p27389
aVEver had an earache when you felt your inner ear will burst your face out?
p27390
aVPerhaps then you don't want to wait for a month to see a nurse.
p27391
aVYeah.
p27392
aVCondescending knowitall.
p27393
aVI doubt an A&amp;E consultant would know what to do for earache anyway.
p27394
aVMuch better to get a GP referral to a specialist.
p27395
aVAnd people wonder why A&amp;E waiting is so long.....
p27396
aVI myself would go to ASDA and spend 12p on ibuprofen.\u000a\u000a
p27397
aVIncredibly stupid comment... Good on you, mate.
p27398
aVI think you just won some price of some sort.
p27399
aVhttp://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/irredeemable-fuckwit-gif.gif\u000a\u000aBy all means, please, when you are severe pain, take ibuprofen.
p27400
aVThis is the best way to remove yourself from the gene pool.
p27401
aV(Have you heard of intracranial complications?
p27402
aVHow idiotic do you have to be to even suggest things like this?
p27403
aV)\u000a\u000ahttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/860323-overview\u000a\u000aThere you go, asshole.
p27404
aVStick to your ibuprofen. 
p27405
aVChill,\u000a\u000aNo, of course I haven't heard of intercranial complications.
p27406
aVIs it a symptom of hypochondriasis?
p27407
aVIts still not an immediate life threatening condition.
p27408
aVIf a GP isn't available the correct service to use is a walk-in centre.
p27409
aVIncorrect use of services doesn't get sympathy.
p27410
aV[deleted]
p27411
aVYes, she is registered.
p27412
aVThat's not been my experience at all.
p27413
aVI've had ear problems twice in the last few years.
p27414
aVThe first time I got a GP appointment within less than a week.
p27415
aVMy GP thought it was full of wax, syringed it out then and there, found an ear infection behind the wax, and prescribed me some type of topical antibiotic which cleared it up in no time.
p27416
aVThe second time, I got an appointment with the practice nurse in less than a  week.
p27417
aVWas told to put olive oil in for ten days or so and come back.
p27418
aVEar syringed and a foreign object revealed, which the practice nurse removed with tweezers.
p27419
aVThe only issue is that ear problems aren't usually considered an emergency and so in our practice we need to wait for about a week for an appointment.
p27420
aVThis was a problem for my wife when she developed earache just before we were due to go on holiday.
p27421
aVThankfully after some discussion the practice fitted in a appointment with the practice nurse next day and it all got sorted.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p27422
aVI'm not saying all of NHS is bad.
p27423
aVI just gave one example of my bad experiences.
p27424
aV(I have about 2 more cases.
p27425
aV) It's not a representative sample, merely an indication that not all is well all the time.
p27426
aVThere must be some regional differences, but the only waiting time map I've found was for Central London: http://www.mapsdata.co.uk/portfolio-items/mapping-health-data/\u000a\u000aApparently waiting times for GPs is going to get worse because of our ageing population and a shortage of doctors who want to become GPs.
p27427
aVSweden has about the best healthcare outcomes in the world, and their system doesn't cost much more than the UK.
p27428
aVThe secret of their success is that everything is funded and managed locally.
p27429
aVBut I wonder if they have a lot of disparity in waiting times. \u000a\u000a
p27430
aVFrankly put anecdotes don't mean anything in the grand scheme of things. 
p27431
aVWell, tell this to yourself when the system fails you.
p27432
aVBetter yet, tell this to the Stafford Hospital patients who died needlessly.
p27433
aVI'm sure they'd understand.
p27434
aVMind you, I'm not saying NHS is bad, let's get rid of it, but your dismissive tone of an obvious failure of the system shows something more than just having issues with NHS.
p27435
aVIt shows you are casually dismissing problems in order to defend something mindlessly.
p27436
aVSomething that might actually be improved had people not acted like a bunch of drunken jerks defending their favorite football team in a fucking pub.
p27437
aVI don't need to tell anyone anything, anecdotes mean nothing.
p27438
aVThis is a fact .. statistics 101.
p27439
aVI have used the NHS extensively and it's been great.
p27440
aVThis means it's the best healthcare system in the world.
p27441
aVNo wait, that's not how how it works in the real world.
p27442
aVYour anecdote means nothing, mine means nothing.
p27443
aVThe data means everything. \u000a
p27444
aVRiiiight.
p27445
aVI know there is google in Norfolk; I lived there, so I'm not sure why you can't do a simple google search.
p27446
aVThe first couple of hits will give you enough statistics which support my experience and not yours.
p27447
aVHow about that?
p27448
aVAnecdotal evidence supported by cold hard statistics?

p27454
aVYou have moved the goal posts, my original point still stands.
p27455
aVYour anecdote means nothing.
p27456
aVNow your actually making a valid point .
p27457
aVAnd your miss using the word "troll", chum. 
p27458
aVAh yes.
p27459
aVI always wonder about these stats.
p27460
aV2-3 weeks to see a GP, six months to see a specialist, terrible cancer care.. Botched operations left right and centre.
p27461
aVMid staffs, fiddling of stats , 5th biggest employer in the world, hospitals going bust because of PFI with up to 10% if the NHS budget hidden in PFI as well.
p27462
aVI don't get it.
p27463
aVClearly you're all using a different NHS to me.
p27464
aVEdit.
p27465
aVThe NHS is shit.
p27466
aVIt's the laughing stock of Europe. 
p27467
aVOr the media is just cherry picking the horror stories...
p27468
aVClearly I am, I phone up in the morning and get an afternoon appointment.
p27469
aV10 minutes to see a GP, a few weeks to see a specialist, and cancer care that was good enough to save my aunt.
p27470
aVClearly, you must be using a different NHS.
p27471
aVOr perhaps you'll acknowledge that provision is poor in some locations, and that's an issue that should be tackled, while not branding the rest of the NHS as being as poor as them?
p27472
aVThe problem is nobody allows us to talk about being treated badly, so that it can be acknowledged that provision is poor in some locations.
p27473
aVWe're just shouted down for daring the question the NHS.
p27474
aVWhy are you branding the entire NHS to be as good only by the standards of where it provides the best care?
p27475
aVAre the rest of us not important?
p27476
aVWho is waiting 2-3 weeks to see a GP?
p27477
aVAnd 6 months to see a specialist?
p27478
aVI've had to wait 3 months to see a GI specialist but now it's happened the ball is rolling very quickly especially since it's not a urgent issue.
p27479
aVAnd that is why we better privatise it.
p27480
aVWho wants to be the best when you can have average and a bunch of richer rich people.
p27481
aVBeing honest, the NHS won't be here much longer.
p27482
aVThe government simply can't afford to keep putting money in with out anything coming out.
p27483
aVThe amount of people coming to England only for the health care is massive and it's only getting bigger. 
p27484
aVDoesn't our national insurance cover this?
p27485
aVThe only thing we can really take from this is that the UK healthcare is cheap.
p27486
aVHuh?
p27487
aVWe came first on nearly every single criteria.
p27488
aVTake a look at the chart.
p27489
aVThe "healthy lives" criteria is the one that measures life expectancy and death rates from conditions treatable with medical care.
p27490
aVWe come second last.
p27491
aVOnly the US is worse and many people there can't access healthcare at all.
p27492
aVWhat does that say about the quality of healthcare provided?
p27493
aVI know Australia is just as obese, and has equivalent problems with binge drinking, smoking and lack of exercise - yet Australia comes fourth in the "healthy living" criteria.
p27494
aVThe other criteria mostly measure forms of 'efficiency' and cost.
p27495
aVThis report tells us that the NHS is great with costs, but not great with healthcare outcomes.
p27496
aVVery vague criteria though.
p27497
aVHow does one judge "quality of care" in a way that allows comparison between countries?
p27498
aVThe article seems to say that the US suffers because so many people are uninsured or that not every person has their own doctor - but those aren't inherently bad things.
p27499
aVThat's why the only result I trust is the cold hard number for how much it costs.
p27500
aVYou don't believe that a high percentage of the population in the US having no access to healthcare is an inherently bad thing? 
p27501
aVThis is just the headline chart from a [thirty two page report](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2014/jun/1755_davis_mirror_mirror_2014.pdf) (PDF link) with fully referenced methodology.
p27502
aVEach of the indicators is the synthesis of a number of clearly phrased questions or metrics.
p27503
aVYou could argue about the methodology, but the criteria are not especially vague.

p27507
aVFrom the Washington Post article\u000a\u000a&gt;In 2004, the U.K. ranked third of the five nations studied.
p27508
aVThe U.K. diagnosed its health care system\u2019s problems and addressed them, Davis said.
p27509
aV\u201cThey really have moved up over time.
p27510
aVA lot of it has been systematic attention to increasing resources in the system,\u201d \u000a\u000aFrom the Daily Mail article:\u000a\u000a&gt;The latest figures are not yet available although Professor  Jarman suspects death rates in England have fallen because care has substantially improved.
p27511
aVSo yeah, looks like we've improved dramatically over the last ten years
p27512
aV10 years is a long time, and the Daily Mail is the worst place for a balanced, non reactionary view. 
p27513
aVAlso the proprietors of the Daily Mail are very keen on seeing the dismantling of the NHS, hence the constant litany of NHS related bullshit it vomits.

aVBeing a typical student, I got front row of the Jezza K show.
p27517
aVHe spoke to me, and said I was a lazy student.
p27518
aVI said he was my inspiration.
p27519
aVHe gave me the finger.
p27520
aVBest moment of my life.
p27521
aVWell worth the £30k student debt.
p27522
aVI also had a decent shot of me behind him gawking at the proles before me.
p27523
aVI so want this to be true
p27524
aVMay actually be true my girlfriend went with a load of mates and he went through a load of questions getting people to sit down if it didn't apply to them the last question was "Who here had sex this morning?
p27525
aV"\u000a\u000aGirlfriend was the only one standing up so he berated her with questions about sexual positions and protection and my proficiency in the bedroom.

aVAlong with a gambling and drink scandal. 
p27528
aVHe should go on Jeremy Kyle.
p27529
aVProbably is.
p27530
aVMy mates went and they had a chat with him.
p27531
aVIt seems like a recurring theme that he pokes fun at students.
p27532

aVAh, the more you know.

aVGood comeback.
p27539
aVCan confirm.
p27540
aVSource: Privileged Uni student who got offered Jezza tickets but had course work due for 9am next day that I had not finished so had to decline :(.
p27541
aVYou've got a little something just ... there
p27542
aVYeah, I always find it really hypocritical when Jeremy Kyle starts having a go at chavs for drug use in front of an audience of students, most of whom buy and use drugs from chavs almost as frequently.
p27543
aVThe only difference being that the chavs on stage are using 'the tax payers' money' to pay for it, whereas those in the audience are just using their parents' money or their Uni grants - which is actually tax payers' money - to pay for it.
p27544
aVEdit: Am I the only person whose friends received grants?
p27545
aVNo, they aren't from the 1970s, I went to Uni in 2009 and many of my friends were given maintenance GRANTS (completely separate from their loans).
p27546
aVThey're based on how much money your parents make.
p27547
aVHeck, I could even have applied for one, but would have only worked out at about £80 a semester.
p27548
aVSome of my mates got the full 3k, ON TOP of their loans.
p27549
aVSurely I'm not the only person this has happened to?
p27550
aVThat's a little harsh, I'm sure some of the students work to pay for their drugs themselves :P \u000a\u000aSeriously though, the majority of the audience will be younger people (probably university students) who are able to go to a TV recording in the middle of the day for a few hours.

aV[deleted]
p27552
aVDid she try to put some deep religious notion behind it, like teaching you to be tolerant or compassionate? \u000a\u000a 
p27553
aVMy RE teacher taught us how he was abused by his father as part of sex ed.
p27554
aVI'm not sure which is worse. 
p27555
aVI wouldn't say "most of", none of my uni friends take drugs.
p27556
aVReally?
p27557
aVI'd probably say at least 1/3 or 1/4 of my friends were frequent users of either weed, MDMA or sometimes coke. 
p27558
aVthey can afford coke?
p27559
aV!
aVCornwall has some of the cheapest drug prices in the country apparently, because it all gets smuggled in through Newlin and Penzance.
p27560
aVBasically they were buying it wholesale haha
p27561
aVit's still coke, even if you got it from costco
p27562
aVWell played
p27563
aVtoplad
p27564
aVFair point.
p27565
aVTalking from my own experiences of being a stoned student and watching Jeremy Kyle every day for three years, and my criticism is directed towards the hypocrisy of the show, not it's student audience
p27566
aVAlso it bothers me that you called them "grants" 
p27567
aVThat's what they're called
p27568
aVAre you redditing from the 80s through a time portal connected to a BBC Micro?
p27569
aVNo just you know... the present day with my laptop
p27570
aVThey are loans, not grants 
p27571
aVSome of us for grants as well as the loan. 
p27572
aVAnd bursaries and scholarships.
p27573
aVPotato, potato.
p27574
aVEverybody is entitled to a grant, which is means tested via your household income.\u000a
p27575
aVA grant doesn't put you in debt
p27576
aVgenerational thing I think.
p27577
aVMy generation (current) had to pay lots for uni so are a bit more careful.
p27578
aVI DJ at a lot of student events and have done for over a decade, and went to uni 96-99; the idea that modern students or more careful than previous generations is laughable.
p27579
aVIf anything, the whole getting shitfaced culture is worse than before because of relaxed licensing rules, when I was at uni clubs all kicked out at 2am.
p27580
aVmaybe I assumed I am typical.
p27581
aVguess not.
p27582
aVProbably depends on the uni.
p27583
aVI know of some where people were pretty reserved and others (like mine) where most people couldn't stand upright.
p27584
aVNot many drugs, though.
p27585
aVIn halls I lived opposite a guy who liked a bit of weed every now and then, but he was the only one I am aware of in a building of more than a hundred students.
p27586
aVAnd this is exactly why people put so much stock in anecdotal evidence despite the fact that it is not useful.
p27587
aVYou are utterly average.
p27588
aVCongrats. 
p27589
aVand you are below average.
p27590
aVI'm top of the bell-curve, bitch. 
p27591
aVsure you are: top of the bell curve of "amount of clothes bought at the toilet store"
p27592
aVYou're above average in the number of penises you've touched. 
p27593
aVEveryone loves Ket up north. 
p27594
aVYeah, from school to uni in Newcastle.
p27595
aVAtleast it isnt meth
p27596
aVWe all know that's complete horse shit don't we.
p27597
aVthanks for the insightful input.
p27598
aVYou don't pay for uni out of your student loan, so you wouldn't have to be careful with the money
p27599
aVYou guys are missing out
p27600
aVI'm sorry.
p27601
aVYou may be surprised.
p27602
aVObviously I don't know your friends but a surprisingly high amount of my friends do and I had no idea.
p27603
aVUnfortunately 'zero' isn't a useful statistical sample size ;)
p27604
aVThe drugs around where I live are crap apparently so I don't think anyone in the uni bothers with much beyond weed. 
p27605
aVI'm meant to be going to Aber for uni in September...might have to change that now
p27606
aVIf your choice of uni is based on drug availability, maybe higher education, and indeed Aberystwyth generally (it is a relatively sedate and peaceful place, and lovely in my opinion) aren't for you.
p27607
aVThat said, surrounded by agriculture as we are, I've heard there are good mycology prospects at the right time of year.
p27608
aVhehehe, **high**er education
p27609
aVDon't worry, I barely even like alcohol, I'm certainly not into drugs of any kind
p27610
aVAnd isn't it great that alcohol isn't a drug?
p27611
aVThat's what you think now, I go to Bangor and I had never been drunk before uni but the first night of freshers week... oh man.
p27612
aVOn Halloween I may have sampled some other exotic burning materials as well.
p27613
aVwow you so cool
p27614
aVI'm just warning people that may never have touched alcohol before that uni may be a different experience to what they thought.
p27615
aVi was alluding to your consumption of 'exotic burning materials'.
p27616
aVyour at least 18 ffs, just call it weed.
p27617
aVI went through 3 years of university without getting drunk, despite several of my new friends claiming that they'd do it.
p27618
aVThey didn't.
p27619
aVSame for two years of college.
p27620
aVStill mostly teetotal.
p27621
aVWhy can I ask?
p27622
aVIt's just beer and wine I don't like.
p27623
aVI mostly stick to fruity ciders or Pimms...god I sound so middle class
p27624
aVWhy do you hate Britain?
p27625
aVhaha big up Bangor University!
p27626
aVFuck off Aber

aVHey man, I was doing 5 shifts a week when I was at uni.
p27628
aVI paid for those drugs myself
p27629
aVyou're a better man than me, I'll admit that much.
p27630
aV[deleted]
p27631
aVNah just from York.
p27632
aVI was at uni in Newcastle.
p27633
aVI don't really have the hook up in York at all, not since before I went to uni, so 2009.
p27634
aVSorry brah.
p27635
aVJeremy was a gambling addict for a long time, he's hardly in a place to judge. 
p27636
aVYet he does every episode
p27637
aVYes.
p27638
aVYes he does.
p27639
aVI feel like the shame/disgust he feels for how he was comes out as anger and disgust on that stage. 
p27640
aVAnd his show is sponsored by a Bingo Company whose advertisement bumpers kind of seem a bit inappropriate when they follow a segment about a gambling problem\u000a
p27641
aVThat's hilarious.
p27642
aVBingo might not seem like hardcore gambling but if people are spending what little they have on it and wasting their savings it can still be a problem.
p27643
aVI always thought that too...
p27644
aVI love how he talks about his brothers problems quite often.
p27645
aVHis poor brother has worked hard to get through them, yet gets talked about on national TV weekly.
p27646
aV[Jeremy Kyle is not a nice man, he participates in chav bateing which is quite frankly , racist.
p27647
aV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Ni2Rko8BI)
p27648
aVIf I ever get the chance I'm going to go and watch the Jeremy Kyle show while on drugs.
p27649
aVReally stick it to the man.
p27650
aVI'm doing it right now.
p27651
aVWell worth the irony.
p27652
aVI meant actually be in the audience while high, unless that's what you're doing in which case trip on.
p27653
aVCan confirm, I now people whose parents were divorced, and between them would have earned more than the baseline amount to exclude them from getting grants.
p27654
aVBut as they lived apart they had to put the address of one house, so obviously they put the address of the parent earning less money.
p27655
aVThey got a £3k yearly grant, a loan to cover their tuition fees (like everyone else) and a £900 a year bursary on top of that.
p27656
aVThe system needs to change but I can't say that they were complaining.
p27657
aVArguments did break out over who was to get the next round in the pubs a lot though
p27658
aVSame as EMA.
p27659
aVKids got it in my School just because their parents were separated.
p27660
aVOne girl got £35 a week - her divorced dad worked in the Middle East as an oil merchant. 
p27661
aVYeah I know someone who got £30 a week.
p27662
aVSmuggest motherfucker ever
p27663
aVYup, dat shit cray.
p27664
aVI don't think a single person at my school direly needed a whole £35 a week, should've been capped at £20/25.
p27665
aVGrants?
p27666
aVI wish.
p27667
aVI have to pay for those drugs monthly for the next 20 years.
p27668
aVWTF is a "Uni grant"?
p27669
aVDepending on your household income you get a grant in addition to loans that cover the Tuition Fee (paid directly to the University) and the Maintenance loan (for living expenses).
p27670
aVUnlike the others you don't have to pay back the grants. 
p27671
aV[deleted]
p27672
aVIt can be in addition to or in lieu of.
p27673
aVYou can definitely get both, I learnt from living with 3 people who all get the grant AND claim the maintenance loan
p27674
aVAnnoyed the hell out of me.
p27675
aVYou either have the guys whose parents can afford it or you have the guys who get a grant + their loan whereas I wasn't eligible for a grant but my family aren't well off enough to have helped me.
p27676
aVFuck that.
p27677
aVSame position here... lower middle class gets fucked over the most I guess. 
p27678
aV[deleted]
p27679
aVah i see.
p27680
aVcheers for clearing that up
p27681
aVI'm surprised and glad that exists. 
p27682
aVAlso known as a 'Scottish University Education'.
p27683
aV&gt;Uni grants.
p27684
aVWhat is this 'grant' of which you speak?\u000a
p27685
aVGrant/subsidies.
p27686
aVYou get them if your parents earn below a set amount, are divorced or sometimes if you have good grades.
p27687
aVCalled bursaries now though
p27688
aVIsn't that what is handed out directly from the university?
p27689
aVMaybe it has changed with 9k fees but the non-repayable bit that the SLC gave to you was a grant, and the bursary was something the university handled.
p27690
aVThis was only a year or two ago.
p27691
aVYou're right.
p27692
aVMy student finance letter calls the bit that I don't have to pay back the grant, and I get bursaries from the university which I also don't have to pay back.
p27693
aVThe bursaries aren't handed out to everyone though and are dependant on your family/living situation.
p27694
aVGrants are for specific things ie if you're a lone parent and bursaries are household income dependent.
p27695
aVThere are also trusts, endowments and scholarships which are also non repayable.
p27696
aVBarely anyone at my uni did drugs and those that did smoked weed a couple of times a week.
p27697
aVGetting drunk is way cheaper.
p27698
aVHate to break it to you but drugs are definitely a lot cheaper than alcohol.
p27699
aVChav is an oppressive term.
p27700
aVStop using it and fuck off.
p27701
aVEDIT: Check out the bourgeois up in arms.
p27702
aV"Downvote this for me please, Jeffrey.
p27703
aV"
aVFuck off is an oppressive/silencing phrase.
p27704
aVStop using it and people might listen to you.
p27705
aVFuck off.
p27706
aVYou'll note I don't disagree that chav *is* an oppressive term and that demonising the working class is a terrible idea for everyone.
p27707
aVNot all working class people are chavs...
p27708
aV*You* know this.
p27709
aV*I* know this.
p27710
aVPeople whose image of the working class comes mostly or only from TV/newspaper/whatever don't have such a solid grasp on this concept.
p27711
aVThe "chav" idea is a way to make the working class unsympathetic to people "above" working class, that *They* deserve to be poor/have dead-end, shithole jobs, because urgh they dress *wrong* and talk *wrong* and act *wrong*.
p27712
aVSo when one of these Enlightened people get to make a decision about the working class, they imagine the "chav" image, and don't have to feel bad about shitting on them.
p27713
aVCunts are cunts whether they're poor or not.
p27714
aVBeing shit on (worse schools, worse jobs, worse housing) makes you be covered in shit.
p27715
aVAh that makes sense.
p27716
aVHonestly not something ive ever really given much thought.
p27717
aVCheers!
p27718
aVI know.
p27719
aVIt was just a feeble attempt at 'lulz'
p27720
aVIn this context it's descriptive.
p27721
aVFor all you know I might be the biggest chav you've ever seen. 
p27722
aVActually you're getting downvoted because you're obviously a twat, love Jeffrey. 
p27723
aVHave you ever experienced this type of oppression?
p27724
aVI'll retract the "Fuck Off" but I take the term Chav seriously.
p27725
aVIt affected me at college, and its affected many people around me.
p27726
aVIt perpetuates this fucking class shite.
p27727
aVI'm sure Karl Marx and Martin Luther King feel your pain from beyond the grave.
p27728
aVYou're using Chav in a class sense, I'm using it in a descriptive sense.
p27729
aVEg.
p27730
aVA Chav, a grunger, an Emo, a Goth, a Greebo. 
p27731
aVChav isn't simply a descriptive.
p27732
aVIt's got VERY negative connotations.
p27733
aVProbably because the people it is associated with give it a bad name. 
p27734
aVOh god.
p27735
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb8wH_XlLfA
p27736
aVDo you see how the man being interviewed in that video is doing a better job of getting his point across than you are? 
p27737
aVArguably the best comment I've seen all day.
p27738
aVUnlucky it's so far down on a thread.
p27739
aVYes.
p27740
aV&gt;Uni grants\u000a\u000aWhat is this, 1973?
p27741
aVThey're student loans now, dear
p27742
aVoh the shire, how goes ye
p27743
aV***SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS INTENSIFIES***
p27744
aVI hate this guy, he's just the unashamed face of everything that's wrong with our culture, dressed up as a "helpful hero" type, all the while pocketing the cash and there's so many people that watch it "BECAUSE HE HELPS PEOPLE ITS REALITY OMGZ!
p27745
aV" No, he doesn't, he's an opportunistic cunt, but just as much shame on the people that go on his show because 5 minutes of looking will find 100 better places to get help than this assholes stage.
p27746
aVHe is the Daily Mail given form, all that is sneering and vile delivered unto us that we may know suffering unending by his glorious hand.
p27747
aVJennifer Saunders [played him so well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVmYLq2kUco)
p27748
aVWow, that's spot on!
p27749
aVHe and everyone in the audience knows that the show is not about helping people.
p27750
aVI've been and it's all one big in joke, and he openly admits it to the crowd.
p27751
aVSo at least he's honest about it.
p27752
aVEveryone knows, [except the subjects of the show](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/07/itv.television), apparently.
p27753
aVGreat article, really interesting.
p27754
aVOriginal artist is Jenni Sparks.
p27755
aVYou can see the rest of here brilliant illustrations [here](http://jennisparks.com/).
p27756
aVCan't understand why someone felt the need to remove the artists name from the image.
p27757
aVI see that a lot on Reddit.
p27758
aVNo idea why people do it.
p27759
aVLove the girl in the Black Magic vest.... Mmmmmmmm
p27760
aVFuck Jeremy Kyle and the whole "LOOK AT THIS LOSER!
p27761
aVAT LEAST YOUR LIFE ISNT AS BAD AS THIS!
p27762
aV" bullshit.
p27763
aVI spend quite a bit of time in my work visiting long term benefit claimants at home.
p27764
aVA large majority of the people I visit have this shit show playing on their TV when I walk in.
p27765
aVIn fact, I actually visited a couple that had been on this show recently.
p27766
aVBoth of them had pretty obvious learning difficulties and were exploited for cheap entertainment in which a paternity test was involved.
p27767
aVI've always thought of Jeremy Kyle as a show that encourages poor people to hate themselves.
p27768
aV^(or is that just ITV in general?
p27769
aV)
aVIt's ITV in a nutshell.
p27770
aVPoor people arguing!
p27771
aVPoor people selling stuff!
p27772
aVAnt and Dec are giving away free tat to their poor audience members!
p27773
aVNow Simon Cowell has pissed on it and told them how utterly miserable their lives will be!
p27774
aVAnd now to cleanse the palette, here's a period drama!
p27775
aVLook at all these rich old people!
p27776
aVYou'll never be as successful or cultured as them!
p27777
aVYou may as well go into Robert Dyas, buy a length of rope, and hang yourself!
p27778
aVWhat's that, your local store has been replaced with an up market coffee shop?
p27779
aVWell of course, fuck you poor people! 
p27780
aVChannel 4 is somewhat similar, though it reminds me more of a zoo.
p27781
aV"Watch Britain's fattest dwarf....*on benefits*". 
p27782
aVChannel 4 doesn't seem to have as clear an agenda though.
p27783
aVOften they try to stir up right wingers as well.
p27784
aVIt's just 'lets be as edgy as possible and see how much attention we get.
p27785
aV'
aVI don't know, "Benefits Street" made me really uncomfortable. 
p27786
aV*First guest walks on*\u000a\u000aJK: "Don't worry about them (The Audience) they should be at work"\u000a\u000aPriviliged Upper Middle Class Audience: *Giggles*\u000a\u000aEvery show ever.
p27787
aV"Use a condom"\u000a\u000a"But I'm a virgin"\u000a\u000a"Then get a job"\u000a\u000a"I'm only 13"\u000a\u000a"You make me sick, get off my show".
p27788
aV&gt; You make me sick\u000a\u000aNeeds more italics for emphasis.
p27789
aVThis guy is an affront to counselling, therapy and humanity in general. 
p27790
aVReminds me of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZb9-7i-ncc
p27791
aVAh, dead ringers... best show of my childhood!
p27792
aVAll the good satire shows seem to be gone, e.g.
p27793
aVBremner Bird and Fortune and Dead Ringers.
p27794
aVJohn Fortune sadly died last year as well so any chance of a return of the show is impossible now.
p27795
aVWonder if Bremner and Bird will ever get together though
p27796
aVThe now show is good, but unfortunately they don't do impressions; I think there was a radio version of dead ringers recently, but tv was better.
p27797
aVThe now show has loads of impressions usually by Jon Culshaw at least once a series. 
p27798
aVHaha, love the bit about Graham (he's a legend, supposedly)
p27799
aVI've always wondered about his qualifications....
p27800
aV[Looks like](http://www.grahamstanier.com/) he's a Psychology graduate with a Masters in psychotherapy and counselling.
p27801
aV.., although it neglects to say from where. 
p27802
aV[deleted]
p27803
aVHmm.
p27804
aVMy theory is he specifically told them not to bring up jk before hand. 
p27805
aVOut of curiosity, who's Graham and how does he resolve family feuds?
p27806
aVI love the pushing the chairs apart.
p27807
aVSo delightfully petty
p27808
aVMost of the people who agree to be on the show are from poor backgrounds and have the IQ of a child of a normally civillised city.
p27809
aVThis is missing the step where you press the off button on your remote.
p27810
aVI think my favourite 'Jeremy Kyle moment' had to be when he got hit in the head with an envelope.
p27811
aVThe look he gave afterwards, like a perturbed ostrich on high alert... it almost made watching it worthwhile.
p27812
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wr-oAL958M#t=49
p27813
aVEnvelope isn't even the best bit, it's the guest calling Jeremy out on his being a bossy coward:\u000a\u000a&gt;(Bouncers leer over guest; Jeremy stands behind them)\u000a\u000a&gt;**Jezza**: It's really mature, being you, isn't it?
p27814
aV&gt;**Guest**: I'll give you mature, mate.
p27815
aVYour big mans all stood next to ya, innit?
p27816
aV&gt;**Jezza**: (awkward pause) Why don't you just concentrate on the truth?
p27817
aVMind, those bouncers probably have to be there for health and safety.
p27818
aVJezza might not even want them (doubtful, but just saying).
p27819
aV"You throw it at me, I throw it at you, your mum"\u000a\u000aREKT
p27820
aVI think he might have said mong and not mum, but I'm not sure.
p27821
aVMan, I want to believe.
p27822
aVThat was an impressive throw.
p27823
aVJeremy looked a bit out of his depth there.
p27824
aVikr!
p27825
aVI feel like if I had tried I would have missed!
p27826
aVFull house!
p27827
aVS/He passed every question!
p27828
aVAlso-\u000a\u000a"Oh, the test's wrong is it?
p27829
aVDon't give me that.
p27830
aVYou passed the first question!
p27831
aV"\u000a\u000a...
p27832
aVI watch this show too often.
p27833
aV(It's good background noise..)
p27834
aVThe Jeremy Kyle Show exists purely so the second lowest common denominator can make fun of the lowest common denominator and feel superior.
p27835
aVI knew there was a reason I watch the show.\u000a
p27836
aVThey should make everyone with depression watch this on repeat.
p27837
aVYou'd have cured depression within 24 hours.
p27838
aVI liked him much better on Jezza's Virgin Confessions on Virgin Radio.
p27839
aVSeemed more real and helpful and less chavvy and trash tv
p27840
aVBefore that he was on a local midlands station called BRMB.
p27841
aVHe called himself 'Jezza' in those days, mind.
p27842
aVJezza's Capital Confessions too when he was in London.
p27843
aVIt's heart breaking to see what he has become.
p27844
aVI'm going to have to listen to those.
p27845
aVI suppose 8 years of dealing with people like this every day takes it's toll.
p27846
aVThat said, one of the reasons I prefer The JKS to other day-time-tv is because there seems to be actual help.
p27847
aVAnd while he's harsh at the start, he's usually more helpful by the end if the guest hasn't been a twat.
p27848
aVHang on.
p27849
aVEdit: found it!
p27850
aVCopied from an earlier comment I made: \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOk.
p27851
aVSo, a couple of years ago my mum, then boyfriend and I used to love TJKS, and I went and got tickets to watch it be filmed in Manchester.
p27852
aVGood times!
p27853
aVOnly it wasn't a lie detector or chavs fighting episode, it was a weepy.
p27854
aVWe were a little disappointed that we wouldn't get to hear the rustle of tracksuits close up, but whatever.
p27855
aVSo a woman comes on stage, she's all upset, I don't remember why.
p27856
aVShe's sat in a chair, head in hands, crying, and JK is sat next to her, patting her back and saying comforting things.
p27857
aVWell, suddenly he stops, presses his earpiece in, listens, then says to the audience, 'there's a technical issue, will just take a couple of minutes to sort.
p27858
aV' Then he *physically picks up his chair, turns it away from the woman and ignores her.
p27859
aV* For a good five - seven minutes while she continues to sob.
p27860
aVAs soon as the technical issue was resolved, he turned back and continued his 'sympathetic tv show host role'.
p27861
aVI was appalled.
p27862
aVYou have any proof that you went?
p27863
aVAll I've got is a blurred pic of my and my mum in the audience that I took when it was aired on the telly.
p27864
aVI can post that if you want?
p27865
aVit was like 15 years ago, not sure you would find any of the old recordings!
p27866
aV&gt; That said, one of the reasons I prefer The JKS to other day-time-tv is because there seems to be actual help.
p27867
aVApparently not very much, and the show is hugely exploitative in general: http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/07/itv.television
p27868
aVThis is awesome, who is the artist?
p27869
aVOriginal artist is Jenni Sparks.
p27870
aVYou can get it on a t-shirt [here](http://jennisparks.com/Chat-Show-Flowchart).
p27871
aVWhat about chasing after them backstage! 
p27872
aVI haven't watched the Jeremy Kyle show enough to judge this, but it is reaffirming some assumptions I already had.
p27873
aV*GET GRAHAM OUT*
p27874
aV[deleted]
p27875
aVStep one: switch off the television.
p27876

aVOh right, thanks.
p27881
aVNo wait, what?

aVAnyone?

aV)
aV**STEP 2: GET YOUR HEARING SORTED!!
p27885
aV**
p27886
aVJeremy Kyle and Nigel Farage show me cunts who are slightly worse cunts than I am, so I'm gonna do whatever they ask.
p27887
aVShit, who remembers when fucking 'Kilroy' was the leader of UKIP? 
p27888
aVKilroy once punched me on the leg to get me to move up when I went and saw his show in college.
p27889
aVScience fact.
p27890
aVSometimes when I was driving late around Birmingham many years ago I used to listen to his show on BRMB.
p27891
aVHe used to get some right weirdos calling his show. 
p27892
aVJeremy Kyle loves himself.
p27893
aVI remember watching racing on channel 4 and they were interviewing Phil Daniels, you could just see his head popping up in the background desperately trying to get a look in, eventually Phil Daniels said "I think Jeremy wants an interview" it was too funny.
p27894
aVSounds like a UK version of Maury Povich or Jerry Springer.
p27895
aVIt does my heart good to know we aren't the only ones. 
p27896
aVNot sure who maury povich is, but Jeremy Kyle's show is similar to jerry springer imo\u000a\u000aJeremy Kyle gets angry at his guests (usually chavs) and there's real fights on the show, and he's generally a dick, shouts at the audience sometimes, and acts so smug and holier-than-thou, etc.
p27897
aVThere are lots of clips from the show on YouTube:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU9l15FgVbg \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1mCkxidPro\u000a\u000aIt's trash TV with weird people chosen intentionally, pls don't think this represents england :D\u000a\u000a
p27898
aVLol well I won't think it represents England if you won't think Springer represents America!
p27899
aVI am a huge British history nerd so I don't think that at all.
p27900
aVStereotypes only scratch the surface most of the time anyway right?
p27901
aVJerry's a jolly old laugh compared to this post-apocalyptic neo-Dickensian nightmare.
p27902
aVWow he got everything in one picture!
p27903
aVAmazing.
p27904
aVAny high quality file of this?
p27905
aVI love it!
p27906
aVBest you'll get is from the artists own website [here](http://jennisparks.com/Chat-Show-Flowchart).
p27907
aVHave you seen Jerry Springer, or Montel, Maury?
p27908
aVDo they just get a bunch of ridiculous personalities on the stage?
p27909
aVIf so, this is the true gold and beauty of reality TV. 
p27910
aVI'm confused, at the artist hasn't mentioned the point where he's a cunt. 
p27911
aVWhat is...?
p27912
aVFucking graham...
p27913
aVAre you indeed?
p27914
aVKeep it in your trousers...
p27915
aVI'm watching it right now.
p27916
aVIt's just awful, mainly because he's so up himself now.

aVThe latest Popbitch newsletter may put the show into further context:\u000a\u000a&gt;       *Nice reception*\u000a&gt;       Doing it for the digs\u000a\u000a&gt;    The producer of a big British daytime\u000a&gt;    talk show surveyed a group of guests\u000a&gt;    about why they had chosen to go on\u000a&gt;    telly to talk about their personal\u000a&gt;    problems.
p27920
aVWhat do you think the most\u000a&gt;    common answer was?
p27921
aV&gt;    To give their issues a wide, public\u000a&gt;    platform?
p27922
aVTo generate debate or help\u000a&gt;    others in the same position?
p27923
aVTo get\u000a&gt;    the sort of expert advice that only\u000a&gt;    TV money can buy?
p27924
aVErm, no.
p27925
aVThe most\u000a&gt;    popular answer given was: "To stay\u000a&gt;    in a nice hotel"\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;    Which becomes even more poignant\u000a&gt;    when you learn that the producer\u000a&gt;    revealed the 'nice hotel' they\u000a&gt;    book guests into is a Travelodge.

aVThe hypocrisy is sickening.
p27953
aVThe politicians on Question Time are bleating on about free speech and the right to offend while people are being jailed for posting insensitive jokes on Twitter.
p27954
aVI'm writing to my MP to ask them to pass on concerns regarding this to the relevant Minister.
p27955
aVThe Act which tweeters are arrested under is the Communications Act 2003.
p27956
aVIt would be great if you also wrote to your MP so that at least two letters are received regarding this issue.
p27957
aVHere's mine.
p27958
aVDear Nick Raynsford,\u000a\u000aI hope you agreed with Nick Clegg when he said that "People have to be\u000afree to offend each other" and with that in mind I hope you can push to\u000achange Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Section 4A inserted\u000ainto the Public Order Act 1986 which states\u000a\u000a(1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person\u000aharassment, alarm or distress, he\u2014 (a) uses threatening, abusive or\u000ainsulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays\u000aany writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening,\u000aabusive or insulting, thereby causing that or another person\u000aharassment, alarm or distress.
p27959
aVIn accordance with this statue a Glasgow man was arrested for making\u000aoff colour jokes on twitter\u000ahttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-30585301  and many others\u000ahave been investigated for similar comments made in bad taste.
p27960
aVI certainly agree that it should be a crime to threaten or harass but I\u000adraw the line at simple insults and probably abuse too.
p27961
aVYours sincerely,
p27962
aVNot to nitpick, but it wasn't a Glasgow man.
p27963
aVIt was a guy from Sunderland making jokes about something that happened in Glasgow.
p27964
aVNice letter, but you wrote:\u000a\u000a&gt;statue
p27965
aVNo wonder my MP doesn't give a flying shit about my opinion.
p27966
aVI live in Greenwich borough too, and he never responded in previous emails
p27967
aVI usually get a response from his secretary and occasionally an email or letter in reply.
p27968
aVIn this case I got this\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Thank you for your email to Nick Raynsford MP.
p27969
aVNick has raised your concerns with the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice.
p27970
aVAs soon as Nick receives a response I shall be in touch.
p27971
aV&gt;Best wishes,\u000a\u000a&gt;Jo\u000a\u000aSo at least that's something.
p27972
aVIts quite sad really, just last month about the Scottish rubbish truck joke it's stupid and a insensitive joke but a guy got got arrested for it.
p27973
aVWhat about Jimmy Carr and his jokes (which I find hilarious some times)...
p27974
aVHe does a 10 minute segment of really offensive jokes that only get worse purposely to see if he can offend someone.
p27975
aVNot seen any police raids on him.
p27976
aVAll goes along the lines of people get offended too easily on social media... Thing is nothing happens to you if you get offended which people seem to forget.
p27977
aVIt's a double standard.
p27978
aVThe guy made a rubbish truck joke, he got a arrested.
p27979
aVKatie hopkins makes a joke, she gets put on big brother.
p27980
aVOne rule for them one rule for us
p27981
aVYou're right, it's unfair she got a much worse punishment.
p27982
aVMaybe they'll let her transfer to a normal prison with good behaviour?
p27983
aVShe got put in a prison of Narcissism though, which most people would find atrocious, but to her its more akin to sticking a fat person in a prison made out of cake
p27984
aVI'll be honest, I have no idea who she is and I was just making a joke.
p27985
aVDon't worry about it, I just wanted to make a similar joke about a fat person in a prison made out of cake!
p27986
aVI like the idea of a prison made out of cake for fat people.
p27987
aVThey can easily eat their way out, but why would they want to leave the precious cake?
p27988
aV?
aVJust put her in solitary confinement for a few years. 
p27989
aV&gt; The guy made a rubbish truck joke\u000a\u000aPersonally I thought it was pretty good.\u000a\u000a
p27990
aVThat woman is the absolute definition of a sour cunt
p27991
aVYou're right, also these kind of jokes have been passed around so much over the years.
p27992
aVAlmost instantly after a tragic event.
p27993
aVSomebody once told me that the vast majority originated in Liverpool and then went viral via verbal/email/text.
p27994
aVI haven't heard of any complaints about these forms of communication before.
p27995
aVI think it's just the gov trying to pass more and more legislation enabling them control over the Internet.
p27996
aVThey're scared about how easily dissent spreads online.
p27997
aVMaybe the politicians are reeling that people are able to insult them online, make fake accounts and satirise them.
p27998
aVThey can't exactly prosecute those people because it wouldn't be the right story.
p27999
aV&gt; Somebody once told me that the vast majority originated in Liverpool\u000a\u000aIntriguing allegation there.
p28000
aVAre the people of Liverpool uniquely skilled in creating offensive jokes?
p28001
aVI was there as a student and can confirm their sense of humour tends to be a little dark, but then perhaps I'm wrong because I'd probably gravitate towards that.
p28002
aVI know somebody that breeds jokes in his mind like microbes in a culture (impossible to tell), he told me about many jokes originating in LP so I kind of took his word for it.
p28003
aVEdit: I've had a look and can't find anything regionally specific.
p28004
aVDidn't hear about the rubbish truck joke, does anyone have a link to an article on it?
p28005
aV"freedom of speech if you have the right voice"\u000a\u000aPenny Rimbaud.
p28006
aVYou dont really have freedom of speech in UK, to really have freedom of speech you need to be able to also have the ability to freely offend people...
p28007
aVHowever thats illegal in uk.
p28008
aV"However there is a broad sweep of exceptions including threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior intending or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress or cause a breach of the peace (which has been used to prohibit racist speech targeted at individuals)"\u000a\u000a[From Wikipedia.
p28009
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country#United_Kingdom)\u000a\u000aObviously you dont always know if you are offending someone, and you may not of intended to insult anyone...
p28010
aVSo this is law enforced by feels rather than reels...\u000a\u000a
p28011
aVI wonder if the cartoons published in Paris would have fallen foul of this law if published in the UK.
p28012
aVIf they were deemed to provoke racial hatred then yes.
p28013
aVProbably only if you tweeted them.
p28014
aVYes, or similar.
p28015
aVWhen a number of uk publications wanted to publish the Danish cartoons last time round, they were advised by police that they may break the law, incite public disorder, and the police would not protect the pubkication's safety.
p28016
aV&gt; they were advised by police that they may break the law, incite public disorder, and the police would not protect the pubkication's safety.
p28017
aVReally?
p28018
aVIf so that is vastly overstepping the power police have.
p28019
aVIt is for courts to decide what is illegal.
p28020
aVPolice have to defend murderers from lynch mobs if it comes to it.
p28021
aVI think it's pretty obvious what probably happened.
p28022
aVThe police &amp; presumably the government at the time didn't want trouble, so they had a quiet word with major TV, newspapers and magazines.
p28023
aVA little bit of this subsequently leaked out, as it's obvious some journalists are unhappy about this, as it's been tangentally mentioned in a number of press articles in the last couple of days.
p28024
aVI can't find the story that mentioned it again yesterday - I think it was in the Spectator and Telegraph.
p28025
aVYou may also recall that in 2006 (?
p28026
aV) Channel 4 had a live debate TV program in which vieweers voted whether or not to show images of Mohammed.
p28027
aVThe viewers voted yes, but Channel 4 decided not to show the images anyway.
p28028
aVNevertheless, it is certainly a fact that individuals &amp; organizations who would otherwise be opposed to extremism, regularly do not get involved in this on police advice.
p28029
aVe.g.
p28030
aVhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/10588267/Lib-Dem-candidate-receives-death-threats-for-tweeting-Prophet-Mohammed-cartoon.html\u000a"A spokesman for the Quilliam Foundation said the organisation would not be commenting on the matter, after receiving advice from the police.
p28031
aV"\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the near universal failure by the UK press to show the images now, again has the same underlying reason.
p28032
aVNo, because they aren't directed at a person.
p28033
aVIs there anywhere I can get clarity on what the limits of free speech are in the UK?
p28034
aVI know someone was arrested for saying they wished that a killer had pissed on the corpse of his victim - the teacher - on twitter recently.
p28035
aVDid anything come of that?
p28036
aVI mean while it's not really a nice thing to say, I support someone's right to hold that view.
p28037
aVSo long as they are not hurting anyone.
p28038
aVI can see a situation where I truly despise a certain person and so if bad comes to them, I wouldn't be sad; I mean, say these terrorists in France, I imagine if they end up dead in a police shootout, you would get lots of people holding the view 'great, they're dead.
p28039
aVShould piss on the corpses too'.
p28040
aVWould people be arrested for saying that on twitter?
p28041
aVWhat's the difference between the first and second - it just depends on your opinion on the deceased?
p28042
aVAre people being arrested for opinions they hold?
p28043
aVIs it the fact that they put it on social media - can it be sent in a private message?
p28044
aVSaid to people down the pub?
p28045
aVSerious question rather than trolling here.
p28046
aVSometimes I really don't know what i can say or not.
p28047
aV&gt; Are people being arrested for opinions they hold?
p28048
aVIt's a very fine line at times.
p28049
aVIn general, free speech, like all fundamental rights (including the right to life), is not taken to be absolute.
p28050
aVVery very few can logically argue that it should be, considering that, at the very least, the civil law (e.g.
p28051
aVdefamation) places *some* limits on speech.
p28052
aVThe more intense debate takes place in the context of using the criminal law, and different countries resolve the tensions differently and through different combinations of regulation by law, social/cultural norms, procedures etc.
p28053
aVIn a nutshell, matters of free speech turn immensely on context.
p28054
aVThe context can be cultural, historical, socio-economic, and even just practical, but essentially it's about consideration of the time and the place, both on the macro level as well as the micro level.
p28055
aVAs you might imagine it is very difficult to give absolutely concrete definitions of these concepts in advance, particularly because defining them is an ongoing process.
p28056
aVIn short, in the UK people are *not* technically arrested for the opinions they hold.
p28057
aVThey are arrested for the manner and context of the opinions they are flagrantly expressing.
p28058
aVThe lines can be very blurry though, so it's important for the debate to be continuous and as *open as possible without crossing into violence.
p28059
aV* Unfortunately it is one of those debates that in practice has the propensity to produce collateral damage.
p28060
aVThere's a good comparison of the approaches of the US and UK on this [here.

p28062
aVSo you're saying the Prophet Mohammed wasn't a real person?
p28063
aVThat's blasphemy, infidel!
p28064
aVIncitement?
p28065
aVI doubt it, because it isn't encouraging anyone to do anything because of the cartoons.
p28066
aVIn fact, isn't the magazine sold here as well?
p28067
aVYes.
p28068
aVProbably available in South Ken.
p28069
aVVisited south east Kent right on the channel recently, and used to live near there\u000a\u000aThey don't sell the publication, and it wouldn't sell well if they did.
p28070
aVPeople in Dover and many of the surrounding towns are extremely xenophobic, to the point where EDL et al would call it a safe haven
p28071
aVApologies.
p28072
aVBy Ken I meant South Kensington.
p28073
aVThere's a little French area around the embassy and a very good newsagent/bookshop that would stock this.
p28074
aVBit disturbing to hear Dover etc is so far gone that they would freak at the sight of a French publication - especially as they are so close to France and probably gain a lot from continental travel.
p28075
aVAhh I see.
p28076
aVFair enough.
p28077
aVI don't think they'd so much freak at a French publication, they just wouldn't buy it.
p28078
aVIt'd be seen as trying to sell to 'tourists' more than anything.
p28079
aVDover is no land of hopes and dreams; that ferry is about the only worthwhile thing there, and I speak from the experience of having gone to Dover a lot when I lived in the area
p28080
aVYes, because targeting people because of their race or religion is illegal.
p28081
aVThat's why the last round of danish cartoons were only visible here in news stories.
p28082
aVTargeting *a person* because of their race or religion is illegal.
p28083
aVThe cartoons do target people - Muslim people.
p28084
aVIt's not possible to target a religion because a religion cannot see the cartoons, read the paper or hear a comment.
p28085
aVIt cannot reply, change its mind or react to what is said.
p28086
aVThe target is the people who follow that religion because they are the ones who see and hear what is said and they are the ones affected by it.
p28087
aVBut they aren't targeting a specific person, which is the point of the law (well not a live one or one who lives in this country anyway).
p28088
aVIt's the reason that Diane Abbot can go on about 'White People', not a specific white person.
p28089
aVIt's the reason that Steve Bell can draw funny cartoons mocking Christianity and not a specific Christian.
p28090
aVIt's the reason that David Blunkett can talk about Roma, but not a specific Roma person.
p28091
aV&gt; may not of \u000a\u000aThis offends me
p28092
aVI would support this prosecution under the Communications Act.
p28093
aVThis is just the start of the restriction of free speech, the Tory's are already working on banning people with opinions they disagree with from TV, public speaking, protests, social media, and the internet.
p28094
aV&gt; The restrictions are expected to include banning individuals from speaking at public events, protests and meetings, having to inform the police in advance of any public event, protest or meeting that they plan to attend, and banning individuals from particular public locations.
p28095
aV&gt; May also wants to include restrictions on banned individuals from broadcasting, from associating with named people, and restricting their use of social media or the internet by requiring them to submit in advance any proposed publication to the police.

aVIt always amuses me how many people think (from watching American movies presumably) that they have a "right" to free speech - this right has never existed in the UK!
p28099
aVArticle 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights mandates freedom of expression.
p28100
aVObviously that's in conflict with some of the laws that are in place in the UK currently, but that does mean that those laws could potentially be challenged at the European Court of Human Rights.
p28101
aVThere are so many caveats in Article 10 that it's virtually useless:\u000a\u000a&gt;Article 10 is a qualified right and as such the right to freedom of expression may be limited.
p28102
aVArticle 10 provides that the exercise of this freedom \u201csince it carries with it duties and responsibilities\u201d may be limited as long as the limitation:\u000a\u000a&gt;o is prescribed by law;\u000a\u000a&gt;o is necessary and proportionate; and\u000a\u000a&gt;o pursues a legitimate aim, namely:\u000a\u000a&gt;* the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety;\u000a\u000a&gt;* the prevention of disorder or crime;\u000a\u000a&gt;* the protection of health or morals;\u000a\u000a&gt;* the protection of the reputation or rights of others;\u000a\u000a&gt;* preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence; or\u000a\u000a&gt;* maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

aVNone of those seem to say that I couldn't call someone a wanker on Twitter though.
p28105
aVUnless somebody decides that it's immoral.
p28106
aVYou're more than welcome to call someone a wanker on Twitter, it's directly harrassing someone with abuse and threatening them that can land you in trouble, ya know, like in real life.
p28107
aVDo tell me how the guy that was arrested for the glasgow bin lorry joke tweet was directly abusing or threatening anyone.
p28108
aVI hadn't heard about that until now, just looked up on it, and you're right, it isn't directly aimed at anyone.
p28109
aVHowever, it does say he handed himself in after complaints, and police were investigating malicious communications.
p28110
aV[had to find that in a local paper, none of the nationals reported that piece of information](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-bin-lorry-tragedy-teenager-4867286) I can't find anything more recent than the day it happened, but I hazard to guess that it either has, or will be dropped.
p28111
aVIf he hadn't gone to the police station himself, they probably wouldn't have done anything, but because he actually reported that he may have committed a crime, it had to be investigated.
p28112
aVapparently The tweet said: "So a bin lorry has apparently driven in 100 people in Glasgow eh, probably the most trash it's picked up in one day".
p28113
aVits fucking ridiculous he got arrested shame on the UK \u000a\u000a
p28114
aVbecause he went to the police station voluntarily.
p28115
aVHe would have been arrested as a formality whilst they investigated a potential malicious communication, that he himself reported.
p28116
aVI'm sure that will have been dropped after the paper work was filled out and they were satisfied that that's all it was.\u000a
p28117
aV&gt;He would have been arrested as a formality whilst they investigated a potential malicious communication\u000a\u000aUh, so he would've been arrested anyway then.
p28118
aVHow you can defend someone being arrested for a joke on twitter by saying "oh it was just a formality while they were investigating it" is beyond belief. 
p28119
aVI'm not necessarily defending it, but it's not as though they actually went after him.
p28120
aVAnd within the context of investigating malicious communication I can understand why an arrest may have been made, to later be dropped.
p28121
aVThough it is on the face of it is ridiculous.
p28122
aV&gt;within the context of investigating malicious communication I can understand why an arrest may have been made\u000a\u000aYou can understand why someone was arrested for making a joke on twitter.

aVNo, TL;DR they were going to arrest him anyway, but somehow that's ok, because you've decided it was "a formality"\u000a\u000ajesus christ just admit when you're wrong.
p28133
aVWhere does it say there were going to arrest him anyway?
p28134
aVThe article says he voluntarily went to the police station.
p28135
aVIt doesn't say they were searching for him, or that an investigation was launched to find him.
p28136
aVHe went of his own accord because of the complaints he had received.\u000a 
p28137
aV&gt;Where does it say there were going to arrest him anyway?
p28138
aVI find it hard believing that this is a serious statement.
p28139
aVThe police will not just arrest you if you show up and hand yourself in.
p28140
aVThey only arrest people when they believe they have commited a crime and a charge could follow.
p28141
aVHe is out on Police bail, and while they find more information.
p28142
aVIf the Police have no intention of doing anything, they don't put people out on bail, they release them without charge.
p28143
aV[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Joke_Trial) is another example, but eventually (after 3 trials) the bloke got off.
p28144
aVI'm wasn't really defending it, just looking at a potential chain of events.
p28145
aVAnd I wasn't implying he was arrested for just turning up, but it is possible he was arrested for a possible breach of the law, for suspicion of sending malicious communication, until it is properly investigated, and then he would later have it dropped without charge.
p28146
aVThat other one you linked though, whilst I appreciate the guy was joking, it's in very bad taste and very dodgy territory.
p28147
aVThe police have to investigate it, and despite the intent it could be taken as a threat.
p28148
aVIf they had let it slide and then a bomb was exploded we'd all be asking why they didn't respond to it.
p28149
aVI know the laws are daft, and I wish that at times they weren't necessary, I really am a proponent of free speech (up to the point that it harmful or abusive etc), but it just highlights that we have a social responsibility to be thoughtful of how we communicate, especially now when so much of what we think and say is posted publicly for the entire world to see.
p28150
aVIn this case so the police don't have to chase after non-serious threats of terrorism.
p28151
aVIf people weren't racist, or abusive or threatening or joking about blowing things up, we wouldn't need to have systems and laws to prevent, to protect people and punish it.
p28152
aVIt has so many exceptions that it's practically useless .

aV[Know Your Rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lfInFVPkQs)

p28155
aVIt sounds nice, but allows governments to decide what speech is acceptable, so it isn't really a freedom.
p28156
aVBut currently in the UK the far right want to sever connections with the European human rights court...
p28157
aVIt means more than this, actually.
p28158
aVThe ECHR is incorporated into domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998 and is enforced by domestic courts.
p28159
aVYou don't have to go all the way to ECtHR anymore.
p28160
aVlol if only, \u000a\u000aremember section 44
p28161
aVThe Human Rights Act only has 22 sections...
p28162
aVsection 44 (stop and search) of UK law was found to completely contravene article 8 of the ECHR.
p28163
aVi.e the right to privacy 
p28164
aVThat's section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 if anyone's wondering, repealed in 2011 following the ECtHR ruling, replaced by s47A.
p28165
aVhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2000#Section_44 
p28166
aVFreedom of speech is and always has been somewhere on a spectrum.
p28167
aVThe state and private individuals allow others certain degrees of freedom of expression depending on the time and place and who they are.
p28168
aVThe idea of freedom of expression being black or white is silly.
p28169
aVThe right to free expression is innate, it belongs to the individual.
p28170
aVA government can choose to recognize it or to restrict it - but it is not theirs to give.
p28171
aVFound the American.
p28172
aVScottish.
p28173
aV'Freeeeedom' and all that.
p28174
aVIf you look at it that way anyone has an innate right to do anything that is physically possible.
p28175
aVOr as Assassin's Creed puts it, Everything is Permitted.
p28176
aVEverything is possible, not everything is permitted.
p28177
aVAs has been said many times by many people - freedom to act does not mean freedom from consequences.
p28178
aVMy point was that our right to free speech is not dependent on which government 'allows' us it, it is not theirs to give.
p28179
aVWhere would you say it comes from then?
p28180
aVI agree that it does not come from a government, but where does it come from?
p28181
aVEverything is permitted in this context is extremely similar to everything is possible, except that we know some things are not possible.
p28182
aVIt is almost saying that everything that is possible is permitted by nature.
p28183
aVThere are no other restrictions.
p28184
aVWhilst humans may try and intervene with this, they cannot affect nature itself.
p28185
aVNo human law (such as a restriction on free speech) has any meaning on nature.
p28186
aVThe concept of "having rights" is also subject to the fact of reality that is outlined with "Everything is Permitted".
p28187
aVAs much as nature allows us the "right" or ability to express ideas, it also allows others the ability to attempt to stop us.
p28188
aVNature expresses no preference.
p28189
aVAs such, the view that we have some sort of absolute right to anything that cannot be infringed is purely an agreed upon human construct.
p28190
aVI quite like that it is, but to view it as anything more is silly.
p28191
aV**Tl;dr:** I am just being pedantic and making a silly semantics argument.
p28192
aVYou probably shouldn't have wasted your time reading this and I certainly shouldn't have wasted my time typing it.
p28193
aVI can't quite believe we're having to argue that people have a right to free speech
p28194
aVThat's a ridiculous argument.
p28195
aVPeople have the right to their own opinions.
p28196
aVOf course.
p28197
aVThey also have the right to attempt to inflict suffering upon others, and others have the right to attempt to stop them.
p28198
aVThere aren't any morals embedded in the fabric of the universe; morals are purely an agreed upon social construct, and different groups of people will come to different conclusions on what these should be according to their own moral axioms.
p28199
aV&gt;They also have the right to attempt to inflict suffering upon others\u000a\u000aUh, no they do not.
p28200
aVThat is absolutely nothing like free speech.
p28201
aVI can't believe I'm actually having to argue that a right to free speech shouldn't be suppressed.
p28202
aVYou are completely missing the point of what I am saying.
p28203
aVI am not arguing anything.
p28204
aV&gt;I can't believe I'm actually having to argue that a right to free speech shouldn't be suppressed.
p28205
aVI am not arguing at all about any practical actions that should be taken.
p28206
aVI have not stated any opinions on how a society should actually be governed.
p28207
aVRead my comment again with this in mind, and if it still doesn't make sense let me know.
p28208
aVI will then attempt to re-word it so it makes more sense.

aVJohn Betjeman
p28212
aVMany people believe it is a a fundamental right.
p28213
aVWhether the UK government regonises the right is irrelevant. 
p28214
aVIt amuses you that people think they have a right to their opinion?
p28215
aVLiterally what the fuck?
p28216
aVWe as human beings do have a right to free speech, a right to our own opinions, and when that right is oppressed we should be annoyed.
p28217
aVYou're making out like people are some sort of entitled idiots for wanting free speech, I can't quite believe what I'm reading in this thread. 
p28218
aVOP was not making out that people are entitled idiots for wanting free speech.
p28219
aVI don't even know how you inferred that from what OP said.
p28220
aVWhat OP said was that an absolute right of free speech has never been enshrined in UK law, but a lot of people mistakenly believe that it was.
p28221
aVYou might be right, I need to stop using reddit on my phone, I always misinterpret things by not reading them properly.
p28222
aVI do believe however all people do have a fundamental right to free speech, regardless of whether its protected by law.
p28223
aVthank you
p28224
aVStart?
p28225
aVWe didn't have it to begin with... 
p28226
aVYour user name offends me.
p28227
aVit's ironic. 
p28228
aV&gt; You dont really have freedom of speech in UK, to really have freedom of speech you need to be able to also have the ability to freely offend people...
p28229
aVHowever thats illegal in uk.
p28230
aVIn the USA, it's illegal to shout 'fire' in a cinema.
p28231
aVSlander and libel are also chargeable offenses.
p28232
aVYou can't say they have totally free speech when you can't say anything you want whenever you want.
p28233
aVSlander and libel are civil offences - not criminal - in the US.
p28234
aVOr so I thought.
p28235
aVStill supports what I said though
p28236
aVThat is correct.
p28237
aVI prefer they way we have it compared to the states.
p28238
aVHere you can get punished if it is reasonable to assume you intend to offend.
p28239
aVI'm not going to pretend it's a perfect system, there will always be exceptions, but I much prefer the idea that if you meant to cause offense you can be punished, but the same system will give you leniency if you unintentionally offend.
p28240
aVIt's almost literally a "don't be a twat" law.
p28241
aVIf we stray into a system like the US has, it's far too black and white for what is only ever going to be a hazy gray area.
p28242
aVFuck that shit.
p28243
aVI'm OK with arresting people who threaten others online but offending people is our sacred right, nay, our duty you stupid cocksucker.
p28244
aVThis is where the problem lies.
p28245
aVI think "offence" too often gets used in place of what the actual reasons are, like harassment, racial or sexual abuse etc.
p28246
aVWhen people cry, oh boo hoo, you're offended, what a shame, it's usually in response to someone calling them out on being an out and out nasty racist fuck.
p28247
aVIn regards to the cartoons, I would say that there isn't an issue in printing them, many Muslims here on reddit have said that of course they are offended by having their religious figure depicted in such a way, but it's the right of the person who drew it to do so, so they just ignore it and move on.
p28248
aVHowever I completely understand the argument that allows the curtailment of anything that is deliberately meant to undermine any demographic, whether it be race, sexual, gender, faith etc because it can lead to, or aid in the complete marginalisation and dehumanisation of that demographic.
p28249
aVWhich is why I believe, laws exist that prevent racial abuse for example.
p28250
aVIf you allow people to to throw racist abuse around and they go unchallenged, it's not long before that escalates to direct harassment, maybe online, then in person, and soon it becomes physical.
p28251
aVBy saying, no you can't say x, y and z, we're making it abundantly clear that everyone is free to live with a feeling of security and that society will protect them.
p28252
aVAnd I think that's fair.
p28253
aVI can't believe the shit I read that goes against free speech in this sub sometimes.
p28254
aVWhat part of what I wrote do you specifically object to?
p28255
aV&gt; Here you can get punished if it is reasonable to assume you intend to offend\u000a\u000awhy should it ever matter if someone's offended by something?
p28256
aVI'm sure Monty Python offends some people, should that be banned, should they be fined or jailed?
p28257
aVpretty much anything can offend somebody, just look at tumblr
p28258
aVMonty python has been banned at local level before though. 
p28259
aVand that was really stupid and pointless\u000a\u000ayou can't go on about how important it is to protect free speech in the face of religious extremism, and then go and ban media in your own country for being edgy\u000a
p28260
aVTorbay council only lifted the ban on Life of Brian in 2008.
p28261
aVWithout attempting to defend the laws themselves as such, but rather to explain them, I think the distinction is between something intended to offend, and something that incidentally offends.
p28262
aVWith satire and comedy, like Monty Python, the object is to make people laugh or make a commentary on society or politics.
p28263
aVSome of the output may offend people, but that is an incidental effect.
p28264
aVThe contrast would be the pictures of Mohammed that have been going up over reddit.
p28265
aVNone of them have any political, satirical, social or artistic value.
p28266
aVThey exist only to be as offensive as possible.
p28267
aVNot saying the latter should be banned.
p28268
aVJust trying to point out the difference, and why it is ok to criticise one, and stupid to criticise the other. 
p28269
aVso if i write a joke that intentionally seeks out to knowingly cause offence amongst  paedophiles am i guilty of an offence?
p28270
aVshould i be arrested because i have deliberately written something to make a group of people "feel bad" \u000a\u000aabsolutely not
p28271
aVI explicitly said that I wasn't defending the law, I'm just pointing out why Monty Python wouldn't fall foul of it. 
p28272
aV&gt; Here you can get punished if it is reasonable to assume you intend to offend.
p28273
aVNo you can get punished if it is deemed that a reasonable person would consider what you posted offensive.
p28274
aVIndeed if I try to offend you in a way that a reasonable person would not deem offensive I wouldn't have even broken any laws.
p28275
aVUhhh, no.
p28276
aVSorry UK, this is one area where the Americans got you beat.
p28277
aVYour laws are ridiculous.
p28278
aVI'd hate to live in the UK, I'd feel as if I'm walking on eggshells each day.
p28279
aVIf you get arrested for tweet, can you claim "it was just for the bantz" ?
p28280
aVWalking on hyperbole. 
p28281
aVIt should be an on the spot £60 fine and a criminal record for using the word "bantz.
p28282
aV"
aVBut if we get beat up because of what we said, at least we get free healthcare to patch us back up, so we've got that going for us which is nice.
p28283
aVI agree that the free speech laws are messed up - but the idea that you are walking on egg shells is a bit silly.
p28284
aVHaving lived in both places the USA feels more oppressive - because the police can be so badly behaved with impunity, overly corporate influenced politics etc etc - the practical realities are more troubling in the states. 
p28285
aVSorry but we definitely have corporate puppet politicians and badly behaved policemen too.
p28286
aVGranted they don't go round shooting teenagers but it's still chocked with institutionalised racism and bigotry.
p28287
aVYes we have that too.
p28288
aVNo it isn't anywhere near as bad as the states.
p28289
aVOn Question Time, they reaffirmed it many times that they talk about 'free speech within the bounds of the law' is what's always meant.
p28290
aVBut the bounds of the law are unclear and interpretable in different ways
p28291
aVActually to be fair, David Davis (an MP who I personally have a lot of time for) did clarify and make clear that they should be referring to Freedom of Speech within the law.
p28292
aVUsing the shouting 'Fire' in a theatre example.
p28293
aVYeah, like it or not our 'freedom of speech' comes with what our lawmakers feel are reasonable restrictions.
p28294
aVAnd since we haven't overthrown anyone recently, we as a country have agreed to obey our laws.
p28295
aVIt's a bit sketchy, however, when those laws are applied like an asbo against idiots acting out, but deferred for professional satirists and comedians who deliberately shoot for 'offensive'.
p28296
aVI like that there's room for context, but dislike that there's room for hypocrisy.
p28297
aVIt must be that they think it's OK to offend Muslims only.
p28298
aVHas anyone ever been pulled up for offending Muslims on Twitter?
p28299
aVNot on twitter, but arrested for offending Muslims:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yorkshirestandard.co.uk/news/19-year-old-released-on-bail-after-alleged-koran-burning-video-9133/\u000a\u000a

aV[There was also those people who were given a prison sentence for putting bacon on the door handles of mosques - again, not on Twitter though.
p28301
aV](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-27941589)
p28302
aVThat is a little different; a video of you burning an object which you own should certainly be legal.
p28303
aVBacon on mosque door handle should, as it is a direct and physical action should be dealt with in some way.
p28304
aVNot sure it should be much more than whatever the maximum fine for littering is, plus the costs of cleaning the doors though
p28305
aVI wonder if I'd be arrested for burning the violent chapters of the Qur'an only.
p28306
aVWhat would the charge be?
p28307
aVInciting to ethnic and racial hatred by protesting ethnic and racial hatred?   
p28308
aVI agree it's a little different.
p28309
aVBut there are still similarities in that although it was a physical action, it wasn't causing any physical harm - just as an insult causes no physical harm.
p28310
aVThere's no *permanent* physical harm.
p28311
aVIf someone poured a load of sand into my car through an open window there would be no permanent harm, but a physical action has been taken against my property and there should be some, can't think of the right word; retribution is near but not correct, because of the time and effort required to undo what they have done.
p28312
aVSame goes for those people who dumped a pile of shit outside of a ukip office; no permanent physical harm but a definite physical action which will require time and money to resolve.
p28313
aVI think I agree with a lot of what you're saying.
p28314
aVBut in this instance, there wasn't even any temporary or costly physical harm.
p28315
aVWhat you're hinting at is criminal damage.
p28316
aVIf you put water soluble paint on someone's window that washes off in the rain, the police wont get you in trouble for criminal damage, because it costs nothing for the "victim" to clean it up, just as with bacon on a door handle.
p28317
aVIf someone put a pocket full of sand (shout-out to /r/pocketsand ) through your car window, then there should be maybe a verbal warning for anti-social behaviour, because there's no damage done apart from maybe 45 seconds of your time to hoover it up.
p28318
aVIf someone *filled* your car with sand, then that would probably be criminal damage for which more than a verbal caution should be handed out because it's actually costly to you.
p28319
aVI agree there should be some retribution for the bacon folk, at *very* least a verbal caution.
p28320
aVBut the fact that it was done particularly to target Muslims, knowing that they would be particularly offended should mean they get at least a little more than a verbal caution, because it's effectively discrimination or a "hate crime" - targeted harassment almost.
p28321
aVI've forgotten the original point now anyway:/
p28322
aVIs the fact it wasn't causing physical harm really relevant?
p28323
aVSurely it doesn't seem OK to put a sign with a swastika outside a synagogue or a burning cross outside the house of a black family?
p28324
aVIn this instance the crime wasn't causing offense, but for intimidation and threat.
p28325
aV&gt; Is the fact it wasn't causing physical harm really relevant?
p28326
aVYes.
p28327
aVBecause if we start sending people to prison simply because they "hurt someone's feelings once" then pretty much everyone on Reddit should be in prison.
p28328
aVI don't think putting bacon on a door handle is threatening or intimidating.
p28329
aVHad they said something, or left a note, or a threat, then that would be intimidation and threatening, or if they'd done it over and over again, that would be harassment, or if they were trying to get others to attack them, that would be inciting violence etc.
p28330
aVBut none of those things happened.
p28331
aV&gt; Surely it doesn't seem OK to put a sign with a swastika outside a synagogue or a burning cross outside the house of a black family?
p28332
aVNo it's not, because they are both threatening symbol associated with violence and hatred towards a certain group of people.
p28333
aVBacon is bacon - not a symbol of hatred or violence.
p28334
aVOne Muslim redditor once described how Muslims view pigs as how anyone else might view a sewer rat: a dirty horrible little creature.
p28335
aVNot a sign of death or violence like a burning cross or swastika.
p28336
aVDon't get me wrong, I'm not defending the people who put the bacon there - they're clearly unpleasant and hate-filled individuals - but I think a prison sentence was far too harsh in that case.
p28337
aVEven just from the pragmatic point of view: as tax payers, we're now all paying for them to be in prison, and they're not going to be able to provide back to the community, whereas had they been given a community order, it'd be the opposite way round.
p28338
aVAlso, chances are they'll be even more bitter and hate filled when they come out, whereas had they been made to work in or alongside the Muslim community, they might actually change their views on Muslims.
p28339
aVAs I said though, I've kind of forgotten any original points anyway:)
p28340
aVWell was it cooked bacon or raw bacon?
p28341
aVIf the latter it can absolutely be argued that it is kind of low-grade biological warfare.
p28342
aVI'm so paranoid about food safety that even if I wanted to put bacon on mosque property, I'd probably resort to sellotaping crispy bacon strips on instead,and even then remove it after a day. 
p28343
aVOne man's food is another man's biological warfare.
p28344
aVPigs are so versatile.
p28345
aVTerrible example, the door handle girl *was on probation for previous racially-motiviated crimes*.

aVI mean... One can hope.
p28375
aVThe people charged with making insensitive jokes about the Ibrox disaster and Madeleine McCann where not threatening to to rape / murder / blow up someone on Twitter.
p28376
aVOne day, I'm sure NotThisBenjamin will understand.
p28377
aVI mean... One can hope he can at least refrain from posting irritating-as-fuck messages.
p28378
aVYour point is?
p28379
aVBecause if this is your point, it still shows you have no idea what "context" means.
p28380
aVIf one day you wonder why nobody laughs at your jokes, check back on those comments.
p28381
aV&gt; The hypocrisy is sickening.
p28382
aVliterally?
p28383
aVI wanna see vomit pics!\u000a
p28384
aVA few years ago he started tweeting huge Game of Thrones spoilers at people as he thought everyone was making a fuss over the show, and he didn't think spoilers where worth getting upset over.
p28385
aVI started a hashtag to ensure that whenever his favourite football team is playing people tweet him the scores.
p28386
aVTo this day I remain blocked on Twitter by him.
p28387
aV:) 
p28388
aVI too am blocked by him, because of something I can't remember.
p28389
aVBit sensitive. 
p28390
aVHe's a contradiction, he's a fan of freedom of speech but doesn't like to hear from people who disagree with him. 
p28391
aVThe freedom to speak is not the same as the right to be heard.
p28392
aVOK! 
p28393
aVNot really.
p28394
aVHe's just distancing himself from hearing you, which is the acceptable thing to do.
p28395
aVIf he actively tried to silence your voice to everyone, then it would be a contradiction.
p28396
aVI don't disagree but if a lot of his points are railing against people trying to censor him ignoring others voices, whilst his right, to me, undermines his points a little. 
p28397
aVNot the same thing - freedom of speech is a legal thing and, to be honest, is largely effected by social pressures.
p28398
aVHim blocking you isn't about freedom of speech, it's him exercising his right to ignore what you're saying.
p28399
aVI don't disagree, it does to me undermine some of his points on the subject though.
p28400
aVHe's probably just practising what he preaches, which would be to ignore those who you find offensive or irritating rather than sicing the police on them.
p28401
aVIt seems like the entirely reasonable thing to do and reinforces his point that there's a better way of dealing with it. 
p28402
aVHe was trolling people with spoilers, that's not practising what you think he's preaching. 
p28403
aVJust because he's a hypocrite doesn't undermine his point about freedom of speech.
p28404
aVThough aggressively spoilering people is a dick move and is less about "muh rights" than it is about "I am a colossal cuntwagon"
p28405
aVI haven't once stated that his opinions on free speech are wrong. 
p28406
aVYou just implied that not wanting to hear from someone who disagrees with you is incompatible with supporting free speech.
p28407
aVIt's literally your last post.
p28408
aVIt's not contradictory to want people to have free speech, but block them from free speeching *at* you
p28409
aVI said it was contradictory, not that he didn't have the right to do it. 
p28410
aVYou feel like you won that one?\u000a
p28411
aVNo actually, I miss reading his tweets, he's very funny.
p28412
aVHe was just a total cock about GOT, he targeted the tweets specific people and they where upset.
p28413
aVI know it's hardly that important but if he didn't like having things he enjoyed spoiled be shouldn't take pleasure in doing it to others.
p28414
aVEdit.
p28415
aVI used the word actually three times! 
p28416
aVNot just a cock about GOT, but an all round bad sport. 
p28417
aVHe seems to actual be an areshole, not just an act.
p28418
aVAlthough he exagerates it even more for his standup.
p28419
aVHe is mildly funny and very occasionally says something interesting but always seems pretty arrogant and smug. 
p28420
aVI imagine after a few years of finding fame and fortune from that "act" and being told everyone thinks you're hillarious when acting like that, it would seep into your offstage persona as well.
p28421
aVEven if you weren't an arsehole to begin with.
p28422
aVHe's basically been conditioned to think people will like him for being a twat.
p28423
aVIt might be that he sees going on twitter as going in character, because I've met him in person and besides being a bit of an oddball (He absolutely loves apocalyptic fiction and sci-fi and you can see it in him), he's usually pretty decent.
p28424
aVSame happened to Ricky Gervais
p28425
aVHe donated a tonne of cash to british victims of torture at Guantanamo Bay and went on a hunger strike.
p28426
aVHe certainly does more good than most celebrities. 
p28427
aVIt's just a tv show...
p28428
aVThe same way it's just a bunch of guys kicking a bit of leather around so fatter and unhealthier guys can tell them how shit they are...
p28429
aVYou're ducking shint!
p28430
aVI agree but if it's something people like why intentionally spoil it? 
p28431
aVYou can measure how someone really feels about freedom of expression by observing their reaction to views they _don't_ agree with.
p28432
aVaka britishpolitics :-)
p28433
aVNice we can agree on something.
p28434
aVThat said, the law is the law and whether it is Frankie Boyle, Jyllands Posten or Charlie Hebdo it should be applied equally.
p28435
aVI keep hearing how no-one prints cartoons against jews, as some kind of counter to why we shouldn't mock islamic fundamentalism.
p28436
aVDo jews really get no mockery, is there really no satire about them or just cheap jokes about the holocaust?
p28437
aVFor the record, I think both sides are fair game, as are christians, athiests and anyone I've missed, you weirdos.
p28438
aVJews get ripped on by pretty much everyone who plays FIFA - "jew goals" are a thing.
p28439
aVto be fair, isn't anyone beating someone else on FIFA a gay nigger jew fag  cunt by default over xbox live?
p28440
aVWho apparently has fucked my mum.. while being gay.
p28441
aVReally, tho I'm suggesting every religion gets mocked and satirised to a certain extent, but in the past decade or so Muslim extremism has been very much at the forefront of terrorism, so it's no surprise that it's getting most of the attention, both of satirists and journalists in general.
p28442
aVI imagine there's still anti jewish humour out there, it's just not to the same extent in the West as at least in Europe and the US, they're not blowing shit up or cutting heads off as much.
p28443
aVQuite happy to be corrected however, I admit I'm fairly ignorant of Judaism and the jewish conflicts in general.
p28444
aVAFAIK they don't really affect life in the UK that much tho?
p28445
aV(Not saying we shouldn't give a damn, just explaining that I don't tend to hear about them, we have a very UK-centric news media.
p28446
aV)
aVNever really understood why playing the ball to another player to get it past the keeper is a "Jew goal".
p28447
aVBecause it's a 'cheap' goal and the stereotype of Jew's is that they are cheap and tight fisted with money.
p28448
aVIt's not on really and I don't know why it's so accepted.
p28449
aVPreaching to the choir, if I'm in a position where it's 2 of my players vs. your keeper and I can easily pass from one to the other inside the box to make it an open goal, hate to break it to you, but your defence messed up.
p28450
aVSpot on-they shouldn't put themselves in that position in the first place.
p28451
aV&gt;pretty much everyone who plays FIFA\u000a\u000a&gt;everyone who plays FIFA\u000a\u000aNo, some people have the capability to chose other words...\u000a\u000aAlso, some people aren't such sore losers that upon conceding a goal, they must insist that it's not a true goal.
p28452
aVYeah in my house we call it sweaty goal
p28453
aVmaybe no one prints cartoons....but southpark has been pretty hard on them
p28454
aVI think you've missed the point of south park.
p28455
aVThe racism in south park is making fun of racists.\u000a\u000a
p28456
aVand the point of satire is.......
p28457
aVEh?
p28458
aVDon't understand your question.
p28459
aVYou said south park has been hard on Jews.
p28460
aVI'm saying it hasn't because those times when a casual viewing might lead you to think that Jews are being mocked are actually satire.
p28461
aVThat would make your original claim incorrect.. Jews do not get a hard time on south park, in fact it is anti Semitism that gets a hard time.
p28462
aVHow does you asking me what the point of satire change that?
p28463
aVmy point is that satire is to expose issues and make fun of them.
p28464
aVThe above guy said "do jews really get no mockery".
p28465
aVI pointed out that they do, in southpark.
p28466
aVYes they are also mocking the kid who is mocking the jews.....but thats the point of satire. 
p28467
aV&gt; I pointed out that they do, in southpark.
p28468
aVThat's my point though -- they _aren't_ being mocked.
p28469
aVCartman shouting "you dirty Jew" at Kyle is South Park mocking Cartman not Kyle.
p28470
aVIn fact I can't think of a single episode in which Jews were the actual target (my memory is not encyclopedic of course, so I'd be happy to be corrected).
p28471
aVSince the writers are not targeting Jews _at all_ it wasn't correct to say "southpark has been pretty hard on them".
p28472
aVUnless you think they agree with anything Cartman says or does?
p28473
aVThe only time I can think of off the top of my head is when Cartman refuses to save Kyle unless he gives him his secret bag of Jew gold which apparently every Jew carries.
p28474
aVKyle denies this for a while then eventually reveals he *does* have a bag of secret Jew gold
p28475
aVHa.
p28476
aVGood one.
p28477
aVWell remembered.
p28478
aVPlus Family Guy does it loads.
p28479
aVEveryone gets it from them. 
p28480
aVhttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NTntNaQy_5I
p28481
aVWhat about the episode where they get abducted by "Joozians" which are the beady eyed, huge nosed, frizzy haired aliens that control all the media in the galaxy? 
p28482
aVCartmanland where Kyle gets a haemorrhoid and questions his faith mocks the book of Job pretty aggressively. 
p28483
aVno.
p28484
aVThe point I'm making is that they are still saying it.
p28485
aVIt is not being not said due to PC etc. 
p28486
aVSeriously?
p28487
aVJews are about the most mocked ethnic group I can think of.
p28488
aVOften by Jewish comedians!
p28489
aVSouth Park, Borat, Larry David and Joan Rivers all spring to mind.
p28490
aVCharlie Hebdo had plenty of Jew cartoons.

p28492
aV[deleted]
p28493
aVIt's sort of satirical of antisemitism though.
p28494
aVIt's generally only from Cartman, who is made out to be a jackass.
p28495
aVExactly.
p28496
aVThe whole *point* of Cartman is that he is the embodiment of what you *shouldn't* be like.
p28497
aV&gt; cheap jokes\u000a\u000aheh
p28498
aVunintended, I just wish it hadn't been, I'd have taken credit for that one :)
p28499
aVWell you have to make a distinction between followers of Judaism and people of Jewish descent.
p28500
aVThe former is fair game, criticising people's beliefs is fine, but the latter would be racism
p28501
aVWe tend to laugh at ourselves more.
p28502
aVJust watch curb your enthusiasm and south park!
p28503
aVPlus having token Jew in comedies (BBT, American Pie etc) is so common.
p28504
aVIt's part of our heritage to laugh at ourselves.
p28505
aVAnd no one else can really make fun of a religion that already laughs at itself and accepts humour.
p28506
aVThere's just no edge or self righteousness to take the piss out of.
p28507
aVQuote of Stephen Fry on QI: Why do jews have such big noses?
p28508

p28510
aVIf that's satire, I'd hate to see the hecklers.
p28511
aVWell if we're going by satire, Charlie Hebdo made an awful lot of antisemitic comics as well.

p28513
aVThat's it, I've seen Muslims tweeting that 'they'll print cartoons about Mohammed but they won't touch anti Semitism' and I was thinking that's probably bullshit.
p28514
aVMost satirists I've experienced the work of tend to attack any target so long as it's 'punching upwards', that is, they're generally not attacking the Government because it's left or right, but because it's the government and it's being some blend of incompetent or evil.
p28515
aVSame goes for religion, countries or any other grouping of power.
p28516
aVPeople think that due to the conspiracies of how the Jews run the world.
p28517
aVYeah, no.
p28518
aVAntisemitic events in the UK have increased exponentially, and antisemitic hate crimes account for 60 percent of U.S religious based hate crimes.

p28520
aVFair enough, news to me as a Brit, I've never personally seen any, but I'm willing to take new info on board.
p28521
aVI'm not quite convinced that 'jew' as slang for mean, tightfisted etc is really a racial slur up there with 'nigger' however.
p28522
aVI wouldn't personally use it, I grew out of that after school, to me it's from the same era as saying something bad is 'gay', it's from another era and people need to leave it behind, but I don't rate it as high on the scale as nigger or faggot.
p28523
aV'Kike' isn't used much, but I'd put that up there however, and wouldn't use it.
p28524
aVWhen I was like eight tho, and we'd be out on the fields at lunchtime at school, often someone would throw a 2 pence coin at someone, yell 'jew bundle' and everyone in vocal range would pile on them to retrieve the coin.
p28525
aVYou'd be hard to pushed to find any of them able to explain why 'jews' were so desperate for 2p, or even what a jew was.
p28526
aVSure it's irresponsible and not right, but there's 'levels' of racism and offence.
p28527
aVWell because 'jew' isn't always offensive, as in "There are two Jews in here.
p28528
aV" It's mostly in the tone you use it.
p28529
aVBut yeah, just avoid 'kike', thanks.
p28530
aVI don't really think these cartoons in Charlie Hebdo were punching upwards though.
p28531
aVThey're more punching downwards - racist and offensive cartoons aimed at a minority that is already having a difficult enough time in France. 
p28532
aVFrom what I've seen they've mainly having a pop at extremists tho, maybe there's stuff I've not seen that's been just at muslims in general.
p28533
aVI've got no problem with people ripping on Islam, but I don't think it's so clear cut to take the piss of muslims personally or individually.
p28534
aV(copy paste that to any religion.
p28535
aV)  Extremists tho, they've already decided to be batshit crazy, so they're fair game imo.
p28536
aVCould you explain how a cartoon of Muhammed posing for a porno, or a cartoon of Muhammed's naked arse from behind with a star to obscure his arsehole, is 'punching upwards'?
p28537
aVThat's just lazy and offensive to all Muslims.
p28538
aVAlso, the cartoons are full of grotesque hook nosed Muslim figures, honestly some of them look like Nazi era cartoons of Jews.
p28539
aVObviously I think the murders of the journalists were completely wrong but that doesn't mean I have to support what they were doing.
p28540
aVI think they were being dicks, to be honest. 
p28541
aVAh well those I didn't see, and I can side with you on that.
p28542
aVTho, there is the argument to be made about responses to threats about depicting him vs freedom of speech.  
p28543
aVThe argument in most places, especially on reddit, seems to be pathetically childish.
p28544
aV"These cartoons offend Muslims, the murderers were Muslims, let's reprint the cartoons.
p28545
aVOh, and where are all the moderate Muslims to condemn this?
p28546
aV" These cartoons are offensive to almost all Muslims, not just the extremists.
p28547
aVHow is it helpful to then cast being anti-terrorist murders as being pro-offensive cartoons?
p28548
aVAnd being in favour of free speech doesn't mean being in favour of people using that free speech to be absolute arseholes, or that you should show your support for free speech by being as offensive as possible to a minority group which is already widely vilified. 
p28549
aVIndeed, turns out I'd only seen cartoons in response to the attack, which tended to be thought out pieces of satire based on the killings.
p28550
aVAnything that's just lazy muslim bashing however, they're free to print them, and sure as hell shouldn't die for it, but, they should be criticised for it, not get a free pass just because muslims are an unpopular, easy target.
p28551
aVI've seen one or two of them, and yes...
p28552
aVWhile I'm not religious, if they portrayed someone I care about, I would be grievously offended.
p28553
aVFreedom of speech aside, there are context-dependent lines you just shouldn't cross.
p28554
aVContext-dependent, because if it's a stand-up show or otherwise overtly 'supposed to be comedy' setting, I think the lines are/should be relaxed.
p28555
aVJust randomly portraying Muhammad as a stereotypical curtain wearer getting arse raped...
p28556
aVI think it goes beyond the realm of 'begging for trouble' and back out the other side.
p28557
aVTrouble doesn't mean machine guns and bombs though.
p28558
aVThat's just the worst possible response to such a thing.
p28559
aVA decently-sized 'fuck you' would cover it, seriously.
p28560
aVImagine how it would go down if I went round putting Hitler 'taches on all pictures of David Cameron, or drew a comic strip portraying Nigel Farage as a male prostitute.
p28561
aVPeople would be offended, and those guys aren't even religious figures.

aVSatire on Jews is not antisemitism.
p28564
aVJust as much as satire on Islam is not Islamophobic.
p28565
aVNo I'm allowed to burn that building your honour.

aVIt is satire and thus protected speech.

aVThis is such a _beautiful_ tweet

p28569
aVI think this tweet is 1 character away from being the single greatest possible tweet.

aVI think the person above you thought they were being facetious and trying to throw some dirt at Boyle.
p28589
aV[deleted]
p28590
aVNo, the original commenter is legitimately asking if Frankie Boyle is referring to the sun.
p28591
aVAll he did was ask if it was the Sun he used to work for because Frankie put "I used to work for", that is all. 
p28592
aV[deleted]
p28593
aVHe's not, and I misread.
p28594
aVHe did used to work for them, though, I'm pretty sure. 
p28595
aVYes he did.
p28596
aVHe wrote a column for the The Sun AFTER talking about the queen having a haunted pussy.
p28597
aVSo I guess it's not The Sun he's referring to.
p28598
aVProbably the Daily Fail. 
p28599
aVQuestion for the group : *did* a paper ever try to have Frankie arrested and charged with obscenity for a joke?
p28600
aVI remember the joke being reported on, and some Ofcom investigation, but not this?
p28601
aVDespite the multitude of replies, I can't see any actual evidence that they did.
p28602
aVHmm.
p28603
aVGood old Reddit.
p28604
aVThis is going a while back now.
p28605
aVThe funny thing was that when the joke was first broadcast there was no complaints what so ever.
p28606
aVIt was only after the ross/brand thing kicked off that people complained on a rerun of the show.
p28607
aVThough frankie has been in court over one of his jokes, IIRC he sued the mirror for libel.
p28608
aVCalled him a racist comedian or something. 
p28609
aVAnd the Katie Price thing got him in hot water too
p28610
aVEven if they did they weren't succesful. 
p28611
aVWouldn't be surprised if the Sun talked to one of their lawyers to decide if it was breaking any laws, just to fill out a double page spread that they could fill with Boyle's name and a huge photo of his big beardy face.
p28612
aVmaybe they just don't like you Frankie
p28613
aVSo true, Frankie Boyle annoyed me a little over the whole Scotland referendum (I'm a unionist) but he does make some good points and can be genuinely funny.
p28614
aVAnd to be fair the referendum was a pillar of free speech and democracy in this country - plenty people made their views known, that's for sure.
p28615
aVFrankie Boyle is from Pollokshaws, a suburb of Glasgow you could probably power off of the burning hatred of the English.
p28616
aVHe was never in a million years going to be a unionist...\u000a\u000a
p28617
aV"you are now approaching, Pollockshaws West.

aVDo you have any examples of widespread anti-English sentiment in Pollokshaws?
p28621
aVOr is "hatred of the English" code for left wing independence supporting?

p28624
aVAll of this stuff goes both ways.
p28625
aVThere are plenty of English and Scots who love each other, and plenty who are always spouting rubbish about each other. 
p28626
aVCome off it.
p28627
aVYou're in Scotland and you're from Essex, are you telling me you don't experience any anti-English comments?
p28628
aVI get it all the time.
p28629
aV&gt; plenty who are always spouting rubbish about each other\u000a\u000aI actually don't get as many bad comments as one might think.
p28630
aVI do have to try and right some misinformation about how easy they think we all have it down south, I suppose.
p28631
aVGood-nature ribbing abounds, though!
p28632
aVMy experience is when there is a pot hole in the road, a nationalist will always be nearby to tell me it's because of the English.
p28633
aVHah, really?
p28634
aVMaybe it's because most of the people I know up here have a lot of English blood in their families, and I work at a small company which generally leans towards pro-union.
p28635
aVMost people don't care, most people just want to get on with their lives.
p28636
aVHowever, there are a few people I know with a deep hate for English people, even though they have literally nothing to complain about in their lives.
p28637
aVNever seen this.
p28638
aVEver think, maybe yer just a cunt?
p28639
aVracism against the english?
p28640
aVwhat?
p28641
aVGo spend some time in Scotland. 
p28642
aVyou can't be racist against a country\u000a\u000aI appreciate they might not like the english in parts of scotland, but that's not racist, 'english' isn't a race\u000a\u000aedit: go ahead and 'downvote', doesn't change the definition of words\u000a\u000a
p28643
aVSo you're saying England has no significant cultural identity?
p28644
aVYou can be racist against the Welsh, the Scottish and the Irish, but not the English?
p28645
aVthat's not at all what I'm saying\u000a\u000anationality does not equal race - you can be white &amp; english, and black &amp; english etc\u000a\u000athe word you're looking for is bigoted or discriminatory, not racist
p28646
aVIn law it is racist btw.
p28647
aVWas redefined by the tories.
p28648
aVSorry to disagree but racism doesn't have to be tied to a race.
p28649
aVIn fact, there's not really any such thing as race in any strict sense.
p28650
aVe.g.
p28651
aV[What race is this person?
p28652
aV](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Corazon_Aquino_1986.jpg)\u000a\u000aMoreover, "Jewish" is *absolutely not* a race, but we can all agree that the holocaust had definite elements of racial motivation.
p28653
aVso, in our view, what are the human races?
p28654
aVIs there an accepted list?
p28655
aVIs it based skin colour, or some sort of genetic pedigree?
p28656
aVQuite a few at the Olympics.
p28657
aVUsain Bolt is famously a racist - makes fun of swimming races, for instance. 
p28658
aVoh you!
p28659
aV:)
p28660
aVExactly!
p28661
aVIt baffles me why the understanding of racism is so poor a lot of the time.
p28662
aVWhy the fuck do people obsess over the definition of racism?
p28663
aVIt's like you want to legitimise your illogical hatred towards people.
p28664
aVAnd now the goalposts are shifting.
p28665
aVThis is why definitions and agreed meanings are important.
p28666
aV"When I said racism, I meant *my* definition of racism!
p28667
aV"\u000a
p28668
aVEnglish is a race?
p28669
aVBiologically speaking humanity doesn't have "races".
p28670
aVSo it is commonly applied to nationality as well as ethnicity and sometimes religion. 
p28671
aVWell if we accept that you can be racist against Chinese or Indians, or the people of any other country, then yes.
p28672
aVChina and India are in Asia, so are we talking about racism against Asian people?
p28673
aVHating another country would be xenophobia.
p28674
aVAre you saying that racial abuse for Chinese and Indian people would be the same?
p28675
aVThat you would see a racist insulting an Indian by slanting their eyes, showing their top teeth and saying "Sore finger?
p28676
aV"
aVSorry if I misunderstand you but "Asian" is not a "race".
p28677
aVIf you're interested, here's a [map of human migration](http://www.musicearth.name/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Geno-Project-Human-Migration-Map_print-590x421.jpg).
p28678
aVBy law, it counts as racism.
p28679
aVHaters going to hate.
p28680
aVAre you trying to stifle free speech! 
p28681
aVFound the UKIP voter, guys \u000a\u000aEdit: people in a position of privilege can't play the victim.
p28682
aVWhat widespread anti-english 'racism' are you talking about?
p28683
aVI've never seen it.
p28684
aVI'm English and old enough to have seen any - if it existed. 
p28685
aVSpend enough time in Scotland and you'll find it. 
p28686
aVAnd that's widespread, is it?
p28687
aVJust Scotland?
p28688
aVScotland's population is more than 5 million.
p28689
aVedit: not saying they're all xenophobes/racists, but that population size is nothing to be sniffed at, even if just one per cent had anti-English views that's 50,000.
p28690
aV5 million is half a Greater Manchester.
p28691
aVC'mon.
p28692
aVYou're not a repressed victim of anti English hate.
p28693
aVGet some perspective.
p28694
aVEdit: I'm wrong.
p28695
aVIt's 2 Greater Manchesters.
p28696
aVThe 'widespread racism against the English' is still a silly statement to make.
p28697
aVDon't bring us into this.
p28698
aVI used it for comparison.
p28699
aVI'm a Mancunian. 
p28700
aVYou again?
p28701
aVYou really are a thick fuck aren't you?
p28702
aVGreater Manchester, 5 million?
p28703
aVTry half that, not 10 million.
p28704
aVOr do you often lie to support your points, then claim "it's just a joke" when you get pulled on it?
p28705
aVApologies, you're right.
p28706
aVScotland's entire population is double Greater Manchester.
p28707
aVYou need to get over your potty mouth, though.
p28708
aVThere's really no need for it.
p28709
aVStill not seeing this widespread racism against the english, though.
p28710
aVI'm from Manchester myself.
p28711
aVI've been in Scotland for the past 3 years.
p28712
aVMost people don't care and just get on with their lives, but with the build up to the referendum there was a lot of anti-English sentiment I experienced from the nationalists.
p28713
aVA lot of people would blame the English for a lot of things, some of them would blame the English for anything, literally anything.
p28714
aVI sat there watching TV with one such person during the Somerset floods, she was foaming at the mouth in anger that English news was on her TV.
p28715
aVThere are a lot of people up here who do hate the English but are never really able to have a proper debate, because as soon as you argue with them logically they can't really justify it.
p28716
aVI love Scotland, I want to stay, most people are absolutely great.
p28717
aVBut to think there's nobody here that hate English people is just wrong.
p28718
aVIt's exactly the same as a racist, they might have coworkers that are black or Asian, they might work and get along with them every day, yet will generalise and blame them for things in the world.
p28719
aVSo forgive me for being angry at your totally ignorant comments, I highly doubt you have any experience of it at all.
p28720
aVBut you just hit me as another UK Redditor who knows all about the world from the comfort of their bedroom, while banging on about UKIP.
p28721
aVThanks for engaging at a more reasonable level.
p28722
aVThere's a real difference between hating people over a fairly arbitrary border and racism.
p28723
aVThere's always people who hate other people for any petty (or real) reason, but unless you're talking about systemic discrimination (and not just 'no blacks no irish' signs, but the subtler things) it's not one of the discriminatory -isms.
p28724
aVI will bang on about UKIP, because they're a dangerous band of delusional lunatics, and I find it disturbing when people who are otherwise rational buy into their slippery narratives.
p28725
aVThe comment I originally made was actually much longer, but while typing on a phone the invocation of 'UKIP' became a much better shorthand for what I was saying.
p28726
aVAre you fucking serious?
p28727
aVYou called him a UKIP voter because he said there's racism against English people?
p28728
aVYou dumb fucker.
p28729
aVThis subreddit is like every self-hating leftie nutter grouped together.
p28730
aVWidespread racism against the English.
p28731
aVNot seen any evidence yet, but keep up the sweary language, it's a Real Alternative to facts. 
p28732
aVYou just called him a UKIP voter because his opinion was everyone accepts widespread racism against the English.
p28733
aVThis is probably the most moronic statement I've seen this year so far and is the reason I often leave this shitty sub for weeks on end.
p28734
aVHow the hell can you say people in a position of privilege can't play the victim?
p28735
aVAre you saying everyone in England is in a position of privilege, other countries in the UK are not, so it's ok for people to hate English people but not the others?
p28736
aVHmmm, it was a bit of an odd comment but that is exactly the sort of thing "those people" say sometimes.
p28737
aVProbably a bit more EDL than UKIP tho.
p28738
aVKeep overreacting though, how's that blood pressure?
p28739
aVIt's the double standards that is annoying.
p28740
aVThough I should take it lightly, /r/unitedkingdom is mostly lefties that have never had any real life experience, and sit on the internet moaning about UKIP or some other make-believe fascists they desperately wish existed.
p28741
aV&gt; And to be fair the referendum was a pillar of free speech and democracy in this country - plenty people made their views known, that's for sure.
p28742
aVWhen people say things you agree with, or mildly disagree with, and that's okay by you, that is free speech, but does not strike at the heart of what free speech really is.
p28743
aVThe tenet of free speech is to protect what is offensive, and outrageous, and what people don't think belongs in society, and is inflammatory.
p28744
aVNo I got plenty of vitriol from some unionist quarters.
p28745
aVI still defend their right to say it.
p28746
aVThe point of free speech is being able to speak the truth to power, racists offending people is a misuse of free speech.
p28747
aVI'm not so sure, they should be allowed to say racist things, so long as they're not being actually inflammatory, and urging negative acts against people or groups.
p28748
aVThere's a difference between 'All darkies are shit at dressage' and 'all darkies need a good kicking, remember that if you see one'.
p28749
aVOf course, it's then in decent people's rights to call them fuckwits for being racist and not evolving past the neanderthal,tribal roots of their brain.
p28750
aVIn what way are racist things not inflammatory?
p28751
aVYou be ignorantly racist without calling for hatred and violence against a race, such as stupid comments about the eyes of asians or lips of black people.
p28752
aVI think it's actually quite useful to have people come out with stuff like that so people know that they're in need of a little education about how to treat your fellow man.
p28753
aVI think as a society we can let people like that know that it's not the 70s any more and they need to grow up and learn that they're sharing a planet with more than their direct family now.
p28754
aVWhen it's 'fuckin muzzies, we should go fuck up a mosque to pay em back' that's over the line, and inciting violence.
p28755
aVWhat about racist stereotypes such as "Asian people are good at maths" is that not just as offensive despite not being an incitement to violence?
p28756
aVYeah, personally I think you should be able to say that kind of thing, even negative ones about asians and women being terrible drivers, or whatever, so long as you're accepting that you might get called a stupid twat for saying it.
p28757
aVStupid twat!
p28758
aV...and I stand by your right to say that, you total git.
p28759
aVSeriously?
p28760
aVThat's all you think free speech is for?
p28761
aVWho gets to define 'proper use' of free speech?
p28762
aVAs soon as you start talking about misuse, you allow those with power to shut their critics down.
p28763
aVEven assuming this is the only point of free speech (I disagree): \u000a\u000aYou won't be able to speak the truth to power if we accept carve outs for whatever isn't politically correct, unless you assume that what is offensive at one point in time can never be the truth.
p28764
aVWhat is offensive to the mainstream has historically *often* been the truth.
p28765
aVE.g.
p28766
aVthe idea that black people deserved equal treatment was long seen as offensive.
p28767
aVAnd criticising various uses of religion to oppress has many places throughout history been seen as blasphemy.
p28768
aVAnd many things we see as harmless, others see, or have seen as deeply offensive and "misuse of free speech".
p28769
aVTo give an example of what your line of thinking can lead to: In Norway, when Monthy Python's Life of Brian was released, it was seen as a misuse of free speech on the basis of similar arguments to the one you are putting forth: It wasn't "worthy" of free speech protections, because it didn't serve a political purpose, so it was ok to ban it under anti-blasphemy legislation because it was considered a misuse of free speech to offend christians (it was the last ever use of that law).
p28770
aVClearly what is offensive is fluid.
p28771
aVBut a lot of that fluidity is contingent on people being able to say unpopular things so that unpopular viewpoints can also get heard, and possibly gain popularity (Yes, that means vile viewpoints may also gain popularity; but what you and I find vile may very well be in conflict)\u000a\u000aProtecting even *just* (and I would argue this is just a small part of what freedom of speech is about) the ability to "speak the truth to power" thus requires being vigilant about protecting speech that we find offensive *first and foremost* for the simple reason that speech that those in power don't find offensive is much less at risk of getting attacked by the state in the first place.\u000a
p28772
aVI agree they should have the right to say it, I'm just pointing out that allowing racists to speak their bile is a negative consequence of free speech rather than the point.
p28773
aVAbsolutely, whilst I'm a unionist I think the debates overall were a good thing and I would always defend a person's right (including Frankie Boyles) to make their views known.
p28774
aVI wish he was on the unionist side though.
p28775
aVAnd any separatist would get shouted down.
p28776
aVI liked the bit where people tried to get Nick Robinson fired for asking Alex Salmond a difficult question.
p28777
aVWhich he answered in his entirety, on camera, but Robinson then claimed he didn't.
p28778
aVI dreamt the part where people tried to have him fired.
p28779
aVMy mistake.
p28780
aVOh, some did call for it, never denied that.
p28781
aVNor did I agree with their sentiment, but it was all part of a greater protest against perceived BBC bias, but that's a whole other thread's debate.
p28782
aVYes it really proved that in the UK you can say you will do anything, and never have to follow up on it. 
p28783
aVDid you watch his "dissection" show of the referendum?
p28784
aVIt's the only thing Frankie Boyle has ever done where I didn't laugh once.
p28785
aVAll it showed was just how much of a poor sport and sore loser he is.
p28786
aVWhat did he do that was annoying?
p28787
aVI didn't hear any of his stuff.
p28788
aVI didn't know that happened.
p28789
aVI know there was a bit of hostility after ha made the haunted joke - which wasn't that bad anyway.
p28790
aVWhich paper tried to have him arrested and charged?
p28791
aVYeah it's OK to do it on TV but God forbid you tweet it.
p28792
aVI cant stand Frankie Boyle and find his comedy just offensive a lot of the time.
p28793
aVBut he is 100% right, it has been a bit of the joke the crap politicians and papers are coming out with. 
p28794
aVRather ironically I can't favourite this because he blocked me after finding we didn't share the same opinion.
p28795
aV*e*: yes irony isn't the right word, it was late when I posted this.
p28796
aVI don't need more than one person to tell me that, thanks anyway. 
p28797
aVSupporting freedom of speech in no way implies a duty to listen to what anyone actually says.
p28798
aVNot in any particular case, but it's generally a good idea to listen (at least sometimes) to those you disagree with most strongly to check that you haven't missed something.
p28799
aVYes but that implies no legal obligation.
p28800
aVYou have the right to speak but it's at my discretion to whether I listen.
p28801
aVExactly, people should have absolutely no obligation to listen.
p28802
aVIt's just wise policy to sometimes do so.
p28803
aVThat isn't the same thing at all.
p28804
aVYou don't have a right for people to listen to you.
p28805
aVHe isn't making up other people's minds for them.
p28806
aVWhat is the irony?
p28807
aVAll he wanted a thousand spoons but instead he got blocked on twitter by Frankie Boyle.
p28808
aVThe only irony is the fact the commenter doesn't understand what irony is.
p28809
aVNot really ironic, its the difference between him blocking you and him banning you from Twitter.
p28810
aVYeah, Frankie's a fucking hypocrite.
p28811
aVHe sued a paper because they claimed that he was racist -- after he made racist jokes.
p28812
aVGuy's full of shit.
p28813
aVBut he is mildly funny.
p28814
aVWell he did donate the money to charity.
p28815
aVIsn't that the correct response though?
p28816
aVA civil response rather than a state one.  
p28817
aVI don't like the man but since when does free speech include the right to defame people?
p28818
aVI think there are far too many restrictions on expression in the UK, it's absurd that bad jokes on twitter are seen as a criminal offence.
p28819
aVHowever this doesn't mean that people should have no recourse if national newspapers make false and damaging claims about them. 
p28820
aVYou can make a racist joke without actually being a racist, you know. 
p28821
aVIn fairness, he was directly quoting what an ex-Prime Minister had once said, which was the route of the joke: http://youtu.be/9w1-gFvDyAM
p28822
aVyou have the freedom to send letters to Chelsea Manning in prison - oh wait you don't.
p28823
aVWhy is she in prison?
p28824
aVFor telling us what our own governments are doing to us.
p28825
aVReveal how little freedom we have, get imprisoned.
p28826
aV1984 **wasn't** aimed as the USSR, it was aimed as a critique and warning to the UK/west.
p28827
aVAnd just to be ironic the UK government censored the introduction to 1984 in the original editions.
p28828
aVI'm all for for freedom of speech and pro-Snowden, but didn't Manning go to jail for indiscriminately releasing military intelligence &amp; records, including details regarding ongoing operations that could legitimately have endangered the lives of US personnel?
p28829
aVAll while she was a paid member of the military, having signed all sorts of official secrets documentation?
p28830
aVSnowden has his stuff publicised by a vetted journalist after they painstakingly ensured nothing was released that could directly endanger US lives.
p28831
aVManning just flashed a hard copy and uploaded the whole lot.
p28832
aVI don't consider leaking top secret government documents by one of it's employees to be *freedom of speech/expression* but what you posted about [Manning isn't correct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning#Publication_of_leaked_material)\u000a\u000aManning gave all of the data to Wikileaks, which in turn published the leaks through the New York Times, Guardian and Der Spiegel.
p28833
aVThese news papers and journalists have not been prosecuted (that i'm aware of) for publishing this information, as it is the defacto freedom of the press that allows them to do this.
p28834
aVManning went to prison for espionage and theft, not for exercising their right to freedom of speech.\u000a
p28835
aVManning is a hero in the true sense of the word, in the future she may be acknowledged as such.
p28836
aVOk, why?
p28837
aVIs any of what I said not correct? 
p28838
aVHer revelations have amply demonstrated how many lives are at risk when whistleblowers keep their mouths shut.
p28839
aVThe evidence she's been responsible for placing in to the public domain shows American (and allied) involvement and/or complicity in hundreds if not thousands of murders, tortures, and rapes (including of countless civilians, and including executions of the elderly and children, and the operation of death squads), rampant corruption between corporations and the US government over GMO, arms/weapons, etc., and acts of coercion, espionage and sabotage against allied countries in Europe.
p28840
aVNone of which we would know without Manning, and she's paying a huge price for it.
p28841
aVIn fact, arguably, her revelations brought an end to the Iraq occupation (at least until now).
p28842
aVI broadly agree with you.
p28843
aVHowever, one thing I've been thinking about more and more recently is what's possibly the elephant in the room.
p28844
aVManning acquired the information in a manner that's often presented as the NSA's wet dream: an extremely broad, unrefined search where all information's laid bare in the hope of confirming/finding actual crimes against Humanity.
p28845
aVNo discretion, simply a blanket method of surveillance.
p28846
aVWhilst I believe Manning did a great deal to highlight just what's been hidden under the guise of National Security, I also think she could have done things a lot, lot better.
p28847
aVThere are legitimate secrets that can influence the dynamic between countries, that do need to be kept under wraps.
p28848
aVAnd the left and right are both at it.
p28849
aVManning is not British and was not prosecuted under English law. 
p28850
aV&gt; Why is she in prison?
p28851
aVFor violating a contract that she willingly signed as well as putting members of the military in danger.
p28852
aVCall me old fashioned, but if you join the army with a specific name, you should be called by that name unless you have gained another name from your sisters and brother in arms (even if its "Assange Beatch") \u000a
p28853
aVTo me 1984 revealed more about left-wing thought in modern day Britain.
p28854
aVThe hatred of anyone who doesn't think like them.
p28855
aVI mean, look at what people say about anyone that supports UKIP.
p28856
aVOrwell was a socialist. 
p28857
aVSo what?
p28858
aVWhy do people go on about that like it sways from what he was trying to say?
p28859
aVHe was a socialist, but he understood the possible corruption.
p28860
aVHave you even read the damn book, what do you think was going on in that?
p28861
aVObviously he wouldn't attack only leftists like you do.
p28862
aVMost right-wing thought is just as close-minded as most left wing thought, don't act superior.
p28863
aVI'm against extreme left or right equally.
p28864
aVWhat annoys me is all the thick fuck lefties out there who don't think the lessons from 1984 apply to them because "Orwell socialist hurr hurr".
p28865
aVWhere in actual fact, in today's world it's the left who use the double-think to validate their hypocritical views, changing them to suit what's trending on Twitter, or what will gain them points in their social circles.
p28866
aVI don't get why free speech *in it's fullest form* is so impoprtant.
p28867
aVAs long as you are allowed to criticise those who are in power then I don't think we need to be able to verbally abuse one another.
p28868
aVBecause what's the point of life if I can't call everybody a cunt?
p28869
aVWhat is the definition of verbal abuse though?
p28870
aVClaiming offence is now seen by many as the ultimate trump card.
p28871
aVThe moment you claim it the person expressing an opinion, an idea, or now even facts must stop.
p28872
aVTo the offended or those acting on behalf of those that might be would say that everything they don't like is abusive.\u000a
p28873
aVIt isn't something you can define in one go.
p28874
aVThere are many examples.
p28875
aVOne would be newspapers making things up about people and ruining their lives.
p28876
aVYou shouldn't be allowed (in my opinion) to say someone murdered somebody if they didn't.
p28877
aVYou also shouldn't be able to say that yoru wonder pilcures cancer if it doesn't.
p28878
aVYou shouldn't be able to go up to the old lady down the road every morning and get in her face and say you are going to rape her.
p28879
aVThose examples are lies,libel, or threats.
p28880
aVThey aren't subjective.
p28881
aVThis is my whole point - loads of people *say* they want unconditional free speech, but they don't actually.
p28882
aVThey don't want libel, threats, etc to be allowed.
p28883
aVYou are getting confused.
p28884
aVFree speech doesn't mean shouting in fire in a crowded theatre, and libel and threats of violence are rarely considered free speech.
p28885
aVOffensive remarks about beliefs, racist opinions and stuff not on the BBC are usually the grey areas ripe for the debating society.
p28886
aVThere would be a two tier justice system if we were allowed to criticise some but not others.
p28887
aVThat isn't free speech at all.
p28888
aVYou either have free speech or you don't.
p28889
aVAny intermediate option requires audit by some arbitrator, who may well decide that your criticism of the government amounts to a personal insult to an individual, and that you should therefore be persecuted.
p28890
aVRestrictions on free speech in any form set a dangerous precedent. 
p28891
aV&gt;You either have free speech or you don't.
p28892
aVIn which case: we don't have freedom of speech, nor does any country in the world, present or past. 
p28893
aVI doubt that HM would really care, honestly.
p28894
aVAs unpleasant as this is - the same could be said about France.
p28895
aV1985 France engaged in deliberate terrorism against Greenpeace sinking the Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand waters, resulting in the death of an innocent photographer who was on board.
p28896
aVOr worse do we forget what France did to Algeria, the scale of the murder, torture, lies, destruction of a country?
p28897
aVOur society is as consistent with its principles and values as an airtight colander.
p28898
aVThis in no way compromises the tragedy that has unfolded.
p28899
aVYet our society cries in pain for itself but is happy to inflict that selfsame pain on others.

p28908
aVPeople need to stop being so bloody soft and get on with their lives.
p28909
aVThere are much worse things than insensitive jokes to moan about.
p28910
aVFrankie Boyle is still a cunt though - however the hypocrisy in this case is bullshit.
p28911
aVWhy would you buy a paper that tried to have you arrested?
p28912
aVHave you *seen* their crossword?
p28913
aVThere is a stunning amount of hypocrisy, freedom of speech doesn't end where peoples feelings begin.
p28914
aVAlso, if this is about the 'my pussy is haunted' joke, sign me up on the royal payroll and you can make jokes about the supernatural tendencies of my genitals all day long.
p28915
aVFuck, I'll pose for a close up and you can put it on the back of the 5p coin, it'll be big enough.

aVI'm usually not phased by celebrity deaths to much of an extent but this guy defined my childhood comedy.

p29202
aVWe followed the careers of the cast as best we could from the States and always enjoyed seeing something new.

p29209

aVThe comedy world has lost a legend today. 
p29220
aVI moved to the USA 8 years ago.

aV?\u000a\u000a
p29569
aVIf you were to compare his fame and recognition to Rowan Atkinson, Fry and Laurie or Elton and Curtis while doing practically as much as them I feel he didn't become as big as he deserved.
p29570
aVI think he took the choice in the mid 90s to get off the celebrity and media merry-go-round (yes I know he continued to do stuff).
p29571
aVHowever in the 80s he was, arguably, the leading alternative comedian of his day bringing about the mass cake and circuses you see today.
p29572
aVHe passed the baton over earlier than most of his contemporaries.

aVI remember going to see Bottom Live when I was 16 with my dad..
p29711
aVI was in hysterics.
p29712
aVI still quote Bottom to this day.
p29713
aVGodspeed you magnificent b'stard! 
p29714
aVIn the early to mid 80's there were two comedies that got me into uncontrollable fits of giggles.
p29715
aVAnd those shows were The Young Ones and Blackadder.
p29716
aVThere were other comedies we watched as a family back then such as Hi-De-Hi, Allo Allo, The Good Life.
p29717
aVBut none of these made me laugh like these two comedies did.
p29718
aVAnd of course Rik Mayall was a big part of this.
p29719
aVThe Young Ones had a big impression on a 6 year old me.
p29720
aVIt had plenty of adult humour that at the time I did not understand.
p29721
aVBut at the same time a lot of childish slapstick humour which would have me laughing all the way through.
p29722
aVRik's performance in this was outstanding.
p29723
aVAnd though he repeated similar comedy later in the likes of Bottom, it never quite captured the pure anarchy humour the Young Ones had for me.
p29724
aVLikewise Blackadder, still my joint favourite (with Red Dwarf) comedy of all time.
p29725
aVHad some very good adult humour, but also much that a young child could appreciate.
p29726
aVAnd though Rik was in it very little.
p29727
aVWhen he showed up as Flashheart he stole the show.
p29728
aVWhich is no mean feat considering the many great talented actors and comedians there.
p29729
aVAt the time he was by far my favourite character on the show.
p29730
aVSo I am very sad to hear of Rik Mayall's death.

p29870
aVI was never a fan of The Young Ones, but loved him as Lord Flasheart in Blackadder.
p29871
aVThe strangest thing is I didn't like Bottom either, but my very serious Dad always cracked up watching that.
p29872
aVI would even go as far to say that show changed his life.

p29943
aVBad enough that they only used to fill your laptop with adverts and now they're trying to do what is pretty much on the same lines as forcing you to take insurance.
p29944
aVDo please contact trading standards, you may also want to contact Which?.
p29945
aVForgot about Which, thanks I'll report to them now.
p29946
aVHere is the email I sent by the way, it's a bit more competent than my original post.
p29947
aV~~Dear Sir or Madam~~\u000a\u000a~~Recently it has come to my attention that PC World and Curry's are using some very dodgy, possibly verging on illegal, tactics in order to milk more money out of their consumers, for a service that they do not need.~~\u000a\u000a~~Three to four weeks ago, I visited the Hove branch of PC World/Curry's in order to collect a reservation that my housemate had made the same day.
p29948
aVUpon arriving, we were told that whilst the laptop that we had reserved for £449 was in stock (the Lenovo Flex 14), the only ones they had available had had a "set-up" service that came with the laptop.
p29949
aVThis "set-up" service includes a USB stick with a backup of the PC's files and nothing more - yet, a new laptop comes with a backup partition pre-installed for free.~~\u000a \u000a~~We refused this price as it was not the price that we had reserved the laptop for.
p29950
aVWe were then informed by the sales assistant immediately that he would be able to drop the price down to £25.
p29951
aVWe refused again, and he countered with the offer of dropping the price down again, to £10.
p29952
aVAt that point we had had enough and just wanted to purchase the laptop, so we bit the bullet and cut our losses of £10.~~\u000a\u000a~~This had obviously raised red flags, but not as much as it has today.~~\u000a\u000a~~Today me and my father visited the Derby branch of PC World/Curry's, after reserving an ASUS 2-in-1 laptop for £500.
p29953
aVSure enough, when we arrived, we were informed that they did not have the laptop in stock without the set up service.
p29954
aVAfter we refused, and I had told the sales assistant what had happened in Hove a few weeks prior, the price was again brought back down to £25.
p29955
aVThis is when we decided to leave the store.~~\u000a\u000a~~These events show that this is a tactic that is being used nationwide, and it is likely that hundreds, if not thousands, have been subjected to this absolutely useless £35 charge, without knowing the inherent value (or lack of) of this backup - which as I stated before, comes on the recovery partition on the laptop.~~\u000a\u000aRevised letter:\u000a  \u000aRecently it has come to light that Curry's PC World are falsely advertising the availability and prices of their laptops, using a \u2018bait-and-switch\u2019 strategy, meaning that the price the customer pays is often £35 more than the price that they had reserved the laptop at, or had seen the laptop for on the shop floor.
p29956
aVThree to four weeks ago, myself and my housemate reserved a Lenovo Flex 14 laptop for £449 on the Curry\u2019s PC World website for collection in Hove.
p29957
aVHowever, when we arrived at the store we were told that they were out of the \u2018regular\u2019 laptops for £449, and only had laptops that had been \u201cset-up\u201d \u2013 the definition of this being the inclusion of a USB recovery stick.
p29958
aVWe were then informed that this would cost an extra £35 on top of the RRP, making the price £484 instead of the £449 price we had reserved the laptop for.
p29959
aVAfter refusing to pay this price, the shop assistant made a counter offer of £25.
p29960
aVWe again refused this, and he offered it again to us for £10, rather than the original £35.
p29961
aVAt this point we decided to cut our losses after driving especially to the store to pick up the reservation, and paid £459 rather than the £449 the laptop was reserved at.
p29962
aVNow, a few weeks later, my father had also reserved a laptop for collection at Curry\u2019s PC World in Derby.
p29963
aVThe price of this laptop was £499.
p29964
aVYet, again, as we went to pick up the collection, we were informed that there were no \u2018regular\u2019 versions of these laptops left either, only those bundled with the 'KNOWHOW' recovery USB, and we were told yet again that we would have to pay £35 extra if we wished to purchase the laptop.
p29965
aVWe declined, and he offered to give us the laptop for only £25 extra, which would have made the price £524 \u2013 not the £499 price that was advertised and reserved at.
p29966
aVWe then decided to leave the store.
p29967
aVThese tactics are being employed by Curry\u2019s PC World nationwide, with an increasing number of people starting to complain about this \u2013 especially as they had not realised exactly why they were paying more money than the RRP.
p29968
aVThis poses a risk especially to the elderly and less technologically inclined.\u000a
p29969
aVPatrick from Which?
p29970
aVhere.
p29971
aVThanks for getting in touch, I'll raise this with our research teams as it's something we could look into.
p29972
aVWe recently did an undercover investigation of electrical retailers on returning faulty goods to see if they knew the customer's legal rights [under the Sale of Goods Act](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/sale-of-goods-act-faulty-products-investigation/).
p29973
aVAlthough we've seen improvement from last year, many still push you to the manufacturer (under SOGA your rights are actually with the retailer).
p29974
aVAnd this is why I subscribe to Which?
p29975
aV:)
p29976
aV/u/halk &lt;-- love this guy
p29977
aVThey're a great organisation, I'd actually be interested in working for them after completing my degree.
p29978
aVKeep in touch :)
p29979
aVSubtle of you.
p29980
aV:P
p29981
aV[deleted]
p29982
aVUsed to work there myself and it definitely had the feel-good factor! 
p29983
aVSubscribe on where?
p29984
aVI'd post a link, but that'd be a bit cheeky. 
p29985
aVMe too!
p29986
aVYou're the best :)
p29987
aVI subscribe because of the web reviews.
p29988
aVWant a product?
p29989
aVGo look at the reviews and pick the one you can afford, and know the bad points ahead of time.
p29990
aVThe "Which Local" site is also great.
p29991
aVI recently got some building work done.
p29992
aVAs per the review, the builder turned up *on the right day*, he was *on time* (08:30, before I left for work), and his bill matched the quote.
p29993
aVMany, many moons ago, I used to run the UK Philips DAP consumer care line, and it was amazing the amount of people who would contact us as the first port of call when trying to return faulty items.
p29994
aVPeople just don't know.
p29995
aVWhat's even worse is that even more were being directed to us by the retailers, who would refuse to be of any help at all.
p29996
aVWe would help regardless in some instances, but informed them for the next time. 
p29997
aVI had to complain til I was blue in the face about a Philips digisender which promised rgb scart support on the box but didn't actually support it.
p29998
aVEventually got an upgrade.
p29999
aVAh, that would be my pals in CE (consumer electronics).
p30000
aVI was in DAP (domestic appliances &amp; personal care).
p30001
aVI'd be surprised if that wasn't picked up quickly and changed.
p30002
aVIn DAP we regularly changed the text on the DFUs (directions for use) due to stupid people.
p30003
aVLike adding "Do not iron clothes whilst wearing them".
p30004
aVThat was one of my favourites. 
p30005
aVI always read stuff like that in instructions and wonder exactly how dumb you have to be to press red hot metal against your clothes whilst your precious skin is underneath it, then only go on to blame the manufacturer for not saying you can't in the instructions.
p30006
aVSome people are born and then raised to have no common sense and it makes me sad.
p30007
aVThank you very much for the response!
p30008
aVNo worries.
p30009
aVI've added you as a friend so I can remember to get in touch if I have any news :)
p30010
aVCan't thank you enough, I look forward to seeing if anything comes of this!
p30011
aVYou Sir have made me a new Which convert and have now purchased my first which book.
p30012
aVGood to know you guys are out there helping us.
p30013
aVWelcome to the family
p30014
aVWhat a dude. 
p30015
aV"Which?
p30016
aV" are doing what trading standards should be doing.. (or they should be subcontracted!
p30017
aV)
aVPlenty of people who work for Which?
p30018
aVare TSOs\u000a\u000aHow else do you think they interpret the law to protect consumers?
p30019
aVTSOs do a fantastic job on a shoestring budget, with encroachment from private companies like Capita increasingly muscling in on their territory.
p30020
aVDon't go down the lazy-thinking route that Trading Standards = lazy bureaucrats
p30021
aVabsolutely not!
p30022
aVthe bureaucracy and caveats that might be associated with such a contract could hinder them from what they are doing.
p30023
aVI'm not sure how they are funded at the moment aside from paid publications (but I would be interested to know if /u/paddysteen is able to answer that) but it doesn't seem to be stopping them staying impartial and generally doing right by the consumer.
p30024
aVWe're mainly paid for by our members, which includes our magazines and online access to our full reviews etc.
p30025
aVWe have more magazine subscribers than any other subscription mag in the country :)\u000a\u000aWe do have other services too, including consumer legal advice, an energy switching service, a service to find trusted traders in your area, money advice, mortgage advisors etc.
p30026
aVSome of these are included in the normal subscription price.
p30027
aVThese all help with our ongoing commercial success, and we've diversified our business with new services so that we can continue to work for consumers for the next 60 years and beyond.
p30028
aVYou're right that the power we have is based on the fact that we're completely independent - we have no owners, shareholders or Government departments on our back and you'll never see an advert in our mags or on our websites.
p30029
aVAnd we're a not-for-profit charitable organisation - all the money we make is invested back into the business, which also funds all the campaigns we run to change things for the better.
p30030
aVThe more you know... :)
p30031
aVYou guys ever done any looking into the Infinity stuff PC World does?
p30032
aVBasically they say you pay x monthly then after 2 years you pay y and get to keep the laptop \u000a\u000aAs it turns out it was 3 years and there's no buyout option at the end.
p30033
aVYou were renting it - rent a new one or lose the laptop.
p30034
aVOf course we should have read the fine print in the written part of the sale and completely ignored what the sales person was promising but yeah.. Just curious I guess
p30035
aVWhile I don't work for Which?
p30036
aVI do work in a highly regulated industry handling consumer complaints.
p30037
aVI've had a brief look, and it seems as though Infinity is provided through a company called RentSmart, who are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
p30038
aVThis is great news for you as a consumer, because it makes them answerable to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and the burden of proof is on RentSmart if you complain.
p30039
aVIf you genuinely believe you were mis-sold, then you need to register a complaint with RentSmart.
p30040
aVMake it clear to them that you were misadvised at point of sale, and that you either want the service they provide to perform as you were led to expect that it would, or you expect a full refund with redress.
p30041
aVMake it clear that you will take your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you are unable to reach a resolution with them.
p30042
aVBe aware that when the Ombudsman looks at your case, it costs RentSmart £550 regardless of the outcome, and they know that.
p30043
aVI presume you signed an agreement in store and that document contains the terms and conditions in question.
p30044
aVYou should be aware that this is not necessarily a reason to dismiss your complaint, as long as you genuinely believe that you would not have signed it without being misled by an agent acting on behalf of RentSmart.
p30045
aVTake 'em down Patrick, take 'em down.
p30046
aVHaving used to work at Currys/PC World for some time, I can tell you they have to do a lot of strange things in an effort to 'make more money' on these products.
p30047
aVThe principle issue is the margin on high end electricals is vanishingly low.
p30048
aVWe're sometimes talking maybe £20-50 profit on a TV or a laptop, if that.
p30049
aVIt's too competitive for them to raise the price any higher, so they are forced to sell all these services and other crap to make up the difference.
p30050
aVThe situation in the store was very much one of punishing poor performance instead of rewarding good.
p30051
aVI hear it's got better now but it used to be the case that every salesperson, and the store overall, was tracked on various performance metrics with which there were enforced minimum performance criteria to meet.
p30052
aVIt was a flawed system.
p30053
aVThe way it worked, it actually caused stores to TURN AWAY BUSINESS because losing the sale was less of a problem than not getting these arbitrary performance numbers.
p30054
aVIf they hadn't sold many TVs with extras that week, they would rather tell you a TV was out of stock than let you buy it without the HDMI cables, the Blu-Ray player, and their insurance/protection plan, because to do the latter would get them in trouble.
p30055
aVThat's right.
p30056
aVThey will often try NOT to sell you something if you won't take the extras they want to sell with it.
p30057
aVUsually by claiming it's out of stock.
p30058
aVIn an area where there were multiple stores, we'd regularly get customers coming in saying "Currys up the road said you have X of this in stock" and we know they'd sent them our way in order to avoid selling them product that would hurt their numbers.
p30059
aVWe'd also be forced to do the same, if our numbers were bad at the time.
p30060
aVEveryone in the store, managers and all, thought it sucked and didn't like it, but the system didn't really give them a choice.
p30061
aVIt was that, or face repercussions for underperforming.
p30062
aVSo to hear that they're now doing this...
p30063
aVI'm not surprised, but just know it's not the fault of the people in the store, they hate it as much as you do.
p30064
aVBut they will probably try hard not to let their product go without these bogus 'services' because they're in trouble if they don't.
p30065
aVOP saying they were dropping the price will have been the managers trying to make the sale while being able to claim they also sold the set-up service, because the numbers will only show a +1 sold for that service, not that they sold one at a discount so large it nearly erased any profit it was there to make up.
p30066
aVHi Patrick -- I finally got round to resubscribing to Which today.
p30067
aVYou give a brilliant service!
p30068
aVThanks again.

p30070
aVThe warranty is separate.
p30071
aVYou are free to deal with the manufacturer directly during the warranty period if you want to.
p30072
aVBut you've always got the Sale of Goods Act.
p30073
aVThere is something about six months, which you may be getting mixed up about.
p30074
aVAfter six months of ownership the onus is on you to prove that the fault was not due to any fault of your own (ie.
p30075
aVthat it is inherent).
p30076
aVWe have all the details for free on our consumer rights site: http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-goods-act
p30077
aVAs a subscriber to Which and Which legal I hope you will be covering this illegal practice.
p30078
aVIt needs national exposure to prevent those without knowledge of their rights or technical expertise being exploited. 
p30079
aVThe thing is, modern laptops don't require this unless you are going to install another operating system onto it.
p30080
aVEven then, laptops these days have large recovery partitions that can re-install the complete copy of the OS ( these days usually Windows 8.1 ) without the user having to do much apart from hold down a key to boot into recovery mode.
p30081
aVHi Patrick, if it helps I had an identical experience (sales rep saying we could not buy at the standard price, that we could only buy if we accepted the setup fee) back in April.
p30082
aVI complained and Curry's response was that this was 'necessary' because a lot of customers don't know how to setup their laptops.
p30083
aVFor reference, actually setting up the laptop is no more complex than turning on a new mobile.
p30084
aVThanks for sharing.
p30085
aVThe more examples of this happening helps us.
p30086
aV*Sorry to be a pain, I rewrote the letter of complaint as the part about partitions isn't necessarily relevant, and I'd been awake for over 2 days at the time of writing the original.
p30087
aVHope the edited versions helps everybody get a clearer understanding:*\u000a\u000aRecently it has come to light that Curry's PC World are falsely advertising the availability and prices of their laptops, using a \u2018bait-and-switch\u2019 strategy, meaning that the price the customer pays is often £35 more than the price that they had reserved the laptop at, or had seen the laptop for on the shop floor.
p30088
aVThree to four weeks ago, myself and my housemate reserved a Lenovo Flex 14 laptop for £449 on the Curry\u2019s PC World website for collection in Hove.
p30089
aVHowever, when we arrived at the store we were told that they were out of the \u2018regular\u2019 laptops for £449, and only had laptops that had been \u201cset-up\u201d \u2013 the definition of this being the inclusion of a USB recovery stick.
p30090
aVWe were then informed that this would cost an extra £35 on top of the RRP, making the price £484 instead of the £449 price we had reserved the laptop for.
p30091
aVAfter refusing to pay this price, the shop assistant made a counter offer of £25.
p30092
aVWe again refused this, and he offered it again to us for £10, rather than the original £35.
p30093
aVAt this point we decided to cut our losses after driving especially to the store to pick up the reservation, and paid £459 rather than the £449 the laptop was reserved at.
p30094
aVNow, a few weeks later, my father had also reserved a laptop for collection at Curry\u2019s PC World in Derby.
p30095
aVThe price of this laptop was £499.
p30096
aVYet, again, as we went to pick up the collection, we were informed that there were no \u2018regular\u2019 versions of these laptops left either, only those bundled with the 'KNOWHOW' recovery USB, and we were told yet again that we would have to pay £35 extra if we wished to purchase the laptop.
p30097
aVWe declined, and he offered to give us the laptop for only £25 extra, which would have made the price £524 \u2013 not the £499 price that was advertised and reserved at.
p30098
aVWe then decided to leave the store.
p30099
aVThese tactics are being employed by Curry\u2019s PC World nationwide, with an increasing number of people starting to complain about this \u2013 especially as they had not realised exactly why they were paying more money than the RRP.
p30100
aVThis poses a risk especially to the elderly and less technologically inclined.\u000a
p30101
aVHow does that work with catalogue sales,  if you don't mind me asking?
p30102
aVVery.co.uk are my least favorite people,  I work phone support for &lt;game console manufacturer&gt; 	 And they just tell EVERYONE "not our problem, contact the manufacturer". 
p30103
aV[deleted]
p30104
aVIts not me they are fobbing off, I just want to be able to say to my customers "Very are giving you the run around, go back to them and say &lt;x&gt;"
p30105
aV[deleted]
p30106
aVOur procedure is "tell them to go back to the retailer".
p30107
aVI would just like to go the extra mile and give them some ammunition to go back WITH.
p30108
aVAnd to watchdog?
p30109
aVYep, I did that shortly afterwards.
p30110
aVYou should make this much more formal.
p30111
aVTerms like "dodgy" and "milking" won't lend you any credibility. 
p30112
aVDoesn't make the claim any less true.
p30113
aVIt's not a cover letter.
p30114
aVThe problem is the character limit, so I've had to use shorter terms like that in order to adhere to it.
p30115
aVThe character limit is 1500 on Which?, and 1600 for Trading Standards.
p30116
aVHopefully it'll get the point across, and if enough people complain, the vocabulary I've used shouldn't matter too much.
p30117
aVBesides, it's probably better than 90% of the complaints that they receive.\u000a
p30118
aVPesky character limits!
p30119
aVFYI you can always email us on our community site: http://conversation.which.co.uk/contact-us/ Or ping me a PM.
p30120
aVWe use this site to get evidence of emerging issues, which we then use to inspire new investigations or launch new campaigns.
p30121
aVAnd it's free for everyone to use.
p30122
aVIt's a bit like Reddit but just consumer issues (and not quite as busy :P).
p30123
aVAnd I browse Reddit too.
p30124
aVHad to cut the email down a little bit, but I think most of what's been said in the email has been covered here too.
p30125
aVThe testimonials of people who used to work there posted here provide an even deeper insight as to what is really going on behind the scenes.
p30126
aVIf you need any more information from me though, feel free to PM me.

VJust saw this on the Guardian, scary stuff
p31336
aVJust out of curiosity, what would prevent a concerned citizen from setting up surveilance on this site and reporting on every single entrance and exit from the facility?
p31337
aVIt's open to the public, you have to go there to claim recovered property.
p31338
aVThis article is terrible.
p31339
aVOf course it can't, it's damning to the defense.
p31340
aVThere was a time when cops accepted the fact that they had a responsibility to put their lives on the line to uphold justice and rights for the people.
p31341
aVThere was a time when the police were respected for that.
p31342
aVPolice were a different class; they accepted that their lives were forfeit to the cause of service and protection, and many of them died in that pursuit.
p31343
aVNow there doesn't seem to be any sense of nobility.
p31344
aVCops aren't proud patriots anymore.
p31345
aVThey don't do their job because they know it is necessary and want to put their very lives behind American values.
p31346
aVThey don't do their jobs because of a sense of moral duty.
p31347
aVThey do it because its a job you can get without any skills, special qualities, or strong moral compass.
p31348
aVSmart people, with critical thinking skills, worldly knowledge, strong moral convictions and the willingness to put their lives on the line for justice are excluded from the police force for the most part.
p31349
aVIf you are not prepared to take a bullet for truth and justice, then you have no business being a police officer.
p31350
aVIf you are willing to kill an unarmed, negligibly-dangerous person, you have no business being a police officer.
p31351
aVThose cops know that they murdered that guy, and they know that he posed no threat to their lives, or any meaningful threat to their persons at all.
p31352
aVThose cops are despicable, and they should all be criminally prosecuted, and they know that they are guilty.
p31353
aVedit: Thanks for the gold, stranger.
p31354
aVI was just venting my frustrations here.
p31355
aVI obviously don't have the evidence, and am just reacting to what seems like convincing video.
p31356
aVI'm very pleased that my thoughts resonate with many Redditors.
p31357
aVI really believe in the power that Reddit has as a tool for disseminating ideas, and providing the opportunity for discussion.
p31358
aVIf I had posted this in a more popular subreddit, I might have been downvoted for "sitting on my high horse," but I'm glad that some Redditors recognize the honesty in "fancy worded walls of text.
p31359
aV" I'm no paragon of social justice or activism, and I'm no revolutionary thinker.
p31360
aVI'm just an American who believes in the foundations of my country.
p31361
aVWhen I see people tearing down those foundations, I feel like the only thing I can really do to manifest change is to talk about it.
p31362
aVSome people don't want to hear it, or tell me to get off my computer and do something, but I think that I'm at least doing my part to speak out, and hopefully my words can reach someone who will benefit from them in some way (this is a better venue for speech than a sandwich-board on a street corner, after all).
p31363
aVI'm also really glad that redditors find my input valuable enough to support Reddit with gold.
p31364
aVThough it is relatively insignificant, I am proud to be a part of the gears that keep Reddit turning.
p31365
aVThanks again, and keep on Gilding!
p31366
aVCheers,\u000a\u000aOakenbones
p31367
aVYou have an excellent way with words, sir.
p31368
aVThank you.
p31369
aV"You're Honor, I object!
p31370
aV"\u000a"On what grounds?
p31371
aV"\u000a"It is incredibly damaging to my defense.
p31372
aV"\u000a\u000a-Couldn't find the gif so I figured I would act it out.
p31373
aVThis needs to get to the top.
p31374
aVThey straight up **murdered** that kid.
p31375
aVRight at the end it looks like he is begging them.
p31376
aVHe looked like he was about to throw another rock at them to me.
p31377
aV/S ?
p31378
aVNot at all.
p31379
aVHe looks like he has something in his right hand and is bringing it up to draw back and pitch it at them.
p31380
aVI'm not saying that's what happened.
p31381
aVThat's just what it looks like to me.
p31382
aVHe at no point drew back in a way that would indicate he was about to throw a rock.
p31383
aVTIL most redditors are blind.
p31384
aV[This was his stance the moment he was shot to death.
p31385
aV](http://imgur.com/T2px2Zb)
p31386
aVAre tasers not an option anymore?
p31387
aVWhen they got developed this is the kind of thing we were promised they would prevent, crazy person does dumb shit to cops gets stunned and handcuffed.
p31388
aVIt seems though that lots of departments just don't issue them.
p31389
aVStill no excuse though, there are 3 of them and they do have batons, which might hurt him if they used them but you know, less than bullets.
p31390
aVIt seems now that the new doctrine for any misbehavior is to mag dump on the guy till you are sure he is dead, even if you have to chase him across the street and corner him before you shoot him some more.
p31391
aV"there are 3 of them and they do have batons, which might hurt him if they used them but you know, less than bullets.
p31392
aV"\u000a\u000aBruises result in lawsuits, bulletholes don't.
p31393
aVUnless of course someone is recording...
p31394
aVAnd it just pains me so much that I'm thinking the exact same thing while I'm typing the comment you replied to.
p31395
aVThat dead guys don't have a story different from yours, don't use up crowded jail space, don't add workload to over loaded public defenders and court-dockets and don't sue.
p31396
aVIt makes wonder how many times does this happen not in front of a camera.
p31397
aVDo they just kill a guy and clean up the story all the time because it's easier and cheaper?
p31398
aVCheaper until the day when the public at large loses faith in their police force.
p31399
aVThen the bill comes due with interest.
p31400
aVSpeaking of 'overuse of force,' let's think numerically about this:\u000a\u000a I count three officers firing 5 shots down the street and, ten seconds later, 7 shots into the wall or into Mr. Zambrano-Montez.
p31401
aVThey could be firing together, close enough that bullet shots sound like echos, but perhaps that's what you folks hear.
p31402
aVHopefully forensic analysis can take all the bullets and match them to each gun.
p31403
aVHow many rocks was this 35-year-old man holding?
p31404
aVHow big exactly?
p31405
aVAny sharp rocks in there?
p31406
aVHow high were these cops when they decided that rocks require lethal force?
p31407
aVPerhaps they were using something whilst in their wonderfully shiny police car?
p31408
aVOkay, the last two questions were not really useful (yet) here... but still: does rock throwing require a response of bullet firing?
p31409
aVThis article has the best and unedited version of the video I could find.
p31410
aVNo adds to watch before hand either.
p31411
aVWow, thats the first I've seen that.
p31412
aVIf he was unarmed they effing murdered him.
p31413
aVHoly crap.
p31414
aVI am no police defender - I think they are mostly huge bullies and have been harassed for nothing on multiple occasions- but what did this guy think was going to happen when he started throwing rocks at cops?
p31415
aVSo being stupid or possibly having mental issues (I don't know this kids story) is a capital offense?
p31416
aVCops are paid to be in the line of fire and dangerous situations that is the job.
p31417
aVIt is not their job to play judge jury and executioner.
p31418
aVOur police forces have either become the biggest bullies or the biggest pussies, I am not sure which.
p31419
aVOh he threw a rock at me - yes you can hurt someone, but you will damn sure do more damage with a gun than someone with a rock.
p31420
aVThey can get back up, not every situation has to end withing 10 seconds, and if they get away well then do some damn investigative work to track them down.
p31421
aVOh but that is all too much work, it is faster and less effort to just straight up murder people especially since the cops never get held accountable.
p31422
aVNot to mention that the barrage of bullets headed downrange on a street full of cars presents a very clear and present danger to the walking/driving public.
p31423
aVNobody got hit this time but that's why you don't add 30 or 40 shots to a scenario where the police are the only ones with guns.
p31424
aVDid I say he deserved to be shot?
p31425
aVNo.
p31426
aVBut he also shouldn't be throwing rocks at the police if he wanted to stay alive.
p31427
aVBoth parties can be in the wrong you know.
p31428
aVYou may as well say it because you are implying it awfully hard "shouldn't be throwing rocks at the police if he wanted to stay alive".
p31429
aVI will reiterate the job of the police is to catch the criminals, not judge them, or sentence them to death.
p31430
aVLethal force should always be a last resort even if it costs a cop their life - that is the job that is what they get paid for.
p31431
aVIf they do not want to do that then they can GTFO of the force.
p31432
aVWe don't know if the kid had mental problems or not, not everyone is rational, yes it is a bad idea to throw rocks at the police, did he do it because he thought he was playing a prank or was he sick, we will never know because the cops murdered him.
p31433
aVSaying someone should know better is not the same as saying they deserved what they got.
p31434
aVIt is easy to say someone should know better but do you understand that not everyone does.
p31435
aVEveryone wants to think that everyone in the world is normal, that mental issues do not exists or low intelligence but they do.
p31436
aVNot every person out in the world understands right and wrong and the police have to deal with those types more often because they don't understand the difference.
p31437
aVSo the police need to be able to deal with that because they will face it.
p31438
aVI don't know if this kid is an example of that but throwing out that phrase "they should know better" is just dumb not everyone does.
p31439
aVI guess that Indian guy the police body slammed to the ground is to blame in your world as well because you should know better than to not speak English or pull away from someone when you know you have done nothing wrong.
p31440
aV&gt; Lethal force should always be a last resort even if it costs a cop their life\u000a\u000aNo, no, no, no.
p31441
aVWe have no right to ask that.
p31442
aVWe can ask them to go into dangerous situations, yes.
p31443
aVWe expect them to make a best-effort attempt at apprehending suspects.
p31444
aVWhat we cannot do is expect them to sacrifice their lives for it.
p31445
aVThat's not the same thing.
p31446
aVThese are cops, not soldiers for crying out loud.
p31447
aVIf they were soldiers, then yes we could expect them to succeed at all odds, even pain of death... but we'd also expect them to use deadly force as a primary tactic.
p31448
aVCops have just as much right to come home safely as other emergency services (such as firefighters).
p31449
aVI have no problem with cops holding their own lives above those of violent offenders.
p31450
aVThey should try everything that *doesn't* involve getting themselves killed before taking a life.
p31451
aV(I haven't seen the video yet.
p31452
aVI'm replying specifically to a statement that I disagree with, not within the context of this shooting.
p31453
aV)\u000a
p31454
aVWe hold our soldiers to higher standards than we do our police when it comes to use of force, if I had done what these guys did when I was in the Army I would probably still be sitting in a jail cell even though it was a war.
p31455
aVWhy can we not expect cops to sacrifice themselves when dealing with our own citizens, they are the enforcers of justice and in this country justice is supposed to be one of our highest ideals.
p31456
aVBy them putting themselves above justice it weakens our entire system and I guarantee if it continues you will see more instances of people just saying the hell with it "I am going to take them with me" or purposefully hunting them.
p31457
aVYou seem to be conflating concepts.
p31458
aVThere is a spectrum of choices upon which cops have to choose.
p31459
aVAt one extreme end, you have shoot-first and ask-questions-later, even for minor offenses.
p31460
aVThis is unacceptable.
p31461
aVEveryone agrees on that.
p31462
aVAt the other end, they can bum-rush any suspect, regardless of how dangerous, lemming style, and pin them under the weight of their now dead bodies.
p31463
aVThis is also unacceptable.
p31464
aVWhat you're suggesting seems suggestive of the latter, as a knee-jerk reaction against the former.
p31465
aVYou seem to be saying that police should value their own lives less than the lives of violent criminals.
p31466
aVIs this really what you are saying?
p31467
aVI strongly disagree.
p31468
aVI don't believe that justice demands that, nor can we maintain a police force at that standard.\u000a
p31469
aVNo. 
p31470
aVAre you sure about that, cause from where I'm standing your doing the apologist dance.
p31471
aVCan I play you some music to do it with?
p31472
aVI brought my tambourine. 
p31473
aVTo clarify a little: What Brad is doing, knowingly or unknowingly, is using his statement as a strawman.
p31474
aVThe fact that it IS stupid to throw rocks at cops has no bearing on whether or not lethal force was justified in this situation.
p31475
aVThe way to respond to your argument could be, "Maybe you're right that lethal force was not necessary in these kind of situations, but you do have to agree that the action of throwing rocks at cops was a terribly stupid idea and he should well have known that he would be going to jail for aggravated assault.
p31476
aV"\u000a\u000aThere, now we can have two discussions, one about the justification of lethal force and one about what level of response is necessary for rock throwing!
p31477
aVApologists don't show up to have discussions, they show up to carry agendas.
p31478
aVMaybe I should be more polite about it.
p31479
aVI just really don't care what people think about me anymore so long as they don't see me pretend like any of this predictable damage control is in the slightest bit credible.
p31480
aVYeah, I'm an apologist for saying that it's dumb to throw rocks at cops.
p31481
aVOk.
p31482
aVI have a huge problem with their illegal seizure of someone's phone and the claim that the video can't be used as evidence.
p31483
aVBut throwing rocks at cops from 10 feet away is something an idiot does.
p31484
aVOr someone who wants to die.
p31485
aVI genuinely look at this video and think "suicide by cop"
p31486
aV"He had it coming folks!
p31487
aV" Classic apologist dance there, only two steps and always the thing to fall back on when nothing else could possible work.
p31488
aVAlways be sure to tell everyone your not going to dance it while dancing it.
p31489
aVAre you genuinely an idiot or are you just a troll?
p31490
aV"He's got a rock" He had it coming" There is absolutely no excuse for what everyone can click that video and see and damn straight I'm mocking you for your weak ass attempt to apologize for it.
p31491
aVIt's straight up murder for disrespecting their badges.
p31492
aVYou hear that?
p31493
aV*Straight up murder.
p31494
aV* You should be ashamed for even trying to excuse it.
p31495
aVI never said he had it coming.
p31496
aVI said he was an idiot for throwing rocks at cops.
p31497
aVI said he should have known better.
p31498
aVIf you can't accept that it is dumb as fuck to throw rocks at cops, how in the world are you still alive?
p31499
aVI have been held at gunpoint by cops for driving a shitty car in a nice neighborhood at night.
p31500
aVI have been handcuffed and detained for "fitting a description" I did not actually fit.
p31501
aVI have had two cars stolen from me and never received a lick of help from the police.
p31502
aVI have had one car impounded by the police for a violation the judge later said was not even a real thing.
p31503
aVI have no love for cops.
p31504
aVI also have no love for idiots who assault cops.
p31505
aVShould they be killed?
p31506
aVAbsolutely not.
p31507
aVDo I have to treat them like blameless martyrs?
p31508
aVFuck no.
p31509
aVWhat you'll do is deflect as much blame as you can.
p31510
aVYou think we don't know you're coming to do that the second the link gets posted?
p31511
aVYou think we don't know you're going to open with "I don't like Cops BUT..." You think we don't know before you even land on the thread that you're going to move on to "What did he think would happen?
p31512
aV" You think we don't know you're going to moan like a little girl when you get mocked for it?
p31513
aVPredictable as the sunrise.
p31514
aVMy only question is:\u000a\u000aHas he not seen the news in the last few months?
p31515
aVIs he not aware that cops have killed people for little to no reason before?
p31516
aVIf no, that is the only justifiable reason I can think of why you would become aggresive with a group of police.
p31517
aVIt's almost like he wanted to die.
p31518
aVBy no means does this alleviate the police of wrongful intent, but it does make me wonder what the hell was going through that guys mind.
p31519
aVMust have been very serious to warrant risking your life to cops.
p31520
aVToday in misleading headlines.
p31521
aVThis kid's teacher must just hate him.
p31522
aVIf I were the parents I'd simply lawyer up and make the ISD start spending money they don't have to defend against a barrage of lawsuits against them and the teacher.
p31523
aVI'm talking hyper sensitivity like a Tunbler/SJW on crack; every time he got scolded, looked at funny or if the teacher didn't call on him when he raised his hand the teacher, principal and the ISD would get letters.
p31524
aVAfter a while they'd learn to walk on eggshells around him.\u000a
p31525
aVThat sounds like a terrible idea.
p31526
aVSounds like a perfect idea.
p31527
aVTheir child is being abused. 
p31528
aVSometimes teachers/admin make the wrong decisions.
p31529
aVSo, you think that essentially putting your child in this isolated bubble and forcing the school district to spend the small amount of money that they get from taxpayers to fight lawsuits over stupid shit like this is a good idea?
p31530
aVYou're a psychopath.
p31531
aVInstead of being a fucking crazy person, you could instead go the route that involves sitting down with the instructors and admin and talking things out.
p31532
aVIf that doesn't work, then go to the school board.
p31533
aVImmediately suing seems to be the knee-jerk reaction in America nowadays, and it's fucking ridiculous.
p31534
aVBe an adult and handle your problems without potentially ruining peoples lives. 
p31535
aVNo sir you are naive.
p31536
aVFirst of all my child comes first.
p31537
aVIf you can't say that then don't you EVER have a child.
p31538
aVThere's nothing to talk about.
p31539
aVThe kid did nothing wrong.
p31540
aVCut and dry.
p31541
aVAs far as politely discussing anything; what do you think they did?
p31542
aVLegal action comes 2nd.
p31543
aVI would always give the retarded monkeys who run the public school system a chance to explain why they do the moronic shut that they do but there's a line you don't cross.
p31544
aVYou don't let your child be bullied at ANY cost!
p31545
aVIf you would put government employees above your own child then you are pure shit.
p31546
aVNo parent would ever do that.
p31547
aVDisgusting.  
p31548
aVNo shit your child always comes first.
p31549
aVBut that doesn't mean you should discard every sense of decency that you have just because you want to act childish yourself.
p31550
aVThis school suspended the kid for a stupid reason.
p31551
aVDid they put his life in danger?
p31552
aVNo.
p31553
aVDid they bully him?
p31554
aVIt doesn't really seem like it.
p31555
aVSo they made a mistake in suspending him.
p31556
aVIt didn't ruin the kids life.
p31557
aVI think it would be a great way to set an example for kids if parents didn't freak the fuck out every time their child gets put in an adverse situation. 
p31558
aVIt's doesn't matter.
p31559
aVThey are government employees.
p31560
aVThey work for the public.
p31561
aVThey answer to us not we to them.
p31562
aVWe set the rules.
p31563
aVThey did not make a mistake.
p31564
aVThey purposely suspended a child for no legitimate reason.
p31565
aVYou tell them what did was stupid (it was) and that they will apologize to your child and fix any damage.
p31566
aVThey do this and it's settled.
p31567
aVThey don't and it's lawsuit city\u000a\u000aYou tell your child they they work for him (they do) and he answers the his parents not a federal troll. 
p31568
aVYou do understand that these "federal trolls" you're speaking of are other people right?
p31569
aVPeople who are just trying to make a living to support their families and themselves, just like anyone else.
p31570
aVThey weren't out to get this kid.
p31571
aVThey were just trying to follow the codes of conduct at their school so that no one gets hurt.
p31572
aVThe whole magic ring suspension was garbage, but the other two were at least somewhat understandable.
p31573
aVI'm sure they have clear-cut rules on the use of labels, and on nudity of any kind.
p31574
aVMost teachers try their best to make sure that learning environments are comfortable for students, and they have to make judgement calls on the fly to make sure every kid is okay.
p31575
aVSometimes they're wrong.
p31576
aVBut they aren't your kids personal servants, they're other human beings.
p31577
aVMaking a living and calling kids out for not following bullshit rules are two different things.
p31578
aVAlso it's a known fact that people who work for the government are assholes.
p31579
aVCops, the IRS, the dmv \u000a\u000aNow if I go to chick-fil-a I'm greeted with a warm smile.
p31580
aVAt the dmv I'm made to feel like an idiot for not knowing what a form 44-34S is like I live and breath nonsense.
p31581
aVThose codes of conduct are pure bullshit.
p31582
aV8 year old wares a James Bond shirt = suspended for sexism.
p31583
aVWhat about the classic; "terrorist threatening" which can be applied to anyone for ANY bullshit reason!
p31584
aVSchool administrators are a big part of what's wrong with education.
p31585
aVThey soak up tax dollars and earn six figure salaries to turn schools into a police state.
p31586
aVParents hate them, teachers hate them so why are they even there?
p31587
aVThis is why no child of mine will ever set foot in a "public" school.  
p31588
aVYou do know that admin isn't a public school only problem right?
p31589
aVPrivate schools have just as many issues, and their admin make an excessive amount more than public school admin.
p31590
aVSo sending a kid to a private school doesn't help them escape from bullshit rules and people.
p31591
aVIn fact, considering that most private schools are religiously affiliated, those schools probably have even more ridiculous rules set in place.
p31592
aVMost restaurants are McDonald's but I don't eat there lol.
p31593
aVPrivate schools exist because patients pay tuition.
p31594
aVIf a parent doesn't feel their child is being treated properly then then can move them to another school.
p31595
aVThat's their incentive to not fuck up.
p31596
aVHey idiot.
p31597
aVInstead of punishing other teachers at that school for something they didn't do, why not just press for the school to fire the teacher that did this?
p31598
aVEat a big bag of dicks.
p31599
aVI'll do as I please 
p31600
aVI was thinking this.
p31601
aVI'd say this has more to do with small town xenophobia than the child's behavior.
p31602
aVThe staff is thinking they'll run them off with repeated suspensions.
p31603
aVTime to lawyer up, and file a lawsuit.
p31604
aVI don't see how the kid's behaviors are causing any real disruption in the classroom, and the suspensions are affecting his right to be provided an education.
p31605
aV..i'm wearing a replica of the one ring right now... am i a threat to my coworkers without knowing it?
p31606
aVYes,  I understand that you know yourself and co-workers better then I do but as a person that lives in this society I know what is best for you and them.
p31607
aVPlease stop offending people with your magical accessories. 
p31608
aVwhat about the replica of one of the nine rings of power of the humans?
p31609
aVCan i keep that one?
p31610
aVOh man, you're in a heep of trouble now buddy!
p31611
aVI'm not sure where you got these "rings" or as I like to call them WMD's.
p31612
aVPlus probably have Garfield the cat literature in your "residence"/home base.
p31613
aVThe FBI is coming for you!

aVThis is America and we don't stand for intolerance of America!

aVClearly this kid is up to no good
p31623
aVThat's so .... preciousssssss.
p31624

p31625
aVThis sounds like a Butters episode
p31626
aVYour having an imagination doesn't suit the needs of the system just at this moment, mmmkay Billy?
p31627
aV\u201cI assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend\u2019s existence,\u201d the boy's father later wrote in an email.

aVAs a recent (ish) texas transplant, this does not surprise me
p31631
aVThats not a kid!
p31632
aVWhat is it then??
p31633
aV?
aVIt's a hobbit dum dum...
p31634
aVOne word: TEXAS
p31635
aVI've lived in nyc, Houston and la.
p31636
aVTrust me, stupid angry people live everywhere. 
p31637
aVas the saying goes, everything is bigger in texas, even our idiots!
p31638
aVHow can they possibly let him go for this?
p31639
aVIt doesn't get more open-and-close than this
p31640
aVYou want someone dead,  become a cop.
p31641
aVShoot them, take the paid vacation, go back to work.
p31642
aVLegal killing / hit men. 
p31643
aVMurder is legal for those who carry a badge.
p31644
aVNow the campus police are the ones murdering students.
p31645
aVThis monster should be tried and executed.
p31646
aVIsn't this the shooting previously in the news and posted at reddit during which the cop warned the guy 29 times to stop or he would shoot?
p31647
aVPretty sure it is.
p31648
aV29 times is no justification for shooting, but I feel like this write-up should mention the fact. 
p31649
aVI'm fine with that line of logic, to be honest. 
p31650
aVThey opened the door, now make them wear the shoes.
p31651
aV/I know I'm mixing metaphors, I'm a metaphor Chef! 
p31652
aVWhat would Jesus do with the homeless and hungry?
p31653
aV'murican jesus?
p31654
aVOr regular Jesus? 
p31655
aVMurican jeebus would open up a can of whupass while regular jeebus would probably feed them or wash their feet or some other hippie bullshit. 
p31656
aVSeriously, whatever reason these ass wipes think justifies fining and/or jailing people that are feeding other people in a charitable act of humanity, deserve to be jailed themselves due to the danger to society they present as insane as they have to be to actually act this way.
p31657
aVThey need to be stripped of any job or responsibility they may take on, that gives them ANY power over any other human being for the rest of their lives.
p31658
aVHe got a kill during his latest urban safari, it seems.
p31659
aVAnd he's been charged with 2nd-degree murder.
p31660
aVFirst degree murder is by definition premeditated.  
p31661
aVI can see that my comment sounds as though I was criticizing the 2nd-degree charge versus the 1st-degree charge, but my point was intended to be the fact that this guy WAS charged and not getting off unpenalized.
p31662
aVIf only they had found drugs, it would have been worth it!
p31663
aV/s
p31664
aVYeah TOTALLY!

aVReally tragic.
p31670
aVI feel so terrible for his wife.
p31671
aVI feel for the community as well, most likely they all feel like they are no longer safe having Police in their communities.
p31672
aVWell, now it's is happening to white people, for no reason other than incompetence.
p31673
aVNow is it time for action?
p31674
aVhttp://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/12/3601771/people-police-killed-in-2014/  I hope you don't think this is just a black/brown issue.
p31675
aVIf you have been watching the US  Drug War, there have always been police killings, especially of innocent people, regardless of race.
p31676
aVThe fact that police are usually racist thugs doesn't stop them from murdering in a color blind fashion as often as not.
p31677
aVThis little baby was hit with a swat team's grenade in a botched , mistake raid: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/20/county-wont-pay-toddler-grenade_n_5695271.html white\u000a\u000aThis sleeping little girl was murdered by cops as she slept in bed, next to her grandma: http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/aiyana-stanley-jones-raid/  black\u000a\u000ahttp://thefreethoughtproject.com/arizona-cop-brutally-attacks-teen-girl-mother-begs-stop/ brown\u000a\u000ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kelly_Thomas - a young white guy with schizophrenia, who died begging for his dad.
p31678
aVThis one just destroys me, bc I would kill anyone who would do this to my child.
p31679
aVI can't imagine the anguish all of these families and all of the rest with murdered loved ones feel.
p31680
aVI hope none of us ever know such pain.\u000a\u000a
p31681
aV&gt;I hope none of us ever know such pain.
p31682
aVSadly, it's probably the only way for it to be recognized by the majority and stopped.
p31683
aVOtherwise it will keep growing, as all things do!
p31684
aVQuick, what's his skin color?
p31685
aVMake a big deal about his skin color!
p31686
aVThat is some sad stuff right there. 
p31687
aVGee another one.
p31688
aVI bet they can find tons more too.
p31689
aVWe can be 'honest' about past injustices because we can *feel good* about how righteous we are now huh.
p31690
aVDon't watch that Walmart shooting.
p31691
aV... or here's the one they really don't want us to notice since it doesn't make the peasants fight amongst themselves: **Not one conviction for the global financial theft and meltdown.
p31692
aV**
p31693
aVNot in this country, anyway.
p31694
aVIceland rounded those fuckers up and jailed them.
p31695
aVFrom what I had read it sounded as if they were extra brazen and obnoxious in Iceland, or maybe it's because was novel for your country.
p31696
aVThey sure went to town there for a while though it sounded like.
p31697
aVAt least you got some justice.
p31698
aVHere all that happened is that they had to return some (just some) of the loot.
p31699
aVSome of these people deserved life sentences imo.
p31700
aVIt was unreal.
p31701
aVZero justice - the royalty just loots the peasants here and we call it capitalism.\u000a
p31702
aVSorry, I should've been more clear.
p31703
aVI'm American.
p31704
aVWhat I meant was that we didn't get any justice in this country (the US), but at least Iceland did.
p31705
aVOne of the reasons Iceland was so hardcore about locking those assholes up, was because the government of Iceland truly believes that they owed that to their people.
p31706
aVThey sent agents as far away as London to arrest bankers.
p31707
aVYou just won't find that sort of respect for the citizen in America.
p31708
aVOur government knows that if they can distract us long enough, most of us will be too apathetic to care.
p31709
aVYou're right, we got zero justice.
p31710
aVI watched a story unfold not long ago.
p31711
aVA man had committed an armed robbery when he was 19.
p31712
aVNobody was hurt.
p31713
aVThrough some clerical error, he ended up not being sent to prison.
p31714
aVThis last year, the error was noticed, and the state was really wanting to have him serve his 20 years.
p31715
aVHe's like 38 or so now.
p31716
aVHasn't been in trouble since, and owns his own business.
p31717
aVHe's got kids, and does the right thing.
p31718
aVPillar of the community and all that.
p31719
aVSo here's a guy who fucked up when he was a kid.
p31720
aVThe state screwed up and let him walk.
p31721
aVHe took that opportunity to get his shit together and be a good citizen, and yet, they still decided that he needed to go to prison.
p31722
aVMeanwhile, we had entire corporations and banks that deliberately fucked this country and the world economy over, for the sake of short term profit, causing a global crisis.
p31723
aVAnd the prospect of jail was never on the table for them.
p31724
aVThat's fucking absurd.
p31725
aVYea ...
p31726
aVI get pretty mad when I hear what these guys made on their bonuses - 3 or 4 years of multi-million dollar 'bubble bonuses' as they knowingly created the bubble.
p31727
aVThen came the crash.
p31728
aVSome were let go - since their losses were so huge etc.
p31729
aVBut of course they kept the loot.
p31730
aVThe guy who ran the derivatives desk at AIG made insane amounts.
p31731
aVBut he kept it all.
p31732
aVThe taxpayers end up paying these guys for their crookery.
p31733
aVWhat happened was so clearly ethically wrong that the govt shoud've done what they did with Capone - get the crook anyway they can.
p31734
aVBut no ... nothing.
p31735
aVMerely some govt trials so that these banks have to return some of the loot.
p31736
aVSo what?
p31737
aVSo as bad as this all was, it's all primed and ready to happen again. 
p31738
aVOh yeah and it'll happen again.
p31739
aVWe didn't revise any policies to put in fail safe procedures.
p31740
aVLiterally nothing has changed.
p31741
aVA few banks got swallowed by bigger banks, but nobody responsible really lost anything.
p31742
aVThe only people who lost are the taxpayers.
p31743
aVOf course, next time it happens, it'll be even worse.
p31744
aVIt's scary to think how bad things will get before they get better.
p31745
aVAmericans don't need distracting, they do that to themselves well enough.
p31746
aVBut one day it will all come crashing down.
p31747
aVAnd you know what will happen to those people who didn't care to pay attention to what would ultimately affect them, they will kill themselves!
p31748
aVYep, it most certainly will come crashing down.
p31749
aVWe live in a fading empire.
p31750
aVIs it easy to move there?
p31751
aVAmerica has turned to shit, and nationalism.
p31752
aVI'm not sure.
p31753
aVMy aunt lived there for 15 years while her husband was stationed there in the Navy.

p31757
aVYay!
p31758
aVA happy ending :)
p31759
aVThis needs more upvotes just as the world needs more people who take action rather than simply gripe.
p31760
aVthis gets me so fired up!
p31761
aVi love seeing good officers out there- protecting citizens.
p31762
aVand hate/loathe/despise when that shit gets twisted up by others.
p31763
aVlove that she got her job back.
p31764
aVhate that this still happens.
p31765
aVi'm glad she fought and won.
p31766
aVthat family will forever be grateful and i hope they never call the cops on their son, again.
p31767
aVworst mistake ever.

aVPeople may not always understand why, but killing cops is almost a necessity now.\u201d
p31770
aVI thought the DEA was effective at stopping like a whopping 3% of the imported drugs from the cartels...I'm glad they aren't corrupt or anything. 
p31771

aVI hope that stupid ignorant sefish cunt is made to clean every last drop of paint off she put up.
p31777
aVAt the very least she should be banned from the parks for life.
p31778
aVAlso could someone near her please go key her car or spray paint some equally shitty art on her home/face.
p31779
aVIt not yours to deface.
p31780
aVIts ours to enjoy and protect for future generations.

p31791
aVOMG!!
p31792
aVSomething positive!
p31793
aVAir soft guns typically have an orange tip on them to show a distinction from real guns.
p31794
aVSeems like they may have jumped the gun here.
p31795
aVA pair of pocket pliers or a roll of black tape can make quick work of that.
p31796
aVIf someone else had torn it out of the package, who knows what had been done to it.

p31798
aV](http://i.imgur.com/NZm41lL.jpg)
p31799
aVThe same thing?
p31800
aVSo the white guy was asked to "drop the weapon" and didn't comply?
p31801
aVAlso, the article leads one to believe he was pointing it at people in the store.
p31802
aVWas whitey doing that too, or did you just instantly pull the race card without bothering to check facts?
p31803
aV[deleted]
p31804
aVArticle doesn't say that the man that was gunned down was a marine; it was "another customer" who was a "former marine".
p31805
aVCrawford, the suspect and victim, was on the phone with his mother at the time (article is written a bit confusingly).
p31806
aVAccording to the article, the events happened something like this:\u000a\u000aCrawford goes to store, hangs out in the toys &amp; games section and grabs an airsoft gun (specifically the MK-177).
p31807
aVI assume he was playing with it, pointing it at kids around the area, maybe miming gunshots as one might do when playing.
p31808
aVAnother customer--a former marine--calls the police.
p31809
aVCrawford gets a call from his mother, and while they're on the phone, the cops arrive and order him to put down the weapon and such, then she hears Crawford say "It's not real," and then the cops shot Crawford and told him to "Get on the ground.
p31810
aV" His mother, still on the phone, hears his screaming and crying.
p31811
aVI assume Crawford dies at the scene.
p31812
aVI think this can be filed under trigger-happy.
p31813
aVI'm sure the cops were nervous and frightened for their lives and such, but being a police officer means you are willingly putting yourself in a dangerous situation, in which you may very well be shot or injured.
p31814
aVAs such, a police officer should not resort to violent measures BEFORE violence presents itself.
p31815
aVThe potential and intent for violence is not enough to justify violent, preemptive action.
p31816
aVAny officer not capable of abiding by this should not be allowed anything other than a taser.
p31817
aVThey *should* be trained to deal with it, but the fact is they aren't.
p31818
aVI don't blame officers if they make actual mistakes if the system they work for didn't prepare them for it.
p31819
aVI'll blame the hell out of the system, though.
p31820
aVYou think that the officers did not make a mistake?
p31821
aVThat is just so wrong. 
p31822
aVI think that?
p31823
aVI wasn't aware.
p31824
aVThank you so much for telling me what I think.
p31825
aVSo you do think that the officers were mistaken.
p31826
aVYou just don't blame them for those mistakes.
p31827
aVGlad that we got that cleared up.
p31828
aVYour position seems illogical, though.
p31829
aVIt does not take any special training to not shoot a person, not take a genius or any bravery to not kill a man for doing nothing wrong.
p31830
aVI am confident that every police officer in the US is instructed not to shoot a person unless that person is an obvious threat that cannot be dealt with any other way - police training 101.
p31831
aVWhy would you blame anyone but the officers for the officers' mistake?
p31832
aVWhen you fear for your life, and you aren't prepared.
p31833
aVyou aren't going to be logical.
p31834
aVYou don't know how you will act until the time comes.
p31835
aVMost of the time for cops in America, it either doesn't come of comes when there is a legitimate threat and clear target.
p31836
aVBut when your life is on the line more things start to look like targets because, guess what, you don't want to die and you panic.
p31837
aVLong story short, instruction doesn't matter as much in practice.
p31838
aVSome people aren't cut out for danger, it doesn't matter what they are told beforehand.
p31839
aVThere was zero danger...... As stated above, the cops were obviously trigger-happy and should never have been allowed to be cops in the first place.
p31840
aVSo lots of blame to go around, but most of all to the crazy fearful police who shot an unarmed man for no reason.
p31841
aVNo shots fired, no-one hurt, no-one acting erratically even though the man obviously had the pellet-gun for at least several minutes.
p31842
aVI mean, the guy was on his cell-phone so his fingers were obviously not on the trigger.
p31843
aVThe cops were wrong and they should not only be blamed, they should be put in prison for murder. 
p31844
aV*manslaughter
p31845
aVThere doesn't need to be danger, the people involved need to *think* there was danger.
p31846
aVThat's what training should help.
p31847
aVPrepare people to think under stress instead of just acting.
p31848
aVYes, but...... what sane person would think that that man was dangerous?
p31849
aVA man in a store for what, 15 minutes or more?, talking on his cell-phone, holding a pellet-gun, no blood, no-one running around screaming?
p31850
aVIt makes no sense.
p31851
aVThe cops fucked-up.
p31852
aVEnd of story.
p31853
aVWhat version of this did you read?
p31854
aV&gt; customer called 911 to report 22-year-old John Crawford waving what appeared to be an AR-15 at children and others at the Beavercreek retailer.
p31855
aV&gt; \u201cThe officers gave verbal commands to the subject to drop the weapon,\u201d Evers said in a statement.
p31856
aV\u201cThe subject \u2026 was shot after failing to comply with the officers\u2019 commands.
p31857
aVSomeone calls and says a guy with is waving an AR, what are people responding going to expect?
p31858
aVThey are going to expect what they are told and that will be exacerbated by their fear.
p31859
aVA guy waving around a gun isn't what I would call totally out of the ordinary.
p31860
aVAnd what does a phone have to do with anything?
p31861
aVYou can shoot with one arm.
p31862
aVYeah, they fucked up, I'm pretty sure I said that more or less, actually.
p31863
aVBut you aren't allowed to judge unless you are in their shoes or on the jury.
p31864
aVI can and do judge those ill-trained trigger-happy cops.
p31865
aVWho gives a shit who called about what?
p31866
aVIf cops bust into your home, shoot your child holding a pellet-gun, and then respond "well we got a phone call that your child had an assault rifle" would you not judge them as incompetent fools?
p31867
aVWhether it happened in Wal-mart or in your home, those cops should go to jail.
p31868
aVIf you want to also prosecute the local police department then that is all good with me.
p31869
aVIf someone called and said an *adult* was and it wasn't in that adults home, I wouldn't too much.
p31870
aVI don't know why you came up with that other situation, since it is completely different.
p31871
aVYou can wave a gun around all you want in your own home, not in public.
p31872
aVA call about an adult is taken more seriously than a kid.
p31873
aVTry your sensationalized bullshit somewhere else.
p31874
aVAnd I don't know where you are getting this idea that I think they were competent.
p31875
aVPersonally, in my view of the world, about 75% of people are *completely incompetent* under legitimate stress.
p31876
aVIt's not the person's fault.
p31877
aVIt is the fault of whoever allows them to be in that situation, especially if they don't prepare them.
p31878
aVSo either cops need better training, or we are going to have a ton of incompetent ones.
p31879
aVUnfortunately, good training would probably see opposition by people saying they are being "militarized".
p31880
aVAnd in a sense they would be right.
p31881
aVIt would also cost a fuckton of money, so good luck with that too.
p31882
aVMy point was sensational but just to show the irrelevance of someone calling and reporting something that the cops would take immediate and lethal action because of.
p31883
aVAgain, who gives a shit who called about what?
p31884
aVI could call on you.....\u000a\u000aMy thought is that we are arguing whether the cops were mistaken, whether they were at fault.
p31885
aVI think so.
p31886
aVYou seemed to say that it was not their fault, that it was their lack of training so you blame the system (that is what you posted).
p31887
aVSo to be clear, while I also blame the system, I blame the stupid-ass cops who could not see that a man was playing with a non-lethal toy gun, talking on a phone, no harm had occurred or was happening, and they still shot the man fatally.
p31888
aVYou seem to want to defend the cops involved and blame their instructors.
p31889
aVI don't understand that.
p31890
aVEven you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.
p31891
aVIt's irrelevant until you are told someone is very dangerous and *you* are the one who has to deal with them.
p31892
aVThen it's pretty relevant.
p31893
aVWhat do you think went down?
p31894
aVThey walk calmly up to him, say "can you please put that down" and shoot him?
p31895
aVThink about it.
p31896
aVThey ran up, screamed "drop it", he didn't and shot him.
p31897
aVIt probably took 3 seconds.
p31898
aVYou don't take your time when you think you can die, trust me on that.
p31899
aV&gt; Even you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.
p31900
aVBull-fucking-shit.
p31901
aVYou have no idea how you would act, and pretending you do is terrible.
p31902
aVYou've never had your life threatened, you've never thought your actions in the next 3 seconds would determine the course of your life, your family's lives, many bystander's lives and their families.
p31903
aVAs soon as you think someone is seconds away from killing you and many others, you can have an opinion.
p31904
aVUntil then you should probably leave it to people with more experience.
p31905
aVThey probably thought they would be able to easily distinguish a threat and act accordingly as well.
p31906
aVAnd they had as much reason to believe that as you do now.
p31907
aVHow does that make you feel?
p31908
aVConfident?
p31909
aVLess so?
p31910
aVYou keep saying "if they think the situation is life-threatening" but it wasn't.
p31911
aVIt wasn't even close.
p31912
aVIt would not even seem so to any reasonable person.
p31913
aVThis is where we disagree.
p31914
aVAgain, if I called the cops and said that you, a man in a park, was brandishing a weapon, would you think it justified if the cops came and gunned you down like an animal?
p31915
aVAnd again, it makes no sense to defend these cops.
p31916
aVThey were wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.
p31917
aVJust admit it.
p31918
aVSay "the police fucked up.
p31919
aV" That is all I want and my request is reasonable.
p31920
aVBut you keep defending them.
p31921
aVYou ever hear the phrase "hindsight is 20-20"?
p31922
aVIt doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what you *think* they are.
p31923
aV&gt; Just admit it.
p31924
aVSay "the police fucked up.
p31925
aV"\u000a\u000aI think if you back up a couple comments you will find just where I said that.
p31926
aVBut I'm guessing you probably didn't read all of what I've said.
p31927
aVThat would probably be why you brought up that "not life threatening" point again when I already explained that.
p31928
aVIf that hypothetical guy in your story didn't drop the weapon, and it wasn't clearly fake, yes they would be justified in shooting him.
p31929
aVAdding the "like an animal" thing is more sensationalist bullshit just to stir people up.
p31930
aVPlease don't spread that and stick to clear facts.
p31931
aVYou're beginning to sound like a major news network.
p31932
aVYou can be wrong but not totally liable for it.
p31933
aVRecently a plane had to make a landing on a beach near me and killed a father and little girl.
p31934
aVHe was wrong but I don't blame him.
p31935
aVA court might and I'll have to respect whatever they say(since they would know more of the facts), but until then I'm not going to let hate fly.
p31936
aVIt's pretty nice being moderate in life until you know all the facts.
p31937
aVYou should try it out.
p31938
aVIt's calming.
p31939
aVYou are the one who seems to be stretching the bounds of reason.
p31940
aVThink about the situation.
p31941
aVA man called and reported possible trouble, 10 minutes later the cops arrive, they see that no-one is hurt, a man is talking on his cell-phone not shooting people.
p31942
aVThink about that for a minute and then tell me where the police were justified in shooting him.
p31943
aVAgain I ask you to put yourself in the victim's place.
p31944
aVWho gives a shit who called on whom?
p31945
aVI could call about the mayor right now - would you think it appropriate for the cops to bust into City Hall and shoot him?
p31946
aVIf the police were not justified then they are guilty of acting inappropriately and should be punished.
p31947
aVThey did not "accidentally" shoot him, they had time to assess the situation and without reason shot the man.
p31948
aVHindsight, foresight, clear sight - it is all the same.
p31949
aVWhere are you getting your insight into what happened?
p31950
aVYou seem to know pretty well, but that article wasn't exactly long and detailed.
p31951
aVIf the mayor was waving around what people thought was a gun and someone called it in, then the police arrive and he doesn't put it down I would hope they wouldn't let the fact that he is the mayor stop them from doing what they think they should.
p31952
aVWhy aren't you mad at the person who called it in?
p31953
aVIf someone tells me I might be shot I'm going to take their word for it and act with caution.
p31954
aVI think that the marine who called it in is a moron and should have known better but also think that he was justified in reporting what he thought was a criminal and dangerous situation.
p31955
aVI do not think that the police were justified in shooting the man because of that call or by anything that the man could possibly have done.
p31956
aVYou tell me if you think otherwise.
p31957
aVWhat could this victim possibly have been doing, what could have the cops seen, what scenario was unfolding, that would justify shooting him?
p31958
aVAgain, there had to be at least a few minutes between the call and the arrival of the cops.
p31959
aVThey saw no bullets fired, no blood, no screaming people...... just a guy with a (pellet-)gun talking on a cell-phone.
p31960
aVShould the cops have arrived because of the call?
p31961
aVSure.
p31962
aVActed cautiously?
p31963
aVOf course!
p31964
aVShot the man?
p31965
aVNO!
p31966
aVYou're problem is that they acted irrationally?
p31967
aVGreat.
p31968
aVNow go put your life in perceived risk and see if you act rationally.
p31969
aVWhat could he have been doing?
p31970
aVWell, I'm assuming standing there holding what looked like a gun and not dropping it when told.
p31971
aVThere isn't much you can do between the time someone aims and they fire.
p31972
aVIt doesn't matter what they saw, it matters what they perceived, and they perceived a threat according to the official story.
p31973
aVYou want to know the thought process of someone who expects to be shot?
p31974
aVHere it is, it's pretty simple.
p31975
aV"Oh shit, looks like gun!
p31976
aV" *pull trigger*.
p31977
aVNo thinking involved.
p31978
aVEven people trained for combat don't think in the moment.
p31979
aVYou act on instinct.
p31980
aVThinking comes later, you don't have time for that now.
p31981
aVYou know another reason why I'm not judging harshly?
p31982
aVBecause I know I don't know the facts.
p31983
aVWhat time did this occur?
p31984
aVWas the store crowded?
p31985
aVWas is business as usual?
p31986
aVI'd like to think it wasn't crowded at the time.
p31987
aVMost cases of "guy with gun" don't involve blood and casings everywhere, actually.
p31988
aVPeople run and people suck at shooting.
p31989
aVIf I was arriving I would think that, unless it was crowded, people ran away and stayed away and the guy was hold up inside.
p31990
aVDid the guy who called tell the employees?
p31991
aVDid he tell other people?
p31992
aVDid people leave while completely avoiding the victim thinking there was a problem?
p31993
aVI would.
p31994
aVAnd what makes you think nobody else thought there was a problem?
p31995
aVIf these guys walked in and there were dozens of shoppers going about their business that's one thing.
p31996
aVBut I have no reason to believe that is true any more than I have reason to believe the alternative.
p31997
aVAnd you keep bringing up the cell phone like it makes him look less threatening or something.
p31998
aVWhy?
p31999
aVIf they shot him after seeing all the evidence you are assuming was there, they did it because they wanted to kill someone.
p32000
aVNobody is as dumb as you are thinking these guys are.
p32001
aVThey either acted out of fear or malice.
p32002
aVAnd you shouldn't punish someone acting out of fear and you can't determine malice without an investigation in this country.
p32003
aVYou could get these guys for manslaughter, now that I think of it, but I'm not on the jury so it doesn't matter what I think.
p32004
aVMany minutes in between report and police arrival.
p32005
aVStore was not in chaos, no blood or screaming.
p32006
aVIf the man had a cellphone then only one hand was holding a rifle.
p32007
aVI agree that the cops acted out of fear - that was wrong.
p32008
aVI stand by my assertion that the cops made a mistake and are guilty of manslaughter.
p32009
aVWhere are you getting that information?
p32010
aVAnd in what world can you not operate a rifle with one hand?
p32011
aVI mean, it wasn't bolt action.
p32012
aV&gt; Another customer, 37-year-old Angela Williams, suffered a medical emergency during the incident and died a short time later at an area hospital.
p32013
aVprobably lead poisoning. 
p32014
aVCannot view without Facebook account.

p32017
aVShitstorm begins
p32018
aVI don't feel like Mcconnell's 20 minute statement is doing this situation any favors. 
p32019
aVCan you link that?
p32020
aVIt was pretty much required.
p32021
aVNobody who was interested in this knows what the fuck a grand jury is.
p32022
aVI wonder if there will be any uproar or rioting.
p32023
aVThe last thing needed is another situation to get out of control.
p32024
aVLet's hope the time passed has cooled the tempers a bit.
p32025
aVWas there some sort of obligation, legal or otherwise, to announce this during the evening or did just nobody think this through?
p32026
aVWhat's next?
p32027
aVProbably not all that much.
p32028
aVA civil  trial maybe.
p32029
aVMaybe a burning car. 
p32030
aVCivil trial is off the books in a self-defense dismissal.
p32031
aVIn almost every state with self-defense laws, the defender is protected from civil litigation.
p32032
aVThe police and the officer also have sovereign immunity in this case as no foul play was suspected.
p32033
aVThere will be a Federal case in the works, and probably a federal grand jury will look as see if there was a civil rights violation and if the law was followed as this case was brought before the county grand jury.  
p32034
aVAnigGamor is familiar with judicial systems hierarchy.
p32035
aVImpressive. 
p32036
aVI hope it's darren Wilson's car and he's in it alive.
p32037
aVWe already knew this would be the outcome.
p32038
aV#justicefortrayvon didn't work either 
p32039
aVA lot of those protesters didn't look like they were from Ferguson.
p32040
aVThe moment it was determined at the time of the shooting that a young black man was killed by a white officer, today's grand jury verdict was pretty much a foregone conclusion.
p32041
aV(I'm not saying this particular verdict is wrong - I don't know if it is or not.
p32042
aV) Given all the deaths of seemingly innocent people at the hands of police without any negative consequences to police, I wonder exactly what laws an officer would have to break in order to be indicted for murder after killing a young black man.
p32043
aVIt's beginning to seem like there aren't any laws police can break that will definitely result in indictments. 
p32044
aVThat's fucked up.
p32045
aVThis is all so fucked up.
p32046
aVRacism, goddamn alive and well.
p32047
aVI don't know how to put it other than say it's so fucked up.
p32048
aVThis comment is straight up racism.
p32049
aVCompletely without any logic, and looking for a verdict solely based on the race of the parties involved.
p32050
aVHave faith in the justice system, or get involved with politics to change it.
p32051
aVQuit looking for racially influenced judgements.

aVIt's like the young guy that goes to confession and tells the priest that he has been sleeping with twin sisters who are members of the congregation.
p32061
aVThe priest tells him to say three Hail Mary's and to stop doing it.
p32062
aVThe young guy says he does not want forgiveness and the priest asks him why he told him about it.

aVFuck, I should have gone to school in Louisiana.. 
p32070
aV[deleted]
p32071
aVIt's because everyone who was ever a 16 year old guy knows that's bullshit.
p32072
aVSex with with two hot blond teachers doesn't give teenage me anything but a lifetimes worth of memory boners.
p32073
aV&gt;Sex with with two hot blond teachers doesn't give teenage me anything but a lifetimes worth of memory boners.
p32074
aVFACT!
p32075
aVThat's jerk off material for decades.
p32076
aVI still to this day remember my first threesome and it was far longer ago than I care to admit.
p32077
aVBut yeah, reverse this and those (male) teachers would be strung up in the streets by a mob if they gang banged a 16 y/o girl.
p32078
aVDouble standards.
p32079
aVSociety is full of them.
p32080
aVEDIT: I meant material for the boy who did it.
p32081
aVNot for me or us.
p32082
aVI read my comment and realized it could have been taken the wrong way
p32083
aVAnd never having been a 16 year old girl I can't say she isn't mentally/emotionally harmed by such an event.
p32084
aVAsk someone who used to be one.
p32085
aVAnd maybe two adult women COULD harm a boy's psyche doing this if they wanted to.
p32086
aVOdds are though if he is harmed by it, it will be because of guilt for getting them in trouble.
p32087
aVAnd how can we we legally and morally say this is okay for boys but jail time if you do it to girls?
p32088
aVI guess we can start by not pretending that it would not be awesome to find yourself in what would be considered an unrealistic fantasy porn clip. 
p32089
aVHow do you think he's going to be "twisted up"?
p32090
aVIt's not like 16 year old kids don't have sex anyway, this was just with older people who, for all intents and purposes, look kind of like highschool girls.
p32091
aVHeck, the one chick was 23.
p32092
aVIn two more years would you be complaining about an 18 year old being "twisted up" after sleeping with a 25 year old?
p32093
aVIt's not like he's a ten year old child.\u000a\u000a
p32094
aV&gt; just with older people\u000a\u000aThe problem is they are teachers - in position of authority over the students.
p32095
aVIANAL, but i think in some places that means there can't legally be consent.
p32096
aVYou are wrong on so many levels, he will be telling this story in the retirement home one days with a huge grin on his face.
p32097
aVI hope the kid turns out alright.
p32098
aVIt's easy as hell to make jokes, and frankly, if it doesn't effect him negatively, rock-on, guy.
p32099
aVBut this could very well ruin his life.
p32100
aVDamn.
p32101
aVHeavy stuff.
p32102
aVMeh.
p32103
aVThe kid is 16.
p32104
aVMost kids are fucking at 16 (or wish they were).
p32105
aVGoing to jail for 17 years for something so arbitrary is beyond stupid.
p32106
aVAnd yes I would say the same thing If it was a female student and male teachers.. as long as she is a willing participant.
p32107
aVThe problem is that the teachers are in a position of authority over the students, muddying the fact that of whether or not they are willing participants.

aVYou want him to change your ass?

aVI'll excuse myself now.
p32113
aVNo one, EVEN a criminal deserves to get shot multiple times in the back for running away.
p32114
aVI don't care what his rap sheet says, chase him down and do your job.
p32115
aVAnd for the record, my dad was a cop and I have huge respect for the good ones, which this man is not.
p32116
aVI just think it's great that the department is not letting this guy hide behind his badge while they conduct an "internal investigation.
p32117
aV"\u000a\u000aNope, no special treatment.
p32118
aVYou fucked up, you pay the price.

aVRespect to the chief.
p32120
aVI like to believe it's because that is the right thing to do, but In all honestly it's only cause it was all caught on camera.
p32121
aVThat's why I think we need body cameras, the good cops won't care and fuck the bad ones.

aVThere is clear video evidence of the officer shooting the victim in the back as he is running away...
p32125
aV&gt;Scott allegedly gained control of the Taser to use it against the officer who then fired his service weapon at the suspect.
p32126
aVDid you watch the video?
p32127
aVNo problem giving the officer the benefit of the doubt but there is video evidence showing what happened.
p32128
aVAnd in this case it shows him very obviously murdering a man who is no threat.
p32129
aVMost of the "witnesses" who claimed that Brown was just being so innocent are those local neighbors that hate police and are trying to stick up for one of their own.
p32130
aVThe MAN was a thug, he just committed strong arm robbery.
p32131
aVHe is a known thug.
p32132
aVHE violently attacked a police officer.
p32133
aVYou can't play with fire and then get pissed if you get burned.

aVRace is only brought in because people love to play that card so they can stir up drama and/or go steal from stores and burn down a town.

p32138
aVIf Michael Brown would have done that he would be alive today. 
p32139
aVWhy is there not a shoot to kill policy being used against the rioters? 
p32140
aVWhy the down votes?

aVThey're a risk to human life. 
p32142
aVSounds far from a 100% sure scenario.
p32143
aVThat is what a jury is meant to sort out, not a grand jury.
p32144
aVA grand jury is meant to determine whether there is probable cause for the charge, not determine whether it was a "100% sure scenario.
p32145
aV"
aVThe grand jury seems to have decided that this scenario of what happened is 100%.

aVEven [The National Bar Association is questioning](http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b493e6c4d31beda32fdaf8e2d&amp;id=73514e334b) how the Grand Jury, considering the evidence before them, could reach the conclusion that Darren Wilson should not be indicted and tried for the shooting death of Michael Brown.
p32147
aV&gt;The National Bar Association was founded in 1925 and is the nation's oldest and largest national network of predominantly African-American attorneys and judges\u000a\u000aYep, no racial bias there.
p32148
aVYou don't know what the Bar Association is, do you?
p32149
aVlol.
p32150
aVI think you're the one who seems to be confused.
p32151
aVThe [American Bar Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association) is the national association of lawyers which establishes the code of ethics for attornies and the criteria for the testing of law students.
p32152
aVThe [National Bar Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bar_Association) is a fraternity of black lawyers and judges.
p32153
aVThat the National Bar Association is suspicious of the findings should not surprise you.
p32154
aVThe press release you linked (which was written by the NBA themselves) intentionally avoids making a distinction between the ABA and the NBA, likely in an attempt to stir outrage by making people think that the ethical overseer of lawyers everywhere thinks that there should have been an indictment.
p32155
aVWhat should have given it away to you, had you actually read the entire release, is that the NBA clearly takes a position that "justice" is an indictment and not a decision made based on study of  evidence.
p32156
aVThe ABA would not take sides on a case, nor would they publish a press release in favor of one side versus another.
p32157
aVDo you?
p32158
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bar_Association   It's original founding name is the "Negro Bar Association", a professional association for black law practitioners.
p32159
aVYou're confusing the NBA with an actual government mandated bar association http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association  Those aren't national, they are state by state in the US.
p32160
aVEDIT: The ABA exists too, nationally, but is not an association attorney's are required to join in their stats afaik.

aVI guess life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness isn't the US main goals anymore.
p32170
aVI guess 1 our of 3 (pursuit of happiness) is still ok...but the other two would be nice to get back.
p32171
aVThe goal of the average US citizen is to die with a roof over their heads nowadays.
p32172
aVWhere have you been?
p32173
aVThere need to be riots over this too!
p32174
aVMost the water in Montana is shit anyway.

aVThey know who the kids were that did this, or I assume at least the victim does as they go to the same school, no?

aVPuts some perspective on "cyberbullying" when you read about real bullying.
p32177
aVIn several of my various job titles (none of them police related but dealing with potentially hostile people) I have been trained on responding to various situations.
p32178
aV(I know, kinda vague but bound by confidentiality agreements and such).
p32179
aVOne of the training sessions that we do is with a hostile person wielding a knife.
p32180
aVWhat I took away from the session is never let someone that intends to harm you within about 20 feet.
p32181
aVBy the time you can react to the persons movements (person makes move towards me, do I shoot?
p32182
aV) you could already have multiple wounds from the attacker.
p32183
aVIn my professional opinion, this is an open and close case in terms of was it justified.
p32184
aVThe officers lives were in clear danger (the attacker was about 10 feet away by my quick calculations).
p32185
aVI saw a good post on another thread about this saying that although the shooting was justified, the police were mistaken to pull their car that close, narrowing the time to talk the suspect down.
p32186
aV&gt;In my professional opinion, this is an open and close case in terms of was it justified\u000a\u000aAgreed.
p32187
aVThe two shots they put into him on the ground could use some explanation, though.
p32188
aVYou shoot to eliminate a threat.
p32189
aVThat means you shoot until you are certain that the threat is eliminated.
p32190
aVAs I was taught in my Concealed-Carry Class, "No Collateral=No Overkill".
p32191
aVIt doesn't matter if someone get hit with One bullet or One Hundred, the end result should be the same. 
p32192
aVYou shoot to eliminate the immediate threat; while hitting them once or ten times is fine, once someone is lying on the ground no longer advancing on you, they're no longer an immediate threat (subject of course to them not pulling out a gun, or otherwise missing the hint that now might be time to give it a rest).
p32193
aVIf you keep shooting once they're on the ground, it starts to look like you're shooting not to stop, but to kill, which is frowned upon.
p32194
aVWhy would they just pull up and get out of the car guns blazing if they expected him to cause them harm?
p32195
aVThey made no effort to disengage.
p32196
aVHe had his hand in his pocket before the car parks.
p32197
aVThe police were justified in drawing their guns at that point.
p32198
aVIn this case it was a knife but it could have easily been a gun and he could have fired as they got out of the car.
p32199
aVTL;DR:  keep your hands out of your pockets when talking to the police.  
p32200
aVI changed the title because I thought it was a little biased.
p32201
aVWhile it's true the guy didn't attack the officers using an overhand grip on the knife, it's very clear he was going to keep advancing til they opened fire, they let him get very close.
p32202
aVSuicide by cop.
p32203
aV**According to the rachael maddow show, both officers had tazers.
p32204
aV**
p32205
aVSo, they had Tasers.
p32206
aVTasers are inaccurate and unreliable.
p32207
aVYou cannot use a taser until a person is within 16 feet from you.
p32208
aVYou are not supposed to let a person with a bladed weapon within 20-25 feet of you.
p32209
aV(Sorry I cannot recall the exact number.
p32210
aV)\u000a\u000aI got all of the info above from CNN, who had an expert on and then interviewed multiple other people, none of whom contradicted the CNN expert.
p32211
aVEdit: punctuation
p32212
aVIf you tazer him, and it doesn't work PERFECTLY, you are likely dead or seriously wounded.
p32213
aVBut hey, it's easy to tell the cops what to do from the privacy of your computer desk, right?
p32214
aVI didn't tell anyone to do anything, I am simply stating the fact that they both had tazers.
p32215
aVThese cops had options.
p32216
aVThey didn't have to kill him. 
p32217
aVThey did have options.
p32218
aVThey could have yelled at him to drop the weapon repeatedly.
p32219
aVThey could have given him ample chances to raise his hands in the air.
p32220
aVThey could have even been unbelievably restrained and allow a man wielding a knife to get within one second away from stabbing range before finally deciding to use lethal force.
p32221
aVWait, just watched the video.
p32222
aVThey did all of those things.
p32223
aVTo use 20/20 hindsight and yell about a taser or something is pretty ignorant, and unfair, frankly.
p32224
aVA lot of Monday morning Quarterbacks around here.
p32225
aV:\u005c
p32226
aVSuicide by cop is a common thing, for which I'm sure there is training to avoid.
p32227
aVThis incident speaks to the fact that the police are not members of this community.
p32228
aVThis guy was known to be mentally ill.
p32229
aVThe police were the targets of his behavior.
p32230
aVThe could have stepped back to the other side of the car.
p32231
aVThey could have shot his legs.
p32232
aVThey could have tazed him.
p32233
aVThey could have put their weapons up and deescalated the situation since the man was positive they were going to shoot him.
p32234
aVThere were many other folks around.
p32235
aVThe man made no motion of intent towards any of them.
p32236
aVHe was fixed on the cops.
p32237
aVThis gives the cops options since they didn't need to be as concerned about the safety of other folks around.
p32238
aVHis hands were at his side, yet the police report claims he had an overhand grip.
p32239
aVWhy would those details be changed if the cops felt they had done the right thing?
p32240
aVHow many bullets did they put in that guy?
p32241
aVYou're going to tell me each round fired was necessary to take down a mentally ill man who was obviously in an agitated state?
p32242
aVThis incident speaks to the over-equipment and lack of training of cops around the St. Louis area. 
p32243
aVYou make it patently obvious that you have no idea what you're talking about.
p32244
aV&gt;The could have stepped back to the other side of the car.
p32245
aVBacking away from an armed man/turning around to see where you're going...neither are good ideas.
p32246
aV&gt;They could have shot his legs.
p32247
aVI'm going to take a stab in the dark and say you're not too familiar with semi-automatic handguns.
p32248
aVShooting a small, moving target (like a leg or an arm) is not as easy as those movies you watch make it seem.
p32249
aVThis is an extremely unrealistic idea.
p32250
aV&gt;They could have tazed him.
p32251
aVLet me walk you through the possible scenarios.
p32252
aVFirst off, they would have to decide who was going to holster their gun and pull their tazer.
p32253
aVThey'd probably have to do this by just yelling at each other, meaning he would know what they were doing.
p32254
aVThen the cop would have to holster his weapon, unholster his tazer, fire its one fairly inaccurate round that may or may not incapacitate the subject...all while hoping he didn't get a knife in his throat at any point during his actions.
p32255
aV&gt;They could have put their weapons up and deescalated the situation since the man was positive they were going to shoot him.
p32256
aV...these are literally the dumbest words I've ever seen put together in a sentence.
p32257
aVI'm not going to explain this one.
p32258
aV&gt;How many bullets did they put in that guy?
p32259
aVDo you know what a life or death adrenaline rush feels like?
p32260
aVI guarantee neither one of those cops could accurately recall how many shots they fired.
p32261
aVThey probably couldn't accurately recall a lot of things because their eyes should have been completely fixed on the hand holding the knife.
p32262
aVTL;DR:  Your arguments are shitty and if you replaced the cops in this video you'd probably be dead.
p32263
aVOr they could have been stabbed to death?
p32264
aVThis seems to have been a good time to use a Taser, as pointed out.
p32265
aVBut not all cops have them.
p32266
aVCan anybody confirm that these officers actually had Tasers, and declined to use them?  
p32267
aVThe taser has one shot.
p32268
aVHad the closest officer used one, and it didn't work (hit clothes, misfired, missed, flat out not stopped the guy) he would have been stabbed.
p32269
aVI'm watching rachael maddow, they contacted the department, both officers had tazers.
p32270
aVIrrelevant.
p32271
aVCops are not trained to shoot at ankles or taze.
p32272
aVThey are trained first and for most to protect their own lives.
p32273
aVThen the public at large.
p32274
aVThey don't distinguish between cold weapons and hot weapons.
p32275
aVWhat I saw in this clip is a deranged man yelling for the cops to shoot him.
p32276
aVI didn't really see a knife but he did advance towards them in an aggressive manner and they reacted to their training.
p32277
aVThat said, the issue we need to address is with training police officers to shoot at the knees or other non lethal location to subdue the assailant if they advance if that assailant does not have a hot weapon.
p32278
aVIf they keep advancing, mortally wound them.
p32279
aVIf assailant has a hot weapon shoot for the bullseye. \u000a\u000a
p32280
aV&gt;That said, the issue we need to address is with training police officers to shoot at the knees or other non lethal location to subdue the assailant if they advance if that assailant does not have a hot weapon\u000a\u000aDo you know how many people in the world could consistently make a shot like that?
p32281
aVA shot on a arm/leg while that limb is moving, while they are under extreme stress and fearing for their lives?
p32282
aVI am certain it is less than 10.
p32283
aVYou expect the entire US police force to be held to that standard?
p32284
aVRidiculous.
p32285
aVNotice how the cop jumped out of the car and just shot.
p32286
aVIt's called murder folks.
p32287
aVI remember when cops were part of the community not the enemy of the people.
p32288
aVTimes sure have changed.
p32289
aVIf you think you saw a cop jump out of the car and just shoot, you are delusional.
p32290
aVBoth cops were out of the car at 1:25, and the shooting didn't start until 1:40.
p32291
aVIf you bother to watch or listen, you will see that during those 15 seconds, both officers shouted an order to stop what he was doing, and both told him "drop it" and "drop the gun".
p32292
aVDuring that time, the "victim" had enough time to approach them twice and yell "Shoot me, Shoot me!
p32293
aVShoot me Now!
p32294
aV" and brandish what they understood to be a gun or unknown weapon.
p32295
aVThey showed considerable restraint in not shooting him in the first 4 seconds he approached them while showing a weapon.
p32296
aVAt any time, he could have said "ok" or "yes, sir" or, "I'm co-operating" and dropped the knife and stopped rushing them, and he would have lived without injury.
p32297
aVWhy do the cops owe it to him to risk their own lives by giving some random screaming maniac the chance to attack them?
p32298
aVI would prefer that he be tazed...but did they have tazers?
p32299
aVIf they did, did they have time to holster their guns and take out and aim a tazer before this unknown attacker had time to pull a trigger or run 5 feet and stab them?
p32300
aVSo what is your theory?
p32301
aVIs it that they see a black man and they immediately think "Here's our chance to kill one?
p32302
aV"  Why, then, did the 5-10 other black people holding up phones and some shouting things at them not get threatened with weapons or killed?   \u000a
p32303
aVThank you!
p32304
aVI was beginning to think I was crazy for seeing what I thought was the logical turn of events.
p32305
aVSome of these comments are just so far biased, it's concerning.
p32306
aVI am all for shedding light on police brutality or corruption, but this one just doesn't look like that to me.
p32307
aVOh of course.
p32308
aVWhy should we expect the protectors of our civil society to treat someone like a human being?
p32309
aVLet's just jump out of our car and act like there's a rabid dog that needs put down. 
p32310
aVThey treated everyone on that scene like a human being.
p32311
aVEveryone who didn't make themselves appear to be a threat was left alone.
p32312
aVEveryone who didn't charge the police screaming and holding a weapon was never threatened in any way.
p32313
aVThis one person clearly set up a situation that forced the police into a conflict with him, and then he gave them no choice but defend themselves.
p32314
aVHow can you look at that and blame the two people who showed up and did their job as commanded and trained?
p32315
aVOh I dunno, maybe because they came flying around the corner like Super Troopers and blew a guy's brains out?
p32316
aVYou're telling me THIS is the best way to diffuse a situation?
p32317
aVOut of all the ways in all the countries of the world that officers are trained, THIS is the best thing to tech them?
p32318
aVI would genuinely love to hear how you would have handled this situation.
p32319
aVSo, when somebody calls the police to respond to an armed robbery, you don't think they should rush?
p32320
aVAnd again I don't think I need to repeat my entire first post on this point, but they didn't just fly around the corner and blow somebody's brains out.
p32321
aVIf you really think that's what you saw, either you didn't really watch the video or you're delusional.
p32322
aVYou're only seeing your own hatred and preconceptions, and not  acknowledging anything that actually happened.
p32323
aVLet me guess...you are white and have never been to the ghetto.
p32324
aVLet me guess\u2026 You disagree with me but can't think of a single reasonable thing to say that contradicts anything I said above.
p32325
aVTherefore, your only recourse is to try to guess my biography and play the race card if applicable.
p32326
aVI don't think there is any reason for me to help you do that.
p32327
aVYep pretty much, I love you!
p32328
aVI didn't see it that way, looks like they tried to talk him down and then he walked into them, they let him get a lot closer than I think most would have.
p32329
aVTalk him down?
p32330
aVThey had guns drawn as they got out of the car.
p32331
aVThey force multiplied his ass, they didn't attempt to deescalate the situation at all.
p32332
aVYou can hear in his voice that he knew he was dead.
p32333
aVThat's why he shouted "Shoot me"
p32334
aV&gt; You can hear in his voice that he knew he was dead.
p32335
aVThat's why he shouted "Shoot me"\u000a\u000aHe robbed a store at knife-point, and then hung around for the cops to show up.
p32336
aVWhen they  finally did, he approached them and told them repeatedly to shoot him.
p32337
aVWhen that didn't work, he backed up and tried it again.
p32338
aVThis was *clearly* suicide by cop.
p32339
aVThat's what he *wanted*.
p32340
aVNow maybe the officers had other options.
p32341
aVI'm very surprised he wasn't tazed.
p32342
aVBut he wasn't scared that they would shoot him.
p32343
aVThat's what he was there for.
p32344
aVAre you actually suggesting that they do not have their weapons drawn when pulling up on an armed suspect? 
p32345
aVIs he gonna throw the knife thirty feet at them like a Damn ninja? 
p32346
aVNo, he could charge them and close 15 feet in 2 seconds.
p32347
aVIs that not enough?
p32348
aVAlso, they don't know if he has a firearm either.
p32349
aVSaying "sir, we see that you are wielding a knife, could you please put it on the ground?
p32350
aV" is not controlling the situation.
p32351
aVMaking him drop the knife and get on the ground at a safe distance is.
p32352
aVAnyone who says different is just doing it from the unfair position of knowing all the facts NOW since they have reviewed the video, and also the ignorant viewpoint that cops should be ninjas and disarm the guy, or risking a knife to the neck to try and use a taser.
p32353
aVThey do not meet lethal force with non lethal force. 
p32354
aV[deleted]
p32355
aV&gt; cops are trained in hand-to-hand combat for situations such as these\u000a\u000aNo they are not.
p32356
aVThey are not superheroes.
p32357
aVIt is not their job to try to wrestle a knife away from someone in a situation like this.
p32358
aVThat is insane to think.\u000a\u000a
p32359
aVYou want to go hand to hand with someone carrying a knife?
p32360
aVGood luck dude
p32361
aVIf they had a taser absolutely, not all cops have them though.
p32362
aVSo if they did have them, and between the two of them, neither used them.
p32363
aVWouldn't this be something that would upset a community, over time?
p32364
aVWhat will happen to the officers, if and when they are found to have them? 
p32365
aV&gt; I'm watching rachael maddow, they contacted the department, both officers had tazers.\u000a\u000a
p32366
aVI would be upset if they had them and didn't use them in that situation, but I'm not going to get upset over a hypothetical.
p32367
aVThe officers are not supposed to meet lethal force with non lethal force.
p32368
aVTasers are not the magic "sleeping dart" like they are in video games.
p32369
aVThey are great for controlling situations with non lethal force, but had the shot missed, or not worked, the officer would be dead here.
p32370
aVThat officer could have been more defensive and immediately moved behind the car.
p32371
aVOne could attempt a taser while the other one had a gun as a backup.
p32372
aVBefore people say \u201dhindsight is always 20/20", let's remember that these are meant to be trained professionals.
p32373
aVMany police forces in the world use no guns at all.
p32374
aVThis shows that our police forces (in many cases) aren't worried about the non-lethal option.
p32375
aVThat's a serious problem.
p32376
aVThey are trained, but they are also not Batman.
p32377
aVRemember that.
p32378
aVThey are not action movie stars, they are Police Officers dealing with an enraged, erratic criminal holding a knife and walking aggressively towards them.
p32379
aVThey waited until he got one second from stabbing range.
p32380
aVThis incident left absolutely no room for putting their guns away and talking calmly with the guy.
p32381
aVThey didn't know if he was on drugs.
p32382
aVThey didn't know if he had a gun in his pocket.
p32383
aVOne cop gets within range to use a taser, then the shot misfires, or hits his clothes, or misses altogether, then what?
p32384
aVHe is within stabbing range, and the other officer doesn't have a clear shot.
p32385
aVNow you have one officer stabbed to death, and a suspect shot to death, and for what?
p32386
aVBecause the man armed with a deadly weapon screaming SHOOT ME SHOOT ME and trying to kill cops *maybe* deserved to be tried?
p32387
aVIt's absurd.
p32388
aVIt's almost as if people would only be satisfied if the cop waited the the blade to slip into his ribcage before finally saying "okay, we're gonna have to shoot him now".
p32389
aVTIL all UK cops are Batman.
p32390
aVWe are a rarity in the civilized world to have cops with guns.
p32391
aVAll of the others deal with knifes too.
p32392
aVThese guys just took the easy way out.
p32393
aVKill him and be done with it.
p32394
aVI expect better from our police.
p32395
aVI expect better from our citizens, actually.
p32396
aVI expect better than us to assume a cop should wait until he has been stabbed or shot before finally taking lethal force against a very clearly lethally dangerous individual.
p32397
aVIf deadly force is EVER necessary, can you tell me when?
p32398
aVWell of starters, when they have a gun.
p32399
aVWith respect for life and the constitution, a cop will find themselves in many situations that call for a hero.
p32400
aVIf they don't want to do it, we can find someone who will. 
p32401
aVThey should.
p32402
aVThe US crime code states that the minimum amount of force needed should be used in situations.
p32403
aVSadly the determining factor is a cop hyped on adrenaline.
p32404
aVMaybe they need more risk management training or something.
p32405
aVThis seemed a bit premature, you know, killing over soda.
p32406
aVHyped on adrenaline.
p32407
aVPerson closing in on me carrying a knife shouting at the top of his lungs to shoot him.
p32408
aVClearly crazy.
p32409
aVClearly would take my life if he wants to take his own.
p32410
aVSave myself.
p32411
aVI have a family.
p32412
aVyep.
p32413
aVThat's all "big hyped up trigger happy idiot cop right"\u000a\u000a
p32414
aVI don't see how you got there from "hyped on adrenaline".
p32415
aVAdrenaline quickens your reaction before your body/brain actually realizes what you're doing.
p32416
aVThat's where training overtakes analytical thinking; fight or flight becomes the base reaction, and training for a law enforcement officer is to essentially neutralize a threat, thus "save myself" isn't even really a consideration--it is simply a matter of reacting in the manner you were trained.
p32417
aVIs the officer responsible for his reaction in such a situation?
p32418
aVI don't think so.
p32419
aVI blame the training, or lack thereof.
p32420
aVIf law enforcement officers are trained for non-lethal take-downs in lethal situations then that's exactly what they'll do when it's time to take action...
p32421
aVUnless the situation skews into unfamiliar territory, wherein a split-second judgement call takes priority, but is still likely to be based on said training.
p32422
aVThis is why officers that are trained to use non lethal (tazer and OC spray) have to have the item used on them.
p32423
aVSo they can have an understanding of the pain, what it can do you to you, etc.
p32424
aVComing from a person ( me) that was trained in law enforcement on the military (I'm an engineer now) pepper spray disperses people on groups better than it lays down one person.
p32425
aVSpecially if said person is aggressive.
p32426
aVMy training Involved me having to be sprayed ; defend against and attacker and handcuff the person after drawing my weapon.
p32427
aVAll the spray did to me was make me angry and more aggressive.
p32428
aVIt burnt yes; but the adrenaline from being sprayed knocks out the pain until it is over it.
p32429
aVI short.
p32430
aVPepper spraying an attacking suspect carrying a knife is the worst option in the world.
p32431
aVAlso; I would like you to try shooing a non lethal shot into a person as they charge you carrying a knife at close range.
p32432
aVIt isn't going to happen.
p32433
aVPeople are already mad at how much we spend on police.
p32434
aVYou want them shooting at the range every week ?
p32435
aVWith more advanced shooting ranges ?
p32436
aVThat's costly.\u000a
p32437
aV&gt; This seemed a bit premature, you know, killing over soda.
p32438
aVJustified or not, it was **not** over soda.
p32439
aVIt was over an armed, unstable suspect approaching cops.
p32440
aVWhether or not it was an over-reaction, or if they had other options, it was **not** about the soda.
p32441
aVI think we're seeing the results of how poorly-trained these cops are. 
p32442
aVThe minimum amount of force changes when a lethal weapon is brandished.
p32443
aV[deleted]
p32444
aVWrong incident.
p32445
aVI know it is confusing, but that was a different black man killed by white cops in St. Louis recently.  
p32446
aVAnd we wonder why people are rioting?
p32447
aVNo one is rioting over this shooting.
p32448
aVAs morbid as this sounds, this was a different black man that was killed by St. Louis police this week.  
p32449
aVNot referring to this one specifically, just the rioting in general. 
p32450
aVI hope that "officer" spends a long time in jail.
p32451
aVIt's time to stop tolerating these abuses by police, and make some examples out of the bad apples.
p32452
aVI seriously wonder how the neighbor who called 911 feels.
p32453
aVI'd feel like an ass.
p32454
aVMeh, he will move to Florida and get a raise.
p32455
aVBusinessInsider draws a very strong and unsupported conclusion - pretty much the opposite of what the research actually says.
p32456
aVI strongly suspect financial motives, especially as this study was funded by one of Australia's largest bread and bakery companies.
p32457
aVHere's the response from the editors of the journal publishing the researchers' work:\u000a\u000a&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.12782/full\u000a\u000a&gt;How does the current study tie in with the literature?
p32458
aVDespite there being ongoing debate as to whether gluten is working alone or alongside other wheat components in inducing gastro-intestinal symptoms, **the work by Peters et al.
p32459
aVsupports the existence of non-Celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), albeit in the form of an extra-intestinal manifestation.
p32460
aV** \u000a\u000a&gt;Nevertheless, this certainly opens a gateway for further research and Peters et al.
p32461
aVare to be congratulated for providing insight into this complex yet evolving clinical entity.
p32462
aVWhether NCGS is a disease of the mind or gut is food for thought, **but it is no longer a condition to be dismissed as functional** and perceived as belonging to a \u2018no-man's land\u2019.\u000a
p32463
aVI'm confused
p32464
aVAt best, this BusinessInsider.com article is an example of bad science reporting.
p32465
aVAt worst, it's a deliberate attempt to misrepresent scientific results for financial gain.
p32466
aVSome of the research in gluten science can seem contradictory and in conflict, but taken as a whole we are slowly starting to make incremental progress in understanding what it is, how it happens, and why it varies so much from person to person.
p32467
aVThanks, I am a gluten person so I'm always interested in these studies. 
p32468
aVSo... What is it?
p32469
aVThe study found no hint of a link to Physical symptoms. 
p32470
aV"Found no evidence" is a very different - and much better - statement than "thoroughly disproves.
p32471
aV"\u000a\u000aSo what is it?
p32472
aVWell, "it" isn't one thing.
p32473
aVSome people are reacting to gluten via Celiac Disease, some people seem to be reacting to other components of the wheat like the specific types of sugars, and there also seems to be at least one additional condition that is a reaction to gluten, but has more to do with psychological symptoms than digestive ones.
p32474
aVWe have more questions than answers at this point.
p32475
aVThe big question is why these things are becoming more common in first-world countries.
p32476
aVBlood samples from the 1950s show lower levels of gluten antibodies than modern blood samples.
p32477
aVCountries divided politically and economically, but not genetically, also show greater prevalence in the more modern and wealthier societies.
p32478
aVSo we're losing our ability to digest foods, and the big hypothesis now points to the microbiomes that we've been killing off with a multifront onslaught of antibiotics, antimicrobial cleaning products, and preservatives in our food.
p32479
aVAll in all, it has been a very enlightening and productive field of research, but that doesn't necessarily mean we understand it yet, either.
p32480
aVThis study referenced pretty clearly showed no link between physical symptoms and gluten.
p32481
aV(Double blind, plocebo controlled.
p32482
aVBasically gold standard for research).
p32483
aVIt would be difficult to find a better study.
p32484
aVWe know what celiac disease is and how to diagnose it.
p32485
aVThis study shows no evidence to support people claiming gluten intolerance out side of celiac disease.
p32486
aVFurther study should be done, no doubt.
p32487
aVMore data never hurts.
p32488
aVBut the picture is becoming clearer and clearer that non celiac gluten sensativity does not cause physical symptoms as far as we know today.
p32489
aVObviously people are suffering but right now i think it makes sense approach these symptons systematically and scientifically rather having people running around self diagnosing gluten senstivity when the symptoms could be coming from very different sources.
p32490
aVI would be interested to see reference for the blood test info though.
p32491
aVI had not heard that before.
p32492
aVI disagree - there was no control group, and all of the subjects experienced increasing digestive symptoms for the duration of the study.
p32493
aVThat's the reason they couldn't find a link to gluten - because everyone was getting worse the entire time, no matter which phase of the test they were on.
p32494
aVThe only exception was the first of the washout phases when all of the suspected food triggers were removed.
p32495
aVAfter that, the patients' reports of symptoms all increased with seemingly no link to what they were eating.
p32496
aVFurther, the study only selected 32 of the subjects, out of the ~120 who were self-diagnosed and willing to participate.
p32497
aVSo 3/4 of the subjects were eliminated due to a lack of testing for Celiac or because of genetic markers associated with Celiac.
p32498
aVIt's a pretty similar number to the proportion of subjects who showed symptoms in Gibson's first study, but we don't know if they would have ever qualified for a diagnosis of Celiac through villous atrophy.
p32499
aVNCGS may be a sort of "pre-Celiac" condition, and we'd certainly be better off if we could diagnose Celiacs before they reach a point of imminent starvation.
p32500
aVGibson's third study on psychological symptoms is important too, because it used the exact same subjects from the second study (the 32 who definitely didn't have Celiac markers).
p32501
aVThe data shows a pretty clear link between gluten and feelings of anxiety &amp; depression.
p32502
aVHere are some recent sources on the apparent increase in Celiac Disease.
p32503
aVIt seems it is mostly a first-world problem:\u000a\u000a[Increased prevalence and mortality in undiagnosed celiac disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362553)\u000a\u000a&gt;During 45 years of follow-up, undiagnosed CD was associated with a nearly 4-fold increased risk of death.
p32504
aVThe prevalence of undiagnosed CD seems to have increased dramatically in the United States during the past 50 years.
p32505
aV[The \u2018Hygiene hypothesis\u2019 and the sharp gradient in the incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases between Russian Karelia and Finland](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apm.12023/abstract)\u000a\u000a&gt;Recent results from Russian Karelia and Finland imply that environmental factors have greatly contributed to the increasing prevalence of immune-mediated disorders.
p32506
aVInfections, or lack of them, may indeed be strongly involved in the development of both autoimmune and allergic diseases.
p32507
aVYou know how people tell you to be careful of awful science reporting that misrepresents the actual science?
p32508
aVThis blog post is what they're talking about.
p32509
aVPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.
p32510
aVIt's hard to get a picture of exactly what the situation was here, and the police who fired the non-lethal rounds are probably primarily to blame for her injuries.
p32511
aVHowever, this statement "We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.
p32512
aV" indicates to me that she was aware of the protest activity, and probably the dangers of the "mob vs. authorities" situation in Ferguson.
p32513
aVIf my wife were pregnant, she would stay the fuck away from any situation that would even have potential for harming her or her unborn baby.
p32514
aV&gt;Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety \u2013 but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them.
p32515
aVSo, she tried to run down a police officer?
p32516
aVI hope she rots in jail.
p32517
aVShes lucky to be alive.
p32518
aV&gt;We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.
p32519
aVAnd she did just that.  
p32520
aVAnother case of "she/he was coming right at me!
p32521
aV"
aVI can't believe there are no comments on this.
p32522
aVThis story makes me sick to my stomach.
p32523
aVI feel for these kids and am so saddened at the state of our "justice" system.
p32524
aVTheir lives will be forever affected so that these police could fill an arbitrary quota.
p32525
aVWhat do you want us to say?
p32526
aVWe all hate cops, you cant trust them, when the gang guys ambush and kill a few you see no one cares.
p32527
aVWait.
p32528
aVUntil one stops your mom from getting raped or saves a baby from a burning car.

p32532
aVNext time tell him it's in the water after he drinks some. 
p32533
aV"safe to drink" =/= "should be drank"
p32534
aVThat's utterly laughable.
p32535
aVThat said, I wouldn't be surprised if the stuff actually was somewhat safe to ingest.
p32536
aVAfter all, it's meant to be used by people, to kill tiny, small bugs.
p32537
aVI'm not saying you wouldn't get sick, and it might cause some sort of horrible cancer, but I doubt this stuff is exactly the perfect suicide concoction. 
p32538
aVHaha why are you being downvoted?
p32539
aVBecause love it or hate it, Reddit is full of neckbeards. 
p32540
aV"causing some sort of horrible cancer" sounds extremely unsafe to ingest....
p32541
aVI feel that's the same as sayings cigarettes are safe to smoke.
p32542
aVIt won't kill you immediately but it might cause some sort of cancer. 
p32543
aVExactly.
p32544
aVYou can drink it, you just absolutely shouldn't unless you like vomiting all over the place and getting sick.
p32545
aVOf course, that just adds another level to Mr Lobbyist's bullshit. 
p32546
aVJust because this chemical is "safe to drink" doesn't mean that it won't taste like shit.
p32547
aVIf it truly was safe to drink, I bet it would still taste absolutely terrible, and most people would refuse to drink it even with the knowledge that it was safe. 
p32548
aVExcept why back out like that then when your company's reputation is on the line?
p32549
aVIf the statement is true, that's worth a little bad taste, right?

aVThere are many good takeaways from this, not just for educators but parents as well.
p32555
aVI'll be sure to remember this article in the future.
p32556
aVI feel that the collegiate level is already implementing many of these takeaways at various stages, but grade school definitely needs to address this.

aVWow, I'm glad she is more aware of her eye-rolling now....
p32558
aVPeople have known for a long time that the Koch brothers are a cancer on the U.S. political system and environment.
p32559
aVBut the Koch Brothers are so rich they simply don't care.

aVThey're job creators, they employ people.

aVPeople need jobs to live.

aVWikipedia articles are as easy to fake as a Rolling Stone article about mythical Koch Bros
p32593
aVOh just shutup already.
p32594
aVJeez. 
p32595
aVDon't feed the troll.

aVPlease stop lying about the Koch bros

aVplease stop sucking Koch 
p32598
aVMilitary equipment should *only* go to SWAT teams, and SWAT teams should be Federally required to pass the same training as counter insurgency teams in the US Marine corps (plus other training).
p32599
aVIn addition there should be a federal requirement that SWAT teams should be annually re-certified.
p32600
aVThat alone would diminish the specious use of such elite forces.
p32601
aVThis person understands.
p32602
aVGiving tools of war to someone with a badge who is there for civil servitude is one of the most ignorant things going on
p32603
aVThanks, you might enjoy [this link](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/14/military-veterans-see-deeply-flawed-police-response-in-ferguson/).
p32604
aVAnd for the record I am actually probably more sympathetic to the police than most redditors.
p32605
aVI have a deep respect for police.
p32606
aVMy step father is a retired assistant police chief and I've heard some really amazing stories.
p32607
aVFrom pulling over drunk drivers, hand cuffing them, but just returning them to their residence (medium town so first timers he encountered got an extra inch) with no paper trail.
p32608
aVTo jamming a police baton between some ones ribs for someone who attacked a sleeping drifter.
p32609
aVPolice play a vital and important role in any society but if you gear them up for a war zone they will act as if they are in one.
p32610
aVFerguson is a touchy subject with me for example.
p32611
aVDue to my respect for officers if one tells me to get off the road and onto the sidewalk I do so at a decent pace.
p32612
aVBut if I was a cop and someone was agitated enough to come up to my patrol car window and a struggle ensues and a shot fired.
p32613
aVBut guy gets away, only to change his mind and come back I feel non lethal should if been used at that point..
p32614
aVBut I've never been in that situation.
p32615
aVBut these stories and videos of high fiving each other after shooting a homeless man, shooting an elderly man, shooting a naked man is just disgusting.
p32616
aVI don't get the mentality and the only thing that I can imagine is the fact the a young individual joins these law enforcement departments and given these feats of engineering that were designed for one purpose and it goes straight to their head.  \u000a
p32617
aVAnother false-flag.
p32618
aVThis operation is contrary to the stated goals and philosophy of Anonymous. 
p32619
aVI thought the whole concept of "Anonymous" was just that - no hierarchy, no organization, no stated goals or philosophy, just an amorphous and unseeable mass of people acting in whatever general direction they choose? 
p32620
aV&gt;I thought the whole concept of "Anonymous" was just that - no hierarchy, no organization, no stated goals or philosophy, just an amorphous and unseeable mass of people acting in whatever general direction they choose?
p32621
aVYou're not wrong, the only thing that truly unites Anonymous is the common belief in the power of anonymity and free speech.
p32622
aVThat an Anon would support the de-masking or social media suppression of another person or group, even a racist one (as if some Anons aren't seriously racist) just smacks of contradiction. 
p32623
aVI only see a contradiction when it's taken at face value.
p32624
aVYou said yourself that they believe in *the power* of free speech and anonymity, not *the righteousness* of it or people's right to it (and while there has been a theme of them fighting for free speech, again, anonymous is amorphous and thus can't take a solid stance on it - on the other hand we can judge they believe in the power of anonymity just by their actions).
p32625
aVIf they don't want people to hold power via anonymity for doing bad things like the KKK presumably does, then they are consistent in attacking that anonymity.
p32626
aVI think under a fair interpretation of their actions, their actions are consistent. 
p32627
aV&gt;anonymous is amorphous and thus can't take a solid stance\u000a\u000aThat's the problem, and why I stopped participating in Anonymous operations soon after Project Chanology.
p32628
aVThere's no way to tell if a task or operation has been proposed by an actual Anon or someone pretending to be an Anon because there's no means of authentication and very little difference besides.
p32629
aVIt falls upon the individual to decide for themselves, hence the meme "[Not Your Personal Army](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-is-not-your-personal-army)".
p32630
aV\u005c#OpKKK seems to be one of the latter, in my opinion, simply because if this were a *chan imageboard nobody would be batting an eye at the presence of racists especially with regards to the situation in Ferguson.
p32631
aVWe're talking about a bunch of assholes that [assaulted an Epileptic forum with blinkenlights](http://www.news.com.au/technology/anonymous-attack-targets-epilepsy-sufferers/story-e6frfro0-1111115935811) for the lulz.
p32632
aVSure they occasionally find it funny to play at Social Justice Warrior for the press, doxing paedophiles on Twitter and whatnot, but their membership has a not-insignificant overlap with the KKK and the more /k/ Anons have been half-jokingly making the same veiled threats towards both the Ferguson protesters and Ferguson cops for months now.
p32633
aVI guess what I'm getting at is that the participants in \u005c#HoodsOff and \u005c#OpKKK don't represent Anonymous as a whole.
p32634
aVAt best, they're one mostly-independent tentacle of the hentai rape monster that is the collective.
p32635
aVMore likely, they're a third party that finds the benefits of slapping a Guy Fawkes mask on a press release outweighs the risk of hacking a bunch of KKK Twitter accounts without a convenient scapegoat. 
p32636
aV"Anonymous responded by \u201cdoxxing\u201d dozens of Klan members, i.e., posting their personal information and photos on line, hence the hashtag \u201c#HoodsOff.\u201d \u000a\u000a\u000aDoxxing members of a semi secret group is much more than just knocking their webpages over.
p32637
aVReddit has a huge racist community of its own.
p32638
aVFinding their main Reddit accounts should be trivial.

aVDo you really think those people are comparable to the organized, actively threatening, and within proximity members of the emergency area in Missouri of the KKK?
p32645
aVI'd argue the difference is that the people you name aren't *really* hurting people.
p32646
aVAnonymous did this in response to the KKK threatening violence in Missouri, which seems credible enough.
p32647
aVI wonder if the deputies will actually face criminal charges because they beat up a white guy.
p32648
aVDude's about to make a killing.
p32649
aVLikely punitive damages after his lawyer argues that this is just the first time the cops got caught.
p32650
aVThere are so much physical evidence of misuse of police power from all over the US, how is there not any major police reform going on?
p32651
aVIt's incredible, the proof is right here on video.
p32652
aVIndisputable proof from beginning to end. 
p32653
aVHow about just for a start we have voting weekends instead of doing it on Tuesdays during mostly work hours?
p32654
aVThat might double turn out at least, especially if the news was allowed to give out exit poll numbers Saturday night to encourage Sunday turn out.
p32655
aVTomorrow- mandatory political reeducation classes
p32656
aVI have not bothered to read the fine print, which has been the catch for drastic changes like this, but someone tell me why this is a bad idea?
p32657
aVRequire everyone, who is a citizen, to vote.
p32658
aVAt least from ages 18 to 40.
p32659
aVWorst thing that could happen is campaign commercials during sponge marathons to capture that 20yr old vote.
p32660
aVAlthough real reform could be fixed by tighter donation restrictions.\u000a
p32661
aV&amp;gt;someone tell me why this is a bad idea?
p32662
aVSimply put, because we have two parties to vote for.
p32663
aVOne loves religion and money- I don't.
p32664
aVAnd the other loves being bossy, money and blaming everyone else- I don't.
p32665
aVI shouldn't have to choose between heroin or crack simply because the dealers don't want to go out of business.
p32666
aVI cannot imagine I'm alone in this regard.
p32667
aVThere are plenty of other parties but in large part because of voter apathy the two dominant parties control almost the entirety of media coverage.
p32668
aVBut you can watch the third party debates.
p32669
aVThey are a real thing.
p32670
aVWhy aren't any of them invited to the big debates?
p32671
aVBecause we allow it to be run that way.
p32672
aVWe the people could definitely change that one part of the system by simply changing the debate formats in the right way and making them mandatory for running.
p32673
aVReally in this internet age there is no reason we are all so beholden to mass media for information on our candidates.
p32674
aVA new system is ripe for the making and we can circumvent be money issues of the old system by leveraging technology.
p32675
aVMore people voting will make it harder on the two party system.
p32676
aVMuch much harder. 
p32677
aVYou don't institute a nationwide compulsory project without dire need.
p32678
aVThere are tens of millions of personal, anecdotal reasons why this is a bad idea, because a mandatory voting requirement will command at least that many people to do something they otherwise would not have.
p32679
aVWho are you to judge how harmful this slight suspension of liberty will be when multiplied by a number with 7 zeros after it?
p32680
aVWhat good does it serve to force people who can't be bothered to vote to interrupt their business (or leisure) on a particular day and time just to express an opinion they don't consider worthy of expression?
p32681
aVEither they have a good reason not to vote, and should be left alone, or they are lazy and probably don't have an informed opinion, in which case we should be grateful they are willing to censor themselves.
p32682
aVThe only reason any Democrat is willing to discuss this is the assumption that most deadbeats would vote for them if forced, helped, or motivated to vote.
p32683
aV(Incidentally, this is the only reason any Republican is interested in cracking down on voter fraud by requiring IDs; they assume a majority of people who would be scared away are voting against them.
p32684
aV)
aVThank you for a different perspective, on phone and in between classes so can't respond justly.
p32685
aVFreedom to vote is an amazing staple to this country and thank you again for your response.
p32686
aVI'd much rather see a move where another national holiday and/or encouragement to employers to allow time off to go to the voting booth.
p32687
aVI know some actually do, but a unified expectation of that could drastically change the landscape of elections
p32688
aVOn a slightly different topic, I still don't know when and how it was apparently proven to everyone that low voter turnout is a problem for anyone in any sense.
p32689
aVCertainly, anyone on the losing side will *assume* that the voters who didn't show would have swung the balance in their favor, but this is wishful thinking and bitterness with no basis in fact.
p32690
aVThe powerful thing about living in a democracy is that you have the RIGHT to vote.
p32691
aVWhether or not you actually go to the polls, your representatives still have cause to fear that you will go to the polls if they displease you too much, and that is what keeps them in check.
p32692
aVIf you feel your representatives have failed to live up the promises of their campaign, you still retain the right to go vote them out next time.
p32693
aV..and if you do, everyone who stays home will be making your opinion count that much more.  
p32694
aVI don't see it as a freedom.
p32695
aVIt's conscription.
p32696
aVI see it as being drafted to provide my consent to the elites, and check a box for OPPRESSOR_A or OPPRESSOR_B.
p32697
aVWhich I refuse to do.
p32698
aVAaron Aaronson would win every time.
p32699
aVI don't know if it's good idea, IMHO democration is all about choice you either choose to go and vote deliberately or you don't give a fuck and you shouldn't vote on behalf some historical events etc first black president, first female president, or first alien president or whatever else stupid reason you have.
p32700
aVYou want mandatory voting?
p32701
aVDissolve the electoral college.
p32702
aVMandatory voting?!
p32703
aVI want to see the opposite in fact!
p32704
aVI feel you should have to prove that you are intellectually superior to the masses before you are given a world changing power like that to choose the leader of an entire country. 
p32705
aVIt is a good idea, in theory.
p32706
aVThere are better ways to get voter participation up though.
p32707
aVVote by mail comes to mind.
p32708
aVI have not heard a single complaint from people who have that policy instituted.
p32709
aVMandatory for illegals too right?
p32710
aVYup.
p32711
aVAnd all votes are for our glorious leader. 
p32712
aVMake it a national holiday.
p32713
aVWhen you vote you get a voucher.
p32714
aVYou turn it into your employer and you get 150% of your regular wage, compensated by the government.
p32715
aVIf you are unemployed you can include it with your taxes for a higher refund or turn it into the Treasury Department and get a check sooner. 
p32716
aVVote for me, my first act will be to increase your dog biscuit incentive for voting!
p32717
aVIt's mostly big-government liberals that love the idea of mandatory voting.
p32718
aVSo, as a compromise I offer this constitutional amendment:\u000a\u000a"No confidence" is offered as a candidate for every seat.
p32719
aVIf 51% of seats in the house or senate are taken by "no confidence", the federal government is frozen at (spending-10%) for two years, until the next congressional election and no legislative action can be undertaken.
p32720
aVLawmakers are not paid for the duration of the freeze.
p32721
aVThe capitol building is mothballed.
p32722
aVIf the Presidency is won by "no contest" the federal government is automatically disbanded and all powers returned to the states.
p32723
aV[deleted]
p32724
aVHow is not forcing people to vote a restriction?
p32725
aVWanting only citizens to vote.
p32726
aVHow terrible.
p32727
aVDon't they know that anyone should be allowed to vote here? 
p32728
aVWere the democrats able to pass this sort of legislation, I would vote against them for the remainder of my life.
p32729
aVI may be a libertarian, but I have voted for many members of the Democratic party at the state and local level.
p32730
aVI rarely consider party or campaign bullshit when voting, I look exclusively at legislative record unless we are talking about someone who's never been elected before.
p32731
aVMost likely, I would just put an empty ballot through the machine in protest of mandatory voting.
p32732
aVNothing makes me more upset than being forced to do things, to the point that I used to get in serious trouble for not doing things as a kid.
p32733
aVMaybe I'm still a 3 year old, but self determination is more important to me than anything else.
p32734
aVIf I can't succeed on my terms, I'd rather fail on my terms than succeed on someone else's.
p32735
aV[deleted]
p32736
aVAbsolutely.
p32737
aVWant to make voting easier?
p32738
aVImplement multiple ways to vote: early voting, absentee voting, whatever.
p32739
aVShit, we hire census workers to go to people's houses to count them... why can't we have a few election workers in each district drive out to people's houses to help them vote if they want to but can't get out?
p32740
aV[deleted]
p32741
aVI don't consider that a terrible idea.
p32742
aVThat settles it.
p32743
aVThis guy is a twat.

aVAnd then they sprinkled some crack on him, "open and shut case Johnson!

p32753
aVI was just trying to imagine Dave doing James Brown. 
p32754
aVYea but to be fair, who hasn't wanted to choke Chapelle.
p32755
aVI mean seriously.
p32756
aVHe left us all hanging!
p32757
aVAnd another Dave Chappele skit comes to life. 
p32758
aVOfficer that couldn't have been Dave Chappelle, he was standing on a clock in his front window masturbating with todays newspaper.
p32759
aVAnd look at this!
p32760
aVThe sick bastard planted pictures of himself all over the house!
p32761
aVLet's sprinkle some crack on him and get out of here....
p32762
aVUsed to be that black foster children were not to go to white foster homes as they would lose their cultural identity.
p32763
aVThis event shows that in fact, their cultural identity can be maintained.
p32764
aVNot at all racist.
p32765
aVUPDATE: The wording was just changed to "detained" in the article a few minutes ago.
p32766
aVThanks again fox...
p32767
aVWhat county was this in?
p32768
aVEDIT: Found it, Onslow County, NC
p32769
aVThese sound like good parents with creepy neighbors. 
p32770
aVI'm 24 and when I was younger my parents would let my brother and I do this all the time, we would walk to the video store, walk to the park, etc... We didn't have cell phones or anything and nothing ever happened to us, I really think that this is ridiculous, the kids had an expected time to return just like we always did.
p32771
aVI didn't realize this was a "thing", it was just normal for me growing up, it's not like they let them walk around on skid row in LA or something really bad. 
p32772
aVI'm kind of on the fence about this general issue.
p32773
aVFor these parents in particular, this incident proved the faults in their decision.
p32774
aVSomething happened, the children did not return, and they were completely helpless.
p32775
aVThey didn't even know where the kids were, they were just randomly walking around.
p32776
aVIf the kids had a cellphone and used it, this wouldn't seem as bad of a disaster.
p32777
aVThe kids didn't make it home on time, but didn't demand to use a phone to call home.
p32778
aVSeems like this decision was exposed as a failure in every way.
p32779
aVThe last time this happened with these parents, the son did have a cell phone I believe.
p32780
aVI remember reading about him having a necklace that held his phone so he wouldn't lose it. 
p32781
aVWhen you were ten, did you have a cell phone?
p32782
aVAnd if you didn't, were you forbidden to leave home without your parents?
p32783
aVThat is a good point.
p32784
aVI wasn't aloud out "running the streets" in town alone until I was about 13.
p32785
aVWalking about the woods was a way different story.
p32786
aVWhen I was aloud out in town, I was always required to have money to use a payphone in case something happened.
p32787
aVIn this case, I think the phone issue is a red herring.
p32788
aVThey were with the cops.
p32789
aVSurely the police had access to a phone to call their parents, even if the children didn't have a cell.
p32790
aVWhy didn't they make calling the parents and letting them know the children were there the first priority?
p32791
aVThis is a good point.
p32792
aVIt seems likely the police actively prevented them from calling their parents after the abduction.
p32793
aV[deleted]
p32794
aVGood point, thanks
p32795
aVI know this sounds like an old curmudgeon, but when I was in second grade, I walked a mile to elementary school by myself and no one ever called the police on us.
p32796
aVMy mom grew up in the 1930's in rural Minnesota.
p32797
aVShe and her older brother would walk several miles to school each day, they were 5 and 6 years old.
p32798
aVOne day a car stopped and a man saying he was an uncle tried to get them in his car.
p32799
aVWould have but each time my mom said yes my uncle said no.
p32800
aVWhen my uncle said yes my mom said no.
p32801
aVThey kept this up so long that the guy gave up, got in his car and drove off.
p32802
aVSure enough when he got to the end of the road he turned right, their house was left.
p32803
aVKidnappings were quite common during the depression as people attempted to get money from those they considered prosperous.
p32804
aVI'm afraid that this generation of children is being raised to be afraid of their shadows and that actually could make the world more dangerous for them. 
p32805
aVHaving to sign an agreement to now leave the kids alone ever seems preposterous to me.
p32806
aVThere's a major problem with the way our government works if they control our parenting along with watching our every step.
p32807
aVIt's of no surprise kids at the age of 15-17 are running away to ISIS if the parents have never let them leave their sides, I would wanna run from them as well.
p32808
aVLet the children run free!
p32809
aVReleased and sprung have two very different meanings in this context.
p32810
aVArticle title uses released, OPs title uses sprung.

p32814
aVEven with my insurance I end up paying most of the bill until I meet my deductible and I'm never quite sick enough all year to do that.

aVIf I was her I  would lawyer up and sue the shit out of that whole department for their total lack of competence. 
p32829
aV*In*competence is the word you're looking for. 
p32830
aVNo, in the context I used the word was used correctly.
p32831
aVIf I was to say lack of incompetence, it wouldn't make any sense.
p32832
aVBy definition, competence is the ability to do ones job.
p32833
aVIn contrast, incompetence is the lack of ability to to their job.
p32834
aVSo if I said "lack of incompetence", I would be saying the opposite of what I meant.
p32835
aVI'm really not trying to be a dick here, I just want you to know how to use the word correctly.
p32836
aVEdit: Some words and stuff
p32837
aVIncompetence is the word you use when you are trying to say "lack of competence", yes.
p32838
aVThere is a word for the phrase you used.
p32839
aVThat's what I'm saying.
p32840
aVEDIT: I know what the words mean.

p32845
aVThey're being downvoted for unnecessarily criticizing someone's sentence.
p32846
aVThere's more than one way to express any phrase.
p32847
aVThere's nothing unusual about saying "lack of competence" and to specifically post something to try "correcting" someone is just inane.
p32848
aVHa, no shit.
p32849
aVThanks for the pat on the back though.
p32850
aVHow much of the spaghetti O's did the cops eat before they realized it wasn't meth?
p32851
aVGiven the state of the world today, he should've known there would be consequences for joking about guns on social media, especially as a student.
p32852
aVI don't really see the police at fault, although detaining him might've been a bit much. 
p32853
aVI disagree.
p32854
aVIt was blatantly in reference to a "dinosaur" and there were no threats made to the school or a specific neighbor.
p32855
aVSo what, it's illegal to SAY "gun" for anyone under the elligible age to own a gun now?
p32856
aVNah, the US are quickly becoming a militarized state.
p32857
aVIt's bullshit and fear mongering and unfortunately the US is the best there is at brainwashing you into thinking this is the norm or even a privilege at that.
p32858
aVPeople are all 'murica this and 'murica that like it's something to be proud of these days, but frankly it's not.
p32859
aVThe healthcare system is a government scam, there's no free education, taxes go to a military to play world police, we're lacking in any kind of updated mass transit system in 90% of the cities, we have ex-military drones being used by the police to watch US citizens, every means of communication is tracked by one agency or another, it's the only god damn nation in the world still using "standard" measurements, Fahrenheit, and a 12 hour time system (AM/PM), people blow hundreds of dollars just to fly around the US and avoid our airports because of how insane we are to non-US citizens and the media has become a sensational super biased joke.
p32860
aVI'm not going to go into all of it, but a country that is supposed to represent the foundations of freedom shouldn't be taking teenage kids into custody over a joke on the internet about killing a PET DINOSAUR. 
p32861
aVIm not saying he was wrong, but imagine what that would look like if he actually was a crazy kid and shot up a school.
p32862
aVThe police knew about it, so there would be this whole thing about how the police didn't do enough.
p32863
aVThey take EVERY gun threat seriously, and they should.
p32864
aVLook at all the random school shooting sprees we've had the last few years.
p32865
aVShould we be so sensitive?
p32866
aVNo.
p32867
aVDo we have to be?
p32868
aVUnfortunately, yes.
p32869
aVIt wouldn't even surprise me to hear about another school massacre.
p32870
aVSo what if they took this kids joke too seriously?
p32871
aVLook at the world we live in.
p32872
aVWe can't expect to say 'gun' so sparingly, when so many people are getting shot. 
p32873
aVPlease...travel.

aVCondescending comment aimed at your intelligence. 
p32875
aVHow did the officer end up in the hospital?
p32876
aVDid he pummel himself in the face?
p32877
aVhow about lets wait until all the information is gathered and examined
p32878
aVI wonder how many more "witnesses" will step forward.
p32879
aVThese days if they don't have cell phone video evidence, we know they didn't see shit.

p32886
aVpoor guy!
p32887
aVI thought it was a Flash Back Friday thing when I saw it this morning.
p32888
aVGood that they are saying it.
p32889
aVNow lets see them back up those words.
p32890
aVThat's awesome, it looks like a small city.
p32891
aVIt looks like it would take an awful lot of effort to keep the panels clean.
p32892
aVI'm not sure, sounds like a job for a robot or at least something highly automated. 
p32893
aVI mean, built in water jets would make it pretty easy but that area doesn't look to be overflowing with water...\u000a\u000aThen again if it's supplying 180K homes with electricity maybe it's worth 100 FT employees just cleaning the panels every day.
p32894
aVI'm sure it's something they have thought through.
p32895
aVYou could probably do it with compressed air and some kind of golf cart type vehicle and use very few people.
p32896
aVI went to school with a kid about 35 years ago that didn't stand for the pledge (In Texas).
p32897
aVWasn't a problem then.
p32898
aVHow is this a problem NOW?\u000a
p32899
aVWhen I was in school a lot of people didn't stand,  self included, not out of protest, but of being a lazy high school students.
p32900
aVAnd im talking early 2000s.
p32901
aVThere was one teacher though who was a veteran, and very patriotic that would send students to the hallway during the announcements if you didn't stand.
p32902
aVOddly enough he was one of the most loved and respected teachers.
p32903
aVI remember at the end of the morning announcements first day he said, "in my classroom you will stand for the pledge or sit in the hall but no one will remain seated in my classroom.
p32904
aV" The rest of the year  everyone either stood up or left, and returned post pledge. \u000a
p32905
aVWas it the same school?
p32906
aVWith the same administration?
p32907
aVDifferent schools, different people making decisions.
p32908
aVYou can't assume one incident (or even several) represent a changing in trends.
p32909
aVOr for all we know, your incedent as not the norm 35 years ago.
p32910
aVThere's always going to be people who think facist behavior (and that is what forced pledges are) is ok, and then there are those who don't.
p32911
aVAs a veteran (since the military folks were called out as a reason why this kid should stand): This kid's opinion is **exactly** what I put my ass on the line to protect.
p32912
aVHe *absolutely* has the right to not say the Pledge, for whatever reason he sees as valid - forcing kids to parrot the Pledge will only serve to indoctrinate them into mindlessly repeating what they're told.
p32913
aVDon't use me and my fellow servicemembers as clubs to beat your children into submission.

p32922
aVRelied on nowadays for the notion that the pledge is voluntary and thus the inclusion of "under god" in the text is not a problem, because no one is forced to say it...unless you are in Texas, apparently. 
p32923
aVIt should be criminal to force kids to pledge allegiance to ANYTHING anyway, especially a nation, let alone stand for it if you choose not to pledge allegiance to it.
p32924
aVThe school will lose hands down here, violating his rights roundly.
p32925
aVI hope his family presses this issue as far and hard as they can.

p32930
aVExercising his constitutional rights..
p32931
aVIf they want to carry guns...
p32932
aVThey outta put up with this type of action too, you can't have it both ways.
p32933
aVIdk is its a correct argument but is my right to say it...thats until reddit deletes my comments.
p32934
aVyeah, and if he wants due process they should deny him that was well, and if his punishments counts as cruel and unusual then he should take it on the chin, because turning the constitution into the goddamn ship of theseus is really working well for the citizens of this country.
p32935
aVWell, he *is* exercising his right as an American to be totally misinformed and act like a brat.
p32936
aVHe's not misinformed according to the article.
p32937
aVAnd not standing up for the pledge is not bratty.
p32938
aVHe is merely acting upon his right to free speech (or lack thereof) and right to protest.
p32939
aVThe school is in the wrong for pushing nationalism on a child who is old enough to think for himself and decide the kind of country he wants to grow up in.\u000a

aV&gt;Dean Reese, a war veteran, said the school is sending the wrong message.
p32941
aV&gt;"The kid\u2019s well-spoken and he\u2019s well-informed," Reese said.

aV"It\u2019s not like he\u2019s ignorant, he\u2019s not doing it to make people mad.

p32953
aVThis comment is satire, right?
p32954
aVNah you should check out conservative blogs and sites.
p32955
aVMost of them believe the rebel flag has nothing with slavery in history,  and that liberals twist history and that the country is founded on Christianity as it's base law. 
p32956
aV&gt;Most of them believe\u000a\u000a...that doesn't make it remotely true.
p32957
aVHistorical evidence is a much stronger source.
p32958
aVAnd for the record, I've read blogs and sites from across the spectrum, but I don't think the teaching of History admits to partisan differences, unless those differences stem from a desire to mold the thinking of the audience in a particular way.

aVYes. 
p32962
aV&gt;  He is facing incumbent Eric Skrmetta, who seeks a cap on how much electricity solar customers can sell.
p32963
aVIn what world does it make sense to cap the amount of energy people can sell back to the grid from their own personal solar panels?
p32964
aVIt's clean it's renewable, it's adding competition to the market potentially opening up new ways of gaining capital to enter the peoples hands without having a big industry middle man.... think i just solved that riddle.
p32965
aVWell for starters competition is just what they don't want.
p32966
aVThere are some costs associated with a two way grid that legitimately have to be born by someone, but obviously this is about the end game of keeping solar out of the market and not that because, bomb.
p32967
aVHere is what they really don't want.
p32968
aVEvery business in the state that has a flat roof and a big AC unit on that roof could put just enough solar on it to meet max pull from that unit and cut what they buy from the utility massively.
p32969
aVThis requires only small changes in the way the grid is structured since they only have to transform DC to AC and send it right back to that building or a nearby AC useing consumer.
p32970
aVThis is lots easier than selling that wattage miles away.
p32971
aVIn a few years when that business switches from tube florescent lights to flat panel LEDs that building just doesn't buy much electricity anymore and that equals a huge income loss for the utilities.
p32972
aVTech is coming very soon that puts them in a position where they either have to get government to let them put massive stumbling blocks in the way of consumer solar or find a way to make industry foot most of the bill for the grid.
p32973
aVThus, bombs.

p32977
aV"\u000a\u000aDo we have a national "debate" or "conversation" only every time we forget about the last one?
p32978
aVBecause someone getting killed (probably the victim.
p32979
aV1 gun against 6 guys would most likely have just gotten the gun taken away and he and his girl shot) would have made the situation so much better right?

p32986
aVThis past summer I was traveling in Europe and 8 Albanians did the same sort of thing to me and the two guys I was with.
p32987
aVThey grouped up on my one friend who instigated the event, but we were never able to press charges or anything because it took the cops 45 minutes to show up. 
p32988
aVMaybe your pal shouldn't have instigated a confrontation with a group of 8 Albanians.
p32989
aVJust sayin'.
p32990
aVWell, I'll tell you more if you're interested, but three of them walked by, and the instigating occurred.
p32991
aVAnd then at least 8 came back and the 'leader'  said, "you say fuck you?
p32992
aVYou say fuck you?

p33001
aVThis part got me - "Officers thought the robbery suspect's Airsoft handgun looked and sounded real" WTF?

p33006
aVAll kidding aside, I can imagine that the robber may have racked the Airsoft Gun's slide or something like that.
p33007
aVThe sound and sight of any pistol's slide being racked could fool anyone into thinking that a gun is an authentic weapon.
p33008
aVIt's understandable how a unfortunate decision, like shooting a guy armed with an Airsoft toy, could be made.
p33009
aVThat does't change that this is a tragedy.

p33028
aVHel-LOOOO.
p33029
aVWhen I was broke and had to commute long distances to low paid temp jobs with no benefits, I had to choose between paying for car insurance and having enough money for rent.
p33030
aVI had no assets so in a car accident, I had nothing to lose.
p33031
aVPeople think you should buy liability insurance to protect the other guy.
p33032
aVI'd like to point out that that has never been the purpose of liability insurance.
p33033
aVThe purpose of liability insurance is to protect your own assets.
p33034
aVJust ask any wealthy person.
p33035
aVThe concept of trying to pay for liability coverage to protect assets I didn't have when I was semi-homeless seemed stupid.
p33036

p33037
aVAn economy designed to keep workers as impoverished as possible must expect to have to shoulder the extra costs to society that inevitably arise when the unemployed and the low paid can't afford to participate fully in that economy at the "responsible citizen" level.
p33038
aVThere *will* be uninsured drivers, people who can't afford health care and huge numbers of people who retire into poverty.
p33039
aVA society that embraces the keep 'em as low paid and desperate as possible as the best possible economic model should expect and plan for these  extra costs.
p33040
aVIn my opinion, we should be grateful to low paid workers who do their utmost to be responsible citizens while struggling to survive on not enough income to pay the bills, with no benefits or vacations, sometimes no healthcare and no chance in hell of retiring because they are on the work 'til you die retirement plan.
p33041
aVBecause of their sacrifices, they make it possible for everyone else to pay as little as possible for goods and services.
p33042
aVSince I don't need anyone's face ground in the dirt to save me a dollar, I wish they would just pay you more and pass the cost on to me.
p33043
aVOn that note we should never send consumers to a for profit industry under penalty of law.
p33044
aVIf insurance is required then car insurance companies should get regulated like utilities are. 
p33045
aVThat place you just described, what a shithole!

aVDear PEW CT and "states":\u000a\u000aThe problem is simple, it's greed.
p33049
aVIt's the same problem with "Health Care" and open internet.
p33050
aVSadly there is no simple solution and seeking better ways to identify those driving without insurance is only looking at a symptom of this plague.
p33051
aVIt's the same old idea that says to charge the people who can't afford to make minimum monthly credit card payments higher intrest, and put people who can't afford court costs in jail.
p33052
aVThe question is how do we solve the greed problem in this society?
p33053
aVStart chatter about adopting ideals of socialist systems.
p33054
aVDon't vote for people who support ideals of capitalism.
p33055

aV\u000a\u000aI paid 250 a month from age 16 to age 25 till it lowered to around 100 dollars a month after that.
p33058
aVAt age 27 I ran into a pole and totaled my car, the pay out value of 6500 dollars...after the accident my insurance rate went up to 172 dollars a month.
p33059
aVSo in the time I started driving till the time I had my 1st accident I had paid just over 29,000 dollars in insurance fees.
p33060
aVThis is why I don't pay for car insurance despite being a driver.
p33061
aVIf I'm going to be in accident with another drive I can guarantee it will be at their fault.\u000a\u000a
p33062
aVThe premiums cost more than the fines and then they play the deductible game if you ever do need to file a claim... which, of course, raises your rates to the sky.
p33063
aVIn cali, you can get caught every other month without insurance and it's still cheaper than getting insurance.
p33064
aVAnd let's be honest here, you don't get pulled over for not having insurance, you get pulled over for other things.
p33065
aVDrive like someone sane and you'll basically be fine.
p33066
aVPocket the cash and there's your repair money.
p33067
aVOver here, where drivers are horrible and cars are more expensive, i get $0 deductible, no questions asked full coverage insurance for $700 a year.
p33068
aVI so much as get a scratch on the car, or a broken light, and they'll just fix it... unless the cost exceeds the total paid-to-date premium, there are no increases.
p33069

aVWould anyone do this to their kids?

aVWhat could possibly go wrong in 10-12 years?
p33080
aVTLDR;\u000a\u000a'Gallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an organization that provides a regular paycheck.
p33081
aV**Right now, the U.S. is delivering at a staggeringly low rate of 44%,** which is the number of full-time jobs as a percent of the adult population, 18 years and older.
p33082
aVWe need that to be 50% and a bare minimum of 10 million new, good jobs to replenish America's middle class.
p33083
aV'\u000a\u000a\u000aEmphasis added.
p33084
aV&gt;The Big Lie\u000a\u000aIs one day without a Hitler reference too much to ask?
p33085
aVI thought we were trying to talk about something serious.
p33086
aV&gt;Right now, we're hearing much celebrating from the media, the White House and Wall Street about how unemployment is "down" to 5.6%.
p33087
aVYes.
p33088
aVLet's take shots at the White House, Wall Street and the media that Gallup is a part of when both parties and all three branches of government have been fucking things up for years.
p33089
aV&gt;None of them will tell you this: If you, a family member or anyone is unemployed and has subsequently given up on finding a job -- if you are so hopelessly out of work that you've stopped looking over the past four weeks -- the Department of Labor doesn't count you as unemployed.
p33090
aVThat's right.
p33091
aVEveryone will tell you that.
p33092
aVThe government, news anchors, columnists, everyone.
p33093
aVAnytime an unemployment number is reported (always in U3 because that's the established, politically convenient standard) people point that out.
p33094
aVI take people less seriously when they ignore the BLS and play dumb about U3 unemployment vs. U6 unemployment.
p33095
aVTo me, this means the writer is either disingenuous or not an expert.
p33096
aVSince Jim Clifton is Chairman and CEO at Gallup, I'm leaning towards the former.
p33097
aVAlso, unemployment has been a *huge* story for about 9 years.
p33098
aVClifton has been in the same position at Gallup since 1988.
p33099
aVIf the news media has failed to explain how unemployment is counted in the past 9 years, Clifton is as much to blame as anyone.
p33100
aVHe's had the power to explain it, and it's actually all fairly easy to understand.
p33101
aV&gt;Gallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an organization that provides a regular paycheck.
p33102
aVWhat a Walmart-friendly way to measure.
p33103
aV[EDIT] It ignores poverty and the fact that 30 hours won't cut it for most people while still demonizing other measures as inadequate and promoting Gallup.
p33104
aVWe're worse off than both parties and their talking heads say, and I'm really sick of bullshit editorials still trying to make it about "the other guy" masquerading as insightful analysis. \u000a
p33105
aVDoes anyone have a number for what the actual total unemployment rate really is if we factor in all the scenarios previously removed?
p33106
aVTen bucks gets you four fricking gallons, 120 miles of driving if you have decent MPG.
p33107

aVOmitted from this excerpt is that O'neill was offered desk work for [the remainder of his contracted service](http://www.esquire.com/features/man-who-shot-osama-bin-laden-0313) so he could retain full benefits (three years as I recall) and he declined.\u000a
p33120
aVWhy is this not bigger news?
p33121
aVBecause the official story is full of holes and likely bs.  
p33122

p33135
aVThis should be considered a terrorist attack imho.
p33136
aVBut likely, it will just be called a disgruntled employee, despite his religious advocacy.
p33137
aVHow is this a terrorist attack?
p33138
aVBecause the intent of decapitating this woman was to spread fear, fear that people like ISIS are working within the US.
p33139
aVHe could have left her dead in many ways, but instead, he chose to behead her when beheading is in the news almost every day because of Islamic terror groups. 
p33140
aVAssuming intent through simple associations in method demonstrates a flawed understanding...in fact some might call it ignorant.
p33141
aVExample: A man kills a person with a gun.
p33142
aVSoldiers use guns, therefore the man must be a soldier.
p33143
aVTrue, false, or not enough information to support that statement?
p33144
aVI used a lot more information than your example, but if you can't understand perhaps you're... ignorant. 
p33145
aVWhat other information?
p33146
aVI'm sorry if I hurt your feels

p33192

p33193
aVProblem is, they are representing OU and the national organization of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
p33194
aVAs members of SAE and students of OU they actually don't have the right to any opinion.
p33195
aVOU and SAE nationals has every right to disown them if they do something they don't appreciate. 
p33196
aV[deleted]
p33197
aVI disagree that as a society we don't have the right to call out dangerous extremists like racists.
p33198
aVWe should ridicule them, because their opinions are out of line.
p33199
aVThey can still hold those opinions, but neither do we need to stay silent about it.
p33200
aVMaybe a few of these students will realize how seriously we take this issue and will reevaluate their perspective. 
p33201
aV[deleted]
p33202
aVThis is a private matter.
p33203
aVFree speech applies to everyone, and the government acting as a legal body can not supress it unless people are at risk of death.
p33204
aVThey can hate other races and we can hate them.
p33205
aVUniversities are largely independent of the state and are disown whatever hate organization forms under their name.
p33206
aVThe nation portion of the group can do the same.
p33207
aVYou can feel however you want and say whatever you want.
p33208
aVBut if you get caught spreading hate while representing another entity, expect that entity to retaliate to save face and the public to turn on you.
p33209
aV[deleted]
p33210
aVThe public has no right to illegally punish these individuals for their actions.
p33211
aVFree speech is meant to protect individuals from persecution from the Government.
p33212
aVThese individuals have a right to have these opinions privately and the right to express them publicly without the threat of criminal law.
p33213
aVHowever, these organizations (OU and the national chapter) can do whatever they want in their response, whether it's suspending the chapter (check), shutting down the house (check), expelling students (check), and possibly bringing legal action against them for discrimination in their recruiting process (I think they can do this).
p33214
aVThe public has ever right to ridicule these individuals but the rights of the public only go so far as to not infringe on the rights of these individuals.
p33215
aVViolence against them, illegal defamation, and other illegal actions are not allowed.
p33216
aVBut when you say "the public has no right to interject itself", you are certainly wrong in the fact that they are exercising their right to free speech as well.
p33217
aVEdit:  Example,  I can say whatever I want to anyone, but if I tell my boss to f*** off he sure as hell can fire me.
p33218
aVSo I'm not really sure what you're trying to argue *for*.
p33219
aVThat's asking to censor people who don't like it.
p33220
aVThose slurred by what they did deserve to hear how much others condemn their attitudes so they know they are a minority.
p33221
aVThis isn't about outrage, this is about supporting the fellow Americans they are disrepecting.
p33222
aV[deleted]
p33223
aVNope, but I do believe if you think someone may be hurt by the opinion, there is nothing wrong with voicing it that you don't agree is equally allowed.
p33224
aVYou can't stop a minority opinion anymore than you can stop a majority one.
p33225
aVThey both have the right to speak.
p33226
aVIt's up to us to choose whom to listen to or not.
p33227
aVThey're actually chanting about lynching people.
p33228
aVNot just saying that the hate them.
p33229
aVI think vocally supporting racially motivated murder is definitely cause for public outrage.
p33230
aV[deleted]
p33231
aV"You can hang them from a tree, but they'll never sign with me..." That doesn't sound like lynching to you?
p33232
aVYou're right and I agree with you.

aVJust what we all needed. 
p33244
aVOr we could make healthy food cheaper?
p33245
aVor we could just tax fat people?
p33246
aVdon't ruin it for everyone.
p33247
aVmost people do not enjoy higher taxes and if they can save money many will lose a few pounds.
p33248
aVplus a specific fatty person tax will provide them motivation, that yes they are indeed making the wrong decisions.
p33249
aVI like the idea but taxes don't change lifestyles.
p33250
aVTaxing poor people won't make them get jobs.
p33251
aVTaxing fat people won't get them to a gym. 
p33252
aVHow about also including high fructose corn syrup?
p33253
aVSince the corn industry has better lobbyists, I bet that would never fly.

p33264
aVCases like this make me cringe.
p33265
aVAnd there are more guns out there in private hands than ever before....
p33266
aVHowever, it is likely due to a number of factors unrelated to weapons either way.
p33267
aVPeople are getting smarter, people are getting more wealthy, food is easier to come by for anyone in the US,  environmental causes of violence such as heavy metals poisoning is diminishing, and jobs (or at least other things to do) are not too hard to come by.
p33268
aVThere are only so much these solutions can do in the fact of the violent tendencies of humans.

p33275
aVWho cares?
p33276
aVIt is still one of the safest cities in the US.
p33277
aVIt is like having a cool month and saying climate change doesn't exist.
p33278
aVOverall the world is warming by the definition of climate.
p33279
aVOverall violent crime is diminishing.    
p33280
aVHardly what the media would have you think.
p33281
aVAfter watching CNN this morning while making my coffee(not something I watch, my brother had it on), CNN would like you to believe that violence in the US and around the globe is on the rise.
p33282
aVThat was beautiful. 
p33283
aVAs far as classifying this as a homicide, does this just mean that the incident with the police caused his death?
p33284
aVHomicide includes manslaughter, doesn't it?
p33285
aVSome commentators I've seen think this is an identification of murder.
p33286
aVI do wonder how large a role Garner's underlying health issues might have played in the outcome here.
p33287
aVHe was asthmatic and had issues with cardiovascular health no doubt in relation to his obesity and continued (what I assume) poor diet.
p33288
aVShould these policemen be held responsible based on the outcomes of their actions, even if the same interaction with a healthy individual would have caused much less harm?

aVStatement from templeton Rye on [their Facebook page:](https://www.facebook.com/templetonrye) \u000a\u000a&gt;We have been working with MGP on a contract distilling basis since we began and have purchased significant product from them.
p33290
aVWe built a distillery in Templeton and have bottled and hand labeled every drop of our product in Templeton since we launched the brand.
p33291
aVWe are also distilling and aging product in Templeton as well as growing rye, some of which we have used to produce our product.

p33294
aVWe are the largest employer in town and to date have invested more than 1 million dollars in the distillery.
p33295
aV&gt;We are proud of what we have accomplished in building Templeton Rye and resurrecting this great American story that both of our families played a part in.

aVWhen the CEO of a company voices their own opinion, that doesn't automatically make it an official statement of that company.
p33352
aVApple sells it's product in places where people who want to buy their product live, what benefit could they possibly make by refusing to serve the people of a country that has a corrupt government?
p33353
aVExcept for the fact he wrote a piece for the Washington Post where he says "On Behalf of Apple..."\u000a\u000aand its called Morality, He cant say one thing is bad and draw attention to it when his company is directly allowing bigotry, mass murder, genitalia mutilation, and gang rape.. to just note a few of the atrocities facing that region.
p33354
aVBy directly, I mean, Apple products (odds are) have been used to organize these things.
p33355
aVNot only did he say a dumb thing about a law he did not read and just had an intern give their best interpretation of based off of talking points but he also did just this, Spoke on behalf of his company to boycott Indiana while his company keeps getting record sales in countries that have REAL problems.
p33356
aVBut he has no issue filling his pockets, his buddies pockets, and his share holder pockets... you know since its not here in America, nor getting the amount of attention since it doesnt fit any kind of agenda.
p33357
aVAlso since you did not know about the article he actually wrote where he spoke on behalf of Apple I can not take you serious after anything you say going forward.
p33358
aVGood luck to you and become more informed!

p33380
aVA belt?!
p33381
aVUgh
p33382
aVI still disagree with using a weapon against your kids.
p33383
aVI think belts are a bad idea, but it seems crazy to consider prosecuting a parent for using one when our schools still spank our kids with paddles. 
p33384
aVThis was in New York, where corporal punishment in schools has been banned for decades.
p33385
aVWell, if you aren't smart enough to convince your child with words, then beat the little brats with a leather belt in front of your friends!
p33386
aVThat is what Jesus would do.
p33387
aVBy 8 years old the little fuckers should know better than to repeat their parents' cuss words!
p33388
aVBetter than fighting someone your own size who might hit back.
p33389
aVIf it was not for someone finally having enough of me and giving me a, spanking I'm not sure where I'd be today - it really got my attention\u000a\u000aOf my 3 kids, 2 were seldom spanked but they got the idea and began to listen.
p33390
aVThe 3rd, well all I can say is it slowed down some of his worst traits.
p33391
aVDo you have kids?
p33392
aVMaybe yours listen and remember - they are destined for greatness --- most kids do not listen or remember words - even spanking is a poor deterrent but it's better than allowing them to run wild without consequences 
p33393
aVAll research into the subject disagrees that your child abuse is helpful.
p33394
aVFor every anecdote you have, I have one the opposite way.

aVCouple of comments on Reddit and you go to 'abusive' language - tells me all I need to know.
p33399
aVHave 2 or 3 kids  raise them without physical discipline, document it - maybe you'll change the world.
p33400
aVMore likely you'll discover there is a difference between discipline and abuse \u000a\u000a
p33401
aVMaybe you will discover the difference between using *stupidity* in a witty biting response and "abusive" language.
p33402
aVYou accusing me of being abusive while defending the beating of children is funny in its irony.
p33403
aVIf you read the peer-reviewed research I just linked you would see that spanking can be objectively considered abuse by all definitions of the word.
p33404
aVYou thinking these methods of physical punishment are necessary or as common as you suggest are telling.
p33405
aVAll the people I know we're spanked as children, as were our parents, grandparent and of course our children and now our grandchildren \u000a\u000aThe people I know are happy productive members of society.

p33439

p33440
aVThe lazy way is usually the best.
p33441
aVWhich is why I continue to use it :)
p33442
aVwait...wow, I think you just did the opposite of what you were trying to do with that statement considering the article.
p33443
aVAs contrasted to the years when they *admitted* to fake vaccination campaigns?
p33444
aVAlso, could they not have administered real vaccinations as part of their intelligence gathering?
p33445
aVI am asking; were the programs administering *fake* vaccinations?
p33446
aVAnd are they reneging in their word if they conduct *real* vaccination programs.
p33447
aVOk, lets get this rolling: \u000a\u000aI belöieve, in a very kind of nice way, the CIA spend some of its overblown budget, that it gained through vileness and treachery, on setting up vaccination campaigns.
p33448
aVThus far, no problem.
p33449
aVAfter all, fuck, if anybody had the funds to do this, surely the CIA had.
p33450
aVNow, what I have a problem with is their practice of using this as an intelligence gathering mission.
p33451
aVNo idea how?
p33452
aVYou go out, and propose to vaccinate kids.
p33453
aVBecause, why not.
p33454
aVNow, what they don't tell you is that they don't exactly use needles for some vaccinations, also microblades, ect.
p33455
aVSo, over the course of this, you build a database of genetic material of people in this city.
p33456
aVBecause heck, you gave them a free vaccination, right?
p33457
aVNow, what the directly disagreeable thing is this is fucking close to metadata gathering.
p33458
aVAnd we all know, metadata being gathered by the CIA leads to anything from unlawfull drone strike killings to being abducted and tortured by the worst type of human swine.
p33459
aVSo yea.
p33460
aVAs hard as it sounds, I think a court order is in need to force the CIA and every medic worldwide to disclose if they ever worked or work for secret service, asnd if they lie on that, to revoke all of their licenses.

p33482
aVU.S. Army Forces Command, based in North Carolina, said it will discuss the \u201cnext planned steps\u201d in the case.
p33483
aVGen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, has been reviewing the case and has a broad range of legal options.
p33484
aVThey include various degrees of desertion charges.
p33485
aVA major consideration is whether military officials would be able to prove that Bergdahl had no intention of ever returning to his unit _ a key element in the more serious desertion charges.
p33486
aV"
aVI guess I don't understand the hate towards this man that I see coming from so many Americans.
p33487
aVSure, he abandoned his post, which is straight fucked off, however he was caught, imprisoned and tortured FOR FIVES  YEARS by enemy combatants.
p33488
aVMy question is: why don't folks feel that is enough punishment as it is?
p33489
aVIn my mind he suffered instant karma the moment he went AWOL.
p33490
aVDoes such action merit FURTHER punishment?
p33491
aVThe primary reason for the hate stems from the prisoner exchange that brought him back into American hands.
p33492
aVSeveral people who were wanted by Al-Qaeda, dangerous people, were set free in order to get him back.
p33493
aVAnd to top it all off, he isn't even someone we would want back.
p33494
aVAs far as the public can tell, he's a traitor, a deserter, rather than someone who fought with honor. \u000a
p33495
aVI see.
p33496
aVDo we know the full story of why he left in the first place?
p33497
aVBut [Mother Jones](http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/quick-facts-army-deserters-bergdahl) said that even though he technically deserted, it wasn't desertion because he was captured.
p33498
aVIntent doesn't real.

aVOnly feels is reals.
p33500
aVBunch of scum.

p33502
aVNow he can join Pvt.
p33503
aVSlovick.
p33504
aVUnlikely.
p33505
aVSlovick had to desert over and over again to finally get put in front of a firing squad and even then some of the military leadership was not happy it had been approved.
p33506
aVA handgun from 120 yards???
p33507
aVI think not.
p33508
aV100+ yards with a quick follow up shot is either a rifle or a championship pistol shooter.
p33509
aVThis is what happens when you ignore evidence and continue to chant "hands up don't shoot.
p33510
aV" Now one officer can never have a normal life again and two more had been shot that are completely innocent.
p33511
aVWillful ignorance is responsible for this.
p33512
aVIn reference to the racist e mails discovered, all employees should be terminated immediately and that's being taken care of.
p33513
aVThat doesn't justify any of this though.
p33514
aVYes, one officer that killed an unarmed man with a paper thin convenient excuse of "he was coming right at me" trumpeted mostly by the media, despite the evidence contradicting that.
p33515
aVHe can not have a normal life, boo hoo.
p33516
aVHe may see a court trial yet as the civil law suit brings to light new evidence and understandings.
p33517
aVHe was not found innocent, he was not tried in a court of law.
p33518
aVA tool that is known for its manipulation and lack of reliability, a grand jury hearing, was used to skip charges.
p33519
aVCharges can be brought back up at any time.
p33520
aVThey should  have terminated the whole police force and began investigating the surrounding police forces.
p33521
aVThis is obviously a wide spread and deep seated problem in more than just Ferguson.
p33522
aVThey've fired the police chief and got the judge and states attorney to step down, taken over all the cases, fired at least two other officer, but it is not enough and could not come quick enough for years of rampart brutality that has terrorized a community for what is likely decades.
p33523
aVThe evidence speaks for itself, a grand jury is to decide if they have enough evidence for a trial, they didn't.
p33524
aVYou're free to look at the evidence yourself.
p33525
aVI'm not going to argue past the fact that when someone who just grabbed for your gun and took off and then doubled back at you when you are alone with a weapon, you have to shoot or risk having that weapon used against you, period.
p33526
aVThe issues with the few police officers involved in the email scandal have been taken care of swiftly, officer Wilson was investigated locally and federally swiftly.
p33527
aVThe media joined in with the "hands up don't shoot" claims early on until evidence showed otherwise.
p33528
aVYou're obviously very emotionally charged and biased.
p33529
aVI'm not emotionally charged, you are obviously uninformed of the evidence and biased by media.
p33530
aVI am well studied in the evidence which clearly contradicts the ridiculous media claim that Wilson was charged at.
p33531
aVYou don't get to slaughter someone in the street while they are no longer a threat at all, for some previous threat (the previous altercation at the side of the car that happened ~180 feet away).
p33532
aVThere was more than one police incident contributing to "hands up don't shoot". 
p33533
aVPlease show me this contradictory evidence.

aVhttp://fox2now.com/2014/11/24/prosecutor-robert-mcculloch-releases-grand-jury-evidence-in-michael-brown-case/\u000a\u000aIt is all there, you just have to understand it.
p33535
aVThe physical evidence proves he was shot several times, likely dying, and headed back towards the police car, which was away from Wilson.
p33536
aVHe likely was not standing up at the time he was executed in the street with a bullet to the top of the head.
p33537
aVAre you wearing your tin foil hat today?
p33538
aVNo, I am just informed.
p33539
aVUninformed.
p33540
aVFTFY. 
p33541
aVStudy the evidence, read the testimonies, and form your own opinion.
p33542
aVThat is what I did.
p33543
aVNo amounts of downvotes by fools who have not will cause me to change my assessment.
p33544
aVThe downvotes this post got as well as on all your replies to /u/XA36 are just despicable.
p33545
aVReddit is a corporate tool just like all the other news outlets.
p33546
aVWhen the riots happened reddit was ablaze with people who couldn't stop parroting negativity towards the people who have been marginalized for decades by the police and justice system culminating in the events of the past few months.
p33547
aVUnderstanding the issue is so goddamn easy too....
p33548
aVA sniper-style attack that could just as easily have killed or injured demonstrators.
p33549
aVI hope the POS shooter is arrested, tried, convicted, and put away for life.
p33550
aVHow could it just as easily injured demonstrators when the target was very obviously cops and the shooter clearly had fine aim?
p33551
aVThat's absurd.
p33552
aVIf you read the news items out there, a protestor who was present described the sound of bullets whizzing past his ear.
p33553
aVThe shooter put more people at risk than just the police he was shooting at.
p33554
aVIt's absurd of you to think otherwise.
p33555
aVAnd your "fine aim" comment is amusing.
p33556
aVIf his aim had been that "fine," the cops hit would be dead.
p33557
aVI hope he gets a grand jury and doesn't go to trial, fair is fair right?
p33558
aVAt least the cops lived.
p33559
aVYes, ambushing people with a gun is certainly no crime at all.
p33560
aVThe shooter tried to kill two police (one of whom will probably live the rest of his life with the effects of the shot to his head) and endangered people who were protesting.
p33561
aV(Protestors mentioned the sound of bullets whizzing past their ears.
p33562
aV) This shooter should definitely walk.
p33563
aVBecause you say so.
p33564
aVAccording to the Ferguson legal system violent gun crimes that result in dead innocent people is perfectly legal, just ask Darren Wilson!
p33565
aVDon't blame me.  
p33566
aV"Innocent" .. attacking a police officer after you just committed a strong-arm robbery.
p33567
aVI wonder what goes through your head.
p33568
aVDude sarcas brah, calm down.
p33569
aVGiven the evidence from the report by U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder's office, "the Ferguson legal system" delivered a just decision in not indicting Wilson.
p33570
aVMike Brown was clearly and repeatedly not "innocent.
p33571
aV" If he had just stepped up on to the sidewalk, he'd be alive today.
p33572
aVHonestly I am surprised this hasn't happened more often since the release of the DOJ report.
p33573
aVA community that has been pushed to the brink now has evidence that they have been systematically victimized by the people they are paying to protect them.
p33574
aVNot saying it's right, but it's not a surprising reaction to a horrible situation.
p33575
aV"This is really an ambush," [said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar].
p33576
aV"You are basically defenseless.
p33577

aV"\u000a\u000aOh the irony.
p33579
aVI wonder if this has anything to do with they plan to fuck the public with the upcoming decision on net neutrality
p33580
aVDoes this report really ask for armed investigators?
p33581
aVMore concerning to me is the FCC'S interference when the IG's tried to hire investigators and the FCC setting up its own IG-like unit without IG or DOJ input.
p33582
aV&gt; "It has also not yet been determined if the motive was a hate crime, domestic terrorism, a personal act of violence against a specific individual, or other motive as there are numerous individuals and entities tied to the building in the vicinity of the explosion," Sanders said in an email to The Times.

aVI managed to find an article that I read a few days ago.

p33605
aVPretty misleading title there PBS...

aVIt sounds like this copycat kid deserved it if he was actually harassing or harming a child, but as for the rest of the article... Wow.

aVSgt.
p33608
aVGrubbs... Hope you don't mean you plan to arrest all the "clown terrorists" that are going around making photos in public.
p33609
aVWhether their presence scares people or not, they are well within their rights.
p33610
aVUnless of course, the law has been changed without notice and there is suddenly a law against walking around in clown costumes making photos.
p33611
aVAnd of course, even if a town passed such a law, the Constitution definitely trumps that.
p33612
aVPretty sure you're going to have a lot of fun losing in court on these arrests you're planning...

aVNow if it was say...Stephen hawking that'd be different.
p33633
aVAs sad as it is to say, I would wager that more people in the US would consider Tracey Morgan more relevant in their lives than Stephen Hawking.
p33634
aVStephen Hawking never was on a TV show...

aVHawking has been on tv and had his own show.

p33638
aVIt isn't US news, its entertainment news.

aVBecause they are most likely black and that would racist and against their civil rights.

aVWell I see my sarcasm didn't go well. 
p33645
aVI'm no racist, but I hate that man.

aVHe is one of the presidents closest confidants you dolt.
p33658
aVLook up how many times he has visited the white house.
p33659

aVwhy is target trying to lose what little business i do in big box stores?
p33682
aVI use them because I get 5% off for linking my debit card.

aVBut those savings can be replicated using bitcoin or other giftcard promotional services.
p33684
aVBut they are cumbersome.
p33685
aVI like the Target near me for most dry goods and groceries because it's never really crowded and and easy experience.
p33686
aVBut I'm losing my patience with them as their service is already horrible.
p33687
aVIt's like the people who got fired from McDonalds work there.

aVJust as Walmart realizes this is a losing formula... Is it time for the big-boxes to trade places?

aVthis is pretty fucked, no matter who you're supporting
p33704
aVYeah, that's not right.
p33705
aVIt seems like a player inside the US economy is trying to draw us into an internal struggle between the State and the citizens?\u000a\u000a
p33706
aVSo full of it.
p33707
aVHow can they say that they can't release it because the hackers are threatening to release movies and information online, and then after be like "oh but the reason we aren't releasing it is because it's not a good movie.
p33708
aV" Real slick. 
p33709
aVYeah it's really funny when you look at it from this angle.
p33710
aVYou can imagine these slime ball backless executives sitting around a big table sweating and nervous.
p33711
aVOr better yet their all skyping each other from their secret woodlands cabin/hideouts.
p33712
aVAll in a desperate attempt to solve their public relations nightmare with some unquestionably epic line of bullshit.\u000a\u000a
p33713
aVExactly, that groups comedy doesnt make everyone laugh but sure as hell I am literally rolling around chuckling at their penis jokes.
p33714
aVYour highness, This is the End, Pineapple Express... all good funny movies... to me, all that matters.
p33715
aVOnly reason the movie was pulled from theaters is to protect themselves from the dirt they were sending each other via email.
p33716
aVI mean that last "big" peace of information is how the damn district attorney was pals with them.. remember Zero Dark Thirty?
p33717
aVWas a big scandal of secret information passed to SONY to make a movie glorifying killing a damn icon in the terrorist world, no one was scared of repercussions then.
p33718
aVBut when some well organized hackers straight steal personal emails, bluffed with the email on how racist Amy Pascal really is how the poor 1k+$ plate dinner she was attending on what to say to Obama is only then they decided to give in.
p33719
aVNot to protect peoples lives, they can give two shits about that.
p33720
aVEdited enough so just going to make a new post.
p33721
aVSecretive and select information only given to SONY to make a movie, none of the other movie studios.
p33722
aVKinda one sided you think?
p33723
aVI just finished it, watched with my gf, mom and her bf and we all thought it was hilarious..
p33724
aVI'm not sure why people think it's not tbh.. Stop taking it so seriously it's just stupid fun and that's OK... 
p33725
aV&gt;Stop taking it so seriously it's just stupid fun and that's OK... \u000a\u000aYeah ok I guess for stupid people.
p33726
aVPersonally I'm not into stupid fun.
p33727
aVLol no not for stupid people.. Not every movie you see has to be Schindler's list
p33728
aVMel Brooks isn't exactly "high brow", yet he's still regarded as one of the greatest comedy filmmakers of all time.
p33729
aVEnjoying silly slapstick fun doesn't automatically make you stupid.
p33730
aVBut I'd venture to say that making such a blanket judgment about people does, in fact, make you a jerk.
p33731
aVYou could tell it was a crappy unfunny movie from the trailers/commercials.
p33732
aVIt would have sold out just from all the free publicity North Korea was giving it, even if it wasn't funny.
p33733
aVSony really screwed themselves over here.
p33734
aVSo we have corrupt police officers murdering citizens.
p33735
aVThe politicians, the police force and the prosecutors are all corrupt in stopping crime and holding criminals accountable for their actions...
p33736
aVSounds like we need Batman.\u000a
p33737
aVCan't stand this style of headline: Me

p33741
aVAlmostly.
p33742
aVtotal Streisand effect.
p33743
aVThe controversy, and news it generated, probably got pornhub more free advertising than the actual cost of the billboard.
p33744
aVBrilliant.
p33745
aVThe billboard seems pretty benign.
p33746
aVDid it really warrant being removed?
p33747
aVNo!
p33748
aVI don't support the shooting one bit.
p33749
aVBut the number of times someone is shot is 100% irrelevant.
p33750
aVWhen a police officer makes the decision to use his gun it isn't to *wound* the suspect into submission, or *warn them* that the officer means business.
p33751
aVA gun is fired with the intent to kill.
p33752
aVThe highly questionable decision to use the gun needs to be the subject.
p33753
aVNot how many bullets were discharged.
p33754
aVThe head shots seem to confirm that the original intent of Wilson was to kill.
p33755
aVIt looks like he just started firing once he had the gun up and then moved towards Brown's head, rather then going for his legs, or some other place that would actually stop a person, but not kill that person
p33756
aVCops are specifically trained not to shoot to maim.
p33757
aVIt's in fact illegal in the US
p33758
aVSo instead they shoot to kill?
p33759
aVIf you shoot someone 3 times in the leg, that person isn't going to be able to run and most likely will be able to recover from the injuries unless a knee gets blown out.
p33760
aVYou should never train someone to use a lethal weapon as a nonlethal tool.
p33761
aVIt's like fucking for virginity.
p33762
aVYou're just begging for things to go wrong.
p33763
aVGuns are a last resort for police.
p33764
aVYou're only supposed to pull it out if there's literally no other option but to kill the aggressor.
p33765
aVAnd now you see the whole issue.
p33766
aV&gt;Guns are a last resort for police.
p33767
aVIf only that were true in so many cases we see these days.
p33768
aVI am still confused why the cops that gunned down the homeless guy camping in the park are not facing murder charges.\u000a
p33769
aVWell, they're supposed to be anyway.
p33770
aVThe reason for this is simple.
p33771
aVTraining to shoot center mass is simpler in a high stress situation.
p33772
aVThey are trained to shoot for effect,  center mass is effective.
p33773
aVShooting at arms, legs and hands is not easy nor is it effective.
p33774
aVIm going to assume you have absolutely no hands on firearm experience much less training.

p33777
aVIf his hands were raised to surrender, why are his hands/fingers pointing in the opposite direction, towards his body, in these photos?
p33778
aVIf his hands were raised towards the sky, surrendering, his hands/fingers would be up in front of his body with his fingers pointing away from his body.
p33779
aVWas the body moved?
p33780
aVIf it wasn't, his body position disproves his hands being up to surrender and proves his hands were in a downed, charging position.
p33781
aVEDIT: I actually noticed something else!
p33782
aVLook at his leg positions.
p33783
aVOne is straight out and the other is curved at the knee, as if he was in a running stance....
p33784
aVSo, the people claiming he was on his knees when he was still shot at by the officer are completely incorrect!
p33785
aVDid you go to the 9-11 Truther school of forensic science? 
p33786
aVIt's very clear to see.
p33787
aVIf his hands were up, they wouldn't be pointing in the opposite direction.
p33788
aVThere's not enough public available information for anyone to reconstruct the events, or to come to any of the conclusions you're trying to make.
p33789
aVBut, your assertion is false - if he was shot  in his arms first he would have likely dropped his arms and then gone limp if the shot to his eye was next. 
p33790
aV&gt;There's not enough public available information for anyone to reconstruct the events, or to come to any of the conclusions you're trying to make.
p33791
aVOh, yes there is.
p33792
aVYou just disagree with them.
p33793
aV&gt;But, your assertion is false - if he was shot in his arm~~s~~ first he would have likely dropped his arm~~s~~ and then gone limp if the shot to his eye was next.
p33794
aVSee, this is why I think I am correct.
p33795
aVHe was only shot in ONE arm, but BOTH arms are pointing in the wrong direction.
p33796
aVYou don't have nearly enough information, from that picture alone.
p33797
aVIf he was standing it's perfectly possible that his arms fell to his sides before his torso hit the ground.
p33798
aVI doubt he was kneeling (sitting on his heals), or I would expect him to be folded over instead of relativly spread out, and it seems unlikely he was laying down at the time.
p33799
aVNot really expressinng an opinion either way, just saying we really don't have enough quality information yet, everything being tainted by politics as it is, it may be a long time before we do.
p33800
aV&gt;You don't have nearly enough information, from that picture alone.
p33801
aVOk.\u000a\u000a&gt;If he was standing it's perfectly possible that his arms fell to his sides before his torso hit the ground.
p33802
aVWe do know he wasn't standing straight up from the angle of the last two shots.
p33803
aV&gt;I doubt he was kneeling (sitting on his heals), or I would expect him to be folded over instead of relativly spread out\u000a\u000aI can agree, even though, some of the eyewitnesses said the cop was standing over him shooting him.
p33804
aVThat just doesn't seem accurate.
p33805
aV&gt;and it seems unlikely he was laying down at the time.
p33806
aVI agree.
p33807
aV&gt;Not really expressinng an opinion either way, just saying we really don't have enough quality information yet, everything being tainted by politics as it is, it may be a long time before we do.
p33808
aVI agree, but I think posting this information gets people talking about it and anyone can see the image and make their own conclusion.
p33809
aVWhy was it necessary to shoot in first place, even if this supposed struggle did happen, if the suspect was unarmed?
p33810
aVI understood that police carry a baton, pepper spray, and a taser why is it they always just say screw that shit and pull the gun?
p33811
aVBecause not all police departments, especially smaller ones, issue batons, pepper spray or tasers.
p33812
aVThe chances of them ever needing those items is usually as likely as ever having to fire their weapon.
p33813
aVI however do not know if that was the case with the Ferguson PD.
p33814
aVAnd if the officers story is to be believed, Brown assaulted him before he was shot, which most training teaches you to pull your gun and fire, not use a less than lethal option.
p33815
aVAlso there's speculation that Mr Brown went for the officers weapon, which I would see as justifiably use of force
p33816
aVHave you read the reports coming in, in favor of the officer?
p33817
aVIF those are correct, Michael tried assaulting the officer, not once, but twice.
p33818
aVWe want our officers to show restraint, and if these new reports are true, we have exactly that:  the officer didn't start shooting until Michael started charging a 2nd time, which is more than ample restraint. 
p33819
aVYeah it would seem so now and I don't believe wholly the story being given from Michael's accomplice that the cop was lashing out at Michael from his car window.
p33820
aVHowever I'm still upset that given a breadth of "non-leathal" options that there continues to be numerous cases per year of police using firearms against unarmed suspects, and apparently I'm not the only one:\u000a\u000a[op ed on reuters by former KC police chief](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2014/08/19/as-police-chief-i-knew-we-had-no-justifaction-for-killing-an-unarmed-suspect/)\u000a\u000aBut I'm inclined to agree that in this case it is nowhere near as cut and dry as the example in the reuters piece, and yes if it ends up being the case that Michael did double back then I can see a more excusable use of force than was initially reported.
p33821
aVIf anything, at the end of the day I think this case shows again the need for officer's to start being equipped with personal recording devices to eliminate the back and forth accusations happening now.  \u000a\u000a
p33822
aVImproper training.
p33823
aVOver-militarization of our police forces
p33824
aVMilitarized police departments and a failed War On Drugs are why can't have nice things

aVThis story is so damn sad.

aVThis family is going to be in a state of fear and stress for a long time to come.

aVTheir child will have lasting damage and what would have been a fruitful life will be spent trying to cope with injuries.
p33828
aVI sincerely hope the SWAT team made a trip to the hospital (if allowed to) to express their sympathy and extend any help. 
p33829
aVI hope that members of the SWAT team, as well as their commanding officers, are fired and thrown in jail for what was obviously excessive use of force.
p33830

p33840
aVSpent a lot of money and debt learning how to be a populist robot.
p33841
aVNo real education unless you're specializing. 
p33842
aVI understand downvoters in most reddit threads, but not this time.
p33843
aVYou really have to be a complete moron to not realize there's an issue here.
p33844
aVAnd to the downvoters: BRING IT ON.
p33845
aVYou probably can't even integrate sec(x) dx
p33846
aVNot after Elliot Rodgers, amirite?
p33847
aVI don't see the issue here.
p33848
aVThe purpose of an execution is to kill someone.
p33849
aVWho cares how it happens, as long as it does.
p33850
aVI'm sure that he didn't afford the poor girl he killed a pain free death, so why should he or anyone else get it easy?
p33851
aVPeople in the United States have rights against cruel and unusual punishment as a provision of the [Eighth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the US constitution.
p33852
aVArguments about the general morality of the death penalty aside, most first-world countries that have any sort of punitive justice system have stipulations that enforce consistency and even-handedness in sentencing.
p33853
aVThe idea is to keep the court system as objective as possible, to serve as a source of justice, not retribution or vengeance.
p33854
aVIn this case, the "Unusual" clause of the amendment is important; barring unusual punishments means that as a judge, I cannot knowingly sentence someone to die in a way that is inconsistent with prevailing standards just because I think they "deserve it".
p33855
aVI can't mandate that a convict be crucified, burned at the stake, drawn-and-quartered, stoned to death, fed to pigs, etc.
p33856
aVLikewise I cannot sentence someone to be strapped to a table and administered a procedure that induces a long, lingering heart attack and leaves them partially conscious and gasping feebly for the duration.
p33857
aVRegardless of their crimes, as a country we have decided that even for the most heinous offenders we must not sink into sadism under the guise of being just.

aVad hominem
p33886
aVIt's not ad hominem, it's an honest news event and a critique on the content of one's arguments (and by tertiary one's character for making such arguments).
p33887
aVIt is not a red herring used in response to an argument to distract from said argument (according to the definition of ad hominem).
p33888
aVUnless, of course you are commenting on Ellen Pao's lawsuit against a former employer as being an ad hominem.
p33889
aVThen, of course, yes you are correct that Ellen Pao used an ad hominem attack against a former employer to distract from the real reason that she was fired \u000a\u000aIrony.
p33890
aVI believe that's called a 'political cartoon'
p33891
aVAhhh... yes, satire!
p33892
aVApparently, that's banned here because you are not allowed to criticize the kafkaesque reddit burea-o-kraut-acracy!!
p33893
aV!
aVIt's fine to criticize Reddit, they have problems.
p33894
aVBut who she slept with doesn't really have much to do with her lawsuit.
p33895
aVI agree with you that her lawsuit was unjustified.
p33896
aVBut that's our opinion, not the news.
p33897
aVIt's not ad hominem, but it's editorialized.
p33898
aVFurther, it's an image macro related to current events, but there's no informational material.
p33899
aVI guess you're mod, but if this passes for content in /r/usnews, I'm out.
p33900
aVNot because I disagree with the spirit of the submission, but because I expect a more serious space.
p33901
aVI respect your opinion, and largely agree with you.
p33902
aVIt is, however, the modern day equivalent of a political cartoon.
p33903
aVI do, indeed, ask that people *try* not to editorialize, but I often allow some opinion.
p33904
aVit's impossible not to have opinions and be biased, but it is possible to be honest and diplomatic about it.
p33905
aVI will now, however, cancel my subscription to the New Yorker for their famous, yet editorialized and satirical political cartoons.
p33906
aVI mean, it's the fucking New Yorker.
p33907
aVTheir journalistic integrity shound do better than their famous political cartoons for fuck sake.
p33908
aVUnless, of course, I agree with the editorial opinion being expressed.... then it's A-OK!!

p33917
aVI am open to feedback on my management style.
p33918
aVI've had people try to reset my passowrd, or claim that I'm not active to the reddit mod mods to steal my mod (5k subscribers is mad power yo!).
p33919
aVThat got old so I had to ban those people.
p33920
aVI've got some basic rules, I ask that people try to follow them, although that is entirely subjective so I don't even know what that means.
p33921
aVI'm not super strict because I hate those subs that make up bullshit rules to Censor news they don't like based on selective prosecution and arbitrary enforcement.
p33922
aVif you want to post that I don't know how to do my job, go for it.
p33923
aVI'm happy to have that discussion as long as it is constructive and civil.
p33924
aVI had this one guy that I had to reluctantry ban after numerous warnings, and he changed user names to do a self post accusing me of being some sort of "faggot nigger" if I recall correclty.

aVThat's how much people hate the TSA. 
p33931
aVI think he makes some very good points.
p33932
aVIf all you got from this is that you don't like that he mentioned Tehran in the list of cities that Iran controls then you are just being nit picky about verbage.
p33933
aVNot that difficult to understand.
p33934
aVHe's saying they're already an established power and that we shouldn't allow them to expand their influence to country x, y and z. 
p33935
aVJust to be safe, they probably shouldn't be allowed to control any more cities in Iran.
p33936
aVOtherwise, as more Iranian cities come under the control of Iranians, the rest of the Iranian cities will also come under Iranian influence and the next thing you know, they'll fall like dominoes and then the entire country will be under Iranian control.
p33937
aVIs it just me, or is stuff generally associated with conspiracy theory showing up as real more often than ever?

aVAnd they set up shop in Indianapolis' local gayborhood.

aVIt really bothers me how they put parentheses around every mention of gay marriage or commitment ceramony.
p33942
aVSeems like they don't take it seriously
p33943
aVnoticed that to, does seem unnecessary.
p33944
aVLike they're trying to get one more jab in before the story goes away.
p33945
aVAlso I think it's funny how the store owners say it has got nothing to do with hate; they just think they're sinners and deserve to burn in hell for all eternity to pay for their 'crimes.

aVPrivate businesses can sell their products to anyone they want.  
p33947
aVWhile I don't agree with their sentiments, I agree that as a private business owner, they should be allowed to refuse service.

aVIf I owned a cake shop and wanted to refuse business to a Catholic couple I don't believe in their recognition of the saints, I should be able to do that.   \u000a  
p33949
aVI would sell my cakes to anyone.
p33950
aVThose people forgot the most important rule of business.
p33951
aVLeave emotion at the door.  
p33952
aVI'd draw a line somewhere.
p33953
aVI think everyone does.
p33954
aVI don't think I'd do any mean, racist cakes.  \u000a  \u000a

aV...to become president!!!!
p33962
aV?
aV?
aVIt certainly does make you wonder if Fox would have still done this if the guy being burned alive was "white" and/or American/British.  
p33963
aVYou really are a sad, sad little person.
p33964
aVYour **hate** for a news organization so blinds you to the horror of what is going on outside the borders of our/your country that you will ignore it, or poo poo it as Right Wing Fear Mongering.
p33965
aVIf what these monsters did doesn't turn your stomach, then you truly are a lost soul.
p33966
aVThey aren't the only ones showing it either. 
p33967
aV1.
p33968
aVI don't hate Fox, I find them too outlandish to hate.
p33969
aV2.
p33970
aVOf course I hate what the monsters did, what in the world does that have to do with whether or not I agree with Fox showing the entire footage?
p33971
aV3.
p33972
aVThey haven't showed the full footage of anyone else being executed.
p33973
aVWhy start now, with a Jordanian?
p33974
aVWhy not air/display all the others?  
p33975
aVYou do realise that out of all the other execution videos released by ISIS, this is the only one Fox News have shown?
p33976
aVThey have not shown a single other execution video released by ISIS.
p33977
aVFox is just following W's lead by "catapulting the propaganda".
p33978
aVBut why are aiding ISIS?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p33979
aVBecause they are publicising their material.
p33980
aVThe whole point of a terrorist organisation is attention and terror, give them that and they have won.
p33981
aVRight.
p33982
aVI was saying that Fox News was aiding ISIS by publicizing the ISIS propaganda.
p33983
aVSo, why would they be doing that?
p33984
aVI really think this is disgusting.
p33985
aVIf you wanted any evidence that Fox is perpetuating terror, here it is.
p33986
aVWhats disgusting is what they did to this man.
p33987
aVThis video should be showed to the public; the general public doesn't truly understand the inhumane things this group is doing to people.
p33988
aVBy posting this video I feel they are saying "see we aren't perpetuating terror or fear mongering" this stuff is really happening and we don't support it, we should be trying to stop it.
p33989
aVBut ISIS **WANT** people to watch this.
p33990
aVThey released it.
p33991
aVAll Fox are doing is helping them.
p33992
aVHow are they helping them?
p33993
aVThe audience that news site panders to are not going to change their mind and join ISIS.
p33994
aVInstead of just believing what we are told, they are literally showing you the outcome of an ISIS threat.
p33995
aVI think they are doing a little more due diligence on behalf of the public for a change.
p33996
aVSomething I think you should be happy about rather than hate on them.
p33997
aVThe site is also very clear about what the video is, they didn't just spring it on people.
p33998
aVWhat would your reaction be if CNN or MSNBC posted this video; and try to respond objectively with no emotion.
p33999
aVISIS have been releasing execution videos for months now.
p34000
aVShowing these videos is spreading what ISIS want you to spread, which is fear.
p34001
aVShowing the videos, and them getting air time are exactly what they want.\u000a
p34002
aVIt's easy to take the point of view that whatever they want, we should ensure that the opposite happens.
p34003
aVBut in reality that may not be in the best interests of humanity.
p34004
aVIf they had killed him in secret and someone had recorded it clandestinely, then would you argue that the video *should* be shown because they would rather it *wasn't*?
p34005
aVI can see your point about not wanting to give them attention, but the reality is that they *are* engaging in this kind of indiscriminate killing, and ending their reign of terror may be best accomplished by ensuring unified opposition against them.
p34006
aVPerhaps they have taken the old maxim "no such thing as bad publicity" too literally, and in doing so they may have become their own worst enemy.
p34007
aVIn that case, maybe in the end we are fortunate that this video exists.
p34008
aVDo you not realise that ISIS have released many many other execution videos?
p34009
aVGraphic high-res videos of people, Americans, being beheaded.
p34010
aVAre you aware these videos exist?
p34011
aVWhy did fox only choose to show this one?
p34012
aVI disagree.
p34013
aVThis seems to be different.
p34014
aVMaybe the world needs to see how cruel and inhumane this group is. 
p34015
aVHow are they perpetuating terror?
p34016
aVThis is reality.
p34017
aVIgnoring it won't make it go away.
p34018
aVThere are people around the world, and in America that have forgotten 9/11 .. it is time to wake up to the horrors heading our way.\u000a\u000a
p34019
aVBut these are people who have recorded this act in order to show the world, and all Fox are doing is helping them.\u000a\u000a
p34020
aVBut Fox isn't the only one with it on their website, so attacking them alone is stupid and immature and shows a bias.
p34021
aVIf someone is going to attack them for doing something others are, and the others aren't mentioned, then the attack is done out of hate (an ignorance in that hate).\u000a
p34022
aVShow me another news site with the video embedded?
p34023
aVhttp://www.breitbart.com/\u000ahttp://www.theblaze.com/\u000a\u000aThose are two I know of right off the top of my head and whose sites I've been to and know its there.\u000a\u000a
p34024
aVTwo more outlets that are just as far-right, anti-Islamic and pro-war as Fox. 
p34025
aVSo.... care to provide links to them embedding the video?
p34026
aVThat's right.
p34027
aVYou can't.
p34028
aVBecause they haven't.
p34029
aVIf Fox is taking some "amazing" stance on this, why didn't they show any of the other execution videos?
p34030
aVI hate that the author thought it necessary to put in puns like "highs outweigh the lows" or "pretty dope".
p34031
aVThe Land of the free they said
p34032
aVThis is... what's the word I'm looking for?
p34033
aVOh, right.
p34034
aV_Bullshit._
p34035
aVI feel sorry for the kid and mother.
p34036
aVTimes have changed so much.
p34037
aVI had about the the same amount of freedom as a child.
p34038
aVHad to stay on sidewalks, and couldn't cross major street. 
p34039
aVThis is from August.
p34040
aVWe've already put our pitch forks and torches away.
p34041
aVYeah, I'm going to go ahead and trust the doctors on this until a family member can provide some proof beyond "she still had heart and lung function.
p34042
aV" Unless one of them is in fact a medical professional, I highly doubt they have to knowledge to make that call.
p34043
aVAlso, Fox News
p34044
aVare you retarded or just a college freshmen trying to be trendy? 
p34045
aVRetarded for pointing out a story from a disreputable "news" organization?
p34046
aVDoesn't seem retarded to me.
p34047
aVIn fact the story seems very analogous to anti-ACA "death panel" nonsense.
p34048
aVPerhaps a thinly veiled story designed to erode confidence in the american medical system. 
p34049
aVThat's why I will never put donor on my DL.
p34050
aVNope.
p34051
aVIdiot.
p34052
aVIf you truly consider doctors or the medical establishment as a whole to be so morally corrupt that being murdered by them is a real threat to you, don't worry about your driver's license.
p34053
aVJust think of this: If those doctors truly shut off life support on a living person to illegally procure organs (which I highly doubt), do you really think they will care much about what is written on your driver's license?
p34054
aVMurdering helpless patients to get their organs isn't exactly a petty crime, simply "misinterpreting" a worn driver's license is peanuts compared to that.
p34055
aVCertainly less reckless than killing a 26 year old girl under your care in the presence and under the protest of her immediate family.
p34056
aVJust think of the money they could have made by keeping that brain-dead girl's body; decades of medical care and expensive life support...
p34057
aVIf doctors are this morally corrupt and reckless, you better never set foot into a hospital again, never call an ambulance in medical emergencies again, get treated by professionals for any ailment be it a broken leg or end-stage lung cancer, buy at a pharmacy an so on.
p34058
aVIt won't even help you in case you get in an accident, for it will be others who call in the ambulance.
p34059
aVYou also might be interested to learn that working at a hosptial isn't exactly the easiest way to make quick cash.
p34060
aVIf you've got a medical degree and just want to make money, you won't have to put up with 24+ hour shifts, constant stress, an endless stream of paperwork and emotional turmoil.
p34061
aVYou probably won't find those doctors in emergency rooms or intensive care units.
p34062
aVStill that doesn't make them evil monsters.
p34063
aVPlenty of people are greedy, yet very few are willing to murder others for greed alone.
p34064
aVBut if you are one of the few people in our society that is willing to disregard laws, social norms and any morality whatsoever just to become rich, you won't become a doctor to begin with, much less work at a community hospital in Arlington.
p34065
aVI for one have decided that I rather risk getting cut open alive by an evil surgeon than dying in agonizing pain from an infected wound because I'm too afraid of doctors.
p34066
aVWhy bother with a trial?
p34067
aVWhy waste time and money?
p34068
aVTake him out back and shoot him.
p34069
aVHe claims he didn't do it.
p34070
aVYou remember hearing about those dudes recently who were in jail for 20 some odd years for rape until DNA evidence cleared them?
p34071
aVNot saying this guy didn't do it but he deserves a trial. 
p34072
aVWould anyone claim they did do it?
p34073
aVSome people confess during interrogation and plead guilty. 
p34074
aVYes, some people are coerced into confession, I know.
p34075
aVBut based on my view from 2000 miles away and an armchair law degree, the evidence here is pretty solid.
p34076
aVAnd that's just the stuff they made public - there is always more that law keeps secret.
p34077
aVWhy waste time and money.
p34078
aVHaha, yeah I hear ya, it looks like a pretty strong case against him but if that was the case every time where strong cases resulted in instantaneous execution there would be a lot of fuckups and a lot of innocent dead people.
p34079
aVDid you hear about that kid [TJ Lane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardon_High_School_shooting#Shooter) who shot up a bunch of younger kids, wore a t-shirt to trial that said "killer" written in permanent marker?
p34080
aVI think he's in jail for life and for folks like that I agree they should just get shot.
p34081
aVThey still deserve a trial to keep things on the level but there's no reason to waste money keeping him alive in jail, just kill them with a gun out back and dump his body in a hole or burn him or something.
p34082
aVEh who knows though.
p34083
aVSometimes in movies you see characters execute people and you feel that they are justified and it all happens outside of court.
p34084
aVI think trial is just kind of a safeguard to confer with other people that the execution is just.
p34085
aVFuck him, but everyone deserves a fair trial, and you know it.
p34086
aVDon't be dense.
p34087
aVSpot judgement of one sets an incredibly dangerous precedent.
p34088
aVWho knows, maybe you could be accused of murder and rape tomorrow.
p34089
aVI guarantee if that happened you would want to eat your words. 
p34090
aVYea I agree, innocent until proven guilty and all that, you're right...
p34091
aVWe want the prosecutor to present all the evidence so that everyone can see what a lying, horrible dirtbag this is.
p34092
aVWe don't want anyone feeling sorry for him, thinking he was railroaded.
p34093
aVThey can take big chunks of my taxpayer money to make it clear to all and sundry that this guy is a violent, evil, pathetic coward who feels justified beating someone to death who had the audacity to tell him no.
p34094
aVThe police have eye-witnesses, DNA, other physical evidence.
p34095
aVDisplay it all so that no one can possibly think he had an excuse for doing what he did.
p34096
aVBecause your rights will be as worthless as his if they are denied so callously. 
p34097
aV&gt;The teacher was alone in a classroom with no guard nearby on Jan. 30 when a convicted rapist assaulted her.
p34098
aV&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;\u000a\u000a&gt;The claim says the department "failed miserably" in its duty to keep the teacher and other employees safe.
p34099
aVYeah, I'd say that's a bit of an understatement.
p34100
aVNot going to show that in news...
p34101
aVActually it was just on dateline.
p34102
aVIt's fucked up.
p34103
aVHe didn't put his hands behind his back when the cops told him to.
p34104
aVSo they'll justify choking him to death.
p34105
aVI haven't heard of any charges being brought up on the NM cops whot shot a homeless man to death.
p34106
aVhttp://youtu.be/rrV9plIPySA Cops can do what they want.
p34107
aVGood ol' protect &amp; serve.
p34108
aV'Merica.
p34109
aVWow.
p34110
aVIt looked like he was just starting to get down when they shot him.
p34111
aVThat's fucked up.
p34112
aVI wouldn't go as far as calling him a "gentle giant"-- and before you sharpen your pitchforks, it's only because we don't know this guy.
p34113
aVThat being said, the video is extremely hard to watch.
p34114
aVSure, he pulled his hands away while they tried to cuff him, but once he was on the ground he was cooperative.
p34115
aVAnd why would you ignore his complaints of "I can't breathe"?
p34116
aVEspecially when you got a full grown man shoving his head down for no apparent reason??
p34117
aVLastly, if you're going to be an emergency responder, *respond to the emergency*.
p34118
aVI don't see anyone attempting to give him CPR or in any hurry to give this guy some medical attention.
p34119
aVWhy be an EMT if you just want to stand there and look pretty?
p34120
aVAnyway, this whole thing was so depressing.
p34121
aVIt needs to stop.
p34122
aVok, so you want to jump in there to give him CPR while the cops are on top of him.
p34123
aVTalk about getting shot by the cops if you try to do that.
p34124
aVHaving said that, I'm saying he was innocent or didn't deal illegal cigarettes but getting killed for that is beyond any law. 
p34125
aVIf there's communication, there should not be no forced CPR nor shooting.
p34126
aVThey should all be professionals.
p34127
aVYou mean to tell me someone in handcuffs has never received aid from a first responder?
p34128
aVCome on.
p34129
aVAnd yes, being killed for a petty crime is beyond any law.
p34130
aVThat I do agree with.
p34131
aVI have seen police abuse countless times in my life.
p34132
aVNo, just the left half of the US is.
p34133
aVThe right half has enough or too much.
p34134
aVYeah, it strikes me as more of a matter of poor distribution than actual supply.
p34135
aVCollect, store, and slow rainwater.
p34136
aVYes, probably a coincidence. 
p34137
aVThere is certainly a strong correlation, but more work needs to be done. 
p34138
aVProbably a coincidence unless/until a scientifically verified study demonstrates any kind of causality.  
p34139
aVAgreed.
p34140
aVDo you think there was ever a scientific study during Prohibition to see if making alcohol illegal might have helped Al Capone make $1 Million a week in the 20's?
p34141
aVI don't believe that I've ever heard of one.
p34142
aVAnd the FBI strongly denied that there ever was a organized crime syndicate.
p34143
aVCorrelation does not imply causality.
p34144
aVAbsolutely true.
p34145
aVThere was a rumor that Buddhism had taken hold in parts of the city, so maybe that affected the numbers.
p34146
aVMore people meditating and less people to kill.
p34147
aVwell duh, no shit.
p34148
aVThat asshole pissed me off so much today!
p34149
aVI think I'm gonna grab my gun and put it down cuz damn those trees look good...
p34150
aVThem thugs are too stoned to murder.
p34151
aVThey would, but they spent all their bullet money on pot and munchies.\u000a\u000a
p34152
aVThese statistics are especially convincing considering the short amount of time that this drastic reduction in crime has taken place.
p34153
aVIn just one short year the number of homicides dropped by 52.9%.
p34154
aVSexual assaults were reduced by 13.6%.
p34155
aVRobberies were down by 4.8% and assaults were down by 3.7%.
p34156
aVNot quite.
p34157
aVYou said "in just one short year" but it's only been a few months.
p34158
aVThe sample size is too small.
p34159
aVPresuming those rates are yearly, you have to adjust for seasonality too.
p34160
aVCommon sense dictates that social interaction causes murder, and people aren't out and about during the wintertime that took up most of the nascent legalization period.
p34161
aVYou have to wait a whole year before making inferences.
p34162
aVAnd - let's not forget - when the numbers are small to start with, the percentage change looks bigger on paper.
p34163
aV...this is news?
p34164
aV&gt; Mesa\u2019s attorney, Mark Gardner, said she\u2019s not a pedophile.
p34165
aV&gt;\u201cShe was not preying on people who had no interest in participating,\u201d Gardner said.
p34166
aVI don't think they know what the word 'pedophile' means.
p34167
aVExcept that pedophilia is defined as an attraction to prepubescent children which these kids aren't.
p34168
aVNot sure what the right term is.
p34169
aVI'm sure there is one out there.
p34170
aVEDIT: Holy Shit there are terms for a bunch of age ranges:  \u000a0-3 Nepiophilia Babies  \u000a0-11 Pedophilia--Prepubescent  \u000a11-14 Hebephilia--Pubescent  \u000a15-19 Ephebophilia--Post Pubescent kids  \u000a20+ Teleiophilia--Adults  \u000a60+ Gerontophilia--Elderly  \u000a
p34171
aVThe male sentence would have been death by mob
p34172
aVShagalicious, baby!
p34173
aVApparently not a consequence free environment :(
p34174
aVShe seems like that girl that beat up that autistic chilc, isn't she?\u000a
p34175
aV&gt; She\u2019s facing two counts of electronic solicitation of a minor and could get up to 22 years in prison when sentenced in May\u000a\u000aIs that the male sentence or the female sentence?
p34176
aVSo many fish in the sea and this hoe looks towards school teens?
p34177
aVSchools of fish.
p34178
aVShe took it literally.
p34179
aV52% of 1687 people surveyed.
p34180
aVStatistics annoy me. 
p34181
aVThis has been stretched out for decades in order to put off having to talk about something important like privacy, economic inequality, and corruption.
p34182
aVThis works in tandem with gay marriage.
p34183
aVGay marriage is way more of an actual issue than this.
p34184
aVDenying American citizens their rights based on religious discrimination is appalling and I'm not really sure how you can compare it to smoking weed.
p34185
aVI know couples personally that plan to stay with each other for the rest of their lives, but don't want to get married because they don't see the point.
p34186
aVThey are just "meh" about it.
p34187
aVThere are some fringe benefits, the posterchild reason (filing joint taxes) is not nearly as helpful as people commonly believe.
p34188
aVI actually think it's more of a non-issue than weed.
p34189
aVWeed has medical uses.
p34190
aVFor some people it's the only pain relief they can get.
p34191
aVIt helps in a couple other areas as well.
p34192
aVAs far as the general population, the right to pursue altered states of mind is more basic than the right to be viewed by the state as a single financial entity with your spouse.
p34193
aVAnd we're living in an evolved form of slavery called Capitalism.
p34194
aVThere are way more important issues that need to be resolved rather than rile up the christian bigots so we can have the Dr. Zhivago of circus politics.
p34195
aVI can understand not really caring about the "marriage" part cause I mean really its just a ceremony.
p34196
aVBut since getting married last year my tax situation is better, we pay less for joint health insurance through my employer, get a better rate as a married couple on auto/home insurance relative to being two single people, when we apply for a loan most places will pull both people's credit if they're married and use the lowest rate.
p34197
aVI also understand that many gay couples have issues sometimes with life insurance beneficiaries and other death benefits like from the military.
p34198
aVPossibly you're friends are just young and haven't realized these things yet, or I guess just really don't care which is certainly their right.
p34199
aVAt the end of the day it just really bugs me that there's even a discussion here, there's no ambiguity involved; all American citizens are guaranteed equal rights under the law, its frustrating and infuriating to see politicians wasting their time on this I agree but that doesn't mean the issue should be ignored.
p34200
aVWell we're not actually having a discussion about whether gay people should have their marriages recognized by the government.
p34201
aVI'm saying this is a non-issue because none of the politicians give a flying fuck about gay marriage.
p34202
aVThey are using it to get the most bigoted half of the country to make some noise, so that they can ignore real issues.
p34203
aVYou know, issues like prisons being a private industry.
p34204
aVOr the mass collection of peoples private communications.
p34205
aVNot missed tax credits.
p34206
aVI think gay marriages should be recognized too.
p34207
aVBut I look at it like people marching, holding up progress, expending all this energy writing their congressman, filling up the nightly news, because you can't rent a car before age 25.
p34208
aV&gt; So really?
p34209
aV...you're going to let *this* derail our democracy?
p34210
aVThis is all it takes?\u000a
p34211
aVCut taxes to middle class, as long as you don't cut the cuts to the upper class, everyone will support it.
p34212
aVIn a lot of these cases, they're trying to do both: Either cutting taxes for everyone, or pairing it with cuts for businesses/the wealthy.
p34213
aVIt's always florida
p34214
aVFlorida Woman strikes again.
p34215
aV/r/floridaman
p34216
aVFucking hell... We passed gay marriage, but noooo, we couldn't just have a decent month in Florida.
p34217
aVSorry guys.
p34218
aVThis state sucks.
p34219
aVWish we knew if he/she was infected during Duncan's first or second visit.
p34220
aVNeed an objective source and not a random caller in to The Blaze.
p34221
aV&gt;More than a dozen witnesses... **police sources reportedly told** St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Christine Byers\u000a\u000aNames one anonymous source...\u000a\u000a&gt;**an alleged friend of the officer**, identified only as Josie, shared what she claimed to be Wilson\u2019s recollection of events.
p34222
aVI don't know, that sounds a little fishy.
p34223
aVSo one of the officer's friends just happened to be there?
p34224
aVIs it any more fishy than a bunch of witnesses in an area that has an almost to-the-person distrust and hatred for the cops coming forward and unequivocally saying they saw the officer "Shoot him in the back while his hands were up", something two autopsies so far have yet to show was at all likely?
p34225
aVNo, it's just as fishy.
p34226
aVI don't think we'll ever get a straight story at this point because the witnesses seem to have a bias towards one side or the other.
p34227
aVI'm still kind of wondering about the whole "Bullet fired from inside the squad car.
p34228
aV" It would seem like that would heavily influence how believable either side was if it could be reliably placed in the timeline of the guy getting shot.
p34229
aVSurprisingly,  Glen Becks website may not be impartial news...
p34230
aVThere weren't more than a handful of witnesses in the first place, if any (legitimate ones), let alone more than a dozen

p34233
aVIf his hands were raised to surrender, why are his hands/fingers pointing in the opposite direction, towards his body, in these photos?
p34234
aVIf his hands were raised towards the sky, surrendering, his hands/fingers would be up in front of his body with his fingers pointing away from his body.
p34235
aVWas the body moved?
p34236
aVIf it wasn't, his body position disproves his hands being up to surrender and proves his hands were in a downed, charging position.
p34237
aVEDIT: I actually noticed something else!
p34238
aVLook at his leg positions.
p34239
aVOne is straight out and the other is curved at the knee, as if he was in a running stance....
p34240
aVSo, the people claiming he was on his knees when he was still shot at by the officer are completely incorrect!
p34241
aVAre you an investigator?
p34242
aVIf so, carry on, but more than likely you should just sit down and shut up. \u000a
p34243
aV&gt;but more than likely you should just sit down and shut up.
p34244
aVEveryone should just sit down and shut up while the investigation is going on, but NO ONE is doing that.
p34245
aVSo why are you adding to the noise?
p34246
aVIn fact I saw you copied your comment over to another thread...why?
p34247
aVChill dude/dudette
p34248
aV&gt;So why are you adding to the noise?
p34249
aVBecause both sides deserve to be defended.
p34250
aVIf you look at my history, I actually thought the marks on his arm as being indicative of him with raised hands surrendering.
p34251
aVThis makes it less likely, IMO.
p34252
aVI am sure mostly all of the people paying attention have seen those images.
p34253
aVIt's been right in front of our faces, but no one really noticed it until now.
p34254
aVIt's physical evidence that can be seen and I think that is why it is so important.
p34255
aV&gt; In fact I saw you copied your comment over to another thread...why?
p34256
aVI have copied it many times, mostly so people could point out where I could be incorrect.
p34257
aVWhen I first noticed it, it kind of shocked me.
p34258
aVOnly one person so far has given me an explanation, but it doesn't disprove what I say, just that I can't be sure:\u000a\u000a&gt; ...because your body doesn't freeze frame the moment you die.
p34259
aVOn top of that he fell.
p34260
aVOn top of that, if there was any sort of inertia in any direction, his body would be drastically different then the way it was when it was shot.
p34261
aV&gt;Man...this is speculation at it's finest.
p34262
aVI hope you're not basing your entire opinion on this arm chair forensic investigation\u000a\u000aEDIT: .
p34263
aV&gt;Chill dude/dudette\u000a\u000aI would if I wasn't so afraid of emotions getting the better of everyone.
p34264
aVAny information we can find and add to the whole picture and evaluate is worthy of being posted, IMO
p34265
aVHave the police offered them jobs yet?
p34266
aV&gt;What sets me apart, I think, is a tolerance for risk and an intuition about what will happen in the future.
p34267
aVActually, no, this is what sets you apart sir.
p34268
aV&gt;I was selling pillows made by my family\u2019s business, Pacific Coast Feather Co., to retail stores across the country, and the ........\u000a\u000aYou were born into a family with a nice business.
p34269
aVThat one simple fact gave you a HUGE advantage over most everyone else on this planet.
p34270
aVAnd this simple fact alone is why I'll be one of the men holding those pitchforks and I can't wait to stick it into some fat cat and make him squeal.
p34271
aVYou see while you were growing up in your nice rich family, I was putting water on my cereal in a trailer park.
p34272
aVMy dad died at 15 from a preventable medical condition, he didn't have good health insurance you see.
p34273
aVThis left me stuck with my crack addict and alcoholic mother.
p34274
aVFlat out, as a man who started this life with zero material advantages coming from a trailer park and a very poor family, I know that I will never have a chance to live the kind of life that those born into richer families will lead.
p34275
aVOk, maybe a tiny chance.
p34276
aVBut it's only somewhat more likely than winning the lottery.
p34277
aVBottomline is that most of the people who are wealthy and powerful started out that way or at least with a leg up over others.
p34278
aVSince there was never a level playing field for the rich to take such massive advantage of their power and fuck everyone else over is completely unacceptable.
p34279
aVIf the capitalists would just stay out of politics maybe, just maybe we could balance things enough to keep the civilization going.
p34280
aVBut there is no fucking limit to the greed, rapacity and selfishness of the wealthy.
p34281
aVThey avoid taxes anyway they can, they speak out against and fund opposition to programs that help people who weren't born with the rich man advantage.
p34282
aVThey manipulate the governments to lower pollution standards so they can poison us and increase their profits.
p34283
aVThey manipulate the government into wars and get thousands of us poor folk killed.
p34284
aVThey can't even create jobs for us because they are to busy offshoring them to countries with lower standards of living or importing immigrants that will work for lower wages!
p34285
aVThe majority of the ills of society can be laid at the feet of those with power.
p34286
aVIt was those with the power who made this society and it is those with the money who have the power.
p34287
aVIt's time to pay the fucking bill for all that.
p34288
aVAll of those "externalities" are about to take the form of a lynch mob and oh my god how you rich fuckers deserve it.

aVHey man, I'm gonna very direct and honest with you because I don't have a lot of time.
p34298
aVFuck your capitalism.
p34299
aVIt aint working for me and mine.
p34300
aVFuck your capitalism right in it's fucking diseased distended asshole.
p34301
aVIf we manually restored the income distribution to 1950's levels, how much of a "windfall" check would I receive from the 1%ers if my current salary is $30k/yr?
p34302
aVConversely, how much is James Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, giving up of his $18.7million salary?
p34303
aVWell considering that this is a total pipe dream I would hazard a guess that our windfall will be something in between jack and squat.
p34304
aVAs for the CEO of JPMorgan and Chase he couldn't be reached for comment as he was busy doing a line of cocaine off a prostitute's ass.
p34305
aVMore importantly... What is the D2F ratio in this middle-out economy?
p34306
aVI have no idea what that is.
p34307
aVIn fact it is such an arcane term that it defies easy and quick google look up as well.
p34308
aVBut somehow I reckon you were expecting my ignorance on this subject.
p34309
aVEnlighten me?
p34310
aVHaha, no.
p34311
aVAlthough I was looking for an actual answer to the question I posed, I wasn't trying to stump, just making a lighthearted joke.
p34312
aVIt is a reference to a joke made on an episode of Mike Judge's HBO series [Silicon Valley](http://youtu.be/pE4LVSESyXc). 
p34313
aVThat explains all the silicon valley references that kept popping up when I would try to figure out what a D2F ratio was.
p34314
aVGood to know Mike Judge is still in business! 
p34315
aVFairies, fudge packers, and boingo boys rejoice!
p34316
aVThe Hoosiers slapped down and the rump rangers have won!
p34317
aVThe judge is a racist.
p34318
aVJus' sayin'
p34319
aVHow is this okay?
p34320
aVIt's okay by SJW standards only.
p34321
aVPersonally I hope this judge catches a bullet.
p34322
aVWhile I agree, my issue is with the fact deadly force is used for a running suspect because his tail light was out.
p34323
aVIf he had just shot someone else then tried to run.. maybe justified.
p34324
aVOh and also tampering with the scene thing too.
p34325
aVHow about... Let's stop running from police officers?
p34326
aVEveryone likes to act like all cops are criminals.
p34327
aVIf they are, then stop running and just cooperate!
p34328
aVIf a guy came up to me with a gun, I wouldn't just start running.
p34329
aVI'd do what he says. \u000a
p34330
aV"Just do what the police say" hasn't worked out very well for a lot of people in the past.
p34331
aVYOU wouldn't run, but he did.
p34332
aVAnd that doesn't mean he needed to die.
p34333
aVI said he  needed to die?
p34334
aVAnd you are saying.
p34335
aVEven if he cooperated.
p34336
aVHe'd still would have been shot?
p34337
aVWhat is wrong with you guys here.
p34338
aVSo much ignorant rage. 
p34339
aVThe police officer is the one that decided the victim needed to die when he drew his weapon and initiated deadly force over what had started out as a minor infraction.
p34340
aVThan while the victim lay bleeding out he chose to tamper with the scene of a crime rather than provide assistance.
p34341
aVBoth parties made some serious errors in judgment, but it doesn't mean either one needed to die because of those bad decisions. 
p34342
aVWhen did I say he needed to be shot?
p34343
aVSweet shit. 
p34344
aVQuit trying to misdirect.
p34345
aVNo one claimed that you said that.
p34346
aVIn fact, my response indicated as much pointing out THE OFFICER decide he needed to die not you.
p34347
aVQuit being so defensive of a guy that may very well get convicted for murder. 
p34348
aVI didn't say that you said he needed to die, no.
p34349
aVEven if he cooperated, he *may* have been shot.
p34350
aVThat's not what happened, so it's impossible to know.
p34351
aVYou're right the likelihood would have been lower, but again there are plenty of instances where complying with police orders leads to bodily harm or death for the suspect.
p34352
aVSomeone wanted the day off.
p34353
aVJust like the Miami. 
p34354
aVHey Hey!
p34355
aVA friend of mine went to high school with that guy and a number of people I know worked with him.
p34356
aVApparently he was never the most tactical nuke in the arsenal.
p34357
aVIt really was lighting the second fore that pooched him.
p34358
aVThis is scary for me because I accadentally left my hotplate on last night when I went to bed
p34359
aVYa, you should probably not do that.
p34360
aVTo me, this is just more evidence that you should never cooperate with social services when it comes to your kids.
p34361
aVParade the kids out, let them see that they're clean, healthy, and uninjured, then tell them to get off your property.
p34362
aVThe people that cooperate with social workers requests end up getting their kids taken, but the ones that threaten them with bodily harm are allowed to keep their children.
p34363
aVThe whole damn system is broken, and if you give them an inch they'll take your kids.
p34364
aVI was about to make my own comments on this article, but at the bottom the author already touched upon why I think the authorities are most likely doing this.
p34365
aVthey do not like the home schooling, it takes the children out of public view and control.
p34366
aVwhen the parents have that right.
p34367
aVEvolution is a matter of survival of the fittest according to the situations confronted with, if everyone was that passive sheep and all hell broke lose then most people wouldn't survive, diversity is good.\u000a
p34368
aVIt seems pretty obvious that they had them under surveillance, who calls the cops on a neighbor because his kids are playing in snow and taking pictures?
p34369
aVYou don't believe there are judgemental assholes that would do this because they don't agree with someones lifestyle and are looking for some way to mess with said people? 
p34370
aVSure I believe it, but you don't just send a squad like that down there based on a "kids in the snow" phone call.
p34371
aVThere is some history here that is not in the article.
p34372
aVTheir "Mineral Supplement" is a dangerous toxic Bleach-like product sold to be drank to cure AIDS, cancer, and many other ailments like your standard snake-oil.
p34373
aVIt has caused many deaths over the last decade and several people have been jailed or sued over its sale.
p34374
aVThey rely mostly on straw sales, by selling it for one purpose and convincing people to drink it as snake oil.
p34375
aVThis event is being used as a marketing campaign to further sales.
p34376
aVThe product relies on a HUGE Internet PR campaign.
p34377
aVIn many reddit posts there seems to be commenters helping to advertise this product and dilute facts with fake-science nonsense.

p34386
aVI loathe the idea that the state has a right to take children away from loving parents.
p34387
aVBut the truth is any other world would not be one I'd want to live in.
p34388
aVSometimes love is experessed in misguided ways, and at that point the state's obligation to the child exceeds their obligation to the parent.
p34389
aVChildren have rights too.
p34390
aVIt's a fuzzy area, clearly, but it's not appropriate to call it 'medical kidnapping', and it's deeply disingenuous represent it as 'taking the children away just because the parent's don't follow the state's opinions'.
p34391
aVIt's reductionist reasoning, and it doesn't wash.
p34392
aVJust look at the pics!
p34393
aVThose kids look *so* unhealthy!
p34394
aV/s
p34395
aVMan, fuck these assholes.
p34396
aVThey're already taxing fuel.
p34397
aVPerhaps if they didn't spend all of our tax money on themselves and other stupid shit, we wouldn't have crumbling bridges and roads.  
p34398
aVWith gas prices dipping to their lowest level in years, lawmakers in state capitals throughout the USA are increasingly open to the idea of raising fuel taxes to help rebuild crumbling roadways and bridges.
p34399
aVThe movement at the state level comes as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week that he's doubtful that there will be enough backing for a bi-partisan push to raise the federal gas tax, which has stood at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.
p34400
aVThe Obama administration has also declined to endorse raising the federal gas tax to finance road funding, but says it will take a look at anything Congress comes up with.
p34401
aVState legislators and governors, however, aren't waiting for Washington.
p34402
aVRepublican leaders who typically find talk of raising taxes a non-starter are making the issue a priority in 2015, even though polling consistently has shown broad opposition among Americans to fuel tax hikes.
p34403
aV"The states have shown that they are more likely to act on the gas tax than the federal government is," said Carl Davis, a senior policy analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.
p34404
aV"The states have to balance their budgets.
p34405
aVIf they see, their roads are in bad shape or their bridges are literally falling down\u2014in some cases\u2014they need to come up with a way to pay to improve that.
p34406
aVAnd there's a limited number of things you can do at the state level.
p34407
aV"\u000a\u000aThe increased chatter in state capitals about raising fuel taxes comes after eight states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming) have done just that over the last two years.
p34408
aVSouth Dakota Gov.
p34409
aVDennis Daugaard noted in his State of State speech on Tuesday that when South Dakota last raised its fuel tax 16 years ago, the price of gasoline hovered around $1 per gallon, and about 22% of that went toward state fuel tax.
p34410
aVThe average price for regular unleaded gas in South Dakota is $1.99 per gallon, and the national average is $2.08.
p34411
aVMeanwhile, the price of road construction has ballooned.
p34412
aVIn 2003, the state could get buy about 7.8 miles of asphalt overlay for $1 million.
p34413
aVIn 2013, that same amount of money could pay for 4.5 miles of asphalt overlay.
p34414
aV"Our state highway system is the state's most valuable physical asset and if we want to maintain it, we must act now," said Daugaard, a Republican, who proposed raising the fuel tax by 2 cents per gallon in 2015 and an additional 2 cents each year going forward.
p34415
aVIn Iowa, Republican Gov.
p34416
aVTerry Branstad and Iowa lawmakers have tossed around raising the 22 cents per gallon fuel tax\u2014which has remain unchanged since 1989\u2014or potentially allowing voters in each county to vote for a 1% sales tax.
p34417
aVThe increased revenue would stay in the counties that levy such taxes to be used on road improvements.
p34418
aV"I think Iowans like the idea of having some say on this," Branstad told reporters last week.
p34419
aVRepublican leaders in Utah's legislature have also signaled they will take a look at the state's gas tax, which hasn't been raised since 1998, as they try to grapple with a transportation funding shortfall there.
p34420
aVIn Louisiana, the state's Transportation Funding Task Force has forwarded a number of ideas to lawmakers.
p34421
aVLouisiana has a backlog of $12 billion in road repairs.
p34422
aVAmong the ideas are to replace the state gas tax with a sales tax on all fuels, direct more money in the construction budget to road work, and steer dollars to highways that would end up in the state's "rainy day" fund.
p34423
aVThe intense debate on the gas tax in New Jersey could have ramifications for Gov.
p34424
aVChris Christie's potential 2016 White House bid.
p34425
aVA Garden State trust fund that pays for road and bridge repair is on the verge of bankruptcy, and some lawmakers in Trenton are pushing for an increase in the state's gas tax to replenish it.
p34426
aVGoing along with that idea is a tricky proposition for Christie, who could find himself trying to show his conservative bonafides with Republican donors and primary voters, many who see any increase in taxes as toxic.
p34427
aVThe idea of raising the state gas tax is also unpopular with New Jersey motorists, who enjoy one the lowest gas taxes in the country.
p34428
aVFifty-six percent of residents said they oppose a raise in the state's gas tax, compared to 41% who support it, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton poll published in December.
p34429
aVOne proposal that's been floated by Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski would increase the state gas tax by 25 cents per gallon, costing the average New Jersey motorist about $292 more per year.
p34430
aVChristie did not address the gas tax or transportation funding issues in his much-anticipated State of the State address on Tuesday.
p34431
aVNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie gives the annual\u000aNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie gives the annual State of the State address on January 13, 2015 in Trenton, New Jersey.
p34432
aVChristie did not address an ongoing debate in the state about whether to raise the gas tax.
p34433
aV(Photo: Andrew Burton, Getty Images)\u000aIn Georgia, lawmakers are taking a hard look at the state's 4% sales tax and the 7.5 cents per gallon excise tax as traffic congestion has become a bigger problem for the state.
p34434
aVA study committee recently found that the state needs to raise at least $1 billion more a year to repair bridges and roads in the Peach State.
p34435
aVMichigan is taking a different tact.
p34436
aVThe GOP-controlled legislature there approved a plan last month for a ballot initiative to boost the sales tax to help pay for road repairs.
p34437
aVMichigan Gov.
p34438
aVRick Snyder signed legislation on Monday to spend $1.3 billion a year more to fix roads and other transportation infrastructure, but it's contingent on Michigan voters increasing the state sales tax from 6% to 7% in the May 5 ballot initiative.
p34439
aVMeanwhile, in Tennessee, Republican Gov.
p34440
aVBill Haslam has warned that the state has to do something soon to deal with its crumbling infrastructure.
p34441
aVThe gas tax hasn't been raised there in nearly 26 years.
p34442
aV"At some point and time soon\u2026I think there will be a bill about gas tax," Haslam recently told The Tennessean editorial board .
p34443
aV"It's incumbent upon us as the administration to show here's what we would do with that money if you increased the fuel tax, and then it's also I think important for all of us not to just increase it so that ... three years from now we're back in the same position.
p34444
aV"
aVAlways great to see our elected leaders being so myopic. 
p34445
aVso how is this guy not labeled a terrorist?
p34446
aVSo a guy who is in trouble with the law is asked to give the FBI information about anything abnormal "in exchange for favourable treatment in an unrelated case".
p34447
aVSo hearsay!
p34448
aVAnd yet where are the American reports of this action, or is the BBC trying something out for the State?
p34449
aVHave to keep in mind this kinda stuff happens fairly often.
p34450
aVThe American Gov't would be terrified if every instance was reported on in it's domestic media.
p34451
aVThen again, most people wouldn't notice due to a marathon of Duck Dynasty. 
p34452
aVWonderful news!
p34453
aVLess smoking and better detection, prevention and treatment are attributed.
p34454
aVI don't know if I'm supposed to be surprised about this.
p34455
aVIt seemed pretty obvious from the beginning that saying it was north Korea was purely because of things that can easily be faked.
p34456
aVIts a good article, but the title should be "why North Korea may not have been responsible for the Sony hack"
p34457
aVDUH.
p34458
aVIt was all done, in my opinion, with the help of the government, as a distraction and to see how they can control people.
p34459
aVLook at all the drones who went to the movies yesterday thinking it was patriotic? 
p34460
aV[Alabama Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrimMyOoEDA)\u000a
p34461
aVThis Alabama man is also a criminal who drove over a police officer during the chase.
p34462
aVNot saying the lawyers aren't scumbags, but it's hard to feel sorry for this guy.
p34463
aVMeh.
p34464
aVI can't bring myself to feel sorry for a cop.
p34465
aVFuck them.
p34466
aVWho would expect a different outcome?
p34467
aVInteresting.
p34468
aVAt first I thought that was completely excessive, but indeed the involvement of bodily fluids is certainly unacceptable. 
p34469
aVThat's what a wet-willy is though, he didn't hurt the guy.
p34470
aVThe only reason this is a felony assault charge is because the cop got embarrassed and wanted the most revenge possible.
p34471
aVI don't know of another charge he could have gotten but this is purely a cop tacking a felony onto someone's record for life for being embarrassed.
p34472
aVI can understand a felony assault charge for an AIDS patient spitting blood into someone's mouth but this is very far away from that.
p34473
aVWhat irks me too is the fact that police probably wouldn't respond to a call of someone giving a wet-willy to someone else and the person who got the willy in the first place would just shrug it off.
p34474
aVThis is a cop though so it is felony assault, which isn't fitting at all.
p34475
aVPetty revenge. 
p34476
aVI'm sure it was overblown, but I really don't think this is that ridiculous.
p34477
aVHe was drunk and he shoved his saliva covered finger in someone's ear.
p34478
aVThat person happened to be a cop.
p34479
aVAlthough I acknowledge it probably would have been lesser for someone who had done this to a civilian, but, I don't doubt for a second that someone *could* press charges for this same thing.
p34480
aVIt's an invasion of that person and the body fluids could indeed transmit a disease.
p34481
aVPeople need to be more careful about their actions, I don't know what that guy expected when he did that to a cop (he probably didn't know either, he was drunk).
p34482
aV WTF was that guy thinking?
p34483
aVOh lets give a police officer a wet-willy and see what happens?
p34484
aVHe was shitfaced so he really wasn't thinking, he was thinking "hey I'm a gonna give this cop a wet willy teehee!".
p34485
aVCop should have taken him in for public intox instead of trying to get him charged with felonious assault.
p34486
aVThat's just petty, like mess up this guy's future by making him seem violent on future job applications petty, so destructively petty when it sounded more like an innocent and playful "attack". 
p34487
aVUhhhh.
p34488
aVNo.
p34489
aVYou don't touch anyone that doesn't want to be touched and you absolutely don't put bodily fluids inside their body.
p34490
aVIt is assault also.
p34491
aVThe cop doesn't decide what to charge him with. 
p34492
aVbut if that wasn't a cop there's no way this would ever be considered a felony
p34493
aV&gt;You don't touch anyone that doesn't want to be touched\u000a\u000aoh, like arresting, handcuffing, and taking someone somewhere against their will?
p34494
aVThat's his job...
p34495
aVThere's people that do that \u000a\u000aPutting your finger in someone's ear isn't the same thing. 
p34496
aVI'd rather get a wet-willy than be kidnapped.
p34497
aVCool, next time an old lady pinches my cheek I'll press charges for assault.
p34498
aVWhen you say "bodily fluids" you're evoking imagery of people spitting AIDS infected blood into someone's mouth which is dangerous and why that counts as assault.
p34499
aVSomeone sticking a finger in someone else's ear for a wet-willy is not the same in scope or severity.
p34500
aVThe cop decided to charge him with felonious assault and through a plea deal with the judge he was able to get it reduced to a lesser charge.
p34501
aVIt is absolutely the cop who decided what to write on the ticket. 
p34502
aVYou can't compare an old lady pinching your cheeks to someone walking up and putting their spit in your ears.
p34503
aVI can't believe you even said that. 
p34504
aVYes you can, pinching someone's cheek and giving someone a wet willy are both meant to be playful.
p34505
aVIf the guy pinched the cop's cheek the cop still would have arrested him, that's the whole point.
p34506
aVCop overreacted to something most people brush off.
p34507
aVWhen you say "putting their spit in your ears" you're more saying spitting in someone's face and that takes it out of context.
p34508
aVYou should call it what it is; a wet willy.
p34509
aVHe licked his finger and stuck it in the guy's ear and twirled it around as a razz. 
p34510
aVYou aren't allowed to do that to anyone.
p34511
aVYou wouldn't let it go if it wasn't someone you knew.
p34512
aVYou'd want to press charges.
p34513
aVYou're literally the stupidest person I've ever encountered 
p34514
aVIn most cases people are just bothered by it if they don't share they in the humor, and in most cases it doesn't lead to felony assault charges.
p34515
aVCan you imagine if a third grader got a felony assault charge for giving someone a wet willy?
p34516
aVThat's because it doesn't happen.
p34517
aVIf someone telling you this is the stupidest person you've ever encountered you should probably get out more. 
p34518
aVChange "pinches my cheek" to "spits at my face" and maybe you've got a valid comparison.
p34519
aVIt's assault.
p34520
aVThough to be honest, randomly pinching a cop's cheek would likely get you arrested all the same.
p34521
aVYou just don't do that.
p34522
aVSee, that changes the intent.
p34523
aVPinching a cheek and giving a wet willy have similar intent.
p34524
aVSpitting in someone's face and punching them are more similar in intent than giving someone a wet willy. 
p34525
aVJust because you didn't intend to commit a crime doesn't make it any less a crime.
p34526
aVDeserving of a lesser punishment, perhaps, but still a crime.
p34527
aVAnd don't tell me you'd just shrug it off if some random asshole came up to you on the street and shoved his slimy wet finger into your ear.
p34528
aV&gt;Deserving of a lesser punishment, perhaps, but still a crime.
p34529
aVExactly, the dude thankfully didn't get charged with felony assault which is what the cop wanted to hit him with.
p34530
aVAnd I wouldn't shrug it off but I definitely wouldn't flag down a cop and potentially ruin a guy's life over it by getting him charged with a violent felony. 
p34531
aVThis stolen trailer is... stolen, you say? 
p34532

aVI imagine that stealing the truck was almost secondary,  since it sounds like they also robbed the shop.
p34535
aVI wonder if they even knew what was in the truck when they took it.

aVThe fact that this happened at all is horrifying and he should be charged, but the more disturbing thing is that his lawyer wanted the case dismissed "because his job as a police officer provides immunity from prosecution.

aVYears ago when my children were little a neighbor had a 4 year old who would slip out at night to visit grandma one street up.
p34560
aVThey ended up putting in a lock high enough that she couldn't reach it with a chair and at some point she outgrew her need for late night adventure. \u000a
p34561
aVWe are already putting the wobbly door knob covers on door knobs and I'm putting an out of reach chain lock on the basement door today.

aVYes, yes, it is reprehensible and all that jazz.
p34566
aVBut it is also a little bit funny in a twisted sort of way.
p34567
aVIt illustrates why the referendum system doesn't work and why California has such a broken government.   
p34568
aVThe ballot measure is called the "Sodomite Suppression Act", sounds like someone's trying to suppress something!
p34569
aVKamala Harris is absolutely right about the bill creating attention for it's sponsors.
p34570
aVThis is just publicity for a hate group.
p34571
aVThe state court would be wise to relive her of her duties in processing this.
p34572
aVLikewise, this proposal should be in and of itself be grounds for an investigation into whatever hate groups thought to put if forward. 
p34573
aVThats scary that the idea got that far.

p34575
aV... What.

p34577
aVFUCK?
p34578
aVPropaganda hour...
p34579
aVWow this could be just the most epic shit ever.
p34580
aVFirst the Fed herds millions and millions of new customers into the for profit insurance industry with the carrot of lower rates/no preexisting conditions and the stick of tax mandates.
p34581
aVThen just after all that sweeeeet money flows in the Supreme's tip the whole thing over and everyone has to pay the old rates at the old rules or walk away from what they have already given the insurance cartels.
p34582
aVFucking classic.
p34583
aVDoes this mean that since I lost my job last year, and spent more than three months uninsured, I won't have to pay the fine?
p34584
aV....I'm still not insured....
p34585
aVSince the title is misleading, here is the salient point of the article:\u000a\u000a&gt;At issue is whether residents of the 34 states where the federal government runs the health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act can receive premium tax subsidies.
p34586
aVAffordable Care Act opponents argue that a strict interpretation of the language in the statute indicates people can only receive federal subsidies if they purchase policies on an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d  \u000a\u000aSo I don't know what dickwads are opposing this, but it seems to be a technicality.
p34587
aVAll the states have to do is establish their own exchange, which is easier said than done, of course.
p34588
aVNot sure whats misleading.
p34589
aVHere's another quote.
p34590
aV&gt;Could the change be accomplished quickly?
p34591
aVJudging by the time it took the 16 states that have already established their own exchanges, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d\u000a
p34592
aVRescues don't authorize foreign wars and contracts with congressman stock holder companies.
p34593
aVBecause if they had rescued them then  that is one less event that helps control the human populous by/with fear. 
p34594
aVSo if the British were so upset about it, and so sure; why didn't they send their own team?
p34595
aVThey're certainly capable of it, although without the logistical support of the US it would have been more difficult--but not impossible.
p34596
aVThis seems like a fish trap right here.
p34597
aVIf Obama had decided on the raid in June instead of waiting on fresh intel, and SOF operators had been killed, you could bet your bottom dollar he'd be in it even worse from these people.
p34598
aVI think a lot of people underestimate the decision making process that occurs here and fail to put themselves into these shoes.
p34599
aVIt's obvious that the damage done in the propaganda war and elsewhere could be much worse than even 20 dead hostages would be.
p34600
aVIf ISIS could claim eliminating a US Special Operations team, they'd be recruiting on that like no one's business.
p34601
aVThat would be the number one thing I'd want to avoid given the same set of decisions.
p34602
aVYeah, I agree.
p34603
aVI don't think anything wrong was done here.
p34604
aVJust a political talking point.
p34605
aVCan someone explain to me why he had to wait 22 years on death row before he was executed?
p34606
aVWere they unsure of evidence and wanted to make absolutely sure he was the perpetrator?
p34607
aVI mean they would only need like 5-10 years for that right?
p34608
aVAren't they hemorrhaging money keeping him on death row instead of executing him as soon as possible?
p34609
aVIndeed. 
p34610
aVI'm inclined to believe that after 10 years a person is mentally not the same person anymore.
p34611
aVWith this logic, this man is not the same man they incarcerated 22 years ago; we killed an innocent man.
p34612
aVBut, in his past life or whatever you're getting at....he killed someone and raped their wife. 
p34613
aVI see it like beating a doge for shitting in your living room last Tuesday.
p34614
aVBeating a dog is bad enough, but there is no way the punishment is any longer relevant to the action, especially in the mind of the dog.
p34615
aVBut when you Govern a community, you can't allow shitting on the carpet.
p34616
aVIt's a bad precedent.  
p34617
aVA 16, 15, 11, and 3 year old all home alone while the parents were out of town.
p34618
aVThat seems a bit reckless.
p34619
aVReally?
p34620
aVPeople hire 16-year olds and even younger to babysit their children!
p34621
aVThis fact is one of the arguments that Florida legislators used against a minimum wage.
p34622
aVI clearly don't understand what it means to try someone as an adult if a judge has to consider if an 11 year old should be tried as such. 
p34623
aVTo the story- damn, that is horrible\u000a\u000aTo the commentators- 16 year olds babysit their younger siblings all the time.
p34624
aVOlder kids bully younger ones.
p34625
aVThis sounds like te fifteen year old went nuts and dragged her entire family down with her
p34626
aVYeah it does.
p34627
aVThe 16 year old is a stretch being home for extended time alone (sure as hell wouldn't have let mine at 16) but the others are WAY too young.
p34628
aVEspecially 3, WTF?
p34629
aVSo 2 idiots have 4 kids together and in typical idiot fashion leave town with their children unsupervised and their guns unsecured.
p34630
aVWhat a shocker when something tragic happens.
p34631
aVMore importantly, the son was beating up the much younger daughter.
p34632
aVI can only assume that this is what was said by the girl who murdered the boy so I'd take that with a grain of salt unless there is clear evidence of substantial abuse which the article doesn't specify.
p34633
aVI have 2 older sisters and they beat up on me when we were younger all the time.
p34634
aVWe remain very close and I never once even contemplated trying to seriously injure let alone murder either of my siblings.
p34635
aVI hear you and am certainly not trying to justify the killing.
p34636
aVI just wanted to point out that these two at least thought that they were being abused, that the killing seemed to be a sort of defense.
p34637
aVRather than, say, trying to get the brother's money or as jealous revenge.
p34638
aVAnd to address your point, get personal, I was also beat-up a bit by my older brother.
p34639
aVFor the most part not a big deal, but at times I was on fire with frustration that no adult would take the bullying seriously - at times, in my youth, I was honestly afraid.
p34640
aVAnd that was from my nice brother, think about how some brothers take things further.
p34641
aVI would not discount those girls' motives.
p34642
aV&gt; the killing seemed to be\u000a\u000aFor now, lets not speculate and see what the investigators come up with.
p34643
aVI was correct, actually.
p34644
aVJournalists at least are reporting that the older brother was extremely abusive.
p34645
aVPretty easy to read between the lines there.
p34646
aVCan self-defense be argued?
p34647
aVAn 11-year old was being beat up by a 16-year old........
p34648
aVI suppose that the sisters could have run or could have called the police, but I don't do those things when I am attacked and I am an adult.
p34649
aVI fight back.
p34650
aVThe more people carry, the more irresponsible people carry.
p34651
aVIt's inevitable. 
p34652
aVI don't know all the details here, but as someone that grew up around guns, I was taught that you don't transport or even walk around with a loaded gun, with a bullet in the chamber, or with the safety off. 
p34653
aVAs someone who also was raised around guns you don't let your toddler dig around your purse when you made the decision to carry it for your protection.
p34654
aVIt's one of those added perks you must have mentally when you do decide to carry,  need to be aware of your firearm at all times.
p34655
aVTerrible news story but does sound negligent.
p34656
aVIn the end we are allowed to carry firearms for our protection and with that comes responsibilities.
p34657
aVLike limiting access to your loaded firearm from your 2 year old when you are browsing at WalMart.
p34658
aVI don't picture this kid as quick draw McGraw.
p34659
aVHe fiddled in her purse, he unzipped the compartment,  he did or did not have to fiddle with the safety which is odd, and he did not have to load a round in a chamber( which is not really an issue as its up to how comfortable the user wants to carry their firearm).
p34660
aVI carry with no round in chamber but have friends who do.
p34661
aVThen he gets to swing it around and aim it at his moms head.
p34662
aVWth is she doing this whole time?
p34663
aVCurious what the security footage shows but doesnt sound like good on the side of smart choices.
p34664
aVIts a two year old and I did not read the article.
p34665
aVWas he sitting in the buggy?
p34666
aVIf yes why did she lay her purse where it could be grabbed..
p34667
aVPut it on the bottom or in the basket or keep it on your shoulder..if its uncomfortable then don't carry into the store..
p34668
aV"[Veronica] wasn\u2019t carrying a gun because she felt unsafe.
p34669
aVShe was carrying a gun because she was raised around guns.
p34670
aVThis was just a horrible accident.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd this is one of the big problems America has in a nutshell.
p34671
aVThere was absolutely no reason to be carrying a gun, her own family admits that the woman carried it simply because of the gun culture she is associated with.
p34672
aVThis story is a ringing indictment of how gun-culture is killing us, literally.
p34673
aVI see people arguing that she was a good gun-owner, that just makes it worse.
p34674
aVThe obvious truth that this story avoids is that this could not have happened without the presence of a gun.
p34675
aV"We are gun people".
p34676
aVCletus, I think I may have found the problem. 
p34677
aV&gt; \u201cThey are painting Veronica as irresponsible, and that is not the case,\u000a\u000aShe let a 2 year old kid shoot her in the head with her own gun.
p34678
aVSo yes, you are fucking irresponsible.
p34679
aVThe only good part about it is that she was the one that got shot rather than a random shopper, which it could easily have been.
p34680
aVWhile tragic, this event underscores the truth that carrying a weapon outside of your person is the most retarded thing ever. 
p34681
aVI like how they added that witnesses confirmed that the shooting was accidental... Nah, the two year old kid definitely planned this whole fucking scenario out. 
p34682
aV"In the US state of Idaho..." Ah, must be the nanny state of England. 
p34683
aVsorry, what do you mean by that?
p34684
aVI understand England is a nanny state, but what does that have to do with the quote specifically?
p34685
aVCheers!
p34686
aVSo, nobody in this sub is willing to even consider that perhaps if there weren't so many people carrying guns in the US the number of fatal shootings would be reduced.
p34687
aVAlthough that was a predictable response, it's still pretty amazing.
p34688
aVWhat about all those police shootings that have people rioting in the streets?
p34689
aVI suppose only a communist would suggest that perhaps police officers would be less likely to shoot suspected criminals if there wasn't such a good chance of said suspect being armed.
p34690
aVOh well, carry on then.
p34691
aVPlenty more stories where this one came from.
p34692
aVMake cars illegal to cut back on auto accidents.
p34693
aVCars are designed to transport people.
p34694
aVGuns are designed to kill people.
p34695
aVYou haven't seen Death Proof, have you.
p34696
aVSlow down man, you're going way to fast there.
p34697
aVRegister guns like we do cars so we can keep better tabs on who is and isn't using them properly.
p34698
aVGuns in the US are required to be registered.
p34699
aVSo if I sell a gun to my neighbor, I have to go to the courthouse and sign the title of ownership over?
p34700
aVThe sale is entered into a database so that one could enter a gun ID and see who the registered owner is?
p34701
aVNope, didn't think so.
p34702
aVWhat we have (speaking as a person who used to sell firearms for a living) is a disposition list of who made it and who it was initially sold to.
p34703
aVThat's it.
p34704
aVAnd anyone who suggests more responsible tracking is shot down by the paranoid gun-nuts in this country who think the UN is going to fly in with black helicopters and steal their guns. 
p34705
aVAnd, in addition to protesting and rioting, what is the public response to police officers shooting and killing members of the public?
p34706
aVShooting police officers, of course.
p34707
aV50 police officers were shot and killed in the US in 2014.
p34708
aVGun safety, indeed. 
p34709
aVWhen are Americans going to get serious about gun control?
p34710
aVHow does this have anything to do with gun control.
p34711
aVShe legally purchased the gun.
p34712
aVShe legally held a CCW.
p34713
aVShe simply wasn't practicing safe gin handling. 
p34714
aVThe gin handling was weak, needed some tonic. 
p34715
aVNicely done sir. 
p34716
aVThe much better question is when we will get serious about gun safety, but nice attempt at putting a spin on this woman's irresponsibility.
p34717
aV"Gun safety," you say.
p34718
aVTake away the "gun", and what's left?
p34719
aVSafety.
p34720
aVOr you leave the gun, and activate the safety, and your two year old can't shoot you.
p34721
aVOr remove the "-ty" and you have a handy place to leave your gun when you can't keep an eye on it.
p34722
aVI rest my case.
p34723
aVWhy do that when it is obviously neither the best nor easiest solution?
p34724
aVPer capita, more Americans are killed by guns than in any other industrialized Western nation.
p34725
aVIn 2011, the nationwide gun death rate in the US was 10.38 per 100,000 people.
p34726
aVBy comparison, the gun death rate in the same year was 0.23 in the UK and 0.86 in Australia.
p34727
aV[source](http://www.vpc.org/press/1406gundeath.htm)\u000a\u000aBut I guess other countries are just better at gun safety, right?
p34728
aVIt can't possibly have anything to do with the laughable approach to gun control in the US.
p34729
aVIt's hard to shoot someone without a gun.
p34730
aVWe have the right to bear arms.
p34731
aVA lot more people have guns in America than most places.
p34732
aVIt makes sense we have more gun related violence.
p34733
aVThis isn't to say the same wouldn't hold true if the gun ownership density was the same in the UK.
p34734
aVIt's just they have less guns.
p34735
aVPeople are the problem.
p34736
aVPeople murder people.
p34737
aVGuns are a tool.
p34738
aVYou are responsible for how you use a tool.
p34739
aVIf hammer related murders were on the rise, would you suggest banning hammers?
p34740
aVI bet there's a lot of knife related crimes in places where it's hard to own guns.
p34741
aV"It's hard to shoot someone without a gun.
p34742
aV"\u000aBingo, you absolutely nailed it.
p34743
aVSo let's make it harder to get hold of a gun.
p34744
aVDid you read the rest of my comment?
p34745
aVHammers are designed to break things and drive in nails.
p34746
aVGuns are designed to kill people.
p34747
aVOn your last point:\u000aYour chance of being the victim of a knife-related crime is indeed 1.27x higher in the UK than in the US.
p34748
aVHowever, you are 35.2x more likely to be shot dead in the Unites States than in the UK.
p34749
aV[source](https://dispellingthemythukvsusguns.wordpress.com/)
p34750
aV73% of those are suicides.
p34751
aVYour opinion may differ,  but I don't consider guns to be the root cause to suicide just like I don't view bridges to be either.
p34752
aVYou sound reactive and scared.
p34753
aVThousands of people in the US have guns on them all the time,  accidents like these are statistically low.
p34754
aVIt's a shame people can forgo rational thought when something bad happens.   
p34755
aVThere's nothing rational about thinking that carrying a gun makes you safer, and nothing rational about the gun "debate" in the US.
p34756
aVI would really like to hear you explain what you just wrote to the police.
p34757
aVThey seem to think their gun is one of their most important pieces of gear,  besides their radio.
p34758
aVAlso, I live in Alaska for 3 months out of the year.
p34759
aVWe don't have police within a 4 hour radius,  if we have cell coverage.
p34760
aVWe have fucking grizzly bears,  among dozens of other things that can kill us.
p34761
aVWe also hunt, because a 4 hour drive to a grocery store isn't always feasible.
p34762
aVI would really like to see you come up to Alaska and try to get us to drop our weapons.
p34763
aVIt would be comedy gold.
p34764
aVDo you suggest we just carry bear mace and a bow and arrow to hunt for food,  lol.  
p34765
aVI agree that there are people who could benefit from carrying a gun and you have listed two very good examples: police officers and people who live in relatively wild areas.
p34766
aVHowever, these people are the exception rather than the rule.
p34767
aVThe woman who died as a result of this very avoidable tragedy did not fall into either of those categories, and would certainly not have died if she did not insist on carrying a gun.
p34768
aVMost Americans have absolutely no legitimate use for a gun, and this stubborn insistence on having one simply because it is their right is leading to a great number of avoidable deaths.
p34769
aVIt would be presumptuous to assume she didn't have a legitimate reason to carry the firearm,  as both you nor I know the woman's history.
p34770
aVYour life and security ultimately rely on you.
p34771
aVMy neighbor ( I say neighbor because he lived in my building) died 2 months ago.
p34772
aVHe was going to 7-11, the same one I go to as well as many others.
p34773
aV[He was robbed and stabbed in the chest.
p34774
aVHe ran about one block away before he bled out to death](http://koin.com/2014/10/16/feds-find-man-dead-near-portland-city-hall/).
p34775
aVHe wasn't homeless,  in fact he moved here from California and was a chef,  fairly new to Portland.
p34776
aVHe was stabbed and died one block away from the largest police station in the state.
p34777
aVAnother incident that hits close to home for me is [this incident that occurred as I was driving through Spokane on my way to Montana](http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/23/us/world-war-vet-beating-death/) (I travel to Montana,  Oregon,  and Alaska).
p34778
aVThis man was not physically capable and I wish he had been armed.
p34779
aVWhile statistically unlikely,  I refuse to have something like that happen to me.
p34780
aVEspecially when I possess the ability to carry a gun.
p34781
aVIt very very easily could have been me in Portland,  I go to that store almost every day, 6 months out of the year.
p34782
aVLife is unpredictable and it is not my decision to choose how others defend themselves.
p34783
aVSome aren't physically capable of thwarting an attack like that (elderly especially).
p34784
aVI fully support the right to carry a gun.
p34785
aVIt is a very big responsibility,  and nothing to take lightly,  but it's my choice and a responsibility I accept.
p34786
aVNobody is every going to convince me otherwise.    \u000a\u000a
p34787
aVWhat a piece of shit.
p34788
aVWhy kill the in-laws, especially the 14 year old.
p34789
aVThat's just fucking low.
p34790
aVIn laws commonly intrude into divorce/custody issues... Not trying to justify it, just offering some insight to a possible explanation for why.
p34791
aVKilling anyone is pretty freaking low, no matter the age. \u000a
p34792
aVThat's true.
p34793
aVVery sad story... 
p34794
aVWe engineer these men to destroy for our country, and then wonder why they can't fit into normal society when they are discharged from duty.
p34795
aVIt's a shame anyone had to die over this.
p34796
aVPoor Kids and that family...
p34797
aVDo you and your child feel safe not realizing you're living with a train killer at night?
p34798
aVWhere's the obligatory "once a marine always marine" correction to calling him an "ex-marine"?
p34799
aV&gt;The company claims it will generate $61 billion in economic activity\u000a\u000aHow is that a justification?
p34800
aVThat's like saying you stole my TV because you claimed you could sell it to your friend for $200, so it's okay.
p34801
aVThis will only turn into blow-back.
p34802
aVWHat are the Apache planning to do?
p34803
aVThis violates 200 year old treaties, so WTF?
p34804
aVFrom my understanding there isn't much they can do.

aVWhen only one party decides that the treaty they have with another group is no long sufficient and change the agreement without consent of the group who held the other end of the recognized treaty, people will come together to stop the crime being perpetrated by the government group wanting to **destroy** a 200 year old agreement.

aVI think they have been fighting to keep this land for a while, but the deal was slipped into the NDAA last minute, courtesy of John McCain.

aVThat's my understanding, at least.

aVI am an attorney who specializes in process safety around highly hazardous chemicals like these, and while details don't seem to be out yet, I'm willing to bet this came down to one of two things: normalized deviation or a breakdown in emergency response operations.
p34837
aVI think those two issues (alone or together) have accounted for 75% of the industry fatalities I've seen.  
p34838
aVTo be clear he also pardoned 700 other people, but in 2012 there were at least 5000 cannabis arrests, and multiplied by years that number is not very significant in my book.
p34839
aVWhy not pardon all the cannabis only, non-violent offenders?

p34841
aVHe stated that he only pardons individuals who have already fulfilled their sentences, who have lived within the law for a few years post-sentence, and who can actively demonstrate that.
p34842
aVIt would be hard for someone arrested in 2012 to have already fulfilled their sentence, assuming that what his son received was typical (3 years supervised probation) and have a clean record for a few years afterwards.
p34843
aVI think I understand your point (more generally) to be that: all cannabis only, non-violent offenders who meet the same criteria being applied to his son should be universally pardoned.
p34844
aVMy guess there is that many of those offenders have not petitioned the parole board for a pardon, which appears to be a necessary step in the Governor's process for selection.
p34845
aVI just grabbed the most recent data on the arrests, which also is not necessarily the same as convictions, although probably pretty close.
p34846

p34854
aVI'm going to label this as a "Governmental Internal Conflict of Interest".
p34855
aVIn this precarious and fragile economy what this IRS did here was ensure the decay of the economy, but only by a little bit...
p34856
aVBut give it enough time and case load and we have a very large problem.
p34857
aVNot to mention this kind of government seizure is exactly what the U.S. Was born against to begin with

aVHow do I tell the legal gun owner from the non-legal gun owner?

aVIf Florida allows concealed carry they what possible basis would he have for attacking someone, uh, carrying.

aV&gt; and the president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required\u000a\u000aSo she was fired.
p35032
aVIt bothers me that resigning is the treatment that the upper class gets while all of us peons get fired.
p35033
aVIt allows her to say, "What happened was below me and I know it was bad performance, I'm actually better than that, better than my track record.
p35034
aV" and to save face.
p35035
aVIf you are being fired and you suggest to the person that you would rather quit, I'm sure under most circumstances they would accommodate you.
p35036
aVIt's simpler for the company. 
p35037
aVYou're held to a higher standard when being in charge of the security of the President...this isn't a normal office job where you can make mistakes and learn from them, so you should expect to get fired if there's someone out there that can do the job without fail
p35038
aVThat's what I'm saying.
p35039
aVShe should be fired.
p35040
aVAnd it should be called fired.
p35041
aVShe shouldn't get to hide under this cover of "resigned" that people at the top always get to use.
p35042
aVBut people at the "bottom" often get the same courtesy, whether it be laying off for financial reasons or because they can't fulfill their job well.
p35043
aVYou hear people at the top "resigning" more often because it's more newsworthy than people at lesser positions in a company.
p35044
aVMany people get to the top from the bottom, so it's a nice professional courtesy to help someone ease into a new job.
p35045

p35052
aVHe knew before he joined the armed forces that he would be sent to the middle east to fight in a war.
p35053
aVSo why did he even bother joining up? 
p35054

aVAn ex-boyfriend of my niece went stark raving mad due to civilian deaths.
p35057
aVHis job was as a forward observer, and he ended up in a hospital Germany after he lost it.
p35058
aVThe niece observed most of the wives and girlfriends of people in his specialty had a high divorce rate, and there were substance abuse issues, and physical abuse issues both for themselves and their significant others.
p35059
aVPeople can talk hard all they want, the reality is that nothing can prepare a person to see that much death, and regardless of what one tells themselves or others, quite a few people can't handle it, and won't know if they can or can't until they are boots on the ground.
p35060
aVThat can change a person, and sometimes they will do stupid or suicidal things when they fail to cope.
p35061
aVI'm sorry to hear that.
p35062
aVYeah, a buddy of mine served in Afghanistan and is in a similar situation.
p35063
aVPTSD, homeless, and alcoholic.
p35064
aVHe said the thing that really haunts him is a situation where he was posted about half a mile away from a 3-4 story shelled out apartment building with some hostiles in it.
p35065
aVHe was a sniper, barret 50 cal, and said he was just waiting for muzzle fire from what they believed to be the last guy in the building.
p35066
aVHe finally spotted the window where the guy was and took his shot and dropped him.
p35067
aVHe went in to confirm the kill and secure the building and said when he found the guy, it was a kid no older than 12 or 13.
p35068
aVI can't imagine what that does to someone; dude grinds his teeth constantly, you can feel the anxiety emanating from him.
p35069
aVI totally agree with you.
p35070
aVBut when you enlist you, especially at war time, it is expected that you will follow orders whether you agree with them or not.
p35071
aVIt's a choice you yourself make when signing up.
p35072
aVIt's not like a regular job where if your don't agree with your boss you just don't do it.
p35073
aVAnd if you are naive enough to think that going into a war zone and killing some civilians is not going to happen then that's on you.
p35074
aVThey call it collateral damage for a reason. 
p35075
aVI'm with you there, I get that.
p35076
aVI think the problem comes in when it starts ceasing to be collateral damage.
p35077
aVWhat I got from the whole situation was he was being exposed to non-aggressives being shot, bombed, or tortured just for the hell of it.
p35078
aVAnd with these guys having to be around sick fucks like Academi (Blackwater) I can see how that would weight on your morals.

p35186
aVI have no idea whether the current lawyers made a decently-supported motion to withdraw. 
p35187

p35250
aVIt's possible that he committed a crime while overseas?
p35251
aVIt just sounds like such a thin thread, but it's a short article so I'm sure there's more to this than it seems.
p35252
aVThe other thing I did notice though, was it seems that he got the attention of the FBI/CIA by posting stupid crap to his Twitter account, I mean how stupid is that.
p35253
aVI wonder if they would have known about this guy if he hadn't posted on social media.
p35254
aVSometimes it seems that the urge to rebel against the established "powers that be" is so strong that people forget that it is serious crap to pledge allegiance to a terrorist organization.
p35255

aVSo, as a whole they are struggling to find a place where they can be successful.
p35293
aVIt's just getting worsened due to corporation moves to limit new competition.
p35294
aVWe just really need another economic boom with new industries rising since black americans are finally in a halfway decent place to benefit, and are already programmed to put money back into black communities.  
p35295
aVNot to mention they are for the most part gettin out of the victim hood idea that was perpetuated way back in the 60'd and 70's.
p35296
aVKinda like the gay community is doing now.
p35297
aVNot tr best long term plan.
p35298
aVI think the issue is with the corporations and not the people.
p35299
aVUnless you wanna think of them as people then it's that group of people therein lies the problem.
p35300
aVBeing poor is as much a choice as being rich is.
p35301
aVPeople need the kind of economic boom you are describing. 
p35302
aV&gt;Perhaps this cohort, which strongly supports gay marriage, believes that the front in the fight for equality has moved on to new beneficiaries?
p35303
aVWhich should scare the shit out of the conservatives ... 
p35304
aV80% of conservatives say the U.S. has done enough to create equality for Blacks, but 30% of conservatives still support giving Blacks a Racial preference for jobs and education through Affirmative Action programs.
p35305
aVWTF is wrong with those stats???
p35306
aV?
aVThe Walking Sick. 
p35307
aV...and allows it to be done on US soil!
p35308
aV80% graduation rate with a 100% functional illiteracy rate.
p35309
aVReach for those stars. 
p35310
aVPublic schools just push kids through to keep getting federal money.
p35311
aVThe 80% statistic loses its importance when you look at how watered down the curriculum is compared to other developed nations.
p35312
aV(Finland, South Korean, ect.
p35313
aV) 
p35314
aVDespite the down-votes you received, you make a valid point.
p35315
aVThe graduation rate does not reflect the quality or success of our public school system.
p35316
aVOur students are not as challenged here as they are in various other countries.
p35317
aVIt may be difficult for some to acknowledge, but it's true.
p35318
aVIt's definitely tru, but the schools can't be blamed for trying to win at the politicians game.
p35319
aVOften the schools that need the cash the most are the ones that deal with issues far greater than what's on the curriculum.
p35320
aVIf you were broke, had limited out-dated resources, and we're trying to still make it, what would you do?
p35321
aVLet the school fail the achievement marks and receive less and less funding each year it happens or make some classes that ensure more students graduate?
p35322
aVIt is a lose-lose situation that our government/we have created.
p35323
aVBlaming schools systems and school personnel is ridiculous. 
p35324
aVHe is a Fat Fool of the first order.
p35325
aVMaybe the NSA has some dirt on him, or on members of his family.
p35326
aVThe same could be true of Obama.
p35327
aVDidn't we just go through this with an embarrassingly wrong accusation against North Korea?
p35328
aV"cybersecurity specialists suspected that Russian government or criminal hackers were responsible"\u000a\u000aor Libyan extremists, or Iranian cyberpunks...
p35329
aVUS wants to put it's puppet back in place.

aVNo surprise here.

p35332
aVAs a former Texas resident, this is just par for the course.
p35333
aVTexas prides itself on its lack of worker protections.
p35334
aVIt's a federal program, not solely a Texan one, though some states have outlawed it, like Vermont, and done much better at bringing workers with developmental disabilities into the general workforce.
p35335
aVTexas is indeed particularly bad with labor issues in general, and are especially bad with this labor issue in specific, but you might want to check whether where you currently live utilizes a similar program.
p35336
aVThe legal term for this is "sheltered workshop," if you want to search for it.

aV* This is in a state where hundreds of households are being forced to go without running water because supplies have simply run out.
p35345
aVMeanwhile, an impossibly huge amount of water is being given to wealthy industrial scale farms at the taxpayer's expense.
p35346
aVIt's preposterous.
p35347
aVWhat grinds my gears are the "congressionally  created dust bowl" signs.
p35348
aVThey should read "congressionally created farms that are currently mothballed due to drought". 
p35349
aVAll that money and equipment...and they send a fax.

aVI'm sure the CIA totally isn't involved in any way...

aVPeople living in CA are told to cut water usage by 20%, yet all over southern california, people still have green lawns everywhere.
p35410
aVI even read an article in the LA times about a couple from some yuppie ass community down there that was being fined by their HOA for allowing their lawn to turn brown, when they were just attempting to help the effort to save water.
p35411
aVHypocritical?

aVI think so... 
p35413
aVCalifornia is sitting on the biggest body of open water on earth, and isn't desalination a thing?

p35420
aVFrom the article: "The bill requires that any smartphone manufactured after July 1, 2015, and is then sold in California include software or hardware -- or both -- allowing the phone to be shut down by an authorized user after the phone is stolen or lost.
p35421
aV" \u000a\u000aSo, the big two questions are, who's an Authorized User, and how does the Authorized User control the kill switch?
p35422
aVAre the local police Authorized Users?
p35423
aVIs it done through a website?
p35424
aVOr does is require contacting the carrier? 
p35425
aVLet's me fast forward a few years.

p35447
aVThis guy buried his victim alive. 
p35448
aVMy thoughts exactly.
p35449
aVHe was given the death penalty and he is dead.
p35450
aVDoes it really matter how he got there.
p35451
aVAnd now our legal system is just as heinous.
p35452
aVThe depravity of his crimes is no excuse.
p35453
aVWhy can't they just use morphine of another happy drug?
p35454
aVwell, let me yell at you.
p35455
aVHave you not read any articles?
p35456
aVMost of the european countries agree that death penalty is dangerouns and a sign of a third world terrorist encampment filled with feudal warlords then a democracy.
p35457
aVNow, imagine what happens if someone leaks which drugs are used, right?
p35458
aVI mean, heck, the biggest step of the anti death penalty movement was that all of the european drug designers no longer ship their products to the terrorist states in america that have the death penalty, and have announced they will not deliver to any state that resells their drugs to one of the lawless states.
p35459
aVNow, imagine what happens when shit hits the fan, and you literally use a happy drug to off someone.
p35460
aVNot only would you get anything but a peacefull looking corpse, but you would also run the danger of the europeans saying, "well, fuck them, if they want our morphine, they have to ban the death penalty.
p35461
aV"\u000a\u000aJust count how many american facilities would be up to the task of manifacturing any drugs that kill.
p35462
aVI mean, heck, there is still a war on drugs going on, as far as I can see, so I bet all the companies want to risk producing happy drugs for usage in death penalty situations, with a promise that the local police units will not treat them like a dispensary.
p35463
aVBut yea.... America don fucked up in that regard, and their only hope is to keep their suppliers secret. 
p35464
aVwow, I have no idea what you said there
p35465
aVLong story short - we buy the chemicals from European countries who disagree with the death penalty, but don't tell them what chemicals are used for what purposes.
p35466
aVIf we switch to morphine and they found out, they'd cut off the morphine supply, and people who *legitimately* need morphine would be completely fucked.
p35467
aVIts probably not really possible to do so, is it?
p35468
aVYou could just grow your own opium or still hide what the end use is.
p35469
aVAustralia has massive licit opium poppy fields which I presume are to produce morphine and/or codeine.
p35470
aVThey'd still supply.
p35471
aVAny reason you can't use CO?

aVMight violate whichever of your amendments talks about cruel punishment though.
p35479
aVI assumed it would be painful or is that the wrong assumption?
p35480
aVI'm guessing it would hurt like hell, but it'd be quick.
p35481
aVThere are already enough people that think the lethal injection is cruel punishment as it is.
p35482
aVAt least this would shut your heart down a lot quicker than the "suffocation" critics of the death penalty claim is happening.
p35483
aVSuper.

aVThe Pope's major theocratic themes seems time and time again to be as follows: Chill out, be a nice guy, worry about the details later.
p35523
aVI can see how this would be jarring to many people.
p35524
aVAfter all, we expect the leader of a whole religious sect to be busy micromanaging and devolving the theocratic details that this Pope seems to consider back burner material.
p35525
aVThat's what makes this pope so refreshing, and that's why his critics can be very hard to praise from time to time. 
p35526

aVThey were asked not to leave the apartment to prevent quarantine break and ignored it, thus potentially jeopardizing the safety of the city exponentially.
p35556
aVYou bet your ass they better have been enforced house arrest.
p35557
aVWhile I don't know the full story of how the nurse was treated, if she was treated inhumanely then obviously an apology and rectification for further cases are in order; however, a quarantine is a quarantine.
p35558
aVPeople can't just disobey requests to maintain quarantine because they feel like it.
p35559
aVGood!

aV&gt;One of the bills would have required local and state-owned buildings and public venues to build or renovate at least one bathroom so that both sexes could access a changing table\u000a\u000aA law forcing all businesses to build changing tables would be a nightmare, I'm glad he killed this one in particular.
p35561
aV&gt;The other would have forced building owners to create an equally accessible changing station whenever constructing a new bathroom or making major renovations to an existing one\u000a\u000aThis seems far more reasonable but I'm still not sure I like the idea of mandating changing tables in public buildings.
p35562
aVThey should incentivize it with a tax credit or something without mandating it, I dunno.

aVFirst of all they're gang members, secondly they're MS-13 gang members, a gang notorious for their unadulterated aggression/violence and willingness to do anything for the gang.
p35576
aVNo need to sensationalize titles for views.
p35577

aVThis wave is out of control.
p35584
aVThe media the left loves to dismiss as false has been talking about this since at least October of last year.
p35585
aVWashington Times, WND, Fox, etc... With the children flooding in mentioned specifically in December in the Washington Times.
p35586
aVYou're at least seven months behind people who can read objectively.

aVEdit: spelling
p35588
aVI lived in Central America.
p35589
aVEven in remote villages, *MS13* was on the walls.
p35590
aVIt's the edgiest thing you can write on a wall, and that's what 15 year-olds do.
p35591
aVThis article also makes no distinction between purported "gang associations" and membership.
p35592
aVThis is a shallow pitchfork piece to stir people up and the graphic they chose says so.
p35593
aVThis boils down to a scare article about graffiti.
p35594
aVI live in an almost all white rural town.
p35595
aVThere is "GD king killers" or some shit spray painted all over by teenagers.
p35596
aVWe haven't called in the gang task force to look for cowboy hat wearing GD gangsters.
p35597
aVThere's a huge difference between American gang members and Central/S.
p35598
aVAmerican gang members.
p35599
aVEven the hardcore US gangs pale in comparison.
p35600
aVUS gangs idolize the gangster lifestyle, but often jerk violence happens it's fairly clean and quick (I.e gunshots).
p35601
aVIt is also used sparingly against a specific target.
p35602
aVMS-13 and other gangs like it operate more like terror groups.
p35603
aVThey kill much more frequently and with greater violence.
p35604
aVVictims are tortured, skinned, dismembered and then displayed in public.
p35605
aVFrequently over the years Mexican authorities have discovered mass graves containing 50-70+ people who were captured by drug cartels and either couldn't get ransom money or refused to backpack drugs into the US.
p35606
aVWhen was the last time the bloods or crips murdered 50 people at once?
p35607
aV...but it was just graffiti.
p35608
aVIt could have been put there by some unaffiliated ambitious teenager.
p35609
aVSame kooks who are trying to tie the "border crisis" with ISIS by saying ISIS will slip in through the Mexican border.
p35610
aVApparently Al Qaeda and every other terrorist organization ever was too stupid to figure that out. 
p35611
aVHave people stopped buying gas?
p35612
aVI could have sworn there was already a tax on gas for this. 
p35613
aVI've read about this before (well, without the fact that funds were about to run out) and IIRC the short answer is "yes".
p35614
aVGas prices are going up, fuel efficiency is going down, and people are ultimately choosing to carpool or bike/walk or take public transportation a little more often, meaning that tax revenue from gas sales is declining.
p35615
aVfuel efficiency is going up
p35616
aVYes, typo there.
p35617
aVFuel efficiency is going up, which means tax revenue from fuel is going down.
p35618
aVBut quick!!
p35619
aVHouse illegals and their illegal children and pay all their expenses indefinitely!
p35620
aVme included, and by most standards I'm rich\u000a\u000aThat said I just bought a house and spent everything no bolted down on down payment and closing costs.
p35621
aVno c-section necessary?
p35622
aVdid they just lube him up?
p35623
aVarticle leaves out the most important details
p35624
aV14 pages of lies and half-truths
p35625
aVI'm sure the local authorities knew nothing about it.
p35626
aVRemember kids, you can always talk to a cop. 
p35627
aVI saw a documentary recently on HBO about how Chinese businessmen go from state to state scrap yards buying up as much scrap metal as they can.
p35628
aVSo I checked my states (Florida) largest export.
p35629
aVsure enough, The number one export by far is $446 million dollars in scrap metal waste.
p35630
aVCalifornia was at $2.3 Billion in scrap metal export.
p35631
aVThe Chinese say it is easier to get these resources from scrap than to pull them out of the earth. 
p35632
aVThis belongs in /r/propaganda.
p35633
aVWe have a $20b trade deficit.  
p35634
aVWe have a trade deficit that is calculated incorrectly.
p35635
aVTrade deficits are currently calculated by the port of debarkation.
p35636
aVThis means that just because an iPhone was assembled in China with parts manufactured all over the world, including the United States, its value gets added to our trade deficit.
p35637
aVSome analysts say every iPhone adds $200 to the U.S. trade deficit.
p35638
aVSome economists have realized this and started recalculating trade deficits.
p35639
aVIt turns out that our trade deficit is not so large after all when you realize that most of the products that are supposedly "made in China" are just simply assembled in China with the actual components coming from the U.S., Japan, Europe and others.
p35640
aVCheck out this article here that sums it up nicely.

aVExactly how would a smart gun reduce gun violence anyhow?\u000a
p35643
aVSometimes guns get stolen.
p35644
aVPeople who steal guns shoot people with them.
p35645
aVThe only smart guns actually available use strong magnets controlled by magnetic rings.
p35646
aVSo to keep the firearm safe I would need to wear that ring at all times.
p35647
aVIf I kept the ring with the weapon as most people probably would when they aren't using it it makes it completely worthless in the situation you're describing.
p35648
aVOn top of that the firearm is still mostly mechanically the same.
p35649
aVIf it were stolen a simple amount of tinkering would remove the "smart" component.
p35650
aVThe only thing a smart gun lockout system is good for is making sure a firearm is not immediately useful in an attackers hand if it is stolen from you in hand to hand combat.
p35651
aVSince police officers are the most likely individuals to have their firearm taken from them in this manner it stands to reason that only police guns have this restriction.\u000a
p35652
aVWell your kids won't be able to shoot it by accident either unless they find the magnet thing too.
p35653
aVIf someone's dumb enough to leave a firearm and ammunition where children can access it, they're probably not smart or careful enough to put the ring in a separate location.
p35654
aVWhile never taking the ring off would fix that, most people wouldn't be willing to always wear it. 
p35655
aVKids will find shit, not everyone can afford a safe.
p35656
aVIf you can't afford to secure a weapon from children, you shouldn't own a weapon.
p35657
aVThat should be obvious.
p35658
aVA trigger lock would work just fine.
p35659
aVI'm not disagreeing with any of your points, I just don't see why smart guns should be illegal.
p35660
aVBecause there are laws in some states that will force gun stores to only stock smart guns when smart guns hit the market. 
p35661
aVCan you help by providing links to evidence?
p35662
aVI have been told New Jersey has such a law, anyone else?
p35663
aVWay to bury the lede, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
p35664
aVIt doesn't even mention New Jersey until halfway down. 
p35665
aVBecause they are not necessary.
p35666
aVThey would most likely be prohibitively expensive.
p35667
aVThey would do nothing to deter crime.
p35668
aVI can't imagine they would be very reliable, at least at first.  
p35669
aVDo you want this axe or this electronically controlled and regulated axe that will prevent you from accidentally cutting off your arm but probably will stop working in the event of (long list of things that can interfere with electronics including your neighbor).
p35670
aVMaybe I should read the article to know what their study concluded...  haha
p35671
aVcause i don't need a gay ass bracelet to fire my gun
p35672
aVIf you squeeze the trigger, the gun better go bang as the situation must be very dangerous to warrant a trigger pull.
p35673
aVI would never install something or buy something new that added any unnecessary complexity that could potentially stop the bang from happening. 
p35674
aVOnly in New Jersey.
p35675
aVsmh.
p35676
aVNO NO NO...\u000a\u000aDon't you remember?
p35677
aVThe BIG stimulus???
p35678
aVThe federal government giving away billions of dollars to the states so that they could fix the infrastructure?

aVAll the bridges are fixed now.

aVREMEMBER ??

aVThey are not.

aV??
p35685
aV?
aVIf you think that public opinion is relevant to those deciding policy decisions like this one, then you're gonna have a bad time.
p35686
aVI don't, but I found it interesting that this result was the case after years of News Corp bombardment that people should think otherwise.
p35687
aVI'm puzzled by how sometimes this kind of attitude adjustment by the masters of the universe is so effective and other times the public seems very resistant to it.
p35688
aVAnd enduring public opinion sometimes does seem to impact policy in a glacial sort of way.
p35689
aVLook at how the war on drugs is eroding at last.

p35693
aVOur country is not concerned about us.
p35694
aVOur state is not concerned about ourselves.
p35695
aVWe have NO leadership on this issue.
p35696
aVIt's absolutely terrifying.
p35697
aVObviously, I'm not a Californian nor do I pretend to be, but I thought your stare was the great liberal and progressive state.
p35698
aVHow can this happen and why aren't your politicians, media stars, and old school hippies doing anything.
p35699
aVAnd if they are, what are they doing that I should support?
p35700
aVIt's Fucking INSANITY.
p35701
aVNo one is doing shit.
p35702
aVThe politicians are silent,the mainstream media is silent.
p35703
aVGolf courses, almonds are growing, tons of our NorCal water is being diverted to irrigate almond farms, and cattle ranches, and fucking fracking.

aVIt seems that there are vague restrictions imposed on water use that could result in fines but they are seldom enforced.
p35709
aVThere is no real signage on the streets or PSAs to remind people or advise them on what to do.
p35710
aVI'm waiting for politicians to put forth a strong statement addressing the claims that California has one year of water left because that's pretty terrifying.
p35711
aVThe chain reaction that will happen when we run out of water sounds apocalyptic. 
p35712
aVAgreed.
p35713
aVFirst there'll be a mass exodus from California.
p35714
aVI dint know if the surrounding states could handle that.
p35715
aVPlus poverty and disease become a big deal.
p35716
aVWater will become the next oil. 
p35717
aV"Nestlé pays only 65 cents for each 470 gallons it pumps out of the ground \u2013 the same rate as an average residential water user.
p35718
aV" How is this stealing?
p35719
aVBecause it's water from an aquifer that belongs to CA, where we are running out of water, and being packaged and sold through out the world.
p35720
aVWhat exactly do you think will happen when our state, which supplies 25% of the country's food, becomes a barren fucking desert?  
p35721
aVI am more concerned that people had such a problem with promoting diversity and acceptance.
p35722
aVThe US does not have a national language, so a week of reading the pledge in different languages should not offend anyone.
p35723
aVOf course there are going to be ignorant morons who get offended by a middle-eastern language "soiling their pledge".
p35724
aVThe sad part about all of this is that there are students that have been taught by their parents that this should be offensive.
p35725
aVIt's really a shame that the culture which divides our countries is still in full swing because parents are preaching this hate to their children.
p35726
aVMost of them were children of Jewish parents or those who served in Afghanistan.
p35727
aVI didn't think that those people "defending our freedoms" were mostly dumb fucks to not realize that Arabic isn't even spoken in Afghanistan.
p35728
aVEven if it was, so the fuck what?
p35729
aVUgh.... Mandarin, Gaelic, Apache, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, no problems so far....... Arabic HUGE PROBLEM, that is so offensive I might just rip off my ears and go shoot some Muslims are revenge!
p35730
aVWtf is wrong with people?
p35731
aVWe have had our conflicts with all languages listed.
p35732
aVShouldn't they be just as offensive?

p35735
aVDespite this, I don't know why students attend out of state and private colleges.
p35736
aVWhy pay that much when you can go to a state school.
p35737
aVAlso, our economy doesn't allow students to major in anything, you gotta make informed decisions that match your career choice and the job demands.
p35738
aVAt the same time, universities do rip people off.
p35739
aVDo I really need music appreciation to be a school counselor?
p35740
aVThis is my beef, too, that people seem to think they have to go somewhere expensive to get a decent education and avoid living in poverty.
p35741
aVIt's a lie perpetuated by...by what or whom, I don't know.
p35742
aVAnd I agree that schools should trim down their credit hour requirements.
p35743
aVI get that we want well-rounded students, but there were certainly classes that I took only because they were the most interesting ones of the bunch I had to pick from.
p35744
aVIf I had the choice, I wouldn't have taken them at all.
p35745
aVI say major in whatever you want, *provided you have thought it through*.
p35746
aVI have an English degree from a state school and earn almost $70,000 a year.
p35747
aVI have $15k in student loans to put it all in perspective.
p35748
aVAt the end of the day, though, it's the person signing for the loans who needs to take more responsibility for the decision to take on and agree to pay back the debt.
p35749
aVThe student loan problem has been a problem for years.

p35797
aVThe administration gave in a little.
p35798
aVThey extended the "pass/no pass" deadline for classes, meaning that students could choose to take a class as simply a "pass" or a "fail" at a later date than usual.
p35799
aVThey also allowed professors to extend finals deadlines at their discretion.
p35800
aVAs you can imagine, the faculty didn't like this very much (specifically this professor), leading to [this exchange](http://i.imgur.com/pOSvWBK.jpg?1) between a student and a professor, which led to [this facebook post](http://imgur.com/WyppgfP.jpg), which then exploded in a complete shitstorm.\u000a

p35846
aVOh I see, they got Ebola in Africa and are Americans... that's kind of misleading because she makes it sound like these are cases popping up in America, when our only diagnosis here was to a guy who contracted it in Liberia.

aV&gt;In the wake of the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) (2001), a three-day lockdown of American [airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace) was initiated to prevent any remaining escapes of perpetrators.
p35857
aV&gt;In December 2005, the New South Wales Police Service initiated a lockdown of the [Sutherland Shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire) and other beach areas of New South Wales to contain race rioting (and retaliative strikes).
p35858
aVThe New South Wales Labor government, in an emergency sitting of parliament, passed an array of amendments to legislation giving the New South Wales Police Service additional powers to 'lock down' targeted areas and roads within New South Wales.
p35859
aVThe legislation introduced to deal with the [2005 Cronulla riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Cronulla_riots) was the *Law Enforcement Legislation Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2005* (NSW).
p35860
aVThe *Law Enforcement Legislation Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2005* (NSW) amended four separate pieces of legislation:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;* *Crimes Act 1900* (NSW)\u000a\u000a&gt;* *Bail Act 1978* (NSW)\u000a\u000a&gt;* *Criminal Procedure Act 1986* (NSW)\u000a\u000a&gt;* *Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW)*\u000a\u000a&gt;Under their new powers the New South Wales Police Service locked down targeted areas and roads at Cronulla, Bondi, Coogee, Maroubra and Brighton-le-Sands to prevent persons of Middle Eastern appearance from committing reprisal attacks and prevent [white supremacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacist) agitators from further violence.
p35861
aV&gt;An example of a campus/school lockdown was demonstrated at the [University of British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia) (UBC) on January 30, 2008, when an unknown threat was made and the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police) (RCMP) issued a lockdown on one of the buildings on campus for six hours, cordoning off the area, and a campus alert was sent via email to everyone affiliated with UBC while students and faculties were to remain locked in the building.
p35862
aV&gt;On April 10, 2008, two Canadian [secondary schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school) were locked down due to suspected firearm threats.
p35863
aV[George S. Henry Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Henry_Academy) was locked down in [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto), [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario) at approximately 2:00 p.m.
p35864
aVThe [Emergency Task Force (TPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Task_Force_(TPS\u005c)) were contacted and the lockdown lasted for more than two hours.
p35865
aV[New Westminster Secondary School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Westminster_Secondary_School) was locked down in [New Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Westminster), [British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia) at approximately 1:40 p.m.
p35866
aVThe [Emergency Response Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Response_Team) (ERT) were called and the school was under lockdown until 4:30 p.m. Due to the size of the school some students were not able to leave until 7:00 p.m.\u000a\u000a&gt;Another example of a lockdown would be an [air raid](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/air_raid) emergency.
p35867
aVDuring the 1940s and 1950s, neighborhoods such as Detroit, MI would practice a [blackout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(wartime\u005c)).
p35868
aVDuring this time, the city's Civil Defense workers would immediately activate the neighborhood air raid siren, and families would be required to do the following in order: 1.
p35869
aVShut off all appliances, such as stoves, ovens, furnaces; 2.
p35870
aVShut off valves for water and natural gas or propane, as well as disconnect electricity; 3.
p35871
aVClose [blackout curtains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_(fabric\u005c)) (plain black curtains that would block light from coming in or going out).
p35872
aVUnlike an atomic bomb, where white curtains are used to reflect the blast, black curtains were used to prevent any airborne enemies from seeing light from windows; 4.
p35873
aVGet to a public shelter, a bomb or fallout shelter, or the household basement, and stay there until the local police dismissed the blackout.
p35874
aVAlthough no longer practiced air raid drills are still used by a small portion of people who would protect against any enemies.
p35875
aVThese blackout incidents would begin at 3:00 PM and usually end around 3:30 PM.
p35876
aV[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] On 19 April 2013, the entire city of [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston) was locked down and all public transportation stopped during the manhunt for Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the suspects of the [2013 Boston bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Boston_bombings), while the town of [Watertown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watertown,_Massachusetts) was under heavy-armed police and SWAT surveillance, as well as systematic house-to-house searches.

aVPost-9/11, I'm not sure that they keep razors in planes.
p35897
aVOr an electric razor...

p35918
aVI think the most important part is that they forgot about them.
p35919
aVApparently record-keeping is lacking there.
p35920
aVWhat else has been forgotten about?
p35921
aVMore importantly is it all still there.   
p35922

p35923
aVSounds like something you'd come across in the wasteland.
p35924
aVI can already hear three dog on the fritz. 
p35925
aVI bet the scientist that found that was like " whoops" 
p35926
aVThe people who found it are probably being forced to live in sealed biohazard containment facilities where people in bunny suits are drawing their blood every 15 minutes.
p35927
aVSmallpox is *scary bad*.
p35928
aVThe **potential** that people may have been exposed to the live virus (and there's no way to prove a negative) means that they have to be isolated until the incubation period of the disease has run its course.
p35929
aVI'm sure that's one reason that despite the fact that they found this stuff around the 1st, they didn't make a public announcement until the 8th.
p35930
aVIf any of the original finders of the vials had come down sick, they needed to be ready to deal with the panic that would have ensued.
p35931
aVThat money could have benefited the falling apart US infrastructure, which will apparently cease to be funded following the next fart from DC.

aV&gt;Abstract\u000a\u000a&gt;Aspartame, an artificial sweetener is very widely used in many foods and beverages.
p35951
aVBut there are controversies about its metabolite which is marked for its toxicity.
p35952
aVHence it is believed to be unsafe for human use.
p35953
aVPrevious studies have reported on methanol exposure with involvements of free radicals on excitotoxicity of neuronal apoptosis.
p35954
aVHence, this present study is proposed to investigate whether chronic aspartame (FDA approved Daily Acceptable Intake (ADI),40 mg/kg bwt) administration could release methanol, whether it can induce changes in brain oxidative stress status and gene and protein expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3 in the rat brain region.
p35955
aVTo mimic the human methanol metabolism, methotrexate (MTX)-treated Wistar strain male albino rats were used and after the oral administration of aspartame, the effects were studied along with controls and MTX-treated controls.
p35956
aVAspartame exposure resulted with a significant increase in the enzymatic activity in protein carbonyl, Lipid peroxidation levels, Superoxide dismutase, Glutathione-S-Transferase, Glutathione peroxidase and Catalase activity in (Aspartame MTX)-treated animals and with a significant decrease in reduced Glutathione, Glutathione reductase and protein thiol, pointing out the generation of free radicals.
p35957
aVThe gene and protein expression of pro apoptotic marker Bax showed a marked increase whereas the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 decreased markedly indicating the aspartame is harmful at cellular level.
p35958
aVIt is clear that long term aspartame exposure could alter the brain antioxidant status, and can induce apoptotic changes in brain.

aVYou could be an excellent tax collector for the IRS and still fail to pay your own taxes properly at the same time.

aVIf it was pre-1983, when Reagan signed MLK Day into law, then it's not racist.

p36042
aVThe OP linked article clearly states that the ex-boyfriend was talked to and released.
p36043
aVIn murder investigations, the first suspects are the closest people to the deceased.
p36044
aVThe stories you have linked all state that the ex-boyfriend was talked to and released.
p36045
aVThe OP article states that the investigators have talked to the ex-boyfriend, but no arrest were made.
p36046
aVThe article goes on to state that friends of the deceased were spreading some pictures of the ex and the deceased around FB.
p36047
aVThere are screen shots of the conversation in the linked article.
p36048
aVWe don't know of the xe-b and the deceased relationship, and the two individuals histories, and the experiences they shared with the FB posters who seemed sure 'the black guy done it' without stating what they had witnessed from their relationship, which makes it hard to understand just what went down.
p36049
aVNo-one ever wants to be involved in a tragedy like this.
p36050
aVMakes it worse when people perceive events with their opinion, rather than waiting for an official investigation to conclude. 
p36051
aVI couldn't focus on the video because of that man's glorious mustache.
p36052
aVHe looks like should be a fire chief, that's probably how he got the job.  
p36053
aVtobaccy?
p36054
aVthat comes from north cackalacky
p36055
aVIt makes me sad, angry and scared that the concept of "free speech zones" has been not only implemented by a lot of places, but accepted by the public in general.
p36056
aVA free speech zone is the antithesis of free speech.
p36057
aVI can imagine in the future the "free speech zone" will turn into the place where the crazy men talk to themselves because the public has become so complacent.
p36058
aVAlso, can we get better sources than The Blaze and The Washington Times?
p36059
aVAdd block offs having to work way too hard
p36060
aVThe real tragedy is all of those kids thinking dumbass liberal arts and women's studies will do something for them.
p36061
aVThey're paying for the privilege of the debt itself. 
p36062
aVLaughing my fucking ass off...
p36063
aVIt's over guys, the NSA is shut down and prosecuted criminal activity and.....no just a product ad.
p36064
aVWhat a dickhead.
p36065
aVI'm glad he's been captured.
p36066
aVThis kid is pure evil. 
p36067
aVHow the hell does he break out?
p36068
aVDon't they have guards and locks for crying out loud
p36069
aVHunting season has come early this year, boys!\u000a

aVWAT?
p36071
aVThis seems ridiculous. 
p36072
aVIf they're banning floatation devices, does this include life jackets?
p36073
aVLeave it to new York to ban another life savings device
p36074
aVYou don't have to play guitar to build a nice one.
p36075
aVWow this is really reaching...
p36076
aVSome kid jumped off balcony after eating bunch of mj cookies?
p36077
aVIf I kill myself after listening to a Bieber song, will that get the ball rolling on banning his music?
p36078
aVEven if it did cause an overdose (a real one), so what?
p36079
aVAlcohol and tobacco kill people daily - are they going to ban those?
p36080
aVNope.

p36084
aVThen get them to fix it Obama and quit your bitching.
p36085
aVIt's all you lame assed politicians who let this shit get this out of hand in the first place.
p36086
aVIt's the ELECTED OFFICIALS of the federal government who make all the fucking rules...
p36087
aVFIX IT.
p36088
aVMake it JOB #1.
p36089
aVYou've got two fucking years left... get busy.
p36090
aVI thought cherry picking which laws to obey was Obama's specialty.
p36091
aVInstall a bunch of surveillance equipment, hire police to stand watch to "protect", and when some artists circumvent all of that to replace flags and expose flaws in security, they want to hunt them down.
p36092
aVBasically, Fuck you for making us look stupid. 
p36093
aVArt is a very loose term.
p36094
aVWasting resources to hunt these "Artists" is even more idiotic.
p36095
aVSecurity is a feeling not a tangible item. 
p36096
aVAll other crime in NYC has been solved.
p36097
aVBanksy did it.
p36098
aVBreaking: Taiwan is not the US
p36099
aV/r/USNEWS? 
p36100
aVThis could be a leading cause for us to be involved. 
p36101
aVWhile I am highly doubtful of the source and agree with WheelerDan, I also found it funny that the main concern of the "sources" and the comments was the financial drain these children are instead of concern over children's care.
p36102
aVAlso should be pointed out lice are a serious problem throughout the US and can be found in any school and all of the diseases noted have vaccines so if the majority of the US population was vaccinated these children would be no risk to public health. 
p36103
aVWhile this is silly opinion piece, is it really a surprise that thousands of children from drug war torn countries, being kept in cramped conditions are carrying lice and other wonderful diseases?
p36104
aVYou go to a school in a economically challenged zone and you will find the same.
p36105
aVI have a friend whose classroom was a hot spot.
p36106
aVBed bugs 4-5 times this year and lice.
p36107
aVGreat way to sensationalize diseases but not the fact these poor kids are living in these conditions.
p36108
aVBetter get yer guns, them scabies is coming. 
p36109
aVFirst of all, this was posted in the opinion section, not news.
p36110
aVI lost it as soon as he claimed the oppressions actually referred to themselves as brown coats.
p36111
aVThis "article" is a work of fiction.
p36112
aVNote not a single name is given in the entire piece, just "sources"\u000a\u000a\u000ajust read the headlines of this particular man's work.

aVBreak up the monotony of voting for Pepsi or Other Pepsi.
p36120
aV"following the steps" means "forcing its way" now?
p36121
aVI wonder if a Claymore mine is considered a landmine?
p36122
aVThose things are damn useful.
p36123
aVI was wondering that too.
p36124
aVI looked up more information, and it appears this applies to ALL land mines, including the Claymore mine, and anti-tank mines.
p36125
aVI wonder how this would affect things, or if the US is going to come up with some kind of weapon "like" a claymore mine, but call it a "placed grenade charge" or the like.
p36126
aVhttp://www.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/mr141-e.htm\u000a
p36127
aV1.
p36128
aVThe United Stated landmine stockpile is more then enough to last through many decades of peace times.
p36129
aV2.
p36130
aVWhat the US military says to the public and what it actually does are two different things.
p36131
aV3.
p36132
aVIn the event of a real war against a credible adversary the military will have the governments public support to make any weapon that does not violate Geneva conventions.
p36133
aVAdditionally they will have secret support to create weapons that violate Geneva conventions.
p36134
aV4.
p36135
aVContrary to popular belief the United States Government and Military are no more ethical on the battlefield than any other countries. 
p36136
aVThe way I understand it is that the US is just destroying old "conventional" landmines.
p36137
aVIt will continue to develop and deploy new types of mines that supposedly become ineffective after a certain period in time therefore they don't consider them indiscriminate weapons.
p36138
aVAlso I don't think that the US has really any intent to ever sign the Ottawa Treaty (which is the treaty banning the use of landmines).
p36139
aVedit: Nevermind, I read more about this on NPR and it says that that's exactly what they intend to do, join the Ottawa Treaty.
p36140
aVAwesome to read, one week before heading to the Dominican Republic for vacation.....
p36141
aVSheesh, I without sounding like the old-fart that I am, I was walking to school at 7 years old (2nd grade).
p36142
aVMy elementary school was 1.25 miles from home.
p36143
aVI walked nearly every day from 2nd grade all the way through high school graduation.
p36144
aVAlso, I've been to Hawaii and walking a mile in Hawaii doesn't sound like a punishment as much as a reward.
p36145
aVAlso, if there are so many pedophiles around that kids can't be outside, maybe the judge should work with the police to reduce that number.
p36146
aVI'm in my mid 20s and I remember walking to and from elementary school most of the time (my parents were teachers in a whole other city) my walk was probably a little less than a mile but by that judge's theory, I'm one lucky sob.
p36147
aVSad that parents aren't able to discipline the same as in the past.
p36148
aVSounds like it's becoming more and more difficult to parent these days.
p36149
aVI'm sure there's two sides to this.
p36150
aVPossibly.
p36151
aVSure.
p36152
aVBut the remarks allegedly spoken by the judge are pure comedy gold. 
p36153
aVSo stupid.
p36154
aVI mean, there are probably a million ways to discipline a kid, but I don't see the harm here.
p36155
aVI used to walk all over my town.
p36156
aVAt least the kid wasn't being beaten.
p36157
aVSome thing the courts should just but out of.
p36158
aVAlso good on the father to try and raise a respectful kid. 
p36159
aVThe comparison to the great depression is the most real it's ever been.
p36160
aV&gt; Ultimately, the solution to the proliferation of encampments across the United States is the provision of affordable housing.
p36161
aVYou can't get much more afordable than a tent-city.
p36162
aVIf you think about it, it's kind of pathetic they'd go through all the trouble to shut these places down.
p36163
aVHere are people who have enough problems as it is, having what little they can muster taken away by someone who goes home to their big phat mansion (relatively speaking).
p36164
aVHow sad is that?
p36165
aV;_;    \u000aYou can see all the subterfuge behind it too, trying to justify it by saying they're druggies or whatever.
p36166
aV[Yeah sure, guys](http://images.tribe.net/tribe/upload/photo/c59/cb3/c59cb357-d66e-4290-baac-348776a4348d).

p36171
aV&gt; Two days later, Hughes said, the same agent showed up at the post office where Hughes works and asked more questions.
p36172
aV&gt; Hughes likes to point out that nearly half the retiring members of Congress from 1998 to 2004 got jobs as lobbyists earning some 14 times their congressional salaries.

aVThis is very important news for all of you internet vigilantes.
p36191
aV"Prior Lake father" has posted on the youtube video explaining that his daughter was playing a game with people on snapchat during an interview saying N-this and N-that.
p36192
aVIt is pretty clear that she has no issue with the word and is using it with other people.
p36193
aVIt is starting to feel like she intentionally tried to get those kids in trouble.
p36194
aVBradley Knudson 5 hours ago\u000a\u000aI would like to thank everyone for their support.
p36195
aVI just found out our daughter did not take this issue as seriously as Wendy and I.
p36196
aVThe n word is something I was taught at a very young age was not appropriate.
p36197
aVYou hear nowadays a lot of songs by People of all color use this word.
p36198
aVYou also see videos that they use this word.
p36199
aVI have never liked it I've always thought it was inappropriate that they used it.
p36200
aVI have now found out that my daughter during the WCCO interview decide...d to use Snapchat and send people videos of her thinking that this was a game and it was funny and she actually uses the N-word twice.
p36201
aVRegardless of your skin color I and my wife do not tolerate this word our daughter is going to be reprimanded in an appropriate manner.
p36202
aVI am extremely saddened and disappointed because of this video she has discredited the message that we wanted to convey.
p36203
aVI hope that this does not stop our efforts to highlight the issues that still remain regarding bully and the effects it has on children.
p36204
aVIt is still truly an epidemic and social media has allowed us to bully individuals 24 hours a day seven days a week no matter where that person lives.
p36205
aVWendy and I are still dedicated to highlighting this issue and help educate our young people on the effects of bullying and how to deal with bullying.
p36206
aVAgain I want to thank everyone for their support getting this message out.\ufeff\u000a

aVWhoopy dee doo - CA
p36211
aV[deleted]

aVI think the only thing worth reporting is the fact that this happened in Dallas, Texas, not the magnitude of the Earthquake.
p36213
aVEarthquakes have been happening in CA since forever!
p36214
aVTo bad it cost $44 million to make.
p36215
aVAnd the millions of dollars in marketing and advertising.
p36216
aVRight up to when it got cancelled. 
p36217
aVThat's opening weekend figures.
p36218
aVIt was projected to make about $20 million, so less than they hoped for, but still a solid showing considering they decided to launch it after so publicly canceling it.
p36219
aVThere was barely any advertising for the online streaming option, too.
p36220
aVIt'll do alright, and probably make up the cost, at least. 
p36221
aVHardly surprising considering it's a big budget comedy with heavy news coverage that can only be accessed online. 
p36222
aVSo...business as usual,huh?
p36223
aV61 percent of statistics are made up 100 percent of the time. 
p36224
aVI don't see them mention where they got that percentage.
p36225
aVTaking average birthrates for 1996-97, there are currently approximately 3.9 million seniors in high school.
p36226
aVThat means 1.3 Million pot smoking seniors.
p36227
aVUS populations is approx 316.1 Mil.
p36228
aVThis means that according to those statistics, 1 in 15 pot smokers are high school seniors.
p36229
aVstudy high take the test high get high scores!
p36230
aVso close to 19 mil.
p36231
aVtotal pot smokers.
p36232
aVSeems pretty low to me but, then again everyone I know smokes so I am biased.
p36233
aVAbout 45-50% of people I know do and I know a lot of people.
p36234
aVHave they tried cannabis?
p36235
aVThey give marinol to cancer patients to get them to eat.
p36236

p36238
aV/r/lastdayatwork\u000a\u000a/ no it's not a sub, it just should be.

p36251
aVDo you suppose his gold is hanging on the rear view mirror of his car?
p36252
aVAh, the US's good old drinking and driving tax.
p36253
aVDrinking and driving is a law mostly only enforced against the poor to generate revenue.
p36254
aVLuxuries like drinking and driving without consequence, even after recklessly running over people, are reserved for the affluent elite in the US.
p36255
aVWith the highest tax rate in the world, what choice do they have?
p36256
aVThe goal of business is to reduce expenses, this is what they're supposed to do.
p36257
aVWhy do we punish people for being productive and reward others for doing nothing?
p36258
aVThey need to figure out how to clean up what Duke Energy did to NC first.
p36259
aVThe Dan River is ruined because of negligence... and coal ash.
p36260
aVNow Duke Energy wants to, and probably will, charge its customers to fix what they did.
p36261
aVI think it's quite obvious that corporations are the problem in America, and they need to be stopped. \u000a

aVThat's, like, two orders.
p36270
aVThe amount of water used for bottled water is so minuscule that this is not even worth mentioning.
p36271
aVYes I do know, and its not California its the Florida Springs. 
p36272
aVWhile this doesn't change how horrible him being shot and killed are, it does introduce a whole lot of context into the situation.
p36273
aVHe was not randomly stopped for jaywalking like we thought- he was a suspect in a crime with video evidence against him.
p36274
aVSo he needed to be stopped by the Police.
p36275
aVIf indeed there was a struggle, this guy is a fricken' giant, 6'4'' 290 pounds.
p36276
aVWhat the hell is the officer going to do if that guy is wailing on him?
p36277
aVOf course he panicked.
p36278
aVNow, did the officer shoot this "kid" (sorry dude, at that size you are a man) while the kid was on his knees with his hands up, or was it actually during the struggle?
p36279
aVBecause thats everything. 
p36280
aVMy question is why this wasn't released sooner?

aVPolice should have said, 'robbery suspect involved in shooting with police officer'. 
p36282
aVMaybe they weren't certain at the start of this?
p36283
aVThe officer who shot him did not know he was a suspect.
p36284
aVIt's a bogus story to smear the victim.
p36285
aVInteresting article that had Brown's friend admit to the robbery.
p36286
aVhttp://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown?cid=sm_m_main_1_20140815_29822566
p36287
aVLots of inconsistencies.
p36288
aV~~This doesn't change anything.~~  Changes somethings, but still even if he was a suspect in a crime, are the policy really justified in shooting an unarmed suspect over a $50 theft????
p36289
aV~~Furthermore I've only seen info that he was suspect in the crime but nothing saying that he was guilty, if that was the case it would be prudent for the police to produce some evidence to support that.~~\u000a\u000aEdit: The second article posted in the comments contains exactly what I was wondering, where was the evidence from the robbery.
p36290
aVThe police say the shooting happened because the officer's life was being threatened.
p36291
aVNow that we know this guy was a violent criminal (violent from the video of his grabbing the clerk by the throat and throwing him against the shelf), it is very easy to believe the police's story that the guy attacked and threatened the police officer.
p36292
aVNow, if they can prove with objective evidence that the guy was not actively attacking the police officer when he was shot, then they could convict him of murder.
p36293
aVBut until that happens, the story the police gave is much more likely and the officer is innocent until proven guilty.
p36294
aVThanks for the actual reply instead of just down voting.
p36295
aVIt will be interesting to see what happens now that the autopsy has been released and sounds like it supports the eye witness testimony.
p36296
aVI can see the cops point of view if he was assaulted by this kid, but at the same time isnt' there a reason a cop carries a baton, pepper spray, and a taser as well as their gun.
p36297
aVIf I read correctly the cop is saying that Michael was in his vehicle struggling for the cop's weapon, that just doesn't make any sense to me why would someone do that.
p36298
aVEven if trying to play tough in front of others, that scenario just doesn't make any sense.
p36299
aVNow that the autopsy has been released though and it sounds like it shows that Michael was gunned down while surrendering, it will be interesting to see what comes of this.
p36300
aVI also don't think that the autopsy by itself disproves the cop's story but it still doesn't make sense to me that even if the cop was struggling with this guy if he was unarmed why was it necessary to shoot him.
p36301
aV&gt;If I read correctly the cop is saying that Michael was in his vehicle struggling for the cop's weapon, that just doesn't make any sense to me why would someone do that.
p36302
aVWell, it doesn't make sense to *me* why someone would go into a convenience store, steal a box of cigars on camera, manhandle the clerk and throw him up against the wall, knowing all of this is being recorded and his face is all over the video.
p36303
aVI can't imagine someone being so stupid as to do *that*.
p36304
aVAnd yet he did just that.
p36305
aV&gt;Even if trying to play tough in front of others, that scenario just doesn't make any sense.
p36306
aVBut think about the other scenario.
p36307
aVPeople are saying the kid was standing there with his hands up in surrender, and the cop just murdered him in cold blood.
p36308
aVThe guy has no criminal record, no record of misconduct as an officer, he's been serving the police force and serving his community for 6 years.
p36309
aVYou really think this guy would just up and decide one day, out of the blue, to pull out his gun and *execute* an innocent teenager, who's standing there in surrender, for no reason?
p36310
aVThat is an absolutely extraordinary accusation, and one that I find very difficult to believe.
p36311
aVI find it much easier to believe that the kid was being violent and attacking the officer, considering he has just finished being violent and robbing a convenience store.
p36312
aVThat being said, obviously they should rely on evidence and proof before making any accusations.
p36313
aVObjective evidence takes priority over any and all testimony or character analysis, and I'm confident they will do the right thing. \u000a
p36314
aVFair point.
p36315
aVIt seems in the next few days there maybe some answers finally.
p36316
aV&gt;The guy has no criminal record, no record of misconduct as an officer, he's been serving the police force and serving his community for 6 years.
p36317
aVBrown had no criminal record either AFAIK.
p36318
aVLooked like a kid who went in, tried to buy some cigars, got refused and got pissed off.
p36319
aVWho knows what the clerk said to him, the guy he was with even **put back** the box Brown handed him.
p36320
aVPersonally, not having a record doesn't mean a single thing on either side.
p36321
aVOften, it simply means you've not been caught.
p36322
aVI think both sides are lying to an extent.
p36323
aVI like how you're making excuses for someone that shoplifted and violently threw a clerk around who tried to stop him.
p36324
aVObviously you have another agenda and have absolutely no interest in facts or evidence; you're just another one of those people that wants to see this guy convicted with no trial. 
p36325
aVSpare me your holier than thou bullshit.
p36326
aVYou want facts?
p36327
aVBrown had no prior history.
p36328
aVThat's a fact.
p36329
aVIf you think the scuffle on the video is violent, you haven't really seen violence.
p36330
aVWe just raised a bunch of money here to send a convenience clerk's body back to India where some guy came in and simply shot him point blank without giving him a chance to react.
p36331
aV**That's violence**.
p36332
aVThe facts?
p36333
aVThis kid got angry, made a mistake, then the cop got scared and killed him.
p36334
aVThere's blame on all sides here.
p36335
aVThe sad reality is cops used to be able to deal with someone like that without shooting them. 
p36336
aVEveryone can relax now though, the perpetrator/police officer has been assigned desk duty.
p36337
aVNot sure what to make of this.
p36338
aVShe resisted and put hands in the officers face which could be considered a "threat" but he was stopping her because she's homeless and was walking to get where ever she was going on the interstate?
p36339
aVIf he was really trying to help her and was afraid for her well being walking on the interstate I don't think elbows to the head is the best option. 
p36340
aVThere's a video in the news link, did you watch it?

p36357
aVI had wondered about this last winter and posted a question about it in ask science where I got zero replies.
p36358
aVBut I guess the answer is yes, this can happen.
p36359
aVIncreased climate variability, so more of everything.
p36360
aVI think that the methane is the big problem, every increase in temperature releases more methane ice (methane clathrate) along the continental shelf or under permafrost.
p36361
aVLots and lots of methane is trapped as ice and a small increase in temperature releases a lot of it, which can release still more.
p36362
aVThe methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2.
p36363
aVSo the danger is that a runaway, nonlinear situation could develop. 
p36364
aVOMG GLOBAL WARMING
p36365
aVYes, global warming will encourage many odd and increasingly extreme weather oddities that can cause anything from excessive cold to sering heat and massive floods to prolonged drought.
p36366
aVRemember, global warming is the one or two degree average temperature increase over like a 100 year period or something.
p36367
aVWhat happens in ten years, rather on one year, is just statistical noise.
p36368
aVThe long term average is what matters.
p36369
aVThe biggest concern is that the average ocean temperatures will rise, causing dissolved CO2 to be released at a higher rate, perpetuating a snowballing cycle of doom.
p36370
aVYou are ignoring the methane clathrate (ice)

aVCouldn't help but notice some peculiar numbers...\u000a\u000a"...At the unofficial reported cost of $250 per person per day, President Barack Ob..."\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, the reporter claims the per diem is an unofficial number, but lets say for a second that it IS a real number and that it costs, to house-clothe-feed... a person what the government most likely will be paying, namely $250 per day, or basically $7,500 per month...
p36374
aVThe government does realize, doesn't it, that it only gives AMERICAN citizens who are drawing disability or social security (who have, say, worked all their lives here and paid taxes and are usually, through no fault of their own, now unable to continue to work - many bordering on death) about $54 dollars a day to live on (about 1,600 a month)...\u000a\u000aWhat the fuck?

aVThe problem is, by law.
p36389
aVif you know you have a great white shark, which you are not allowed to knowingly catch and keep, you are supposed to cut your line or catch and release.
p36390
aVThese ASSHOLES knew they had a great white on the line and were laughing while innocent long distance swimmers who were training swam right towards the shark.
p36391
aVThe shark was obviously agitated by being on the line for a significant amount of time, which most likely provoked the attack. 
p36392
aVAbout ten years ago or so this happened before.
p36393
aVNo one was attacked but a great white was caught.
p36394
aVThey were arrested and fine by fish and game. 
p36395
aVwhat...
p36396
aVI mean, who swims in the same place people are fishing and pulling 7 foot sharks out of the water?

aVHowever, there are very strict FAA regulations when a plane is on the tarmac.\u2014 \u000a\u000aPassing the buck.
p36412
aVAs if the FAA would fine them for allowing a kid to use the restroom.
p36413
aVTrue but they didn't know when they would get the ok to take off, which would bring about biggera problems in the long run.
p36414
aVThe mother should have taken the kid to the bathroom before boarding.
p36415
aVYeah the attendant couldn't really win in this situation.
p36416
aVIf she lets a kid (and presumably the mom) go to the restroom, others would have demanded the same.
p36417
aVThings can go from bad to uncontrollable when a group of people are stuck on a plane so you can't really bend the rules.
p36418
aVThe FAA has relaxed their old rules about holding planes on the tarmac, but after only an hour they wouldn't have kicked in.
p36419
aVAnyone getting on a plane (or getting a kid on a plane) should be prepared to be trapped in their seat for a while because you never know what's going to happen with takeoff - turbulence, being stuck waiting for weather to pass, etc - a lot of things can keep those seat belt lights on longer than you'd like.
p36420
aVI'm also inclined to think that the off duty pilot chimed in because he knew the flight would be delayed a LOT longer had they returned to the gate, not because he thought it was ok for the mom to disregard the attendants instructions to get back in her seat.

aVHurry with the character assassination before the general public realizes this isn't about land ownership or grazing rights dues and that there is a dirty campaign fraud kickback energy plan being pushed by BLM thugs' illegal conspirings.
p36438
aVI'm aware of the fracking push that's coming through BLM but is this the guy we want for a poster boy?
p36439
aVAnd as for character assassination this guy stands in front of cameras and says this stuff, how can you think it's not going to get covered?
p36440
aVNo one makes him say this unless energy companies employ mind control tech nowadays.
p36441
aVSure he is no poster boy and says dumb stuff in front of cameras, but media chooses what things he says they want to publish.
p36442
aVYou haven't heard positive or compelling things he's said published by mainstream news, that is for sure.
p36443
aVThis isn't just about fracking though, the grazing rights of ranchers were systematically weaseled off the public land over decades, making room for Senator Reids suspicious solar power project.

p36559
aVI guess you might notice an influx of Eastern European looking white people but that's really weird to target a demographic like that that doesn't even compose a majority of the population, and whose population increased more in the 90s.
p36560
aV-Reason why I think it's odd is that the article seems to be implying that there's some kind of widespread racism against *Bosnians* committed by blacks, which is odd because Bosnians look like white people.
p36561
aVSo far it's been a Bosnian dude who got beaten* and now this chick. \u000a\u000a\u000a

aVMany would be hard pressed to dissent from your view of this man and his decision.
p36612
aVWouldn't it be better if they instead launched a massive personal initiative to gain more education and/or more marketable skills?
p36613
aVMany of them *have* a good education and marketable skills.
p36614
aVThey aren't worth squat because there are no jobs in those fields.
p36615
aVAnd before you go "haha, guess their skills aren't marketable", there are *no* fields that are safe.
p36616
aVPlus, your "personal initiative to gain more education" costs time and money that these people don't have, not when their income barely covers food and rent.
p36617
aVWhat are they supposed to do, get a free degree from the all-night degree shop?
p36618
aVSo, you want the govt to force companies to pay wages not commensurate with the skill level of the job performed?
p36619
aVWhat not instead force companies to charge less for their products?
p36620
aVWhy not address the issue of the seemingly exponential increase in the cost of higher education?
p36621
aVWhile we're at it, why don't we address why it is that a college degree is required for a job that barely pays above minimum wage?  
p36622
aVA living wage IS commensurate with the skill level of ANY job performed.
p36623
aVIf the minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would already *be* higher than it is today.
p36624
aV" Why not address the issue of the seemingly exponential increase in the cost of higher education?
p36625
aV"\u000a\u000aBecause we can focus on two things at once.

aV"While we're at it, why don't we address why it is that a college degree is required for a job that barely pays above minimum wage?
p36627
aV"\u000a\u000aBecause we can focus on *three* things at once.
p36628
aVAgain, why are you focusing on a singular symptom in the minimum wage instead of the inflationary policies of the gov't and the federal reserve which affect the total cost of living?
p36629
aVYou are missing the forest for the trees.
p36630
aVIf you address the issue of inflation due to over-regulation and the inflationary policy of the Federal Reserve, minimum wage would stretch a lot further.
p36631
aVMinimum wage was never meant to be a living wage though.
p36632
aVIt was never designed to support a family.
p36633
aVIt was meant for unskilled workers who were to gain skills and move up.
p36634
aVIf there aren't jobs in those fields, then those aren't marketable skills.

p36643
aVThere are plenty of jobs for math and programming.
p36644
aVThey may not be in the locale the person prefers, but if one is willing to move, there are plenty of jobs.
p36645

p36682
aVSorry but students need to brighten up and realize a degree means absolutely nothing.
p36683
aVEmployers are looking for real skills and a degree is an excuse for not having them.
p36684
aVYou need both to be honest.
p36685
aVI majored in business from a top ranking university for undergrad business studies and I'll say the reason I had a job (and a well paying one) out of college last year was because of the skills I learned outside of the business school, in my own research and studies.
p36686
aVWritten and oral communication, leadership, teamwork and technical knowledge are skills we all need but aren't being taught.
p36687
aVI think my generation needs to stop depending on a degree to get us places and take up our own method of education.
p36688
aVWe keep saying its the economy, outside influences.

aVHow about looking at the education system and start blaming that?
p36690
aV200 years a lot has changed but not the education system!
p36691
aVMakes a whole lot of sense right? 
p36692
aVThat's one small slice of what a college education can mean, I wouldn't trust a doctor or nurse or engineer who *didn't* learn skills in college, and a college degree is a sign that *they do have those skills*.
p36693
aVFrankly, I'm more concerned with what they know than their street smarts and oral communication and whathaveyou.
p36694
aVTechnical knowledge *is* what is taught in school in certain fields.
p36695
aVYour major in business is very far removed from a lot of other coursework.
p36696
aVIn terms of what people can actually accomplish, there simply aren't enough jobs for professional programmers and engineers and mathematicians, despite there being an incredibly great number of very well educated people.
p36697
aVI think instead of changing the education system we need to change the system people are educated into.
p36698
aVA world where leadership (of what?
p36699
aV) and ability to coerce people into various business transactions is worth more than actually knowing things is a sad, sad world, but that is what people are being graduated into. 
p36700
aVBy having a degree in business, it is likely that yoh are going to be payed more than someone who doesn't have a degree.
p36701
aVIt may be easier to get a job with experience, but a degree can help open doors later in your career.
p36702
aVYou've stated the issue right there.
p36703
aVHaving the degree matters more than the skills you've learned while completing it.

p36733
aVI'm just surprised that the not-so-unexpected death of an old monarch in an oppressive theocracy ranks so high on the presidents priorities.
p36734
aVWhat bullshit are you referring to?
p36735
aVLet's just hope he doesn't miss another golf vacation.
p36736
aVI want my The President to go on golf vacations.
p36737
aVI **do not** want a fatigued, overworked, and burnt out president, which is what we usually get because people complain or get snarky when the *busiest, most powerful executive in the world* tries to relax or allows his mind to recuperate.
p36738
aVYes the president needs vacations.
p36739
aVHe is not a super hero or a machine.
p36740
aVBut yet when Bush went on all those "vacations" to his ranch, the left cried like little babies?
p36741
aVHypocrisy much?\u000a
p36742
aVSure.
p36743
aVDoesn't change anything though.
p36744
aVAnd did you know his middle name is Hussein
p36745
aVThat not reason boy!
p36746
aVbe clear in your thought don't just barkout
p36747
aVI really don't think he did, you could interpret this a very different and more likely way.
p36748
aVThe dude is a father and has had this job for 5 and a half years.
p36749
aVI commented something to this effect in another story from ABC.
p36750
aV(another news station that vultures over stuff like this)\u000a\u000a&gt;I'm sure if my shit was flipped around and I was drunk or something I'd facetiously say I'd kill Boehner too, he's an asshole.
p36751
aVYou must have been there in person to know the exact circumstances and to know he was being completely serious.
p36752
aVPeople say weird shit to grief people all the time; for all you know the cops were asking him what medication he was on, he might have mentioned his "psychotic break" and they pressed him about it and he said "oh yeah I'm crazy I'm jesus christ.
p36753
aV" Do you know how easy it is to have a "psychotic break"?
p36754
aVAnd considering he just got fired from his job because of John Boehner and his club buddies I really wouldn't be surprised if he was depressed as hell and drinking a lot and extremely pissed off at John Boehner.
p36755
aV&gt;Yet you're here thinking this dude was literally planning to assassinate him.
p36756
aVDoes anyone think the cops would *not* write crazy shit you say off the cuff in a report if they wanted to be the ones to catch you as being the guy that talked about killing Boehner?
p36757
aVThey have every reason to turn everything against him and it sounds like they've done that. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p36758
aVShucks...
p36759
aVHe will get a full pardon one day.
p36760
aVRevenue collection activities will be back to normal shortly.
p36761
aVThis has little to do with crime and a lot to do with money.
p36762
aVAnd by "Work" we mean get back to being stealth tax collectors and reminding brown people that leaving the house means you may get felt up by NYP, better hope that's your fetish.
p36763
aVHail Vivec!
p36764
aVThis should be a boon for Tamriel, but maybe not so much for the USA.
p36765
aVEdit: I only voted for Dagoth Ur because I thought he was running against Vivec.
p36766
aVSorry Vivek Murthy, I read your name wrong.
p36767
aVHow was Ted Nugent's post racist?
p36768
aVI mean trust me, I don't like the guy, but I really didn't see anything racist in that post.
p36769
aVThis article is pretty shitty and one-sided political tripe.
p36770
aVJust read it and it seems pretty damn racist to me.
p36771
aVCome on Ted, don't say Thug use the word you know you want to use.
p36772
aV Michael Brown was a thug.
p36773
aVYou know why?
p36774
aVBecause he broke the law multiple times, *and* assaulted a police officer, *and* attempted to reach for his weapon.
p36775
aVIn this kind of scenario, officers are trained recognize this as an attempt on their life and react accordingly.
p36776
aVEven if MB had been white/asian/whatever, it would be another thug taken off the streets. 
p36777

aVWait.
p36783
aVSo if the guy doesn't get arrested, they aren't going to buy things?
p36784
aVLogic?
p36785
aVI think not.
p36786
aVBeats burning down businesses
p36787
aVYeah, but you could just, I don't know, live life?
p36788
aVWhere's the fun in that
p36789
aVUh, not going hungry is more fun than going hungry.
p36790
aVI am beaten and cannot offer a retort to that
p36791
aVThat thumbnail is completely irrelevant.
p36792
aVThis comment is completely relevantz
p36793
aVOne of my biggest fears in life .... going to prison for something I didn't do
p36794
aVWoman *wrongly* convicted.
p36795
aVOP has done a miraculous job of mangling the title so that it is not only redundant but also completely misses the point of the article:\u000a&gt; 'I'm a free woman now,' says Calif. grandmother wrongfully convicted of killing 17 years ago
p36796
aVWTF?
p36797
aVAhahahahaha you like that?
p36798
aV:P This guy had serious plans, crazy.
p36799
aVThis is how my home town hits r/usnews.... great.
p36800
aVMake him repay for clean up costs,( yeah right,) then let him pick up trash along the freeway, (yeah right.
p36801
aV)  oh never mind.
p36802
aV&gt; a felony charge for battering a person over the age of 65\u000a\u000aIs it extra illegal to assault someone who is old?
p36803
aVI expected this to be an actual punk, not "some guy who is an asshole".
p36804
aVThe facebook comments are fantastic: \u000a\u000aShows a mug shot of a redneck:\u000a\u000a&gt; Potty-mouthed liberals should be neither seen nor heard.
p36805
aVI hope they lock this liberal up and throw away the key.
p36806
aVMaybe his new prison boyfriend will be impressed with his foul language; we Americans are not.
p36807
aVAlmost every single other commentator is celebrating prison rape.
p36808
aVAwesome.
p36809
aVFinally, why is a small physical altercation in a restaurant "news".
p36810
aVI live in Philly.
p36811
aVIt was news a couple years ago that we went four days in a row without a murder.
p36812
aVGet off my news lawn.
p36813
aVYou sound like you're just like the guy in the article.
p36814
aVYou're probably a punk yourself.
p36815
aVI bet you're short too. 
p36816
aVNot OK to resort to violence but in seriousness, the guy might have had his reasons.
p36817
aVLife's a cold bitch because of people in it, and for all we know the people he killed were huge assholes who very well may have made his life a living hell every day.
p36818
aVMaybe they talked behind his back and got him fired and his life fell apart from that.
p36819
aVWho knows.
p36820
aVPeople can be really shitty and nasty in today's world.
p36821
aVSad for all involved. 
p36822
aVWow, does anyone give out a retroactive Darwin Award?

aVResponsible gun owners are only responsible until they are like this douchebag.

aVI'm at LAX and a Southwest gate rep made an announcement that PHX is shut down due to a situation involving an "armed suspect" and they did not have any further information.

p36826
aVThere is reports of a one armed suspect still on the loose(the other detained)
p36827
aV[deleted]

aVNot gonna even edit it.
p36829
aVI like it too much l.
p36830
aV"students are not valued at NYU, but profit is"\u000a\u000aI feel like that is the same for most universities.
p36831
aVIt's a sad truth .
p36832
aV*It's also untrue.
p36833
aV*
aVThis is not "heartbreaking".
p36834
aVHeartbreaking is kids who would kill to go to community college and can't. 
p36835
aVWhile I understand your viewpoint, as one of those kids who volunteered for military service in order to go to community college, I can empathize with where she is coming from.
p36836
aVIn spite of having a military college fund and savings, I still had to drop out due to spiraling tuition costs that could not be covered by loans at the time.
p36837
aVHer complaint wasn't that she had to pay, it was about the clear inequities involved in asking $80k+ from people in the least position to pay, especially when the chancellor is raking in over $1.5m/yr and the staff are clearly putting enriching themselves above the educational process or, possibly in my view, the long term interests of the institution.
p36838
aVsorry you didn't have enough money for school D:
p36839
aVOh, had circumstances been different, I could have had enough money.
p36840
aVAt the time, I had budgeted out my education in advance.
p36841
aVI was also under 25, with parents unwilling to aid in paying for my education.
p36842
aVThis meant, under the rules at the time, I could not qualify for most loans.
p36843
aVWhen tuition tripled over the course of one semester I was neither able to float my own loan, nor could I make up the difference in my budget, even with extra hours worked.
p36844
aVI simply had to drop out.
p36845
aVIn the end it all worked out, as I focused on my hacking/IT skills which were a hobby, and found I could make a good living at that with much effort, but no degree.
p36846
aVHowever, I don't think most people have such luck/opportunities these days, as times have changed.
p36847
aVI also don't think that most people should have to be "outstanding in a field" to make a decent living- the world needs willing generalists, as much as it needs capable specialists.
p36848
aVAs a rule, many people go to college these days *solely for the purpose of advancing their financial security, not their knowledge*.
p36849
aVThat is counter intuitive if you think about it long enough.
p36850
aVUnfortunately, many, if not all colleges, are taking advantage of this meme, and are propagating it as far and wide as possible for their own benefit.
p36851
aVMost professions simply *do not* require a college education of any kind, as most people are not engaged in advancing their field of study in their day to day work.
p36852
aVMost people are simply interested in being able to afford a home, possibly have a family, not go bankrupt due to illness, and retire without eating cat food as a primary source of nutrition.
p36853
aVThis is not something anybody should have to be indentured for their entire lives to accomplish.
p36854
aVDoing so is counter to the ideals that most humans hold dear.
p36855
aVI feel that the "education bubble" is real, and that many things that people go to college for could be accomplished by an additional year of high school with a restructured curriculum.
p36856
aVMany of the things that people go to college for now were previously in the realm of trades education, which was generally free (or nearly so) until funding was completely gutted in most states.
p36857
aVThe idea that a college education is "necessary" in order to secure a better job is largely propagated by the system benefiting most from it, and only succeeds as an idea because people believe in it.
p36858
aVThank you for your service!
p36859
aVI actually went to school using my fathers military benefits.
p36860
aVI don't respect her argument because she chose a private (!
p36861
aV) school that cost four times what I paid to go to UT Austin, a world class university.
p36862
aVI also don't buy her "NYU is the only place I could go" argument because there are a lot of public universities that would've offered the same "safe haven".
p36863
aVShe made a bad decision by not going to a great school she could afford.
p36864
aVAlso I looked up the department she was enrolled in at NYU and the majors seems questionable and unemployable.
p36865
aVIf she was going to public school I think she might've had a point.
p36866
aVI think she is doing a disservice to the very valid issue of the cost of education and student loans by trying to get people on board with her flawed arguments. 
p36867
aVAll part of the dumbing down of America.
p36868
aVThe 1st 2 years of college should be readily available online for minimal cost.
p36869
aVIf this is what capitalism is all about, it is doomed to fail soon.
p36870
aVAs a recent grad with $82,000 worth of debt, both in low interest government loans and high interest private debt, this really ticks me off.
p36871
aVShe describes NYU as her dream school, yet expects to get it for free.
p36872
aVIf I have learned anything in my short time as a moderately independent member of society, it is that you don't get something for nothing.
p36873
aVLoans are the price we pay for a quality education that opens our eyes to a new view of the world and a deeper understanding of subjects that interest us.
p36874
aVSome are lucky enough to find work within that same discipline, but we are certainly not entitled to it.
p36875
aVIn the end it costs money for a university to provide such a quality education to students, nowhere is that more the case than in New York City.
p36876
aVThat money needs to be payed for by the consumers of the university's service.
p36877
aVWhat really "grinds my gears" isn't the student's complaint about the size of the bill, tuition increases have outpaced inflation after all (one could certainly argue the services provided by schools, and their associated expenses ,could justify this difference in growth rate).
p36878
aVMy gripe is with the student's argument that she should not have to dedicate some years of her life to pay her debt back.
p36879
aVWith proper saving and frugal living $80,000 is possible to pay back, former students face this challenge every day and with government loan plans, such as income adjusted payments, this is made easier on the student.
p36880
aVThe notion that she should be able to leave school without owing anyone a thing defines the problem with my generation, entitlement.
p36881
aVAssuming that we as students should be able to attend a school for 4 years and graduate with nothing to pay back is not that different than an individual signing a contract with Verizon for a cellphone, paying less than the cost of the service for the contract term, and being able to keep the phone at the end of the contract without paying for the remaining cost of the service and physical asset.
p36882
aVNYU is in my school's conference, and is certainly an elite school.
p36883
aVUsing the above example, one would not assume they should pay the same for an iPhone and it's associated service costs vs a Nokia flip phone.
p36884
aVThe iPhone is an elite device, and as such, should carry a higher price tag, whether that is paid in cash each year or as monthly payments over the course of a predefined term.
p36885
aVAdditionally, whether or not she is gay, straight, black, white, horizontal or vertical is not relevant in this situation at all.
p36886
aVNo one should get special treatment because of any sort of demographic checkbox.
p36887
aVSan Francisco and many other cities are just as queer friendly as New York, suggesting it was her only choice is irrelevant to her arguement and it seems she is trying to use her sexual orientation as leverage against the university.
p36888
aVIn fact her even mentioning her orientation seems more insulting to the LGBTQ community than anything else.
p36889
aVI hope someday she will realize her mistake and return to NYU or any other institution.
p36890
aVShe is clearly an intelligent individual, but she might need to have a reality check with regard to her expectations of what an education is worth.
p36891
aVIs it worth a life time of $700 a month payments, no.
p36892
aVIs it worth a few years of adapting our lives around paying back 4 years of, mostly responsibility free, self and world exploration?
p36893
aVHaving just completed the same journey, and facing a similar amount of debt, I would say yes.
p36894
aVI have the diploma, and now it's time to pay back the professors, administrators, custodians and others who have allowed me to gain at least an inkling of an understanding of who I am, what the world is, what ideals I hold, and the things to which I want to dedicate the MANY years of life I have ahead of me, years which extend far beyond the next ten years of my life.
p36895
aVThe U.S. higher education / loan bubble will pop.
p36896
aVIt is only a matter of a few more years of this poor jobs growth performance and the ascendency of Indian and Chinese institutions of higher learning.
p36897
aVOlive Garden servers don't need 4-year degrees and the world's brightest will always fight to go to college where the opportunities are brightest.
p36898
aVTL;DR: young woman could not afford to go to very expensive university in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the world because she did not have enough money saved and refused to take a loan\u000a\u000aboo hoo big fucking crocodile tears
p36899
aVwhat this guy said 100% \u000a\u000aI think education is a right; going to a super expensive school in a crazy expensive city is NOT a right. 
p36900
aVThe thing is, she could have taken a loan like everyone else who attends university.
p36901
aVShe simply does not want to pay for her education.
p36902
aV#EducationisNOTaright
p36903
aVIt should be.
p36904
aVWhen you live in a country where a college degree is necessary to obtain any kind of decent paying job, getting that college degree should be a right.
p36905
aVIt's beneficial for the entire country if it's members are educated and able to provide a decent life for themselves and their families.
p36906
aVUnless you are happy continuing to see welfare need go through the roof year after year, you should be supporting an initiative that allows people to support themselves without having to go the government for help.
p36907
aVthat's why many state college systems are so robust 
p36908
aVVery well, go ahead and pay for it. 
p36909
aV Luckily, my town sees it differently; we offer free college to all of our students here.
p36910
aVAnd, I don't know why you think that the tax dollars you are paying that go toward welfare, TANF, food stamps, etc.
p36911
aVare being any better spent that way than they would be on paying for a college education so people wouldn't have to rely on those social welfare programs.  
p36912
aVYou're making assumptions about where I think who's money should go where.
p36913
aVLook up libertarian.
p36914
aVThat's where I stand. 
p36915
aVI'm not making any assumptions.
p36916
aVJust saying you are already paying taxes (at least, I assume you are) and that I can't understand why you wouldn't support an educated society as opposed to one that is in poverty and under educated.
p36917
aVOf course, you are entitled to your own opinion, I wasn't trying to convert you.
p36918
aVI was just pointing out that the money being spent already can be better spent and that paying for education would make more sense.\u000a
p36919
aVI am a pediatric respiratory therapist in West Texas at a 400 bed hospital where we currently have 6 ICU status pediatric patients between the ages of 6 - 16, all asthmatics and all reporting rhinitis and burning/itchy swollen eyes on top of their severe asthma symptoms.
p36920
aVWhat I would take away from this (if you are a parent of an asthmatic) is to be cautious of those particular symptoms, and because it is airborne, I would keep a mask handy for your child in the case that he/she might have to be in the same room with the symptomatic individual.
p36921
aVAlso make them religiously wash hands.
p36922
aVThe severity of asthmatic symptoms escalates very quickly in the case of enteroviruses, and spreads VERY EASILY.
p36923
aVEdit: a word
p36924
aVThank you so much for this.
p36925
aVEdit: Itchy, swollen eyes AND rhinitis (runny nose, right)?
p36926
aVDamn, other than the asthma, my sister and I both had those two symptoms this week.
p36927
aVProbably just allergies, but I'll keep a really close eye on the asthmatic niece.
p36928
aVRhinitis is inflammation of the nasal airway (nasal conchae) but is sometimes accompanied by runny nose.
p36929
aVThe rubbing of ones eyes and wiping of the nose is presumably how it is spreading in addition to airborne aerosol droplets, which is why I say to wash hands religiously.
p36930
aVAnyone know what his initial arrest was for?

aVDon't really know what I can take away from this article, considering its obvious biases, but from the looks of it, she simply forgot to check the area laws, and paid the price (not necessarily justly).
p36936
aVIt also say that she unwittingly crossed the border into NJ.
p36937
aVI don't really see how that's possible, because the NJ/PA border is market (rather clearly) by the roaring Delaware rice.
p36938
aVKind of hard to miss.

aVAmazing, pass a law forcing people to buy insurance and the number of people without insurance goes down...who'd a thunk it
p36969
aVWho gives a fuck if you have "insurance" if it's coverage that doesn't cover much and you can still end up buried under insurmountable medical debt?
p36970
aVThis.
p36971
aVObamacare tried to force more coverage, and did force the bar raised on what is covered and covering preexisting conditions, but I think the dirty insurance companies may have offset most people's benefit of that by jacking up deductibles, which makes poor people reluctant to use their coverage, because they can't afford to.
p36972
aVI used to have good insurance but my current high deductible plan from my employer eats up about 15% of my salary.
p36973
aV"may"\u000a\u000aThe problem is, for profit insurance has been unaffordable for most Americans since the 1990s, but they cannot admit that because of the US's free trade ideology which we are busy forcing on other countries.
p36974

aVThe headline is technically true in that he did compare the two, but it's a bit misleading.
p37013
aVWhat he's actually saying is that, in the same way an alcoholic may have a genetic predisposition to consume alcohol irresponsibly, a homosexual may have a genetic predisposition to engage in homosexual behavior.
p37014
aVBoth of those statements are largely supported by scientific evidence.
p37015
aVIt's the implied idea that a homosexual should suppress those urges as an alcoholic should, or that homosexuality is at all socially destructive in the way that alcoholism is, that is insensitive, offensive, etc.
p37016
aVSo he's not wrong; he's just an asshole.

aVThis title is highly misleading despite the "".
p37031
aVThere is probably a LOT more to this story then is being let on.
p37032
aVMy guess would be that: \u000a\u000aA) The student may have been a habitual bathroom break abuser and it warranted the teacher to make the human mistake of assuming it was a non-emergency\u000a\u000aB) The child did not make it clear that peeing was an emergency because she wanted popcorn\u000a\u000aand C) The teacher is probably a newbie and made a stupid mistake in assuming that the mind of a 9-10 yr old would correctly make a judicious decision on where to spend the "money"\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, it was most likely a huge accident but one that is something to be learned from....like the time a student (who was a habitual bathroom breaker that actually took off to roam the halls) asked to go to the bathroom and I said, "No, we have to finish this lesson and then we will all go" and she said "But I need to go" and I said, "IS it an emergency?
p37033
aVDo you feel like you need to pee within the next 5 minutes?
p37034
aV" and she shook her head no because I used the wrong verbiage...and then she threw up all over the table because no, she did not have to PEE, she had to vomit.
p37035
aVIn short, I just give my kids 12 bathroom passes a quarter (not to be docked during class visits to the bathroom or during recess, transition, or lunch) and help them learn to budget and I never say no.

p37050
aVShe chose too pee herself for some popcorn, not surprised she is a size 10...
p37051
aVI disagree.
p37052
aVThe time to go to go is when you have to go and the place is the bathroom.
p37053
aVI hope she sues the the school district and everyone involved personally just to make life hard on them.

p37057
aVA room of kids with no bathroom rules would be kind of like a room full of monkeys...but in all seriousness, at third grade, students need clear expectations of rules.
p37058
aVI have never had to "charge" but I am also mindful of giving bathroom breaks and giving them a limit to how many times they can ask.

p37071
aVThey have a law enforcement entity (as a part of the forest service - very similar to park rangers or game wardens) that does deal with crimes, poaching, wildlife preservation, illegal growth operations, cartels, etc etc.
p37072
aVSo that answers the question, why they need firearms.
p37073
aVTo answer the specific model of firearms they ordered (.40 cal carbines), what would make the most sense is this:\u000a\u000a- their current stock, supply, and duty weapons are chambered in .40, thus making their purchase fit in with their current stock pile and future ordering of ammunition\u000a\u000a- these carbines could theoretically use the same magazines as their duty sidearms, increasing compatibility (such as Hipoint model carbines can use Glock or Sig Sauer magazines)\u000a\u000a- carbines inherently are easier to carry, lighter and more maneuverable in difficult terrain (such as one would fine in a forest)\u000a\u000a- carbines also allow for increased capacity, as well as increased accuracy over pistols, while allowing for all the above mentioned benefits. \u000a\u000a

p37084
aVBranches of law enforcement that are COMPLETELY necessary (specialized training, terrain management, different fields) need tools to combat a variety of issues.

aVThese officers in the USDA are working with other LEO branches, as well as by themselves.

aVYou cannot possibly train one branch to do everything.

aVPolice get a terrible rap for things that happen to a few officers, deserved or otherwise.
p37093
aVIts what sells in the media, just like gun violence, meanwhile cases like the recent [shooting saved by legal citizens carrying was ignored by the media](http://buzzpo.com/mall-shooting-completely-debunks-gun-grabber-myths-lawful-carry/) Because it doesnt sell.
p37094
aVThere are plenty of stories of cops doing good.
p37095
aV&gt; spend a few minutes.
p37096
aVGranted, this is the internet, and this is internet commentary.
p37097
aVHowever, if you really want people to form and opinion, spend more than a few minutes on it.
p37098
aVLook at the story, look at the other side of the story, look at the background, training, policies, politics, who owns the news etc etc.
p37099
aVA few minutes looking at something?

aVMeh, they are just trying to push some visual methods of learning math.
p37110
aVThey typically require visual depictions or physical paper slips,  wheels, or other visual aids.
p37111
aVOf course they sound crazy with no context.
p37112
aVNone of those examples listed are common core standards....those are state based standards from New York.
p37113
aVThe actual standards are vague but New York's standards are more specific based on what they want done.
p37114
aVIn this case, they have curriculum that aligns with using tactile instruments for mathematics learning which is backed up by research to be beneficial, especially for younger children.
p37115

p37122
aVIt's possible, but I'm not sure how likely. 
p37123
aVFederal case...state should have nothing to do with it.
p37124
aVThe jury pool is selected from the state.
p37125
aVRegardless of what kind of trial, you are always pulling from the states demographics. 
p37126
aVshocker. 
p37127
aVSeems like his defense threw the case.
p37128
aVThis whole thing is extremely bizarre. 
p37129
aVThere was literally never a shred of doubt that he was guilty.
p37130
aVThe trial of this case has been a build up to the sentencing phase.
p37131
aVThe real question all along has been Life w/o Parole or Death.
p37132
aVThat's why the prosecution paraded victim after victim in front of the jury to make sure they saw as much of devastation wrought by these two as often as possible and Why the defense has stated all along that he is guilty but it was really his brother calling the shots and Dzhokhar should only be given a life since because "he wasn't really the one responsible".
p37133
aVWell that's neat
p37134
aVGreat.
p37135
aVNow the gay community can go force all Christians to put the gay community's political agenda on cakes  called "wedding.

aV"\u000a\u000a"That's terrible, I mean it's just a cake with two names on it right?
p37138
aV"\u000a\u000a"Right.
p37139
aVExcept there was no names and it was just a cake that said 'support gay marriage.
p37140
aV'\u000a\u000a"Well that's not a wedding cake.
p37141
aVThat's a political statement.
p37142
aV"\u000a\u000a"How do they know that?
p37143
aVIt could be my wedding cake.
p37144
aV"\u000a\u000a"Yeah, I don't think your plan was as opaque as you think.

p37147
aV"\u000a\u000a"Why is that?

p37149
aV"\u000a\u000a"You, uh.... you think that the wisest course of action?
p37150

p37157
aVI can only imagine what they see. 
p37158
aVThe law is really more to protect businesses.
p37159
aVSome of these gay couples who are making such large waves are trying to get several differnt bakerys to make this cake and making it as obnoxious as possible so the business refuses.
p37160
aVWhich gives them a lawsuit for discrimination against the business.
p37161
aVPeople like that, fucking over and running small business into the ground, is the reason this law was passed.
p37162
aVSo the business can say, "No, im not going to make a cake that says 'Support gay marraige' or 'Butt budies 4 life' because i dont agree with it.
p37163
aV"\u000a\u000aThis is nothing new, every business has the right to refuse service to anyone without reason.
p37164

aVLike most of us, if you weren't lucky enough to have parents/family who already have it taken care of, you have to do things yourself to make it happen.

aVYeah, I think this has a lot more to do with residual effects post-slavery than any discrimination against blacks.

p37267
aVIf it is killing around 28,000 birds as the article indicates, it is a rather insignificant cause of bird deaths.
p37268
aVHowever one should also consider that this power plant is producing about 0.001% of the energy used in the United States.
p37269
aVBased on these comments, it looks like the only way we can NOT kill birds is to move back into caves and kill our cats.
p37270
aVWell that sucks, but you know we could BURN COAL and kill them that way too.
p37271
aVSolar is still the least impactful means of generating energy, which we really have to do.

aVWhy is that "news"?

aVActually, that's true for the entire population as a whole.
p37277
aVIt's been true for some schools for a very long time.
p37278
aVDid you read the article?
p37279
aVIt's *news* because it shows how American demographics continue to change.
p37280
aVOkay, so maybe it's true for the population as a whole, but it's still not true at all schools.
p37281
aVExample: The schools in most towns in West Virginia.
p37282
aVThe demographics continuing to change is cool and all, but I feel like announcing it in that fashion is meant to stir up trouble.
p37283
aVThat sounds like a headline meant to scare people.
p37284
aVSchools that were almost entirely white last year, will be almost entirely white this year too.
p37285
aVSchools that had shifting demographics, will continue to have shifting demographics with just ever so slightly more non-white students than last year.
p37286
aVThere is no significant change from last year, but the headline seems to treat it like a big event.
p37287
aVLike this year the president has ordered that non-white students be air lifted to your child's school to out number them.
p37288
aVIdk, maybe I'm being overly critical.
p37289
aVIt just seems like the kind of thing that doesn't need to be announced like that.
p37290
aVThe demographics are shifting, like they have been for decades, maybe centuries.
p37291
aVBut nobody said it's true for "all schools", and the only people a headline like that scares are racists.
p37292
aVWho, apparently, don't understand how demographics work.
p37293
aVOr how English works, for that matter.
p37294
aVWell okay, they're probably racist I guess.
p37295
aVA lot of Americans are.
p37296
aVOtherwise they wouldn't care about the demographics changing.
p37297
aVI'm just saying it seems like the title is meant to cause trouble.

p37305
aVVery true, but I believe one is a crime and the other isn't.

aVwith our gas production expected to run up in about 53 years according to BP, they feel they should be trying to bolster the industry instead of tying it up with lawsuits and fees over each bald eagle killed.

aVWe could reasonably ask why Obama thinks it\u2019s cool to negotiate with the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d nation of Iran over the nuclear issue, but not with Russia over Ukraine.
p37376
aVAfter all, Iran doesn\u2019t even have a nuclear weapon, and on the evidence, isn\u2019t trying to build one, so these negotiations aren\u2019t really even preventing a nuclear war; they\u2019re just calming the nerves of some trigger happy paranoids in Israel and Washington.
p37377
aVBut Russia does have nuclear weapons, and has made it clear that if the US pushes too hard at putting NATO weapons and forces near the Russian border, or if it tries to undo the annexation of Crimea, it will use them.
p37378
aVShouldn\u2019t that kind of thing call for cool-headed negotiation, instead of aggressive moves like sending offensive armaments to Kiev?

aVThe author is just as guilty of twisting facts and numbers towards his argument as those who argue for more gun control.

p37390
aVI.e.
p37391
aVhe didn't mention that majority of the 10 leading causes of deaths are disease related.
p37392
aVAlso according to the stats presented, 2/3rds of suicides are gun related.

aVThat being said, there are much better arguments for limiting gun control and he doesn't address very many good arguments supporting his case.

p37398
aVMost of the local ranges let you rent the guns for free, but you have to buy their ammo.
p37399
aVUsually around ~50USD.

p37507
aVThis is correct information.
p37508
aVHyphenated names, in my personal experience, = assholes who believe they're entitled.

aVOn today's episode of 'Please forget about the destroyed evidence/IRS thing'
p37510
aVAfter not doing a fucking thing on the economy and making 2/3's of you under/unemployed for the last five years, he is now going to make you more dependent upon government than ever.
p37511
aVIf he had put 1/2 as much work into growing the economy and making use you had JOBS when you got out of school, you wouldn't even be discussing this now.
p37512
aVI disagree.
p37513
aVThe job market has made a comeback, and people who graduate now are much better off than 2-3 years ago.
p37514
aVHowever, I actually think the root cause of the student loan problems is simply the cost of school.
p37515
aVWe've trapped ourselves in this mentality of "I can't afford to pay out of pocket anyways, so what's another $1000 on my tuition bill?
p37516
aV"  We should be attempting to reign in those costs, but for some reason we aren't.

aVSo I am not sure where "Jobs are picking up", but not around here.
p37521
aVWait what?
p37522
aVHow does capping the repayment of loans at 10% of your monthly income make you more dependent on the government???
p37523
aV?
aVDo the math.
p37524
aVYou leave school with $100k in debt.
p37525
aVIf you get out and work making $50k a year, after deductions, your taxable income will be what?
p37526
aV$40k without kids or a house?
p37527
aVWith a house and kids it will drop.
p37528
aVSo you start paying the government back.
p37529
aVWith no interest, that's what?
p37530
aV$4,000 a year?
p37531
aVNow add in 5% compounded interest.
p37532
aVIn short, you will never pay it off.
p37533
aVWhile your math is right, I don't see anything saying that you can't pay more if you want to.
p37534
aVBut you miss the point.
p37535
aVIf we tell people they don't have to pay anything more than 10% of their salary, we the taxpayer are picking up the tab.

aVThe Ten Plagues That Are Hitting America Right Now\u000a\u000aMichael Snyder\u000a\u000a#1 The Plague Of Flies In The Upper Mississippi River Valley\u000a\u000aThis is perhaps the least dangerous plague, but it is also one of the most interesting.
p37644
aVJust recently, a plague of flies was so thick in the upper Mississippi River valley that it showed up on radar\u2026\u000a\u000aThe mayflies were detectable on radar around 845 pm and reports in the towns and cities began rolling in of the swarming and piles of mayflies.
p37645
aVNumerous videos and pictures were circulating on social media, some of which are posted below as well.
p37646
aVThe radar detected the flies about 845 pm, emanating from the river (the source) with echo values similar to that of light-moderate rain (35-40 dBZ).
p37647
aVWith a general south-to-north wind flow above the surface, the mayflies quickly moved north once in the air.
p37648
aVAs the flies dispersed moving north-northeast, they also gained altitude with some of the echo being detected as far north as Black River Falls and as high as 2500 feet above ground.
p37649
aVBy late evening, mayflies were swarming in La Crosse, La Crescent, Stoddard and points up and down the river.
p37650
aVWhile the emergence of mayflies from their river bottom mud dwelling can occur at various times through the warm season depending on the species, this particular emergence was that of the larger black/brown Bilineata species.
p37651
aV#2 The Chikungunya Virus\u000a\u000aAs I wrote about the other day, down in Florida health officials have discovered the very first confirmed cases of the chikungunya virus to be transmitted locally.
p37652
aVIn other words, it is now being passed to people that have not even traveled out of the country.
p37653
aVAn epidemic of the virus has already been declared down in Puerto Rico, and authorities are deeply concerned about the possibility of one up here as well.
p37654
aVAlready, cases of the virus have been reported in 30 different states and the total number of cases in the U.S. is more than five times higher than in any other recent year.
p37655
aVIf you live in an area that has a lot of mosquitoes, you might want to be very, very careful right about now because this is a virus that is exceedingly painful\u2026\u000a\u000aWith illness onset, the person develops high fever, chills, and joint pain, followed in some by a rash on the trunk, limbs and face lasting 3-4 days.
p37656
aVMuscle and joint pain last about one week.
p37657
aVJoint pain is often severe and in some people lasts longer, up to several months.
p37658
aV#3 The Wildfires Out West\u000a\u000aThe massive wildfires in Washington, Oregon and western Canada have spread clouds of smoke over vast areas of the northwest United States in recent days.
p37659
aVThe following excerpt comes from a recent CNN report\u2026\u000a\u000aWildfires spanning almost 170,000 acres are driving hundreds of people from their homes in Washington state and across the border in Canada, officials said.
p37660
aVWashington authorities say the fires surged overnight to 168,713 acres in the state.
p37661
aVThe flames have encroached on towns.
p37662
aVJanet Pearce of the Washington state Department of Natural Resources said the four fires had not been contained as of Friday morning.
p37663
aVAn estimated 80 homes were destroyed and cell phone service was knocked out.
p37664
aV#4 The Drought In California\u000a\u000aThe nightmarish multi-year drought in the state of California just continues to get even worse.
p37665
aVThis week it was reported that 81 percent of California is now experiencing \u201cextreme drought\u201d or worse.
p37666
aVThree months ago, that number was just 68 percent.
p37667
aVAnd we are being told that downtown Los Angeles is now the driest that it has been since rain records began in 1877.
p37668
aVFor much, much more on this, please see my recent article entitled "20 Signs The Epic Drought In The Western United States Is Starting To Become Apocalyptic".
p37669
aV#5 The Virus That Has Killed Millions Of Our Pigs\u000a\u000aA horrific pig virus known as porcine epidemic diarrhea came over from China a little over a year ago.
p37670
aVSince then, it has killed about 7 million pigs, and approximately 100,000 more are dying each week.
p37671
aV#6 Citrus Greening\u000a\u000aHave you ever heard of citrus greening disease?
p37672
aVPerhaps not, but it has gotten so bad down in Florida that experts are now saying that the entire citrus industry in the state \u201ccould be destroyed\u201d\u2026\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s horrible \u2014 it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d says Fred Gmitter, a professor of horticulture science at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center.
p37673
aVIt might be time to kiss your OJ goodbye, unless science steps in to save the day.
p37674
aVAt least 70% of Florida\u2019s citrus trees are already infected by the disease, known as citrus greening, huanglongbing, or occasionally just with an ominous \u201cit,\u201d as in \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u000a\u000aFlorida\u2019s citrus crop this year is the lowest it\u2019s been in 30 years, and agricultural authorities have continued to lower their production estimates.
p37675
aVOrange-juice prices are up nearly 20% this year alone and will continue to rise.
p37676
aVThe disease was a major factor in the lime shortage that made the price of a box of Persian limes jump from $18 to $85 last December.
p37677
aVPrices could jump higher for oranges.
p37678
aVResearchers and growers say that if a cure isn\u2019t found, the entire $9 billion Florida citrus industry could be destroyed.
p37679
aV#7 Bananas Going Extinct?
p37680
aVYour bananas are not safe either.
p37681
aVAccording to CNBC, the TR4 fungus is spreading so rapidly that it could eventually totally wipe out the variety of bananas that we find in our grocery stores today\u2026\u000a\u000aBanana lovers take note: The world\u2019s supply of the fruit is under attack from a fungus strain that could wipe out the popular variety that Americans eat.
p37682
aV\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious situation,\u201d said Randy Ploetz, a professor of plant pathology at the University of Florida who in 1989 originally discovered a strain of Panama disease, called TR4, that may be growing into a serious threat to U.S. supplies of the fruit and Latin American producers.
p37683
aV\u201cThere\u2019s nothing at this point that really keeps the fungus from spreading,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.
p37684
aVWhile there are nearly 1,000 varieties of bananas, the most popular is the Cavendish, which accounts for 45 percent of the fruit\u2019s global crop\u2014and the one Americans mostly find in their supermarkets.
p37685
aV#8 The Number Of Earthquakes Is Increasing\u000a\u000aFor a long time, scientists tried to deny that the number of earthquakes is increasing.
p37686
aVBut now, the USGS is finally admitting that the number of big earthquakes has doubled\u2026\u000a\u000aIf you think there have been more earthquakes than usual this year, you\u2019re right.
p37687
aVA new study finds there were more than twice as many big earthquakes in the first quarter of 2014 as compared with the average since 1979.
p37688
aV\u201cWe have recently experienced a period that has had one of the highest rates of great earthquakes ever recorded,\u201d said lead study author Tom Parsons, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, California.
p37689
aVFortunately, most of the earthquakes in the U.S. so far this year have been relatively small or have been in isolated areas.
p37690
aVBut they have been popping up in very unusual areas (such as Oklahoma), and as seismic activity along the Ring of Fire continues to increase, it is probably only a matter of time before one of our major cities gets hit with a major tragedy.
p37691
aV#9 Superbugs\u000a\u000aThanks at least in part to the massive overuse of antibiotics, a new generation of superbugs is arising.
p37692
aVScientists have no way to kill these superbugs, and according to experts they are finding their way \u201cinto healthcare facilities nationwide\u201d\u2026\u000a\u000aDrug-resistant superbug infections have reached near-epidemic levels across U.S. hospitals, with an alarming 500% increase now documented in a study just published in the August issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America).
p37693
aVLead author of the study, Dr. Joshua Thaden, warned \u201cThis dangerous bacteria is finding its way into healthcare facilities nationwide\u2026 A CRE epidemic is fast approaching\u2026 Even this marked increase likely underestimates the true scope of the problem given variations in hospital surveillance practices.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study also found that an astonishing 94 percent of CRE infections were caused by healthcare activities or hospital procedures.
p37694
aV#10 Fukushima\u000a\u000aThe Fukushima nuclear disaster is the gift that just keeps on giving.
p37695
aVHundreds of tons of radioactive water are being released into the Pacific on a continual basis, and this could potentially affect our oceans and our food chain for generations to come.
p37696
aVBut it is a \u201cslow motion disaster\u201d that is already \u201cold news\u201d, so most Americans don\u2019t think about it anymore.
p37697
aVBut the truth is that there is a lot of evidence that it should be taken very seriously in this country.
p37698
aVIn Japan, of course, things are even worse.
p37699
aVIn fact, one Japanese doctor that was working in Tokyo says that radiation sickness is rampant in that city\u2026\u000a\u000aSince December 2011, I have conducted thyroid ultrasound examinations, thyroid function tests, general blood tests and biochemical tests on about 2000 people, mostly families in the Tokyo metropolitan area expressing concerns on the effects of radiation.
p37700
aVI have observed that white blood cells, especially neutrophils, are decreasing among children under the age of 10.
p37701
aVThere are cases of significant decline in the number of neutrophils in 0-1 year-olds born after the earthquake ( less than 1000)  \u000a\u000aIn both cases, conditions tend to improve by moving to Western Japan (Neutrophils 0\u2013&gt;4500).
p37702
aVPatients report nosebleed, hair loss, lack of energy, subcutaneous bleeding, visible urinary hemorrhage, skin inflammations, coughs and various other non-specific symptoms.
p37703
aVJust like with Chernobyl, this radioactive material is going to silently make people sick and kill people all over globe for years to come, and most of them will never have any idea what is really happening to them.

aVThen why is CNN saying billion as well?
p37709
aV[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/19/us/florida-tobacco-verdict/)\u000a\u000aThough your second sentence is only sort of wrong.
p37710
aVWhat you're thinking about is the difference between the long and short scale.
p37711
aVIn many parts of Europe, a billion means a million million, rather than a thousand million, as it does in the US.
p37712
aVSo, if it was a French news source reporting that it was 23 billion, there is the possibility (slight) that the award would actually be many time **larger** than a US billion.
p37713
aVAlso, Arabic speaking countries generally use the short scale as well.

aVIf you've ever smoked you know that on the first puff it feels like it is killing you, then you get used to it, then after a while it feels like it is killing you again.
p37723
aVSmoking is terrible and the cigarette companies are liars and cheats, but nobody should need to tell you that inhaling smoke is not healthy.
p37724
aVit's 23 billion.
p37725
aVHow does a jury get to that number?
p37726
aVSome smokers believe if it's legal and sold everywhere it can't be all that bad.
p37727
aVIf it is poison, why are these companies allowed to sell it. 
p37728
aVWhats up baby?
p37729
aVYou are fine looking woman.
p37730
aVWTF would anyone care what he utters ?
p37731
aV!
aVI mean this is not really US news.
p37732
aVI live near Dartmouth.
p37733
aVIt isn't even really local news; nobody I know has yet mentioned it and I work with people who love to talk local politics.
p37734
aVIn a related story Tumblr has dubbed the EPA *The Eco-Patriarchy*.

p37743
aVWas Chairman Mao and his state media honest about the extent of the famine in the Great Leap Forward??
p37744
aVIf Chairman Mao and the Chinese government can hide tens of millions of deaths from famine from the world for decades, the US government can hide 25-50% unemployment for a long while.
p37745
aV"Just as the US government claims, falsely, that Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea..." Um what now?
p37746
aVAs a substitute for Goose Creek CISD, a district very near this one, I find it hard to take these allegations seriously.
p37747
aVI take a majority of my jobs at one of the junior highs here, and I can say from experience that the students these days possess a significant aptitude for fabrication and exaggeration.
p37748
aVThey are very aware of the legal ramifications that teachers face, and they will not hesitate to exploit them for any reason.
p37749
aVThe story doesn't include a statement from Smith herself, and the only time she's even asked about the allegations ([KPRC report](http://www.click2houston.com/news/aldine-isd-teacher-accused-of-improper-relationship-with-student/25655432) @ 0:37) they don't even run the footage of her answer.

aVNice

aVNot buying it.

aV15yo still in middle school?

VDepends how you look at it.
p38588
aVIf the main goal of the attackers was to censor cartoons about Mohammed and Islam then maybe we should say: "fuck you!
p38589
aV" and publish as many as possible.
p38590
aVIf their goal was to increase western hostility towards Muslims and make moderate followers of Islam feel isolated in the west, then maybe we shouldn't.
p38591
aVThere have already been attacks on mosques in France as a response to the recent murders.
p38592
aVMany people would say this is exactly what ISIS wants.
p38593
aVI think it's important to consider whether insulting Islam as much as possible is the best route to peace.
p38594
aVI think you're dead right.
p38595
aVInsulting Islam is definitely not what I was suggesting though.
p38596
aVThere were cartoons from that publication that were insulting to Islam (anything showing their Prophet we know would be) but there were others that wouldn't have been insulting to moderate Muslims.
p38597
aVEven besides that, if the media didn't want to antagonise things so much, they should have not covered the story in the first place.
p38598
aVThat's done as much to raise tensions as included additional images would have. 
p38599
aVOf course there's a lot of supportive talk from the Met and politicians in the aftermath of yesterday's events.
p38600
aVBut the editors must worry on some level that there is legal precedent here for charging and imprisoning over cartoons deemed 'insensitive' or 'potentially offensive' to a religion, not to mention 'offensive' tweets.
p38601
aV[Atheist guilty over cartoons left at Liverpool airport](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8549613.stm)
p38602
aVThat's crazy.
p38603
aVDid they change the laws since do you know? \u000a
p38604
aVI completely agree with you there.
p38605
aVI was honestly quite surprised to not see any of the cartoons at the rallies and marches going on.
p38606
aVMakes me wonder what they really mean by "je suis charlie"? 
p38607
aVThat irony was actually lost on me until you pointed it out, cheers!
p38608
aVI'm not sure there's laws against it.
p38609
aVProbably just don't want to offend religious readers. 
p38610
aVBbc news 24 has a show real of images that they have been showing every few hours.....
p38611
aVThis is a myth right?
p38612
aVI haven't been able to catch the world service today.
p38613
aVWhat is it they are showing?
p38614
aVOK, this is my opinion on the matter.
p38615
aVFirst off, this shouldn't been required to say, but I'm going to anyway, the attacks on CH were terrible, when I heard the story I felt physically sick, so don't think for one second I'm sympathising with the terrorists....
p38616
aVBut why should the CH cartoons be put in newspapers, they *were*/are downright offensive, ok, they picked fun at everyone of all religons, I get that, I'm not saying the attacks were in any way excusable.
p38617
aVBut the attacks don't mean we should respond by covering the pages of our media in images people find offensive just because we can.
p38618
aVCH teased and belittled muslims and people of all religions, I don't agree with doing deliberately provocative things just to make a point about pissing people off, the same way I don't agree with people burning poppies.
p38619
aVI'm not saying burning poppies should be illegal, and I'm not saying cartoons should be censored, but these are things people found offensive, why would you *want* to deliberately offend people, and offend people (normal muslims living happily in the UK) who are already facing enough problems with people associating horrible things like these attacks with their religion.
p38620
aVPutting the cartoons on the covers of newspapers would solve nothing except offend people, people who have done absolutely nothing wrong.
p38621
aVJust because you *can* draw anything you want, it doesn't mean you should.
p38622
aVI think that's a really good argument on the matter W_U.
p38623
aVAnd you've definitely influenced by opinion on the matter.
p38624
aVI'm still not entirely convinced whether it would have been right or not to publish all the cartoons.
p38625
aVI think I come from a rather too privileged position to empathise with people when it comes to offence.
p38626
aVI'm a WASP, and tend to find that nothing I find in the media really offends me.
p38627
aVI often find the argument that anyone who is getting offended is taking something altogether too seriously, eg I would say that anyone getting offended by poppy burning should appreciate that the poppy is essentially a trivial symbol, and what it represents is far more important, and so the burning of said poppy is pretty much irrelevant.
p38628
aVI read a really good point made by a staff member at Al Jazeera:\u000a*If a large enough group of someone is willing to kill you for saying something, then it\u2019s something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization, and when that scenario obtains it isn\u2019t really a liberal civilization any more\u2026.liberalism doesn\u2019t depend on everyone offending everyone else all the time, and it\u2019s okay to prefer a society where offense for its own sake is limited rather than pervasive.
p38629
aVBut when offenses are policed by murder, that\u2019s when we need more of them, not less, because the murderers cannot be allowed for a single moment to think that their strategy can succeed.
p38630
aV-Ross Douthat in the NY Times*\u000a(source:\u000a[reddit!

aVPrince Andrew's royalty.
p38653
aVYup.
p38654
aVI'd never heard of Alan Dershowitz...
p38655
aVNope, neither had I.
p38656
aVYes, a powerful lawyer being a paedophile is bad news, but which is worse for us (members of /r/UKnews): a criminal American lawyer or a criminal member of one of the most powerful members of a family which keeps their privacy above all and has huge links to the running of our country?
p38657
aVDoes anybody know if there's actually any truth to this?
p38658
aVIt seems to be doing the usual DM thing of taking one side without providing much evidence of what's gone on...
p38659
aVWell, it is quoting a High Court judgement, so I would trust it in this case.
p38660
aVOh, and Bailii has the judgement, so feel free to have a read!
p38661
aVhttp://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWFC/HCJ/2014/48.html\u000a
p38662
aVIt's not so much a distrust of what the DM's reporting but what it isn't.
p38663
aVThere's clearly more to this case than we can know.
p38664
aVThey also have an 18 year old son so I'd hope he'd have spoken up if his father was as innocent as this article makes him out to be.
p38665
aVThe court trial was in secret, so the son likely didn't know what his mother was upto - furthermore, the major incident cited by the court and the daily fail was an incident 17 years ago.
p38666
aVWhat was reported was exactly (for once) what was in the judgment, which should be taken as the major points of the previous court hearings (as the judge has read all the past transcripts and evidence).
p38667
aVThis is, technically, the best sort of easy reporting - all the facts are in one place, no whitnesses or facts to track down, no photos to take.
p38668
aVThis means it's almost impossible to screw up, and fairly hard to editorialise.
p38669
aVFor once, the Daily Mail did some useful reporting.

p38748
aVThe point people are making is that looking at something as subjective as rape objectively in the way he did is absurd.

aVNo one can say how horrible a rape is except the person who experienced it, since it is such a personal crime.

p38752
aVIn a similar vein, homicide without a justification such as self-defense, is always bad.
p38753
aVBut some homicides are worse than others, and we recognise that by having different charges - murder and manslaughter.

aVPeople generally don't have a problem with us recognising different degrees of homicide, but as soon as we try to apply the same logic to rape, it becomes extremely controversial.

aVI left a comment with similar sentiments.
p38763
aVMy comment: \u000a\u000a&gt; more women are in prison for less serious offences; \u000a\u000aAt the University of Michigan, Prof. Sonja Starr's found in "Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal Cases," that after controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, "men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do," and "[w]omen are\u2026twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.
p38764
aV"  I doubt UK is significantly tougher on women offenders than the United States.
p38765
aV&gt; they are more likely to have been victims of abuse; \u000a\u000aDiscrimination against boys and men who are victims of domestic and sexual violence is systematic in the UK.
p38766
aVFor instance, the British Home Secretary recently announced new anti-domestic violence measures that appear to specifically exclude men and boys who are victims, and also appear discriminatory towards LGBT victims "Bullying husbands who shout at their wives could be found guilty of domestic abuse under new crackdown" (daily mail)\u000a\u000a&gt; mental health problems are more prevalent in female than male prisoners; \u000a\u000aThe male suicide rate in the UK is 3 1/2 times higher than the female rate "There were 4,590 male suicides registered in 2012, compared with 1,391 female, equating to 18.2 per 100,000 men and 5.2 per 100,000 women, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
p38767
aV" (souce the Guardian) \u000a\u000aIt seems that women may be more likely to be diagnosed correctly.
p38768
aV&gt; and, of course, there is the issue of motherhood.
p38769
aVAnd fatherhood.
p38770
aVThe United Kingdom has consistently failed to honor its human rights obligations to fathers and their children under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as the Council of Europe Social Charter.
p38771
aVRecently, the Argus reported that: "SOCIAL services have apologised for a culture of failing to tell fathers about their children\u2019s welfare.
p38772
aV", and a report written by Professor Alexis Jay called the \u201cIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham.\u201d said: "In two of the cases we read, fathers tracked down their daughters and tried to remove them from houses where they were being abused, only to be arrested themselves when police were called to the scene.

p38922
aVTo many deaths this year IMO.
p38923
aVThey found a second body of a man they believe could be the suspect.
p38924
aVI cant believe he even managed to get into this country after murdering his wife in his birth country.
p38925
aVNice one immigration control
p38926
aVYeah, yet another one again today...\u000aYou can tell they are immigrants when they dont name the suspects...
p38927
aVI presume this is another honour killing...\u000a\u000a\u000ahttps://uk.news.yahoo.com/woman-children-found-dead-020352807.html#le9Hcb
p38928
aVI see UK inflation slowdown last month!
p38929
aVSeeing as the average age of first-time buyers is currently around 47, this should reduce demand for mortgages quite significantly.
p38930
aVApparently, property ownership is to become an elites-only undertaking, with the majority once again paying rent to support an elite minority.
p38931
aV&gt; the average age of first-time buyers is currently around 47\u000a\u000aMy bollocks-detector is tingling.
p38932
aVAre you sure that isn't average age for people to be completing their mortgages, or of the parents of first-time buyers?
p38933
aVAll the FTB'ers I know, and all the home owners I met when looking to buy my own property bought in their 20s or early 30s.
p38934
aVThe buyers in their 40s I know are all onto their second or third homes, several with a BTL or two to their names.
p38935
aV47 is the UK figure for the past 3 years.
p38936
aVI have no idea what it is anywhere else.
p38937
aVSource?
p38938
aVIt sounds absolutely unbelievable, especially considering the number of people *over* 47 buying for the first time that that figure would need to work out.
p38939
aVSo in other words, things are reverberating to the olden days where the well-to-do owned nice houses out in the burbs and the majority rented?
p38940
aVIf so, I'm guessing that, historically, mass mortgages will be a relatively short term blip on the historical radar? 
p38941
aVWell that's me completely fucked then.
p38942
aVDoesn't this constitute age discrimination?
p38943
aVGood point.
p38944
aVYou could probably make a case.
p38945
aVIt could also be a load of old scare mongering.
p38946
aVWhy is it always the ugly chavs that do these sorts of things?
p38947
aVSince when giving food lands you in jail?
p38948
aVWhat's wrong with this country
p38949
aVwho wants to bet it was a brony?
p38950
aVWe definitely need something to break the UK news channels to get the conversation and debate open about marijuana in the UK.
p38951
aVBut I think this will ultimately be detrimental to what they're trying to achieve.
p38952
aVYeah, dumb fuck, it's not slander when you actually said those things...
p38953
aVThe thing with bigots is they CANNOT lie.
p38954
aVThey'll deny something that's plain in the face.
p38955
aVNo mention in the article of her Facebook posts regarding cannabis.
p38956
aVIs it just seen as a non issue?
p38957
aVThat's a good point!
p38958
aVWhat is it about Northern Ireland and bat shit crazy people?
p38959
aVIs it something in the water?
p38960
aVThis is somewhat puzzling.
p38961
aVI believe [this is the backstory](https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/articles/class/).
p38962
aVApparently, BBC Lab UK tests are [now closed](https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/class/).
p38963
aV&gt; Scientific surveys will hopefully return.
p38964
aV??
p38965
aV?
aVWhy are you posting daily mail articles?
p38966
aVIs that a serious question?
p38967
aVIt's good to hear what people are writing/reading.
p38968
aVEven (especially) the confused masses!
p38969
aV:-P
p38970
aVWhy not? 
p38971
aVI honestly don't know when I last wrote a cheque and I'm not even sure where my cheque book is.
p38972
aVI was speaking to my dad yesterday, and he said he's had to write one for the first time in years a few days back.
p38973
aVNice though this is, I feel it's a little late! 
p38974
aVI have literally never written a cheque in my life.
p38975
aVI quite like the idea as a way of matching up old and new tech - e.g.
p38976
aVI know one person who is very much a cheque person, and this would let the rest of us interact in a way that suits our more modern preferences :)
p38977
aVThat seems a rather inconsistent verdict.
p38978
aVI guess it is true what they say about gender coming into play in criminal cases.
p38979
aVYes.
p38980
aVI wonder how a close, personal friend of the country's current prime minister, and a trusted member of the murdoch group get found not guilty.
p38981
aV?
aVOr a jury full of redheads. 
p38982
aVI can see his point about the timing being suspicious (if there is currently a  local election campaign going on in NI, as someone who lives in England their politics are even more weird and distant than those of Wales and Scotland, yet still their politicians get to mess around with my life), however as a representative of a political party that has generally accepted links with a terrorist group he has to accept that he will be formally questioned whenever relevant.
p38983
aVHm, the only thing is that he is a suspect in a murder case and he walked into a police station voluntarily to talk to them about that murder.
p38984
aVIf he hadn't of done that, the police probably would have waited, but he sort of forced their hand.
p38985
aVTo put it into context, if somebody was suspected of murdering somebody yesterday, and they presented themselves to police today but had a holiday planned tomorrow, would the police hold off until after their holiday to arrest them?
p38986
aVSpeaking as a person who actually has met women in my lifetime, and spoken with them about gender roles and the way colours are chosen for gender stereotypes, a better way to gather the attention of female voters would be to make it jetblack with flame decals and awesome spikes.
p38987
aVFemale=/= girly.
p38988
aVMost women appreciate awesomeness, just as much as most men do.
p38989
aVMake it (effing) metal, make it rad, make it an artifice of sheer win, and the people will support your cause.
p38990
aVI think the main issue she has here is that you don't see a story like this on the front page of a Sunday paper every time a popular clothing company utilises sweatshop labour.
p38991
aVYou can be critical of it, but I personally can't escape the feeling, that the company is getting a disproportionate amount of criticism for aligning itself as feminist.
p38992
aVI do believe it is fair for Mauritians to enjoy proper compensation for their efforts, certainly when compared to the plight of 1st world females.
p38993
aVHowever if you enforce a (western) living wage/standard of living where these sweatshops are, the factories disappear, and unfortunately they aren't replaced with universities, equality and other options for economic growth and mobility.
p38994
aVAlso bearing in mind that, for the most part, people work in these factories and live in these conditions, because it is the best option they have.
p38995
aVIndeed.
p38996
aVThe typical Daily Mail, very directed to suite their agenda.
p38997
aVThey don't really discuss the issue at all, they just use it to defame.. in fact I think you've covered the issue much more comprehensively than they have.
p38998
aVPapers, especially tabloids, give me nightmares...
p38999
aVThe sexually repressed culture has a secret porn habit?
p39000
aVno..
p39001
aVNot sure I've done this post right.
p39002
aVI wanted to make the point that the title is misleading, and my discontentment with the BBC for letting their standards get so low.
p39003
aVAnyone reading this title would assume that it referred to the general Saudi population.
p39004
aVGiven the first paragraph:\u000a\u000a&gt; Up to 70% of files exchanged between Saudi teenagers' mobile phones contain pornography, according to a study in the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom.
p39005
aVis also so misleading I think that a reader would be forgiven missing the crucial element that:\u000a\u000a&gt; The study quoted in Arab News focussed on the phones of teenagers detained by religious police for harassing girls.
p39006
aVI mean seriously?!
p39007
aVHow can you possibly extrapolate such a small and specific study group to "Saudi" or, only slightly less misleading "Saudi Teenagers".
p39008
aVI would expect better from the UK's publicly funded broadcaster.
p39009
aVThey should be setting the standard for journalism, not resorting to cheap and misleading titles to increase hits.
p39010
aVNB This article was on the top 10 trending articles they have on the side of their front page (why they don't highlight when the article isn't *new* is another question I'd like to ask them).  \u000a\u000a
p39011
aVYou definitely have a point, I'm not sure this is a trend among a large number of BBC articles though.
p39012
aVIt was also 7 1/2 years ago, I would think things had changed amongst bbc news web editors since.
p39013
aVSo although this is bad and perhaps should be removed/edited more recent examples would be good if there's an issue that needs addressing.
p39014
aVI've spotted it here and there.
p39015
aVThis was the most blatant.
p39016
aVYeah, apologies for the lack of relevance.
p39017
aVI only picked up on it because it was trending on the BBC front page, for some reason?
p39018
aVReally misleading headline, as you'd expect from a biased organisation, the MP in question was not involved but was simply a witness, she could have been walking by for christs sake.
p39019
aVAnd F4J have called for her to be investigated, what a load of bull
p39020
aVoh fuck off david.
p39021
aVyou've cried wolf and lied so much that now you've something important to say we can't believe you.
p39022
aVI like how were spinning a foreign policy problem to merit getting involved again in the region or militarisation of domestic law enforcement.
p39023
aVNot to say this isn't a problem though, I just feel that with the state of the UK's press its seems to be snowballing towards racist victimisation of immigrants and more stringent anti-terrorism measures. 
p39024
aVThe actual link http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31721334

aV#
aVPlain packaging isn't to stop young people being taken in with glitzy packaging, it's designed to avoid brand recognition and negate marketing.
p39026
aVIf a tobacco company can't show its brand on cigarettes then marketing them is a whole load harder.
p39027
aVIf plain packaging really made no difference, then the tobacco companies wouldn't care.
p39028
aVHowever, they have launched legal bids to get Australia to change the law and organised campaign groups to be vocal about it.
p39029
aVLastly, banning tobacco would be dumb because banning substances is dumb - prohibition and the war on drugs demonstrates that quite well.
p39030
aVThis really feels like a sponsored post to me...
p39031
aV"Since the ban on smoking in pubs 6000 have closed down" yup, it's all about not being able to smoke in them and totally nothing to do with the massive global downturn...
p39032
aVI'd rarely, if ever go to a pub if smoking were allowed in it as, I think would many people...
p39033
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lep6XIVPevk
p39034
aVFirstly,  I don't have a clue how the "Englishman"  making the post could dare to call himself English while making a bunch of frankly confusing messages that seem to revolve almost exclusively selfish arguments about the benefits he'd receive from being English are made from an office chair in Poland!
p39035
aVOp is Polish,  and frankly he's welcome to stay there for as long as humanly possible.
p39036
aVIt was a mistake letting the eastern bloc in the EU, and the UK have done nothing but suffer because of it. 
p39037
aVI think you've missed the point.
p39038
aVFirstly, he's not in Poland - he's in Germany.
p39039
aVSecondly, he was born in Britain and raised there but qualifies for Polish citizenship through heritage on one side of his family.
p39040
aVMaybe it is a personal reflection on the consequences of the current policy of the government, but it these affect millions of citizens of the UK.
p39041
aVMaybe you fancy answering some of the questions posed?
p39042
aVWhat is Britishness?
p39043
aVHow do English people with no contact with Scotland conceive of their Englishness?
p39044
aVThis.
p39045
aVThis truly hurts me.
p39046
aVWhat the fuck has happened to the world we live in?
p39047
aVI truly despair.
p39048
aVPoorly editorialized title for such a horrific act.

Vappreciate the links.
p39133
aVit is pretty clear the u. s.  has been allowing/aiding isis to develop as it has now become the new rallying cry for security and safety.
p39134
aVthe danger of al qaeda  is a bit satiated at this point, so we show a few supposed beheadings of journalists and pump up the fear in order for the public to get behind another invasion (Syria and Iraq)... although Syria is more crucial given they are in the midst of a civil war and are a sovereign state. 
p39135
aVI'm also in California and I have not had issues with the DMV currently.
p39136
aVWe just had an upgrade and it's very nice. 
p39137
aVno, you wont get killed..
p39138
aVWhere are you planning on traveling?
p39139
aVAs far as I know, there are no areas in the United States where you would face violence of any kind on the basis of race, especially not Asian.
p39140
aVLike the comment before me, unless it is a random act of violence or accident, you have nothing to fear.
p39141
aVLet me know if you have any other questions about travel to the US, I am a fellow traveler and love to help out!
p39142
aVWell, you might... by a random murderer, or a car, or a rouge flying ice cream truck, or a mugger, or a tornado, or street explosions, or by the fat people on electric wheelchairs.
p39143
aVBut so far as i know you won't be killed because you are Asian in most of the US.
p39144
aVMaybe somewhere in the deep south?
p39145

p39151
aVMembers of the electoral college *represent*  the people that live in their districts, regardless of whether or not they can vote, including felons and minors.
p39152
aVThat's the whole idea behind representative government and proportional allotment.
p39153
aVYour claim that the "electoral college assumes that the state's entire population can vote" is not true.
p39154
aVThey do not make that assumption.
p39155
aVFurther, your point about babies is bizarre.
p39156
aVDo children not have a right to be counted in the population?
p39157
aVDo they not have a right to be represented?
