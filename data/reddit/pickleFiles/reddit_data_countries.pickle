VI think it would work better if we just found 365 people to take shifts of a day each.
p5
aVSet them off with a five pound subway voucher and a dairylea lunchables.
p6
aVIm down with this.
p7
aVShotgun day 100
p8
aVI can see how that would be very tempting, but I really think you should just stick with a camera.
p9
aVAh, the ol' Reddit [cameraroo](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2a7jxa/i_helped_some_people_move_today_and_made_a/cisql2k?context=2).
p10
aVHold my canon, I'm going in.
p11
aV[deleted]
p12
aV...this is a thing?
p13
aVUp parascope!
p14
aVDive!
p15
aVDive!
p16
aVDive!
p17
aVPew pew pew!
p18
aVIf we are counting from today you had better book 17th October off.
p19
aVAnd are you sure you want to give up a Friday to follow that cunt around?
p20
aVlunchables make up for it 
p21
aVi did mine yesterday.
p22
aVwhere's my subway voucher?
p23
aV?
aV[deleted]
p24
aVyea i ummm forgot to put film in my camera
p25
aVGod damnit Krieger!
p26
aVDespise them all you want, but some paparazzi are actually professionals who are skilled at what they do (ie shooting situations to fabricate bullshit.
p27
aV)  Fast tele lenses aren't cheap, either.
p28
aV340 days out of a year with some boneheads snapping blurry garbage with their phones isn't going to achieve the same effect.
p29
aVEncouraging folks to add to the scrum at critical times/events might be a useful thing, if everyone behaves.
p30
aVI don't think skill is the key intent here.
p31
aVI think it's just to be an invasive arsehole.
p32
aVI'd imagine most people would struggle to be as invasive either.
p33
aVThey'd probably just stand a few metres away taking pictures.
p34
aVi don't think they mean physically invasive, more invasive of privacy
p35
aVTake pictures of his wife , his kids, when they go on school trips, run shitty little stories about how his kids will be hot when they're older - run constant stories about dodgy tax dealings. 
p36
aVAssuming you aren't actually a 'journalist' this is a good way to get arrested
p37
aVNah it'll be fine, put a small disclaimer buried deep in the CSS stylesheet that everything written is not necessarily true and is the subject of parody.
p38
aVThat'll definitely cover it.
p39
aV^^^^\u005c(IANAL)
p40
aVA CSS stylesheet?
p41
aVIs that like a PIN number or ATM machine?
p42
aVI use it to make my source code look pretty.
p43
aVWell I've not seen anyone getting arrested for it so far.
p44
aV£5 barely gets you a footlong these days and not a good footlong either 
p45
aVItalian BMT and a drink for a fiver.
p46
aVThat'll do me. 
p47
aVDo people know about the Chicken Pizziola?
p48
aVPeople often have no idea what I am talking about (thankfully the staff do) but it's a great sub!
p49
aVI've seen them Stateside, but not here.
p50
aVYou can get them!
p51
aVI have them pretty much every time and the staff always know what I am on about.
p52
aVI did actually see it on the menu once but it didn't have an image and people still don't seem to notice it.
p53
aVThey were in the subway here for a while, on the board at the back I mean.
p54
aVThey were ok but not enough to sway me from my BMT.
p55
aVYeah the BMT is my subway of choice as well here in the UK
p56
aVSteak and cheese, man.
p57
aVNothing else comes close for a lunch sub.
p58
aVBut steak and cheese isn't in the £5 drink deal.
p59
aVI'm not paying like £8 for a sandwich with a drink lol
p60
aVThat and southwest sauce....
p61
aV[deleted]
p62
aVYeah it is, if it's not on the menu (I think it might be on at the mo but without a picture) then the staff will know what you mean.
p63
aVAh, the good old big man ting. 
p64
aVWe told a friend it stands for big meaty twat and he still orders them today as such.
p65
aVHe hasn't realised it's not that. 
p66
aVWith honey mustard.
p67
aVA man after my own heart!
p68
aVCheese, but not toasted FTW.
p69
aVWhat sort of savage are you? 
p70
aVI don't like how the toasting drys the bread out.
p71
aVI like my subway soft. 
p72
aVsoft southerner confirmed
p73
aVSo, did you go down to watch the tour the other day?, I was planning on driving to Sheffield to have a watch but figured it would be rubbish for the 30 or so seconds that the riders go past.
p74
aVWas it packed out?
p75
aVYork resident; can confirm, was well rammed.
p76
aVHaving seen a lot of my trans-Yorkshire mates' pictures, it was the same pretty much everywhere, even in the inconvenient parts of the Dales (a bunch of incredibly masochistic people even cycled up Buttertubs Pass).
p77
aVDo they still charge VAT on toasted sandwiches?
p78
aVMan I haven't had subway in ages
p79
aVI've always been offered it as an optional free thing, never something I've paid extra for
p80
aVWell I remember seeing a sign around the time of the "pasty tax" saying that now they'd have to charge VAT.
p81
aVMaybe it's been reversed now, I'm not sure. 
p82
aVGo the extra quid &amp; bacon that sub up.
p83
aV[deleted]
p84
aVIts the same price here
p85
aVWhat?
p86
aVWhere do you live?
p87
aVIt's *exactly* a fiver for a footlong. 
p88
aVyeah but like the 6 healthy ones.
p89
aVIt's all about the steak and cheese or chicken teriyaki 
p90
aVItalian BMT is now considered healthy?
p91
aVSweet Jesus! 
p92
aVIs Italian bmt part of it?
p93
aVIt used to be the 6 'low fat' ones that were the cheaper deal.
p94
aVChicken pizziola and chicken avocado are nice too
p95
aVOh yeah baby, it's included. 
p96
aVWhat the fuck is a pizziola? 
p97
aVThey toast it with cheese and the meatball sauce.
p98
aVTry it.
p99
aVConsider it considered! 
p100
aVItalian bmt has been part of it for donks.
p101
aVThey used to also give you crisps or a cookie, but they ditched that a couple years ago.
p102
aVYou might as well buy some rubber and pur 250g of salt on it.
p103
aVSubway meat is so shit it on the verge of being vegan.
p104
aVOnly for the cheapy ones.
p105
aVThe good ones are either 5.39 or 5.89.    
p106
aVI will literally do it everyday.
p107
aVFor fun, and 30k.
p108
aVI would happily be a part of this.
p109
aVGive me a greggs voucher and I would be the first one there.
p110
aVI've got a week-old bacon sarnie and I can microwave a grey meat pasty for you.
p111
aVDeal?
p112
aVDone and done.
p113
aVSubstitute the Lunchable with a snack pot of Moroccan Style cous cous and I'm in.
p114
aVJoking apart, I've been wondering when someone would do this.
p115
aVI've pretty much come to realise it hasn't come to pass because 50% of the time, celebrities want/need the publicity.
p116
aVThey just find that they can't put the genie back in the bottle when they get caught getting a BJ from a hooker.
p117
aVThat being said, the Daily Mail is utterly  reprehensible.
p118
aVIf it shines a light on their BS, I'm right behind it.
p119
aVI'm not sure it will get anywhere, but if a few more people start wondering why do many people *loathe* The Mail...\u000a\u000aEDIT:  On the off-chance this does blow up, I think you'd better be very careful - harassment and all that jazz.  
p120
aVThis sounds like fun.
p121
aVI'll do it for a 99p KFC streetwise snack
p122
aVI will do it for a Bargain Bucket, it may be a little bit more expensive, but the end product will be far superior.
p123
aVRather than employing someone, wouldn't it be better to straight up offer £1000 every week to anyone who can get the best/worst photo of him.
p124
aVThink how many broke students there are in London who'd wank off a tramp for a grand.
p125
aVIt would annoy him far more than one dude wandering around after him\u000a\u000a
p126
aVI demand cheese strings.
p127
aVThey taste fucking foul, but that'll keep me awake.
p128
aV[deleted]
p129
aVAlso if it's someone different every day he'll be less likely to see them coming. 
p130
aVOscar Meyer must have bought dairyleA.
p131
aVShame
p132
aVI see.
p133
aVMiddle management? 
p134
aVI'm in, but can I take one of the early days please, I'm going on maternity soon.
p135
aVThis was funny enough before I started imagining a Glasgow accent saying it.
p136
aVHow about making this a challenge for anyone living in/ visiting London?
p137
aVThen fund it like You've Been Framed - 250 upvotes for every entry ;-)
p138
aVI don' think 365 people would be as annying as the sme one all the time.
p139
aVAlso, a real pap (or at least a dedicated amateur) will learn where he goes etc and be more effective.
p140
aVHaving said all of that, the real annoyance of paparazzi must be their ubiquity.
p141
aVA celebrity can take a car or even plane somewhere, get out and still have attention.
p142
aVWe couldn't match that without more staff.
p143
aVCount me in for a day but I need double lunchables.
p144
aV*edit* diarrhea lunchables
p145
aV*tube
p146
aVAlright,  a dairylea tube then. 
p147
aVAnd set up a website with invasive photos of him on holiday, walking down the street, going to dinner with people, hanging out with his family - potentially adding unsubstantiated comments as context to the photos (saying he has family problems if one of the photos makes his wife look a bit sad; say he's under pressure in his job if one photo makes him look a little bit stressed). 
p148
aVDepending on the workload of our private paparazzi, they could maybe take invasive photos of other Daily Mail journalists too - Liz Jones and Richard Littlejohn especially.
p149
aVYou should see this when it comes out: http://www.frontlineclub.com/one-rogue-reporter/
p150
aVThat looks like something I could get behind
p151
aVAh Littlejohn, the lover of britain, who cries himself to sleep at night as immigrants, health and safety, and the "workshy"  ruin his beloved country, lives in the good ole USA for.most of the year, so we might want to hire another paparazzi just for him
p152
aV[deleted]
p153
aVIt would have to be a quintessentially English cake, like a Victoria sponge
p154
aVArgh, that bastard Littlejohn.
p155
aVWhenever I have a chat with my mum about how shite the Mail is, she goes "Oh sometimes Littlejohn says something good" and it depresses me.
p156
aVI don't even know why she looks at it if she thinks/knows the rest of it is crap.
p157
aVShe complains about how they post retractions in with small ads in the back of the paper when the original lie was posted in the headline on P1, and still buys the bloody thing.
p158
aVBut then again, so does my dad (divorced, they don't just both buy the paper haha) and now my cat's dead so I don't even get the pleasure of seeing her having done a big shit on Jan Moir's face every week.
p159
aVJust the mention of Dick Littlejohn's name makes me angry.
p160
aVIf we have a nice big smear article about him and send hatemail to him (of the "you're the scum of the earth, you pile of pigshit" variety) then I'm in.
p161
aVI wouldn't really group those two together.
p162
aVLiz Jones is just a bit crazy/eccentric.
p163
aVShe's not an evil bigoted fuck.
p164
aV[Try here for some better choices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Notable_regular_contributors_.28present.29).
p165
aVJan Moir is infinitely more hateful than Liz Jones.
p166
aVTrue, yeah, very true!
p167
aVSorry to hijack this comment thread, but what's the deal with this Paul Dacre?
p168
aVCan I help write pithy headlines like "Here is Paul Dacre on holiday: he obviously doesn't care what he is wearing today" if I pitch in for the sarnie fund?
p169
aVTwo children died today in a house fire in Whitby.
p170
aVWhere is Paul Dacre?
p171
aVSunning Himself in Majorca.
p172
aVWhen asked if he was enjoying himself, he said he 'hopes HE doesn't get BURNT'!!
p173
aVPolice have yet to deny if he was the cause of the blaze.
p174
aVHaha!
p175
aVDo you actually write for the mail?
p176
aVNo wait you didn't mention immigrants, cancer or Princess Di.
p177
aVFalse alarm. 
p178
aVI'm claiming headline rights to any snaps of him looking after young family members.
p179
aV**Paul Day-care**
p180
aV&gt;Paedo Paul strikes again
p181
aVI'm claiming headline rights to any snaps of him looking badly dressed.
p182
aV**Paul Don't-care**
p183
aVWith any luck we can get him doing the classic 'hide under a blanket' anti pap manoeuvre.
p184
aVThen we can headline it as 'Shawl Dacre'.
p185
aVIf he trips over\u000a\u000a**Fall Dacre**
p186
aVYeah and take photos of his daughter and comment on how she looks "older than her years" or how she's "all grown up"
p187
aVAnd how she's 'showing off' when she's wearing a bikini or dress, and how she is 'sizzling' and has a 'sexy toned physique' (or 'curvier frame' if she's a bit bigger or 'trim figure' if she's smaller).
p188
aVBut bring back hanging for paedos
p189
aVDoes he have a daughter?
p190
aVEDIT: Wikipedia confirms he has two sons. 
p191
aVYeah that doesnt fly so well on the daily mail website.
p192
aVThat's more of a Parliament thing
p193
aVWe could still give them the same treatment, highlight the sexism at the same time as the paedophilic undertones.
p194
aVThat just sounds like a stupid way to be just as bad as them. 
p195
aVWell, you may be right.
p196
aVMight not be worth it to lose the high ground, even if it does hurt Dacre more.
p197
aVYou have to make them questions or you can get sued.
p198
aVIs the Dacre household falling apart?
p199
aVCould the look on Mrs. Dacre's face be described as "upset-with-infidelity"?
p200
aVDon't forget the full Femail treatment, big red circles all over photos of him, highlighting crows feet, fat ankles, cellulite, thinning hair, liver spots, etc , etc...oh, and that he's a cunt.
p201
aVI know the sentiment behind getting photos of his family, but isn't against the law to pap children?
p202
aVThe Mail get away with it because of who they are and their ability to pay for lawyers, but Dacre and the government will come down on redditors like a ton of bricks.
p203
aVA kickstarter wouldn't begin to cover legal fees\u000a\u000aPapping Dacre's fine though, love the idea.
p204
aVFind a friendly American to run the website and host in America.
p205
aVFirst amendment motherfuckers! 
p206
aVAh yes, America, that bastion of digital freedom.
p207
aVThey are far from perfect, for this type of thing they're a lot better than the UK
p208
aVFor invading privacy?
p209
aV:P Yup, I guess they are. 
p210
aVAs far as I'm aware he is quite the recluse.  
p211
aV#DailyDacre hashtag with livefeed on the website!!
p212
aVWith competitions
p213
aVI'm gonna be playing the role of Buzz Killington here but:\u000a\u000aWon't we be upsetting a lot of innocent parties here?
p214
aVHis kids shouldn't have to suffer just because their dad is a cunt.
p215
aVAgreed, which is why the original post I've updated to not include his family in this at all - we won't stoop to his level.
p216
aVAnd just talk about what he's wearing.
p217
aV"Looking drab in a pair of brown shoes"
p218
aVAnd then when he finds out who has been doing it he will do the same to you and publish complete lies about you.
p219
aVThen you can sue the DM but they won't care because that happens all the time. \u000a\u000a
p220
aVWould it not be better just to offer a bounty for photos of him?
p221
aVSay starting at £50 for a simple leaving home snap, then going up in value the more embarrassing and candid the photos are. 
p222
aV&gt;Would it not be better just to offer a bounty \u000a\u000ayes, now we're talking!
p223
aV&gt;for photos of him?
p224
aVOh.
p225
aV:(
p226
aVI can't decide if you're disappointed that Dacre isn't going to be murdered, or that you're not getting a tasty coconut chocolate bar.
p227
aVEither way, I'm with you.
p228
aV&gt;I can't decide if you're disappointed that Dacre isn't going to be murdered, or that you're not getting a tasty coconut chocolate bar.
p229
aVYes.
p230
aVIt wasn't that when you offered me a kit-kat to fuck up Kelvin Mackenzie.
p231
aV"So, let's see these photos then, buddy".
p232
aV"...what?
p233
aV".
p234
aV"Of course.
p235
aVYou want proof!
p236
aV"
aValbum in comments ;)
p237
aVNow i have image of Paul saying "i'm shy, here's my butthole"
p238
aVThis is the way to do it.
p239
aVNot employ someone new, but use the existing paps and buy photos off them.
p240
aVI will throw a few quid in.
p241
aVI think the funny part of this is that he will probably hire his own person and take pictures that no one else can get, thus profiting the money we gave him and only taking pictures that he consents to.
p242
aVThis plan is retarded.
p243
aVJust go take the damn pictures yourself.
p244
aVYou are right.
p245
aVIt won't work. 
p246
aVBear in mind that the existing paps are probably going to be rather nervous of screwing one of their most important customers.
p247
aV£1000 on wanking in the bath
p248
aVI don't know.
p249
aVI mean, I really like coconut in a chocolate bar, but I think I might need a better payment to stalk the daily mail editor.
p250
aV£25 for him accidentally dropping something.
p251
aVWhy not make that paparazzi an Eastern European immigrant?
p252
aVIt would make Dacre double furious.
p253
aVA gay Eastern European immigrant?
p254
aVA gay Eastern European benefit claiming single mother of six
p255
aVA gay Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benefits because she's also working as a paparazzi.
p256
aV*In a wheelchair.
p257
aV*
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair....*who doesn't love britain*. 
p258
aVEven I'm getting angry now.
p259
aVI'm assuming you're Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish.
p260
aVEveryone knows the only appropriate emotion a *true* Englishman feels about England/Britain is a sort of approving sense of mild embarrassment, lest we start getting overexcited and accidentally invade and oppress anyone.
p261
aVI'm dreadfully sorry but I do have to disagree, I don't think getting overexcited is particularly British either, we'll leave that to those frightfully brash rebels across the ocean 
p262
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair *who doesn't love britain* and her kids don't speak English and cost the taxpayer £22,000 per year in order to employ a translator for their school work. \u000a\u000a
p263
aVThat translator?
p264
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who is fraudelently claiming benefits in a wheelchair *who doesn't love britain* and *her* kids don't speak english and cost the taxpay.....
p265
aVThe translator is a left-wing Green Party voting, royal family hater.
p266
aVOooh yeah, anti-royalist, forgot about that one.
p267
aVTbh we just want to piss the guy off right?
p268
aVNot give him an stroke.
p269
aVCan we shoehorn some Muslim in as well?
p270
aVPlease don't make me type that shit out again, I'm on my phone.
p271
aVQuite frankly I'm surprised we haven't already.
p272
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair who doesn't love britain and her kids don't speak English and cost the taxpayer £22,000 per year in order to employ a translator for their school work.....and she's a converted Muslim
p273
aVAnd she participated in The NHS part of the opening ceremony.
p274
aVA gay, black Eastern European single mother of six who's fraudulently claiming benifits in a wheelchair....who doesn't love britain **and** is a cyclist.
p275
aVWhile causing cancer?
p276
aVNomadic cancer, the worst kind. 
p277
aVI have a fuck buddy down south who is literally this so it's not impossible
p278
aVSerious question - Do you really think that Paul Dacre actually gives a shit about immigration?
p279
aVThis is something I genuinely feel most people either miss or forget.
p280
aVI doubt him or any of his writers really feel as they write, but it sells.
p281
aVAnd as long as it sells, they'll continue to write it and allow those offensive columns.
p282
aVIt's all about money and nothing else. 
p283
aVaka Rita Skeeter
p284
aV[deleted]
p285
aVI'll do it.
p286
aVI'll even buy one of those fancy DLSR cameras instead of using my 4 year old phone.
p287
aVYou're welcome!
p288
aVSuch heroics deserve more than mere thanks...
p289
aV[deleted]
p290
aV[deleted]
p291
aVWhy is that?
p292
aVAre lenses the most expensive?
p293
aVIf you want to pap him from insane distances while he's on the beach £10k is a starting point for the lens..
p294
aVFuck.
p295
aVHow do poor people get ahead in life without going into debt.
p296
aVIt's near impossible. 
p297
aVLie in gutter with cameraphone, take pictures directly up celebrities skirts, sell to mail
p298
aV&gt; Fuck.
p299
aVHow do poor people get ahead in life without going into debt.
p300
aVIt's near impossible.
p301
aVI'm confused.
p302
aVDid you in an instant acquire a dream of being a photographer and then decide its impossible because you need £10k capital?
p303
aVWe can easily find 1000 people who hate him enough and have a spare tenner - let's have a whip round.
p304
aVOne word, quadrocopter.
p305
aVHave a camera drone with a GoPro following the man wherever he goes. 
p306
aVLenses are "jesus fucking christ" expensive. 
p307
aVThe only problem is we also need a publication to publish these photos that enough people can see.
p308
aVSure we can host online but if its something no one would go on the photos would be in vain.
p309
aVNot that being stalked and photographed simultaneously for your life isnt degrading and inhumane.
p310
aVJust post it to Reddit, then the Metro will publish it in 3 days time.
p311
aVDon't forget Buzzfeed and the Independent
p312
aVAnd the Guardian
p313
aVErr create a subreddit, twitter, facebook?
p314
aVNewspapers are dying but maybe private eye?
p315
aVPrivate Eye can take a couple more court cases for the team... right?
p316
aVA tumblr would do.
p317
aVWith a newpapery theme. 
p318
aVIt could get trending on twitter, that counts as legitimate news, these days. 
p319
aVI feel like the point is not to make sure people see photos of him, but to give him a taste of his own medicine.
p320
aVOf course, that means a judge would rule this harassment of some kind without a second thought.
p321
aVI just posted pretty much the same thing three days later than you and I feel silly now
p322
aVCould crowd-source it.
p323
aV#pappauldacre? 
p324
aVOh God, that's brilliant.
p325
aVThe kickstarter funds a prize per week for the most invasive photo.
p326
aVNice, yeah.
p327
aV£54,000 Kickstarter, offering £1,000 a week for a year to the sleaziest photo of him (or maybe his family too, but I feel like it's teaching his family a lesson for their horrible father/husband etc) OR the person who photographs him the most over the day. 
p328
aVSomething doesn't add up there
p329
aVSorry, 52.
p330
aVEh, you can keep the extra 2k, it was a good idea.
p331
aVYou'd actually need about 54 anyway because of Kickstarter's fees.
p332
aVI'd do it for £50k... plus expenses obviously, if he swans off to the carribean, I aint paying that out of my own pocket?
p333
aVDo you accept dogecoin?
p334
aVFuck yes.
p335
aV^To ^^the ^^^moon!
p336
aVnope - cash only.
p337
aVSorry\u000a
p338
aVYou're fired. 
p339
aVShame, good thing that I kept my dayjob...
p340
aVDon't quit your dayjob
p341
aV[deleted]
p342
aVTake the money.
p343
aVPay someone else less to continue in lieu of you.
p344
aVProfit.
p345
aVDefinitely stay away from his family.
p346
aVYou shouldn't punish people for what family members do in the hope that it incentivises him to do something.
p347
aVThey have done nothing to deserve such harassment, and to do so would make you a hypocrite.
p348
aVAlso, you should add a caveat about the prize not being offered if the Daily Mail stops posting such shots
p349
aVAs if reddit would pay a paparazzo anything to do anything but punch himself in the groin for 10 hours a day
p350
aVI wouldn't trust them to follow through much better to pay a couple of amateur boxers and the paparazzi 
p351
aVWaiiiiiit.
p352
aV**I'LL DO IT FOR 20,000**
p353
aVThis is the best post I've seen on this subreddit in ages.
p354
aVI'll pledge £50 if you get it up and running.
p355
aVI want my reward to be some exclusive pictures of him looking angry and swearing. 
p356
aVI have never contributed to a kickstarter before, but this would be very hard to resist
p357
aV£30k isn't a great salary for somebody required to travel around, especially in and out of London.
p358
aVWe could up it to £40k, I was thinking of a realistic salary for a paparazzi (we could just get a normal photographer with no experience of paparazzi-ing to cut costs).
p359
aVAh, then the plan may be in trouble.
p360
aVPaparazzi are paid per photo, the price of each photo being relative to its rarity, nuance, and popularity of subject.
p361
aVPictures of Dacre would not be rare, nuanced, and he certainly isn't popular.
p362
aVA salary is a way to do this.
p363
aVYou'd just need to factor in additional expenses.
p364
aVPerhaps crowd sourcing is the solution - start a web page, invite people to take and post pictures of Dacre.
p365
aVBut he needs people taking photos of him ALL the time - night, day, on holiday, at dinner etc etc.
p366
aVPaying someone to make it basically their full-time job (on a year-long contract, we can add in travel expenses) is the only way to do it?
p367
aVThe crowd-sourcing way sounds too unreliable for him to always be stalked by paps 24/7.
p368
aVOh, 24/7?
p369
aVThen you'd need 3 people minimum working full time, and 1 part time for weekends.
p370
aVShit, good point - well maybe not 24/7, but any time he is awake basically.
p371
aVDamn.
p372
aVMaybe crowd-sourcing is the better idea - raise money to be able to offer bounties for the juciest, sleaziest photos of him.
p373
aVThey like to call it papping. 
p374
aV£30k salary, and they maintain right to their photos.
p375
aVBusiness consultant in London here.
p376
aV£30k is what I make.
p377
aVI thought it was quite good :(
p378
aVSo what is the typical charge out rate for a £30k business consultant from London?
p379
aVCouldn't tell you I'm afraid, don't remember.
p380
aV£30k is just a flat payment from the company, I don't concern myself with their pricing.
p381
aVIt's probably more than I'm worth though.
p382
aVWow, this sounds weird to me, a business consultant who has no idea of the business model of the business he works at.. Lol, don't think I am being critical, just curious!
p383
aVI know the business model, but the price they charge for me is irrelevant to my daily work.
p384
aVI've seen it, but I couldn't remember the figure.
p385
aVI've actually spent a lot more time looking at the prices charged for other resources (e.g.
p386
aVoffshore consultants).
p387
aVCouldn't remember those either.
p388
aVI know it when I'm using it, but there are too many different sums to keep track.
p389
aVAlso bear in mind the rate varies with different clients/projects, there isn't just one general amount.
p390
aVI also don't really care about consultancy, I'm quitting as soon as I can afford to.
p391
aVI'd be surprised if less than £750 a day + expenses.
p392
aVSource: knowing
p393
aVSome people have little idea of the average persons salary (median is more illustrative than mean, too).
p394
aV[deleted]
p395
aVOr, in my case, 30k.
p396
aVAfter taxes, about £1800 a month.
p397
aVcame here to say that. 
p398
aVOne site says "Well-established and hard-working paparazzi can make $500,000 a year" - well this guy is pretty much only in London, will have no pressure to sell the photos, is only stalking one guy, so £30k-40k-£50k sounds pretty reasonable as they're probably working 10% as hard with just one guy and not selling photos.
p399
aVpretty sure you could have him killed for that ... nam sayin ...
p400
aVBut you don't want him killed, that'll end his suffering too soon.
p401
aVYou want him to be driven crazy from the constant papping, literally can't go an hour with any privacy.
p402
aVEventually he'll be driven so insane that he'll become a recluse living in the mountains somewhere in Asia, or worse....
p403
aVThinking too small picture here, do this... yes... but once that year's out target some other arsehole and fuck with their life.
p404
aVGood luck though.
p405
aV*paparazzo
p406
aV[Paparazzo](http://slurmed.com/fanart/immortal/023_paparazzi-bender_by-immortal-spider-matt.png)
p407
aVBoth DacreMail.com and DailyDacre.com are available to host the photos and the SCANDALOUS JUICY GOSSIP about Paul Dacre.
p408
aVHey, if they can kickstarter a [Potato Salad to make over $70,000 in 6 days,](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/324283889/potato-salad) I'm sure we could arrange this..
p409
aVI'll do it!
p410
aVI fancy a change of pace. 
p411
aVActually I'm kind of surprised some celebrity hasn't already done something like this.
p412
aVThey certainly have the money.\u000a\u000a
p413
aVYears ago some comedy programme (I forget which now) got a bunch of people to dress as Lady Di armed with cameras to chase after some paparazzi.
p414
aVIt was a single sketch rather than a prolonged effort, but the same concept.
p415
aVThey use them as much as the paparazzi uses the celebrity.  
p416
aVI would genuinely donate £30 to this.
p417
aVPart of me hopes this will happen the majority of me as actually seriously concerned that because this is the internet, this could happen.
p418
aVToday's a strange day.
p419
aVThis will work really well if you work it out properly - people love kickstarter so if people can chip in a quid or two they'll be happy to do so.
p420
aVPeople hate the DM like reddit loves bacon.
p421
aVSome imaginative stretch goals would be good.
p422
aVPretty sure this would go viral too - more liberal news sources would lap it up - huffington post, vice, Guardian etc.
p423
aVI'm not sure what the going rate for paparazzis is, but I bet it's lucrative - to get someone who's effective they may cost a lot - doing this will stop them trying to pap massive celebs who are worth tonnes, and also may make them unpopular with other red top papers, who would normally be their source of income.
p424
aVTL;DR - you may have to pay a LOT to make them bite the hand that feeds.
p425
aV[deleted]
p426
aVKickstarter is a little bit more open now and this is completely legal, as illustrated by the journalists themselves.
p427
aVKickstarter just had a guy wanting to make potato salad for lunch raise $40,000.
p428
aVThey'd allow this. 
p429
aVWe could set up our own site using [Selfstarter](http://selfstarter.us/).
p430
aVWon't work, he doesn't give a fuck.
p431
aVTarget his family, he will learn empathy pretty quickly.
p432
aV[deleted]
p433
aVMy brother is a materialistic bastard but he loves his kids.
p434
aVTarget his kids.
p435
aVIt's a fucked up mentality but seeing others hurt, specifically the ones you love because of your actions will harm you more than if you were the target.
p436
aVSay you have two kids, ideally twins, one of them does something bad.
p437
aVPunish the innocent party, let them know you are punishing them for the actions of the other.
p438
aVUnless the offender is a sociopath things will change quickly.
p439
aVWouldn't actually work on very young kids btw, have to be close to the age of reason, everyones a sociopath until this point.
p440
aVAs an example look at what feminism does in regard to rape.
p441
aVIt doesn't attack rapists it attacks other men for allowing them to rape.
p442
aVI dislike feminism but the punish the innocent mentality amongst them helped them get where they are today.
p443
aVNow these are pretty fucked up ways of dealing with things and if you use them it may very well say more about you than the scum you are attacking, but regardless they are effective.
p444
aVI read a TIL not to long ago which involved a hostage situation.
p445
aVThe russians had an interest in the situation and once one of their people was killed they found the nephew of one of the terrorists, an innocent and castrated him.
p446
aVNo more russians killed.
p447
aV&gt; My brother is a materialistic bastard but he loves his kids.
p448
aVTarget his kids.
p449
aVYou are Paul Dacre's brother?
p450
aV;-D
p451
aVPragmatic but intensely unethical.
p452
aVI wouldn't be able to be any part in doing something like this.
p453
aVI share your sentiment and yet the mentality is actually quite commonplace.
p454
aVHumanity is the most disgusting of animals.
p455
aVThere are amongst us predators of a cannibalistic type, they feed off their own.
p456
aVDacre is one of those types, terms like ethics and morality are vague suggestions rather than rules.
p457
aVInterestingly, they exist in all walks the right, the left, rich and poor.
p458
aVThey position themselves in places where they can feed from others, much like a peadophile is attracted to schools or any occupation where they can be around the kiddies.
p459
aVA physiological cannibal will place themselves in areas of influence and they will hide their true self behind an agenda or a job and they will use that as camouflage.
p460
aVHow interesting would it be to see two of them, same mentality, differing reasoning target each other.
p461
aVNow imagine this is just how things are, have always been, what kind of world do you think we would live in if rather than punishing people for their actions we punished their loved ones?
p462
aVI'm not advocating this, but give it some thought, it's really quite interesting.
p463
aVMaliciously bothering innocent people in protest of doing just that?
p464
aVBoy, you're a fucking empathetic wizard. 
p465
aVI'm available for childrens parties and hen nights.
p466
aVFull pap style, catch them walking out of restaurants ,offices... their home at 7am:\u000a\u000a "fucked any kids lately Dacre?".
p467
aV*snap snap*
p468
aVI feel like kind of a prick asking, but is this serious?
p469
aVIf so, do you have a plan of any kind?
p470
aVI'd happily chip in a fiver. 
p471
aVI'd do the job for £30,000 a year.
p472
aVHow about LetsPapPaul.com as a domain? 
p473
aV£30,000!
p474
aVGimme £5000 and I could probably find someone to make him disappear.
p475
aVI'D DONATE
p476
aVI'm sure you could hire someone to take shots with something other than than a camera for thirty grand.
p477
aVThough if we were going down *that* route we'd have to take donations in Bitcoin or something.
p478
aV[deleted]
p479
aVI'd stalk the dude for 5 years for £30,000 if you're offering.
p480
aVThe only thing lazier than kickstarter is asking someone to do it for you.
p481
aVHe would get a barrister as injunct it in two seconds flat.
p482
aVCelebs want to be followed, plebs cannot afford to do anything about it.
p483
aVDid that transgender school teacher want to be followed before killing herself?
p484
aVSo that would fall into the latter.
p485
aVI'm in.
p486
aVlet's do it.
p487
aVIs fighting hate and spite with hate and spite really the best idea?
p488
aVLike, are you guys... really serious?
p489
aVDo you want to just make the world an objectively worse place instead of doing something that isn't going to be met with backlash and negative press?
p490
aVThis isn't JusticePorn at all.
p491
aVThis is just fighting harassment with harassment.
p492
aVYou guys are no better than he is.
p493
aVLike, think of the ramifications for a moment.
p494
aVSay word gets back to him that there's a reddit group organizing to harass him.
p495
aVThink of the all the fucking press power he has -- morons everywhere will start spreading the word that reddit is a hate crime organization bent on petty revenge.
p496
aVEventually world will spread about reddit's arguably worse sections, like the old jailbait and candid photo whatever subreddits, along with beating/raping/etcwomen that there was all the drama about a few weeks ago.
p497
aVStraight up?
p498
aVYou guys are fucking idiots.
p499
aVAs if reddit needed even worse PR than it already has.
p500
aVYou wanna make some positive change in the world?
p501
aVGet him fired.
p502
aVThat's justice.
p503
aVLiterally stalking him and perpetuating the idea that paparazzism is okay?
p504
aVIt's like this idea was invented by someone who doesn't understand the concept of repercussions.
p505
aVThis is a loose association of redditors with no power beyond money.
p506
aVThis guy is the editor for a media outlet with hundreds of thousands of regular viewers.
p507
aVYou're not winning any battles this way.
p508
aVYou're just poking the bear and making the problem worse.
p509
aVSeriously, get him fired.
p510
aVDo what you can on THAT front.
p511
aVNot this way. 
p512
aVwhats the back story of this?
p513
aVwho is this guy?
p514
aVany why?
p515
aV- american here
p516
aV[Here](http://stephen-fry-me.tumblr.com/post/57805910021/the-daily-mail-and-lord-dacre-appeasing-again) is Stephen Fry's take on him:\u000a\u000a&gt; Lord Dacre is himself a frothing autocrat.
p517
aVAn absolutely foul-mouthed boss, who constantly screams the c word at just about anyone.
p518
aVHe would have read my Open Letter to David Cameron and yelled that \u201cthat cunt Fry needs another fucking dressing fucking down\u201d \u2014 just the kind of language that his paper would prissily decry of course, there\u2019s the glory in the vile bastard\u2019s hypocrisy.
p519
aVHe sends his son to Eton, but somehow mocks me for being posh.
p520
aVHe bullies, swears and shrieks, but presents his paper as having the values and standards of a misty Midsomer Britain.
p521
aVHe decries indecency on one page and pushes his male readers into a semi over a semi-nude actress on another.
p522
aVHis cancer scare, miracle cure stories are sickeningly anti-science and the only good thing to be said about his Mail is that no one decent or educated believes in it.
p523
aVWhich is what you can say about psychics, mediums, homeopathy and the casting of runes, but that makes it, like them, more exploitative and wicked, not less.
p524
aV&gt; Dacre is, all those who have had the misfortune to work for him assure me, just about as loathsome, self-regarding, morally putrid, vengeful and disgusting a man as it possible to be.
p525
aVHis power is absolute.
p526
aVCross him either in private or public and you will be assassinated by his sycophantic squad of columnist minions, all of them infected with his brand of repulsive hypocritical and gleeful spite, ready to vomit out a screed against the BBC (watch this hilarious Vine loop as an example http://entertainment.ie/wtf/Watch-If-you-think-Sky-News-was-bad-with-the-royal-baby-coverage/202884.htm ) or any other institution they hate.
p527
aV&gt; He absolutely despises me and thinks I stand for everything that is wrong about Britain and I think exactly the same of him.
p528
aV* I don't think you really needed a bullet point there
p529
aVI think this is what started Stephen Frys out busts.
p530
aVhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2387093/Why-doesnt-Stephen-Fry-ban-Russian-music-theatre-performing-arts.html\u000a\u000aRead the the daily mail article and [Frys blog](http://stephen-fry-me.tumblr.com/post/57805910021/the-daily-mail-and-lord-dacre-appeasing-again) and make up your own mind.
p531
aVThe truth is The Sun is far far worse for stalking people.
p532
aVMost Daily Mail "celeb" photos are staged, consensual events.
p533
aVThe sun genuinely paps people, has women in a far greater state of undress.
p534
aVBut no one is brigading against rebekah brooks ( she oversaw the hacking of phones ).
p535
aVBut the labour shills have a hatred for the daily mail.
p536
aVNot a week goes by without the Daily Mail trying to spark up a race war.
p537
aVI've personally researched some of the things they put a racial spin on, and more often than not they have absolutely fuck all to do with race. 
p538
aV&gt; Not a week goes by without the Daily Mail trying to spark up a race war.
p539
aVI've personally researched some of the things they put a racial spin on, \u000a\u000acan you give me some links please?\u000a\u000a
p540
aV[This particular article springs to mind.
p541
aV](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2070562/Muslim-girl-gang-kicked-Rhea-Page-head-yelling-kill-white-slag-FREED.html)\u000a\u000aThey use the following in the title:\u000a\u000a&gt;Girl gang who kicked woman in the head while yelling 'kill the white slag' freed after judge hears 'they weren't used to drinking because they're Muslims'\u000a\u000aWhich is factually correct, but clearly a complete spin on the trial.
p542
aVThey've purposely made it sound like they were freed *because* they weren't used to drinking alcohol.
p543
aVThat's not the case at all.
p544
aVTheir Lawyer could have said 'Your honour, Walla walla bibo balla ding dong' and the title could have read:\u000a\u000a&gt;Girl gang who kicked woman in the head while yelling 'kill the white slag' freed after judge hears 'Walla walla bibo balla ding dong'\u000a\u000aThe real reason for why the Judge was lenient with them is at the bottom of the page:\u000a\u000a&gt;Judge Brown said that \u2018those who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside\u2019.
p545
aV&gt;But he said he accepted the women may have felt they were the victims of unreasonable force from Mr Moore as he tried to defend his girlfriend, and handed the defendants a suspended sentence.
p546
aVSo the Daily Mail framed it as a judge letting a muslim off because they weren't used to alcohol when really he reduced their sentences because the victims partner beat the shit out of them.
p547
aVDisgusting vile newspaper.
p548
aVAnd in case you think that no one could possibly read the article that way, the top comments are:\u000a\u000a&gt;NO EXCUSE!!!
p549
aVIf these women were white they would have been jailed\u000a\u000aAnd \u000a\u000a&gt;Don't know how they were able to convince the Judge that they were Muslims when they were in clear violation of the religion by being drunk anyways.
p550
aVDisgusting behaviour ... if they don't like 'white slags' they can always go back to their country of origin.\u000a\u000a
p551
aV&gt;But Judge Robert Brown gave them suspended jail terms after hearing mitigation that as Muslims, the women were not used to being drunk\u000a\u000ahttp://thelawdictionary.org/mitigation/\u000a\u000a&gt;Alleviation; abatement or diminution of a penalty or punishment im- posed by law.
p552
aV\u201cMitigating circumstances\u201d are such as do not constitute a justification or excuse of the offense in question, but which, in fairness and mercy, may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of moral culpability\u000a\u000aThere were 2 sets of Mitigating circumstances.
p553
aVYou can be sent to prison purely for assault - this was mitigated because "they were not used to drinking".
p554
aVThey escaped near certain jail for kicking the girls head because the boyfriend had used "excessive force" to try and stop them ( that excessive force that didn't seem to deter them - you can see in the vid ).
p555
aVI understand there is a lot of prejudice against the daily mail but but you are cherry picking one article to make a case for daily mail as racist.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p556
aVhttps://fullfact.org/factcheck/Muslim_women_spared_jail_for_attack_because_not_used_to_drinking-3179\u000a\u000aYou are wrong.
p557
aVThe judge didn't take any notice of the 'muslims aren't used to drinking' defense.
p558
aVAlmost completely fabricated by The Daily Mail. 
p559
aVhttps://fullfact.org/factcheck/Muslim_women_spared_jail_for_attack_because_not_used_to_drinking-3179\u000a\u000a\u000a "Fullfact.org" gives a contadictory statement \u000a\u000a&gt;We contacted the Judicial Office to find out more details about the case and they told us the judgement was given orally and therefore there was no written manuscript available.
p560
aVThey did however point us towards an article written in the Leicester Mercury.
p561
aVThey also asserted that the reference to alcohol had been made in mitigation of the accused and that the role of the victim\u2019s boyfriend was one which impacted on the judgement.
p562
aVA) There was no written manuscript available ( suspicious in itself ) \u000a\u000aYET\u000a\u000aB) They knew exactly what the judge had said\u000a\u000aGod Bless their eidetic memory.
p563
aVCouldn't possibly be that the Leicester Court House wanted to save one of their top judges the embarrassment of an unpopular decision.
p564
aVI would also be very surprised if\u000a\u000a&gt;According to the Mercury, the Judge Robert Brown said, \u201cThis was ugly and reflects very badly on all four of you.
p565
aVThose who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside, but I\u2019m going to suspend the sentence\u201d.
p566
aV..was all of  Judge Robert Brown summing up but believe what you want.
p567
aVIf you read that article you will also see that there are 2 other papers with the same attention grabbing headline.
p568
aVIs your assertion that it is only racist when the Daily Mail makes a sensationalist headline or are the Metro and the Telegraph also racist?\u000a\u000a\u000a
p569
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dacre googling things really isn't hard 
p570
aVno it is no at all but if you google George Bush you will come up with him being a politician and not why a large majority of people don't like him.
p571
aVIm looking for why people should stalk him not what his occupation is.
p572
aVdont get cocky. 
p573
aVRead the part under "Editor of the Daily Mail" you'll see the shit he's done, he's basically a bit of a twat.
p574
aVAlso what's proposed in this thread by OP is completely stupid and would never happen
p575
aVAmerican here!
p576
aVWut?
p577
aVIt's not hard to understand..
p578
aVWell!
p579
aVI never!
p580
aVHave A levels finished already?
p581
aVMy thoughts exactly.
p582
aVThis sub should require people to post their age in their flare.
p583
aVIt's just such a low effort 'upvote if you agree' type post that marks a clear continued decline in the quality of postings an commenting here
p584
aVIt depresses me seeing how much my comments on this thread have been down-voted.
p585
aVYou are down voted for off hand dismissal of an idea due to imagined age demographics. 
p586
aVI know you're right.
p587
aVI hate it when people are creative using their imagination as well, as it makes me feel really inferior too.
p588
aVIt's okay though, we can all raise an eyebrow and pretend we're better than them whilst offering nothing substantial ourselves.
p589
aVWhen you made that flair of yours did you give your thigh a great hearty slap?
p590
aVYou boring arse.
p591
aVFuck off back to middle-England.
p592
aVPerhaps there should also be a spelling test at the door. 
p593
aVI think he would probably like it.

aVSomeone needs to do this but at least top it up to 60k this poor person will have to follow the guy around the world.
p595
aVI'm sure some famous person or someone who has been a victim of the daily mail will pitch in.
p596
aVi.e George Clooney.
p597
aVHire two for 30 grand each and and 40 hours a week.
p598
aVThen you could at least have 7 day cover.
p599
aV60k is too much
p600
aVSadly, even if this occurred - most people would be too scared. \u000a\u000a
p601
aVi'll do it for 15k
p602
aVI'll do it for £14,995
p603
aVI'll do it for 10K + accommodation. \u000a
p604
aVBut accommodation in London is waaaaaaaay high. 
p605
aVI swear to god if this happens i will do it!
p606
aV!
aVHas he done something more  appallin that normal , or is it just a general idea 
p607
aV/r/crazyideas 
p608
aVI'd happily contribute to this! 
p609
aVI'm in.
p610
aVI have wanted to do this with the TMZ idiots in NYC for years.
p611
aVGive me half that, I'll give you pictures of what he ate for breakfast **while it's being digested**.
p612
aVWhat if he steps down mid-year?
p613
aVShouldn't the language reflect that the kickstarter would pay for scandalous photos of any Editor of the Daily Mail?
p614
aVHurry OP.
p615
aVThis is a novelty and will fade unless you or someone gets on the ball.
p616
aVI will happily donate 20 quid if this is a thing.
p617
aVWe shouldn't pay them to take holiday.
p618
aVIt isn't a privilege to be rid of them.
p619
aVSet up the kickstarter and we will be there. 
p620
aVI think this could work as a kickstarter.
p621
aVIt's an interesting enough thing to get the attention of some news sources, then all you need is a couple of celebs who like it enough to chip in 10k each or something
p622
aVAgreed - and celebs can donate anonymously (there must be a way to do that) to encourage them to do it, because I bet some would savour the thought that these unethical journalists who write lies about them will suddenly have paps on them.
p623
aVCan we do this with tom wheeler as well?
p624
aVDon't they make a lot of money for each photo they grab?
p625
aVOr did you just mean hire some guy with a camera, not a professional paparazzi?
p626
aVGruniad shriters are really upset these days?
p627
aVshotgun day 69
p628
aV&gt; Also, I think this could be another way to raise funds: "Actually I'm kind of surprised some celebrity hasn't already done something like this.
p629
aVThey certainly have the money.
p630
aV" and "I'm sure some famous person or someone who has been a victim of the daily mail will pitch in.
p631
aVi.e George Clooney.
p632
aV"\u000a\u000aSimpsons did this already
p633
aVHow about as a stretch goal, we have him murdered e.g.
p634
aVat 100k.
p635
aVAt 500k, we have his whole family murdered as well, in front of him.
p636
aVPretty sure you can easily hire an assassin for 100 grand.
p637
aVYou seem to be very confused about how much a professional press photographer gets paid\u000ahttp://www.londonfreelance.org/feesguide/index.php?&amp;section=Photography&amp;subsect=National+newspapers\u000a
p638
aV£70K per year, then?
p639
aVThat's well within Kickstarters capabilities.
p640
aVThat's about 5000 people giving a little over a tenner.
p641
aVI think the problem would be that to a news photographer/pap this would be career suicide. 
p642
aVHonestly, if I could do this, enough food to cover whilst working would be enough.
p643
aVOf course, I'd also set fire to this man for free so.
p644
aVMaybe don't trust my judgement.
p645
aVWe really should though.
p646
aVI'd love to see these people get a taste of their own medicine. 
p647
aVBTW It should be noted that Darce isn't the editor of Mail Online and only the articles that come from the paper addition have been approved by him.
p648
aVThe sidebar isn't him. 
p649
aVMartin Clarke is the editor of the Mail Online and is, imo, a more valid target.
p650
aV[He looks like the ideal person to get angry on camera..](http://arifdurrani.mediaweek.co.uk/files/MailOnlineMartinClarke.jpg)
p651
aVWhy not just get someone to stand outside his house and be our insider offering exclusive scoops on his......poops\u000a\u000aOr maybe someone in the NHS can confirm...shock....horror.....he is human after all.
p652
aVHis own Doctor would obviously only be able to confirm he is a distant relative of a vampire squidd.
p653
aVYes yes, this is all fun and games but the bigger picture is being missed here.
p654
aVThe reason newspapers behave in such disgusting ways (Daily Mail or otherwise) is because people buy them.
p655
aVIf people voted with their wallets on such behaviours, then they would be forced to change or die.
p656
aVI have no clue how you'd go about fixing the wider problem, however...
p657
aVWhat is it that Paul Dare did? 
p658
aVprob be easier to just use the money to offer to buy pics of the guy, then you'd have more than one after him at any given time
p659
aVif you guys can get me a work visa for the UK, I'll take the job for 30k.  
p660
aVhow about creating a subreddit and a hashtag called picsofPaulDacre.
p661
aVPeople like karma almost as much as they like money
p662
aVI bet a few celebrities would love to contribute
p663
aVnot really, they depend on each other.
p664
aVIf a celeb funds this, this might mean blacklist and can't get any publicity anymore
p665
aVAs a geneticist, can I write the most pseudoscientific bullshit going whilst also teaching a lesson about believing said bullshit?!
p666
aVTheir "science" articles make my blood boil.
p667
aVAnd we need something scaremongery and not Dacre related to make it more Daily Fail like...!
p668
aVWhy not just put a 5k bounty on the most humiliating picture of the guy.
p669
aVHe will be hounded for the bounty. 
p670
aV&gt;MOST IMPORTANTLY - I personally don't have the time at all to be able to organise this, as much as I'd love it to happen (hence why I posted the idea on here).
p671
aVSo if someone does have the time to set-up the Kickstarter and get it up and running, possibly once a full plan is formed, I'll personally donate at least £30 to it (and many people in these comments are saying they'll donate too).
p672
aVLol
p673
aVJust give random homeless people £30 and a cheap android phone  to follow him round everyday.
p674
aVA cheaper and easier idea would be for B3TA to run it as one of their weekly 'tatoshop challenges
p675
aVWould definitely donate time and money to this most worthy of causes.
p676
aVI'm a web developer - if there is need of my expertise feel free to shoot me a PM for help :)
p677
aVIf the purpose is to harass, which it seems it is, then surely this would just be harassment and therefore illegal.
p678
aVand?
p679
aVThis is a fantastic idea.
p680
aVI'm in.
p681
aVWith the most scandalous photo, get people to vote.
p682
aVHighest wins money
p683
aVSince Kickstarter and Indiegogo are out of the question, where's the Bitcoin wallet address we can send funds to?
p684
aVCome on, this is 2014 and the thread has been around for a day now.
p685
aVSo is this going ahead or not? 
p686
aVOne of the problems with this is that to really make the same impact, they need to be published somewhere sensationalist (like the female treatment mentioned already) and widely read.
p687
aVBut the other tabloids aren't going to bite in case it turns on them next.
p688
aVA big social media campaign might work but...
p689
aVI would fully support this.
p690
aVGuys, This is the perfect project to get funding via Max Keisers crowd funding platform StartJOIN.
p691
aVThey have a number of politically motivated crowd funding projects including a peoples water cannon that's been funded already.
p692
aVhttps://www.startjoin.com/CannonFodder
p693
aVWhat happened to this?
p694
aVAbout the site that you could use to raise the money.
p695
aVGoFundMe maybe? 
p696
aVAre you all being serious right now?
p697
aVI know Reddit's hate for papers like the Daily Mail is pretty obsessive, but raising thousands of pounds to hire someone to stalk someone else literally takes this into creepy stalker territory.
p698
aVThis is fucking weird.
p699
aVNo.
p700
aVIts just a job.
p701
aVWhere there's demand there's supply!
p702
aVI'd have to disagree.
p703
aVI think this is actually genuinely in the public interest for once.
p704
aVIt just gives me that vibe of 15 year old boys plotting to take revenge on a girl that's been mean to them.
p705
aV&gt;but raising thousands of pounds to hire someone to stalk someone else literally takes this into creepy stalker territory.
p706
aVThat's exactly what they do, with legal immunity under the guise of 'free press'.. 
p707
aVSo?
p708
aVAnd emulating then makes it right?
p709
aVNo.
p710
aVIt just makes you all look like massive hypocrites.
p711
aVIt's a form of protest, and most of all it's a bit of a laugh. 
p712
aVIf you're 15, maybe.
p713
aVAm I Missing something?
p714
aVYour solution to someone behaving badly is to behave as badly as them?
p715
aVThere doesn't seem to be any moral high ground there!
p716
aVYou Sir are a genius!
p717
aVBetter start saving your pocket money guys
p718
aVI'll throw in a fiver for a photo of his expression whilst squeezing out a large shit.
p719
aVI'll make it copyright free, so any publication can use it whenever they mention him in an article. 
p720
aVLol I'm in\u000a
p721
aVYou can always raise funds through crypto currencies like Dogecoin or bitcoin!
p722
aV&gt; "Sorry to be a dick, but Kickstarter won't let this happen.
p723
aV"\u000a\u000aIf a guy can get $24,000 to make a potato salad then we can get £30,000 to do this.
p724
aVNot him, his family.
p725
aVWHo is Paul Dacre?
p726
aVBecause the daily mail are the only paper to use paparazzi to get fluffy pointless content?
p727
aVThis whole thread is pathetic.
p728
aVWe can interchange every year - Daily Mail this year, other newspaper editors the next year.
p729
aVBut that is harrasment!
p730
aV/s
p731
aVPeople are fucking starving around the world, and you want to spend 30,000 pounds for petty revenge?
p732
aVFucking idiot.\u000a
p733
aVGive it to charity instead.
p734
aVWhy?
p735
aVwho the fuck is paul dacre ?
p736
aVdont create a tread without explaining your shit
p737
aVWho is this guy and why do you want to paparazzi him?
p738

aVYou'll find sour cream in every Sainsburys, Waitrose, Tesco etc.
p740
aVI know because I eat a disgusting amount. \u000a\u000a
p741
aVSour cream with roasted vegetables is so damn good.
p742
aVI will always be grateful to an Aussie housemate who introduced me to that.
p743
aVI dip everything even remotely crisp related in it.
p744
aVIt's great on a baked sweet potato too. 
p745
aVYep, I managed to find some in my Waitrose, but until recently not in any of the others.
p746
aVTesco has now some excellent sour cream in the Polish fridge, but still not in the regular ones.
p747
aVWait.
p748
aVA Polish immigrant shopping in Waitrose?
p749
aVThe Daily Mail was right!
p750
aVBut I go shopping to TK MAXX sometimes, does that make it even?
p751
aVWell someone has to.
p752
aVYeah you can get sour cream in every supermarket here.
p753
aVI'm not sure why you've been having problems getting it....
p754
aVI buy at least 2 tubs a week from sainsburys, tesco or the co-op.
p755
aVThat's odd.
p756
aVI've never had a problem getting it.
p757
aVIt's usually with the other creams near the milk and yogurt sections. 
p758
aV[Do you mean Soured Cream?
p759
aV](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/search/default.aspx?searchBox=sour+cream&amp;newSort=true&amp;search=Search&amp;N=4294698002)
p760
aVI think I do :)\u000aAlthough - I'm not sure about this stuff you're linking to - it should be thick, almost like a proper Greek yogurt.
p761
aVSomething that you spoon out and it leaves a hole that doesn't fill in on its own.
p762
aVYes that's it.
p763
aVIf you are buying it from [Waitrose this is it](http://www.waitrose.com/shop/HeaderSearchCmd?searchTerm=soured+cream&amp;defaultSearch=GR&amp;search=)\u000a\u000aI think we call it soured in the UK to differentiate it from milk that has gone off/bad or "gone sour".
p764
aVNot sure if you drink much Kefir?
p765
aVit's a little trickier to find in the UK!
p766
aVMy partner is Moldovan and she introduced me to this stuff, can't get enough of it now.
p767
aVOcado sell kefir and ryazhenka.
p768
aVI think a rant of this length while maintaining good humour automatically qualifies you as a naturalised British citizen.
p769
aVWell done.
p770
aVNow, how about we put the kettle on?
p771
aVNot yet.
p772
aVNo mention of the weather.
p773
aVI got used to the weather by now.
p774
aVShouldn't it work like that?
p775
aVOr is it a some kind of unforgivable cultural sin?
p776
aVOh, we never get used to it.
p777
aVWe always complain or reminisce about it.
p778
aVOh remember last Thursday?

aVThose were the days.

aVYou 'ad a room!
p787
aVWe only 'ad a corridor!
p788
aVCorridor!
p789
aVWe used t' live in rolled up newspaper in septic tank.
p790
aVEvery morning we'd be woken up by 'aving a bunch of water thrown on us, then it'd be up clean out rolled up newspaper and work 14 hours a day down Mill for sixpence a week
p791
aVIf you were lucky!
p792
aVParadise.
p793
aVYou damn southerners with your long summers.
p794
aVIt's been raining literally non-stop here!
p795
aVMadness!
p796
aVIt hasnt stopped all day fuckin hell
p797
aVMove to New Zealand, it's paradise.

aVSo, no worries.

aVNaa I have seen those documentary's.

aVThere's Orc's and Trolls and Goblins and God knows what else.
p803
aVNot to mention that huge red eye looking at you all the time! 
p804
aVResignedness is fine, ambivalence is not.
p805
aV&gt; Incompetence in services.
p806
aVDear jesus christ gravy on a christmas tree turkey sandwhich YOU HAVE NO IDEA how much I agree with this statement.
p807
aVUS immigrant here to the UK.
p808
aVThe banks have misplaced our agreements, the realtor have misplaced our agreements, two  electric and gas companies fought over who was servicing us for 6 months, then they both tried to charge us for a misread on the meter (saying we spent 80% of the electric consumption in 70 years this house has been built, in 1 month).
p809
aVThere there is stuff like how bad the foundation's are on many buildings, how bad the flooring is done.
p810
aVCracks everywhere.
p811
aVThis is just the tip of the iceberg.
p812
aVI mean people here need to seriously get their shit together.
p813
aVThat kind of shit would cost you your job in the US.
p814
aVedit: how could I forget I have to send half of the stuff from amazon.uk back because it is dead on arrival.
p815
aVThat is not an exaggeration.
p816
aVOne time the delivery guy threw a book in the one puddle of water in our front yard.
p817
aVIt is like he went out of his way to be incompetent.
p818
aVedit: I still love the UK by far.
p819
aVNice people, little to no guns or gang violence, police are friendly, weather is awesome compared to the south, and the majority of people accept evolution as fact. \u000a
p820
aVTell me about it.
p821
aV6 months after moving into my flat i get a bill from British Gas for £73(ish) for my gas usage.
p822
aVNow i was gonna just go straight ahead and pay this without thinking but then i realised...I don't HAVE gas The whole BUILDING isn't connected to the gas mains!?
p823
aVI contacted them and they said there must have been "a mistake" but they just kept sending these letters out OVER &amp; OVER &amp; OVER, in the end I'd just stuff them straight in the bin, but now I have since moved house and i STILL receive FINAL NOTICE letters from debt collection agencies demanding the above mentioned £73(ish)\u000a\u000a(Just for the record i have never had an account with British Gas, and nore will I be willing to after this ENORMOUS fuck up!
p824
aV)
aVthe magic word is "disappointed" \u000a\u000ayou call up, and say (slowly, with pauses) : "oh, but I keep getting these bills even though you just told me that it is a mistake.
p825
aVi am very ... ... ... disappointed"\u000a\u000ai've actually gotten money back for 2 services (netflix and a tesco phone contract) that i canceled 2-3 days too late .

p833
aVBut you will love it 
p834
aVNah, you can always complain about the weather.
p835
aVDon't forget that.
p836
aVWhat is this?

aVComplacency about the weather?
p838
aVNah complaining about the weather is about as british as it gets.

p842
aVNot enougth rain (that one is admitadly a rare complaint only made by folks with a garden or allotment.
p843
aV)\u000a\u000aIts part of british culture to complain about the weather.
p844
aVAlso a goto ice breaker subject.

aV[Bill Hicks used to do a bit about how he likes Britain because it actually has weather and compares it too L.A saying that hot and sunny gets old fast.
p846
aV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPr9wVqA_RY)\u000a\u000aAlways gave me a chuckle and made me appreciate UK weather, if only for the fact it serves as an amazing conversation piece that saves us a world of awkward silences.

aVNot trying to be a dick, had you fix that. 
p854
aVForget weather, how good is your boiler contract?
p855
aVWTF is a boiler contract?
p856
aVIt's a short term agreement where your boiler promises not to break down during the coldest of months.
p857
aV&gt; I would just give you a strange look if asked if I want some bloody vinegar on my chips\u000a\u000aHe won me over with that.
p858
aVSwearing at the level of "slight irritation" using the word "bloody".
p859
aVYou have to get British points for that.
p860
aVThanks :) I appreciate the credit.
p861
aVI do love British way of speaking, always did, together with your sense of humour.
p862
aV[deleted]
p863
aVHold on.
p864
aVThis foreigner only just accepted vinegar on his chips.
p865
aVTreat him with utmost suspicion, chaps.
p866
aVThe Dutch have convinced me to put mayonnaise on my chips.
p867
aVBut I can be forgiven, because I put crushed garlic in the mayo first, and that is something the Dutch have not yet discovered.
p868
aVadd a bit of dill and some onion powder and you will basically have the "ranch dressing" the Americans dip theirs in
p869
aVClose, ranch is mayonnaise and sour cream with some spices (at least homemade, we're not sure what the bottled stuff is made of).
p870
aVMayonnaise with spices would just be "dip", for veggies or potato chips (uh, crisps?
p871
aV)
aVReal homemade ranch generally has buttermilk instead of sour cream, at least in the part of the country that I'm in.
p872
aVIs sour cream a regional thing?
p873
aVI was born here...and i hate salt OR vinegar on my chips.
p874
aVAm i a suspect, too?
p875
aVPractically makes you a foreign spy.
p876
aV*removes red carnation from lapel, goes back to lurking in the shadows*
p877
aVPoppy, not carnation. 
p878
aVNo one said he was a good spy.
p879
aVI'm not talking about the remembrance poppy, more the cliché of spies in black and white movies identifying themselves to fellow spies and informants by wearing a particular flower in a lapel.
p880
aVEasy to spot, yet inconspicuous.
p881
aVWho hates Salt on chips!?

aV!
aVI think more than I am, at this moment.
p883
aV/r/philosophy 
p884
aVHe's gone native.
p885
aVWon't witter on about British taps, barely remembers to slip in sour milk by the end - sounds like a friend of mine who claims to be German on the dubious grounds of having been born and raised in Bavaria.
p886
aVBut what does he order in a pub?
p887
aV&gt; But what does he order in a pub?
p888
aVIf it's a pint of real ale and a bag of salted nuts he gets a fast tracked passport.
p889
aV(Scampi Fries optional extra, of course.
p890
aV)
aVTechnically, he has to order a pint of bitter from a pump.
p891
aVCAMRA membership isn't an absolute requirement.
p892
aVBonus points are scored if he gets slightly miffed that the local eastern european offie has 57 varieties of bottled lager and one type of canned bitter - *and never mentions it*.

p899
aVMy partner works in a place where if you are sick more than 3 times a year, you need a doctors note for everything for the next 12 months.
p900
aVI'm not even sure if the NHS will do this.
p901
aVSo people come in to work in an open plan office really sick and it spreads, then the management complain about high sickness rates.
p902
aVMeanwhile if I'm sick I just log in from home and do what I can, nothing quite like attending a meeting from the comfort of bed.

aVOnly incident I had that approached this personally, was with a manager asking me, if the "stomach issue I had was serious, or if I could come in anyway".
p910
aVHad to respond that it was unpleasant, as I kept on having to go to the toilet every half hour or so, and would worry about my discomfort while getting to, coming back from, and while at work.
p911
aVThe manager replied that they'd need more details than that to 'authorise the absence'.
p912
aVI gave more details.
p913
aVSomething to be said for describing a catastrophic bowel movement, noises and and all and then asking your manager to double check if they've spelt the words 'consistency' and 'diarrhoea' correctly in their notes, then reminding them it needs to be filed with HR by close of business.
p914
aVThey never asked me for 'more details' for further incidents of sickness.
p915
aV&gt; The manager replied that they'd need more details than that to 'authorise the absence'.
p916
aVI don't even know what to say to this.  
p917
aVWell, what I said worked.
p918
aVUnsurprisingly that it was at that point I joined a union, and decided to get training as a rep, 'cos I managed to get past it with toilet references and a sense of humour - but I've since seen the effect that such managers have on people first hand.
p919
aVSadly this stupidity is not limited to the UK.
p920
aVI'm sure it's not.
p921
aVI just find this particular situation quite ludicrous.
p922
aVI missed 2 days of work last week because my stomach got destroyed by NSAIDS.
p923
aVSo I called my boss and said "My stomach is not feeling well, I'm not going to be able to make it in.
p924
aV"\u000a\u000aI got an "OK" in reply.
p925
aVWhere I work, if we're off work sick more than 3 episodes in 12 months ( that could be three, one day episodes) we have to have a meeting with our manager.
p926
aVIt makes us nervous to take time off when we're ill!
p927
aVWhat in the fuck?
p928
aV!
aVCan confirm this applies to most companies in uk.
p929
aV4 being the norm IMO.
p930
aVIt's weird and invasive but the meetings are meant to 'help you get back to work' and 'understand what we as a company can do to stop you getting ill'.
p931
aVI had one of these once.
p932
aVI asked them if they could cure chronic asthma and the common cold.
p933
aVThey did not see the humour. 
p934
aV"How can we stop you getting ill?
p935
aV"\u000a\u000a"Stop making sick co-workers come to the office.
p936
aV"
aVIt's all about the Bradford Factor, a nasty bit of impersonal number crunching to catch absenteeism.
p937
aVThe basic version is:\u000a\u000a(No.
p938
aVepisodes)^2 * No.
p939
aVof days off over a rolling year\u000a\u000aSo one 10 sickness episode will give you 10 points whereas ten 1 day episodes will give you 1000 points -  the threshold for a Return to Work interview is normally around 500.
p940
aVThe upshot is if you need to take a day off, might as well take 2 to make sure you are fully recovered.
p941
aVSource: Provide HR related services for monies. 
p942
aVI agree with the ill people one - that needs to be dealt with stricter as it makes more people ill.
p943
aVI cannot disagree enough with the education one.
p944
aVThe A level system is quite simply one of the best in the world in my opinion.
p945
aVYes the GCSE's are shite but the A Levels are amazing.
p946
aVI was talking with my Romanian friend (we are both doing masters in Computer Science) as he said that the courses were easier here, and that is certainly true at the high school level, but at A level (and especially Further Maths) far exceeds what they had studied and is one of the reasons that allows for us to have shorter degrees than the USA.
p947
aV(Although the lack of students actually taking Further Maths etc.
p948
aVis an issue)\u000a\u000aIncompetence at services you also get in Germany etc.
p949
aVand it's a bit silly to let a few experiences be the picture of a whole country - my hairdresser is fine (although ironically she's also Polish...)\u000a\u000aBut seriously the depth of study that A levels offer and the freedom to only study what you want to study is virtually unparalleled except in the Commonwealth nations which copied our system.
p950
aVI know people like to complain about Britain but that is one system that I think we got right.
p951
aVFreedom to study what you want is fairly common across Europe.
p952
aVIn fact, in this respect, I do find the A-levels a bit restrictive.
p953
aVDepth is very good though, I agree.
p954
aVI think people's beef with education comes down to inequality of services.
p955
aVOver the years, I have lived in a few other European countries and nowhere else have I found the variance in quality between schools so huge.
p956
aVOf course, there are good and bad schools everywhere, but I would say a bad Swedish school will prepare a student better than a bad UK one and a good student at a bad Swedish school will not have a handicap as big as a good student at a bad UK school.
p957
aVPeople I was acquainted with at university always used to say things like "85% of people from my school go to Oxford or Cambridge" or "I'm the first person from my school to go to Oxford".
p958
aVAnd I always found statements such as that one quite baffling and, indeed, indicative of the problem I am describing.
p959
aVNow this comes down to several factors - political system, society, the (comparably) incredible prevalence and prominence of private education in the UK - so it is not easily solved, but this is something that has always struck me as quite strange, considering how generally proud people seem to be of education in the UK. 
p960
aVI agree that I know the education system only up to the GCSE level here, as my stepson is only starting his A Levels right now.
p961
aVMy opinions are based on what I have seen till now - and I have seen a general attitude of "I don't have to do anything and I'll pass through the school anyway", kids not held accountable for almost anything, no ongoing assessment of the work the do (or not do), only the "big test at the end" environment.
p962
aVNot very supporting for ongoing development in my opinion.
p963
aVThe big problem - and it's been a problem since more-or-less forever - is that GCSEs don't really prepare you for A-levels.
p964
aVUsually what happens is 16 year old kids come out of school with a number of GCSEs and they're absolutely convinced they're God's gift.
p965
aVThey then have the shock of their life when they start A-levels; you really have to step up a gear for them.
p966
aVI can personally attest to that. 
p967
aVEVERYONE who's done GCSEs and A-levels can personally attest to that.
p968
aVAs someone who's about to start sixth form, I'm glad that I get to hear this before I begin and fuck up.
p969
aVGood luck.
p970
aVIf it's any comfort, if you can manage A-levels you'll find a degree to be a breeze by comparison.
p971
aVPlus you can legally drink when you're at university.
p972
aVI dunno up until A levels you barely learn much anyway.
p973
aVAnd A levels used to have exams at Christmas and in the summer every year, then my Uni did the same.
p974
aVI went 6 years without being able to relax at Christmas (I did a 4 year integrated Physics Masters).
p975
aVSo if anything it was like having exams all the time, but I understand that's changed now.
p976
aVThe issue is that the governments idea to fix education was to make every student pass their GCSE's.
p977
aVIt was soon realised that making children smarter is hard work and would not ensure this promise be delivered on.
p978
aVthe solution was then to simply make exams easier and constantly fiddle with the mark scheme so the statistics look good, disregarding what children actually learn from school.
p979
aVI don't get sick pay.
p980
aVIf I don't go to work, I don't get paid.
p981
aVI struggle to eat as it is.
p982
aVYou buggers can get sick for all I care, I would like to eat at the cost of one days unpleasant illness.
p983
aVEdit: A lot of helpful people are coming forward to inform me of Statutory Sick Pay.
p984
aVI do know about this, and yes it is a legal requirement, however it is for 5 days and above.
p985
aVIf I've got a ~~whooping~~ heaving cough or tonsillitis, that's 1-4 days.
p986
aVI'm not losing that amount of money just to avoid you guys getting sick.
p987
aVI'm coming in even if it does spread to the rest of you.
p988
aVI have to eat. 
p989
aV&gt; Cheques.
p990
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p991
aVIt's XXI century.
p992
aVI don't know.
p993
aVI don't remember the last time I used one.
p994
aVIs someone really asking for one?
p995
aVI don't know how I'd deal with that.
p996
aV&gt; And the last one... Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p997
aVSee point 13.
p998
aVThere was a plan to switch over to mph (and therefore presumably l/100km) but the tabloids scuppered that by paiting it as a German invasion.
p999
aVIm about to qualify as a paramedic and I can only pay my registration fees by cheque or standing order.
p1000
aVWAT.
p1001
aVMy fiancee is a competing horse rider, and all the entries to competitions are to be paid by cheques.
p1002
aVOnly Eventing now accepts card payments, but Dressage and Show Jumping as far as I know still require cheques.
p1003
aVLocal riding club wanted a membership fee as a cheque.
p1004
aVWhen my energy company finally repaid me, they did it with a cheque.
p1005
aVBut mostly, when I look at it now, it's horsey people, lol :)
p1006
aVIs the riding club mostly staffed by nice old ladies?
p1007
aVIt does seem to be an age thing in my experience.
p1008
aVOver a certain age, people are comfortable with cheques.
p1009
aVPersonally I hate the things.
p1010
aVI do agree we're a bit behind here.
p1011
aV- in Germany it seems more typical than not to give people an IBAN.
p1012
aVI think you got it right :)
p1013
aVYou get cheques because they can be posted and only you get it.
p1014
aVThey can't transfer money into your account, because its not quite set up like that.
p1015
aVA paper trail in these instances is good.
p1016
aVIts not like they are going to post you cash.
p1017
aVAs for horse club, that just because they have always done that.
p1018
aVI bet school trips for your son would be the same. 
p1019
aV&gt;My fiancee is a competing horse rider, and all the entries to competitions are to be paid by cheques.
p1020
aVThey're riding bloody horses and you're surprised they're behind the times?
p1021
aV!
aVNice post, it's interesting to read perspectives like this.
p1022
aVSome of your points (bad service etc) sound like they're just down to bad personal luck rather than systemic cultural problems.
p1023
aVPeople who litter do exist and are twats but to be honest I'm always surprised by how clean the tube is given the amount of people using it and the lack of bins in stations.
p1024
aV&gt; Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place\u000a\u000aI'm sure plenty of people here will disagree with that one.
p1025
aVMaybe they need some perspective?
p1026
aVThe boiler thing amused me, I didn't realise it was such a thing until I bought my flat and suddenly everyone at work was talking to me about boilers.
p1027
aV(I've got an Intergas combi with a 5 year parts and labour warranty, in case you were wondering)
p1028
aVI think the bad service aspect is a little more endemic than people like to believe.
p1029
aVI've spent my life living in quite a few countries and the one thing I've noticed here is that the service seems a little incompetent when compared to the rest of the developed world.
p1030
aVI've been living in the UK for a year and a half and it's one of the things that annoy me.
p1031
aVI'm studying in Brighton and it's something a lot of international students complain about.
p1032
aVFriends of mine in London don't seem to have as much of an issue with services when compared to friends in other parts of the UK though.
p1033
aVI just finished living out in Kent for a year.
p1034
aVEarly on I got stuck in a weird systemic 'eddy' that I found endlessly frustrating.
p1035
aVTo open a bank account in the UK I needed ID (my Canadian passport) and proof of residence (gas bill or some such), to get into this residence the bank wanted proof of I needed a bank account.
p1036
aVIf I need a bank account before I can rent a flat...but I need a bill from my flat before I can have a bank account WTF am I supposed to do?!?
p1037
aVI also experienced OPs fiasco with the hairdresser.
p1038
aVWent to a local barbershop and gave him the same description I've given every hairdresser I've ever had in Canada.
p1039
aV#3 on the back and sides, leave enough of the front for me to put a little hair glue in it.
p1040
aVHere in Canada, this description always yields [this](http://frenzyofnoise.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Caesar-Haircuts.jpg).
p1041
aVWhen the guy in the UK was done with me, he'd given me [this](http://www.trendirstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/undercut-hairstyle-men-1920.jpg).
p1042
aVJesus, what a difference.
p1043
aVHe's even changed your eye colour.
p1044
aVI don't really care about my hair so I usually give a really vague instruction like, "can you make it shorter please.
p1045
aVBut not TOO short!".
p1046
aVI tend to get roughly what I want.
p1047
aVThis hit me recently.
p1048
aVI've lived in the UK since birth and just realised I've never had a good haircut in my life.
p1049
aVTHIS IS WHY EVERYONE HAS THAT HAIRSTYLE HERE!
p1050
aVI just thought it was popular (and an Essex thing).
p1051
aVI'm bald so had no idea it's all the hairdressers know.
p1052
aVI've also lived abroad for quite a lot of my life (and various places all over the UK) and agree about the services, especially regarding hairdressing.
p1053
aVIt is mindbogglingly difficult to find a competent hairdresser here who will actually pay attention to instructions and then be able to carry them out.
p1054
aVIt took ages to find the one I currently go to and I don't know what I would do if he left.
p1055
aVI can never understand why it should be so difficult for something like this.
p1056
aVPeople working in services just don't seem to give a shit here.
p1057
aVWhat happened to taking pride in your work, no matter what it is?
p1058
aVMy theory is that people in services don't get much recognition from the rest of society in the UK, which is demotivating.
p1059
aVUnlike in places like SE Asia for example, where everyone is entitled to respect even a field labourer.
p1060
aVYes, I've thought about this.
p1061
aVI take the theory that it's not people in the service industry not giving a shit as much as customers being too polite to complain.
p1062
aVPlus a lot of companies feel like once they have your money they are free to give zero fucks.
p1063
aVA utilities company just took 8 months to return £650 to me. 
p1064
aVI think it's because no one directly complains.
p1065
aVThey usually just take the disappointment and move on.
p1066
aVBitch about it later.
p1067
aV\u000a\u000a"Mustn't grumble"
p1068
aVIt's also the reason why stuff gets so expensive, we'll tolerate it and not complain.
p1069
aVBrits are one of the few peoples who are happy on the surface to pay money for old rope. 
p1070
aVHm, I live in Germany and I really miss friendly customer service from the UK - here you're treated like you're a burden, in the UK they at least smile and say hello.
p1071
aVI'd personally rather get my furniture in a complete set with precisely correct amount of pieces required for assembly even if provided by an absolute and utter c*nt.
p1072
aVYou see, I've come to realise in year 10 of my intimate relationship with the UK that service providers at large think that politeness covers for incompetence.
p1073
aVSo I second (and third) everything on the subject.
p1074
aVAs a German American living in the US, I can see both sides.
p1075
aVIn England, they deliver what is fashionable and deliver it somewhat politely.
p1076
aVIn Germany, they deliver what you asked for, but describe exactly how poorly your next social event will go when your friends see what you try to pass for taste.
p1077
aVI'm not exactly sure what I would prefer. 
p1078
aV&gt; service providers at large think that politeness covers for incompetence\u000a\u000aI've found in the U.S. South that folks seem to think being friendly and talking nonstop covers for incompetence and laziness. \u000a\u000a
p1079
aV[deleted]
p1080
aVI fly out for my dental work to Poland anyway.
p1081
aVBetter equipment and way cheaper than private dental work here.
p1082
aVI don't know why you're getting downvoted for that, it's definitely a thing for people here to go on "dental holidays".
p1083
aVNumber 9. is probably partly because we lack bins at railway stations due to the IRA having a nasty habit of leaving bombs in them.
p1084
aVIt doesn't excuse the behaviour, but I previously remember asking a station worker where the nearest rubbish bin was and was told to just leave it by a station pillar/wall.
p1085
aVSince then we are slowly seeing them come back, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as you might expect 
p1086
aVThe modern take on this is to have bins without sides, and clear, see-through bags.
p1087
aVjust hanging from a hoop.
p1088
aVThey look silly, but same logic (making it harder to leave bombs in them)
p1089
aVAlso almost no metal shrapnal from the bin when the bomb explodes.
p1090
aVHaha, it's so interesting to see things from someone else's perspective!
p1091
aVLike the double tap thing, it never even occurred to me it was strange until I went abroad.
p1092
aVThe only comment I can offer is that we love working boilers because cold showers are horrible, and we survive the british winter by taking lots of baths!
p1093
aVYeah, but there are other countries in cold climates.
p1094
aVBritain is the only one to have consistent boiler problems.
p1095
aVGrowing up in New England, I can count on one hand the number of times I had trouble with the hot water supply.
p1096
aVIn three years in England I've lost count already.
p1097
aVI can´t recall anytime that I've run out of hot water, and I live in Sweden.
p1098
aVI´m not even sure whether we even have a boiler in our house, we just have hot water that magically appears through the power of welfare i guess..
p1099
aVCan confirm, I live in Finland and hot water magically appears out of nowhere.
p1100
aVE: Confirm, not corfirm!
p1101
aV&gt; Yeah, but there are other countries in cold climates.
p1102
aVBritain is the only one to have consistent boiler problems.
p1103
aVAnd the only one to have really fucked up windows.
p1104
aVGood half of the places I stayed in still had SINGLE glazing - do you think you live in some fucking Sahara, son???
p1105
aVAnd then complain and moan about rising gas prices - just fix your own house, FFS!!
p1106
aV!
aVI have quickly accustomed to double tap but short taps that even infants wouldn't be able to wash their hands under, are beyond my understanding.
p1107
aVWhat is the double tap thing?
p1108
aVAs in, not a mixer tap.
p1109
aVHaha!
p1110
aVI thought he meant a quick double tap on the car horn rather than a sustained blast.
p1111
aVWas confuzzled.
p1112
aVYes, was also thinking along the lines of Zombieland's double tap.
p1113
aVhttp://www.zombielandrules.com/zombieland-rule-2-double-tap/ (sorry-- am on mobile) 
p1114
aVWhat is the mixer tap thing?
p1115
aVFaucets\u000a\u000aThey mean faucets.
p1116
aVA double tap is one of those dumbass sinks where you can have either hot OR cold, but not warm, unless you fill up the nasty ass sink with water and stick your hands in it.
p1117
aVwhy would you do this to yourself?
p1118
aVThis is masochistic.
p1119
aV... and like every other american, I thought he meant whenever he is shooting.
p1120
aV[the fun double tap?
p1121
aV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_tap)
p1122
aVThat we have hot and cold taps.
p1123
aVAnd other countries mock us for it, saying the hot tap is too hot, the cold tap is too cold...and we should have one tap that you can adjust the temperature of.
p1124
aVBut why don't you?
p1125
aVBecause cultural blind spot.
p1126
aVI got a new kitchen and bathroom, plumber put mixer tap in the kitchen (I'd have been annoyed if he hadn't) but double taps in the bathroom and I didn't even how mental that was until a couple of months later
p1127
aVDouble tab in the bathroom is the worst ...
p1128
aVI want to wash my face with lukewarm water, and I can't just fill the sink with both taps and use that same water for the entire process, since it would defeat the entire washing purpose.
p1129
aVI have to use the bathtub tap, and it feels really silly :&lt; 
p1130
aV&gt; I want to wash my face with lukewarm water\u000a\u000aThat's what the 10-second period from where the water goes from cold--&gt;scalding hot is for!
p1131
aVGood luck getting the soapy water off though.
p1132
aVIt started off because we were one of the first countries in the world to have both hot and cold running water, and it was simplest to have the cold water tap as before, and the hot water one coming from the boiler to a separate tap, and it kind of stuck.
p1133
aVAnd considering the age of a lot of the houses in the UK, they haven't all been updated yet.
p1134
aVMost modern ones are joined though.
p1135
aVI lived in a dorm built in 1992 in London.
p1136
aVIt had double taps.
p1137
aVAlways double-tap.
p1138
aVI'm an immigrant but I lived long enough to forget about the double tap being weird.
p1139
aVNow that I'm reminded of it again, I'll be pissed off next time I'm using one.
p1140
aVI'm so, so, sorry about it.
p1141
aVPlease accept my sincere apologies.
p1142
aVYour use the the word 'bloody' in almost every sentence leads me to believe you've assimilated just fine!
p1143
aVAnd I think I'm way overusing the word 'cheers' in my real life.
p1144
aVI think worrying about over-using turns of phrase is in itself an aspect of British culture!
p1145
aVImpossible.
p1146
aVCheers.
p1147
aVMy girlfriend is Slovak, and was also incorrect like you when it comes to vinegar on chips.
p1148
aVShe's been here 10 years now, and still hasn't accepted her wrongness.
p1149
aVHow can I bring her to the light?
p1150
aVAlso, I really enjoyed reading that stuff.
p1151
aVMore if you have any :-)
p1152
aVWell, I tried it when I moved in and it was disgusting.
p1153
aVI tried it few weeks ago and it was quite good.
p1154
aVNo idea what changed in between.
p1155
aVBecoming a local?
p1156
aV11 years here, still can't accept your soggy chips.
p1157
aVFuck that, I'm going back home!
p1158
aV(this may be a way to reduce immigration - feed everyone vinegary chips at the border and tell them there's nothing else available to eat once you stay?
p1159
aV)\u000a
p1160
aVFun!
p1161
aV&gt;Ill people at work.
p1162
aVI hate this.
p1163
aVA guy I work with hasn't been off ill in 12 years.
p1164
aVHe's ill sometimes and just sits and coughs and sniffs.
p1165
aVMate, your job isn't so important that you can't take 2 days off to get better, and when *I* get ill because you're coughing shit at me, I'm staying home and drinking chicken soup and watching reruns of friends.
p1166
aV&gt;"Do not hog the right/middle lane".
p1167
aVLet me stop you right there.
p1168
aVThere is no 'right' or 'middle' lane.
p1169
aVThere are only 2 lanes - the inside lane, and overtaking lanes.
p1170
aVYou stay on the inside lane if you're coming off at the next junction, if you're a slower moving vehicle (caravans, lorries, wide loads etc).
p1171
aVYou use the overtaking lanes to overtake other vehicles.
p1172
aVThat is it.
p1173
aVIf you're overtaking lorries and you're doing the speed limit and not driving like a mug, then fine, use the passing lane.
p1174
aVIgnore that tosser behind you who thinks he's Mad fucking Max 2014 with his black Audi and LED strips who refuses to use the passing lane to go around you.
p1175
aVIf you're doing the same speed as the lorries but won't move over 'in case you get boxed in', you're being a prick.
p1176
aVIt's context-sensitive, but fyi, INSIDE LANE, OVERTAKING LANES.
p1177
aVHere's the article in the highway code regarding lane discipline: https://www.gov.uk/motorways-253-to-273/lane-discipline-264-to-266\u000a\u000a&gt;Insure EVERYTHING.
p1178
aVIt's a jungle to understand what I really need, and what is just being actively sold to me.
p1179
aVInsurance you *need*: car insurance.
p1180
aVIt's illegal to drive without it.
p1181
aVEverything else is optional.
p1182
aVI insure stuff I could not afford to replace if it broke.
p1183
aVSome people think it's dumb, I don't give a fuck.
p1184
aVI could put away money in a savings account and get stuff replaced, but I don't.
p1185
aVI don't have much insurance.
p1186
aVBut basically, if you think you need it, you should get it.
p1187
aVDo not listen to *anybody* who works for the company.
p1188
aVThey want you to buy it, because you give them a monthly income.
p1189
aVThere are plenty of finance websites/forums/subreddits that can help you with this.
p1190
aV&gt;I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected.
p1191
aVI hate: train tickets price.
p1192
aVWTF, I know someone who spends over 1/3 of his salary just to get to work for a month!
p1193
aVI'm glad the trains are good for you - they suck for me.
p1194
aVRegularly late, cancelled, short, terrible.
p1195
aVIt also costs nearly 1/4 of my salary to get to work each month.
p1196
aVI fucking hate - no, I *loath* the train services.
p1197
aVOurs are the most expensive in Europe I think.
p1198
aV&gt;Daily Mail.
p1199
aVSeriously?
p1200
aVWho buys this... thing?
p1201
aVPeople who blame our problems on the flavour of the month.
p1202
aVSome months it's immigrants, other months it's muslim extremists, other months it's the youth of today, and other times it's because of change.
p1203
aVBasically it's sensationalist nonsense written by sell-outs for traditionalist, conservatives morons.
p1204
aV&gt;David Cameron.
p1205
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p1206
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p1207
aVHow someone like that becomes a Prime Minister, I don't know.
p1208
aVAnd people generally believe what he says.
p1209
aVWhich brings me to...\u000a\u000aCome on.
p1210
aVOl' boy Davey' C ain't that bad.
p1211
aVI could write a 30,000 dissertation on how much of a cunt that guy is and only scratch the surface, but to single him out it's pretty stupid.
p1212
aVNearly all politicians are power-driven, narcissistic, sociopathic maniacs not fit to run a country.
p1213
aVThe problem is, no one normal wants to step up to the plate.
p1214
aVAnd even if they did, they couldn't, because the barrier of entry is huge and complex.
p1215
aVAnd even if they *did* get in, they'd be worse at running it than the politicians are.
p1216
aVWe have 2 hopes - Bob Hope, and no hope.
p1217
aV&gt;Education.
p1218
aVI admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy\u000a\u000aJeez, don't get me started.
p1219
aVWe teach our children to memorise data and information, then regurgitate said information in order to tick all the boxes, so that when they go out to the working world they can do exactly that - regurgitate data and information and put it all into a spreadsheet haha.
p1220
aVNah I think education is fucked.
p1221
aVAs you say, we don't teach self-improvement at all, and a lot of kids feel entitled and thus have no desire to seek out worth for themselves.
p1222
aVI was one of those kids who cruised through school and thought it would all come to me on a plate.
p1223
aVI finished uni, went to work in a job I hate, realised my adulthood would be depressing unless I fixed something, and now I'm actively seeking a new career path - I go away for training in 2 months to France.
p1224
aVJust a quick input on education.
p1225
aVThe quality of the education provided is very dependent on where you live in the UK.
p1226
aVIn some places it is better than others.
p1227
aVAlso parents seem to have forgotten that a child's education is also on them.
p1228
aVI cannot force your child to do its homework properly, you have to do that.
p1229
aVAlso a lot of parents want to change things around because they feel a teacher 'doesn't like' their child so they should be in a different class.
p1230
aVOur education system is actually quite good at not just making people regurgitate what they have learned.
p1231
aVNow they want people to draw their own conclusions, investigate for themselves etc.
p1232
aVYou cant forget that at the end of the day there are going to be lazy children and there will be engaged children who care.
p1233
aVMuch of that is to do with parenting.
p1234
aVIf your parents just skate along then you will be happy to do the same.
p1235
aVTake heart anyway in the fact that our education system is leaps ahead of the US where they really are just taught how to pass a test.
p1236
aVI believe that the main points of "regurgitation of data" is aimed at GCSEs.
p1237
aVThey are almost completely regurgitation in the subjects which allow it, or in the other ones it's "learn the method specific to this.
p1238
aVUse this method, always.
p1239
aV", or at least that's what it's like nowadays.
p1240
aVEven in the sciences, which should be all about the scientific method of how to collect results correctly, there only seems to be regurgitation, especially for the unit 1 (and 2?
p1241
aV) papers, with a bunch of knowledge which you will probably never use, never need to use, and will probably forget as soon as possible (something about nickel and 60°C comes to mind - that's either hardening oils or something to do with "cracking"...
p1242
aVI think the former).
p1243
aVA levels, I've been assured, are much better (and I'm just going into them so I really, *really* hope they are), and also much more difficult (which should be good as it means it'll be more of an in-depth study... Hopefully...).
p1244
aVHowever, GCSEs at the very least are not particularly taxing on the *application* of things, but rather the *memorisation* of things (generally useless or not particularly useful facts).
p1245
aVThey are important, of course, to know, especially if you're going to be working in those sorts of fields, but I think the methods are a lot more important in a wide variety of subjects.
p1246
aVOh, and the English (Literature?
p1247
aV) GCSE seems to be complete rubbish.
p1248
aVRegurgitate complicated words which might apply, and lie through your teeth saying "X" is evidence for "Y", even if you honestly think there is no link between X and Y whatsoever.
p1249
aVSure, the education system is better than a lot of countries, I'm sure, and it's good at and past A levels, so I'm told, but GCSEs really don't seem to be based on learning a topic, but instead memorising facts to the best of your ability (and learning how to pass the test).
p1250
aVOther than the language GCSEs that is, as it's pretty difficult to just memorise facts for those which don't actually help you with the language.
p1251
aVUpvoted for middle lane points.
p1252
aV&gt; Ours are the most expensive in Europe I think.
p1253
aVMaybe, but they\u2019re not as bad as Austria\u2019s.
p1254
aVThis post is pretty interesting to me as I just moved to the UK a few days ago and everything seems a little bizarre to me of course.
p1255
aVI'm from the US and I have a lot of new things to discover and figure out yet.
p1256
aVWelcome to the country.
p1257
aVHave you inspected your boiler yet?
p1258
aVIn case I ever visit a home in Britain is it appropriate to bring a complimentary boiler as a gift?
p1259
aVIn what manner is the boiler to be packed and is it appropriate for the host to unwrap it in front if the guests?
p1260
aVDo I have to look out to not pick a working class boiler for a bourgeoise home?
p1261
aVWhat's standard boiler literature?
p1262
aVThank you for the mental image of you hauling a boiler through Heathrow and onto the Tube.
p1263
aVI rent a spare room from some people so I'll leave that up to them ;)
p1264
aVFrom my understanding, you should get your own.
p1265
aVEDIT: Better two, just in case.
p1266
aVSo he'll need four taps then
p1267
aVWelcome to Yorkshire! 
p1268
aVThanks!
p1269
aVThis post will get drowned, but it'll provide some counter-perspective for you.
p1270
aVI'm an Englishman who's lived in Poland for 10 years, and your country still weirds the hell out of me sometimes.
p1271
aV* Food.
p1272
aVYou have amazing recipes like pierogi, leczo, bigos, big chunks of golonka, and the world's most incredible array of sausages.
p1273
aVIt's like you can turn a pig into a magical meat wonderland of flavour.
p1274
aVAnd the bread?
p1275
aVLoaves stuffed with plums or cranberries, soft or crunchy rolls, dark, grain, rye... it's a baker's paradise.
p1276
aVConsidering these two incredible foodstuffs, can I get a bacon sandwich anywhere in the entire country?
p1277
aVNope\u000a\u000a* Christmas food.
p1278
aVYou celebrate Christmas the night before, by banning all the tasty stuff mentioned above (no meat, no alcohol) and instead punishing yourself with the worst food available.
p1279
aVCarp.
p1280
aVHerring.
p1281
aVBland pasta covered in poppy seeds.
p1282
aVIs this some masochistic torture for all the sinning you've done that year?
p1283
aV* Religion.
p1284
aVApparently, everybody's Catholic.
p1285
aVIf your car breaks down on the street no-one will stop and help you.
p1286
aVOld ladies will spit and curse at you for kissing in public, and everyone cheats each other as much as possible, including never paying any taxes.
p1287
aVPeople really are awful to each other on a daily basis.
p1288
aVBut they still go to Church on Sunday and own a picture of...\u000a\u000a* John Paul II.
p1289
aVYeah, I know, 28 years a Pope.
p1290
aV28 years where he did nothing to help the spread of AIDS in Africa or end the sexual abuse of children in the Church.
p1291
aVDead for 9 years.
p1292
aVBut still many Poles think he's a saint and own a poster/calender/icon of him.
p1293
aVWhat's the new Pope's name?
p1294
aVDon't care, the only Pope is JP2.
p1295
aV* Driving.
p1296
aVBulgaria has worse roads than Poland, and fewer people are killed in car accidents.
p1297
aVThe Lithuanians have worse cars, and kill fewer people.
p1298
aVThe Italians have more treacherous geography, the English and Swedish have worse weather, and the Germans drive faster, and still Poland kills more people with cars than these countries.
p1299
aVWhy?
p1300
aVPolish people suck at driving.
p1301
aVReally, you're awful.
p1302
aVMaybe because you're always rushing around the country on...\u000a\u000a* Holidays.
p1303
aV26 days per year once you reach 10 years of employment (or 3years + 5years of studying).
p1304
aVPlus 12 national holidays, so 38 days off a year, or nearly two working months.
p1305
aVHow does anything get done?
p1306
aVHow, even in the capital city, do shop-owners shut down for the whole of August and still run a successful business?
p1307
aVWhich leads to...\u000a\u000a* Service.
p1308
aVYou'll never feel less welcome than when you walk into a shop and ask the seller for something.
p1309
aV99% of the time the answer will be "no".
p1310
aVThe other 1% the item will be handed to you in awkward silence, with an evil glare for interrupting their peace and quiet.
p1311
aVIn supermarkets, you'll go the entire transaction without hearing a single word from the cashier except...\u000a\u000a* "Do you have any change?
p1312
aV" I'm used to this from homeless people.
p1313
aVNot from the store clerk, desperate to get the 5- and 10grosze coins from my pocket.
p1314
aVThe sale was 49.56zl, I gave you a 50zl note, but you still desperately plead for the 56grosze in change so that you can give me 1zl back.
p1315
aVIn a tiny village shop, ok, I get it, but in massive outlets with 20 cashiers?
p1316
aVThis is retarded.
p1317
aVEspecially in...\u000a\u000a* Home improvement stores.
p1318
aVCastorama, Praktiker, Obi, Leroy Merlin - huge palaces to consumption where you can buy curtains, wood flooring, lamps and bathroom furniture.
p1319
aVFinally, you can decorate your apartment the way you always dreamed, filled with furniture from Ikea or BlackRedWhite.
p1320
aVThese names are confusing, but it's ok: *they all sell exactly the same products for the same prices*.
p1321
aVYou had Communism for 45 years where everyone wore identical clothes and lived in identical apartments with identical furniture.
p1322
aVNow, after 25 years of capitalism it's exactly the same, except it's the people's choice.
p1323
aVAnd Ikea in Poland is more expensive than the UK.
p1324
aV* Bureaucracy.
p1325
aVI'm from the UK; I don't have an ID card.
p1326
aVI don't have one in Poland either, but I do have a unique ID number (PESEL) and a registered address (meldunek) and a tax number (NIP) and a business number (REGON).
p1327
aVI couldn't get an ID card becuase you need meldunek for that, but you can't get meldunek without an ID card.
p1328
aVI worked my way around it to buy a car and a flat, butI can't be registered (meldunek) in  my own flat for more than 5 years because I don't have an ID card, even though I'm listed on the land ownership record (KW) as the owner.
p1329
aVIt takes five different offices to deal with this shit.
p1330
aV* Decograms.
p1331
aVIf I buy ham or cheese I don't buy it in kilos, or grams, but decograms.
p1332
aVWhat the fuck is a decogram?
p1333
aV"20 decos of ham, please.
p1334
aV" Or 200 grams, for normal people.
p1335
aVYou don't use decolitres for beer or vodka, but you'll use decograms for ham, as if you've invented a metric pig.
p1336
aVSo if it's so awful, why do I stay here?
p1337
aV* The weather.
p1338
aVPeople think of Poland as some grey gloomy landscape, like Siberia but with more pork products.
p1339
aVBut it isn't.
p1340
aVIt has 4 very distinct seasons that are all just long enough, and even from my window in Warsaw I can see gorgeous August sunsets shining on the browning leaves of the old chestnut trees over the road.
p1341
aVI regularly stop and stare at the beauty of the weather here.
p1342
aV* The geography.
p1343
aVMountains to the south, sea to the north, a massive lake district and some of the most ancient oak and pine forests in Europe.
p1344
aVThis place is a natural wonderland, achingly beautiful in its wilderness.
p1345
aV* The architecture.
p1346
aVPoland's awful and awesome history means towns are actually distinct from each other, and Lublin is different to Krakow or to Wroclaw or to Gdansk.
p1347
aVThis is unlike Britain, where every town up and down the country has a stone cathedral surrounded by fake Tudor townhouses and a generic high street filled with the same bloody shops.
p1348
aVYawn.
p1349
aV* The people.
p1350
aVOnce people accept you, Poles display a level of genuine warmth that I never experienced in the UK.
p1351
aVThey'll hurl abuse at you on the roads and elbow you in the street without saying sorry, but if you're invited to their house you're an honored guest and nothing is too good for you.
p1352
aVInstead of a bland evening supper of polite conversation and dinner party games (like England) you'll be invited to a three-day weekend at their place in the country with rivers of alcohol and more sausage than a Gay Pride festival.
p1353
aVWhich is how Poles "relax".
p1354
aVA ha ha ha.
p1355
aV* The humour.
p1356
aVA very dry humour prevails in Poland, mixed with a taste for the absurd.
p1357
aVClassic books and movies are either very subtle or utterly outrageous in their weirdness, and once you get that into your head, real life in Poland starts to make sense (in the sense that you know it will never make sense).
p1358
aV* The work/life balance.
p1359
aVThe long holidays and generic product availability is frustrating at first, but then you learn it's how Poles think; Work to Live, not Live to Work like in the UK.
p1360
aVBritishers put in 40-60 hours a week to fill their overpriced house with stupid shit they don't need, so that after 45 soul-destroying years they can die of a heart attack with shitloads of debt.
p1361
aVPoles would rather save save save, pay cash up front for a couple of good products, and make those things last the rest of their life.
p1362
aVPeople at the age of 25 are trying to buy the houses they'll die in, people avoid mortgages and credit cards as if they were ebola, and trade promotion and career prospects for family time with the wife and kids.
p1363
aVAs a result, they have much less stress and more stronger relationships with their family, even if it means they can't afford a 50" TV and three foreign holidays a year.
p1364
aVI think that's a much healthier balance (although it's starting to change).
p1365
aV* Food.
p1366
aVMicrowave and oven-ready meals are almost unheard of.
p1367
aVPeople cook fresh, and cook often (or their mothers do it for them).
p1368
aVIn summer the street stalls are bursting with fresh fruit and vegetables, and beside a few kebab and Asian bars, fast food is almost unknown.
p1369
aVPeople don't really go to restaurants at all, and even Warsaw (a city of 3million people) has a very limited range of places to eat out - not only because of price, but because the stuff made at home really does taste so much better.
p1370
aVIt's also healthier, which leads to...\u000a\u000a* Women.
p1371
aVGirls here are beautiful, not because of genetics but because of style.
p1372
aVThey don't turn into lardbuckets at 25 like their British counterparts, they don't sport horrendous fake tans, buckets of makeup or trampstamp tattoos, or follow the latest retarded fashion trends.
p1373
aVSure, there's always a tasteless minority, but more often than not the women focus on looking elegant or chic rather than Kardashian clones.
p1374
aVIt's beautiful without relying solely on sex appeal.
p1375
aV* You can compliment people.
p1376
aVI can tell the women in the office that their hair looks good today or that I like their new shoes without being considered sleazy or a potential rapist.
p1377
aVMen can say nice things to women (things they honestly mean - those *are* nice new shoes) without the risk of HR getting involved for sexual harrassment.
p1378
aV* More seriously, politics.
p1379
aVPeople here are informed, and the newsagents actually have a choice in weekly magazines on art, science and politics (wprost, polityka etc).
p1380
aVEven the existence of metalist idiots like Kaczynski and Korwin-Mikke helps people have actual debates on what's important for the country, rather than the pathetic dribble of PR quotes that the British hear from Cameron and Clegg.
p1381
aV* Largest apple producer in Europe, and you've only just (last three years) learned how to make cider.
p1382
aVBut it's good cider - clean and fresh.
p1383
aV* Culture.
p1384
aVPeople here have read books, recognise classical music pieces, enjoy attending the theatre and are open to discuss these things.
p1385
aVWater cooler talk is about current events, be it big sports matches or global wars.
p1386
aVIt's not endless asinine bleating about whatever was on telly last night.
p1387
aVEnjoy your time in England; I wouldn't swap places with you.
p1388
aVThe invention of metric pig was our biggest accomplishment.\u000a	\u000a
p1389
aV&gt; Largest apple producer in Europe, and you've only just (last three years) learned how to make cider.
p1390
aVWhat the heck were they doing with all the apples before?
p1391
aVAlso heh at the metric pig :)
p1392
aVExcept for the religion thing, you just also described the Czech Republic too.
p1393
aV[deleted]
p1394
aV6.They are overtaking lanes, you should only be in them if you are overtaking as stated in the Highway Code.
p1395
aVNothing pisses me off more than being on a relatively empty motorway and having to move all the way from the inside lane to the outside lane just to overtake someone sat in the middle lane.
p1396
aVEver tried orbiting?
p1397
aVIt can be difficult to find the right conditions, but it's quite rewarding.
p1398
aVSpot your 'planet': a middle-lane hogger who is sitting there with the road open and little to no other traffic.
p1399
aVApproach in your satellite from the rear in the left lane.
p1400
aVMove out behind them as you get closer.
p1401
aVMove to the outside to go past.
p1402
aVGo past.
p1403
aVMove back in.
p1404
aVMove over again.
p1405
aVEase off so you slow down.
p1406
aVLet them move past you.
p1407
aVIncrease your speed, move out and overtake.
p1408
aVKeep doing this until they get the message and move over to the left.
p1409
aVMy record is 6 orbits.
p1410
aVHave fun.
p1411
aVThat sounds technically ill-advised from a road safety standpoint, but also absolutely hilarious.
p1412
aVI'm not sure exactly how it is unsafe.
p1413
aVAnother chap just mentioned he thought it would be illegal, but I still don't see how *exactly*.
p1414
aVFor the record I've only done it the once, when I got that 'score'.
p1415
aVMostly the traffic conditions mean it's not possible even though I might have been tempted.
p1416
aVDoesn't sound too terribly unsafe (although I suppose that depends partly on how tight your orbits are - how close you're passing in front/behind them).
p1417
aVBut it does somewhat fail on the general principle of driving in a predictable/unsurprising way; if they suddenly notice you're doing laps, who knows how a spooked 'planet' might react.
p1418
aVBloody immigrants...coming over here and being baffled by random stuff.
p1419
aV*and* being nice about it.
p1420
aVBloody outrageous!
p1421
aVMy dad has a [Lamborghini](http://i.imgur.com/BpOAzAw.jpg) boiler. 
p1422
aVWell, if that's not something to boast about...\u000a\u000a
p1423
aVlittered with greasy shit.
p1424
aVDisgusting.
p1425
aVI've never seen anything like that before outside Russia.
p1426
aVmade my day
p1427
aVI meant former Soviet Union.
p1428
aVYears ago.
p1429
aVSlow train moving among the villages of current Ukraine.
p1430
aVWith people transporting chickens and a goat.
p1431
aVAnd eating some unrecognizable stuff out of old newspaper and a jar.
p1432
aVI would love to see someone on a UK train with a goat, perhaps in North Yorkshire?
p1433
aVThe train operators don't like taking bikes wonder how they would react to a goat?
p1434
aVI took quite a large hamster on the train once.
p1435
aVnumber 1- all banks should allow you to open a basic bank account which allows you to withdraw your money at an atm and have money paid in (like your salary).
p1436
aVIt won't allow you to have a bank card or set up direct debits though unfortunately.
p1437
aVIf you open one of these for 6-12 months and constantly have salary paid in you will probably get enough of a history to upgrade to a regular current account.
p1438
aVnumber 6- you should always keep as far left as you possibly can when driving, which is why people get annoyed with middle lane hoggers.
p1439
aVYou shouldn't be setting cruise control in the middle lane- overtake the truck, then move back left.
p1440
aVAs an ex financial advisor I can shed some information on this.
p1441
aV(apologies if this has already been answered) \u000a\u000athe banks have very little interest in working for people.
p1442
aVI worked for HSBC (who turned out to be amazingly evil) to leave and go to Natwest (who turned out to be also amazingly evil).
p1443
aVas the two of the top UK banks this is what you can expect and why.
p1444
aVpersonal accounts make a bank pretty much nothing.
p1445
aVThe reason they give 'normal' people accounts is because they use your money to prop up various funds while they play roulette with your money.
p1446
aVTheir bonus comes from charging people.
p1447
aVThey will (and do) plan and make more money off people's charges and fees than they will off gambling with your money.
p1448
aVThey will keep you around and pay lip service to you in the hope you will start incurring charges (which basically equals free money to them)  \u000a\u000atheir account opening bullshittery is directly related to how often they unjustly fucked the average consumer, who then panicked and tried to hide from his life destroying and psyche crushing debt.
p1449
aVThe financial institutions actively seek out people who will need these products in the future.
p1450
aVto start off with this seems innocent or at least a reasonable business practice, but it is far from.
p1451
aVThe banks actively employ staff to sift through their customer data to search for potential at risk customers.
p1452
aVThese customers are targeted as people who will,  with high certainty get themselves into further financial trouble, creating revenue streams for the banks.
p1453
aVThe personal circumstances are rarely considered and the banks pressure all staff from the counter to management  to increase the free services with the bank so you can sell unnecessary services to the customer.
p1454
aVthe prospect of 'free' banking isnt considered anything special to the people who are unaware of the foreign banks charging for most services.
p1455
aVbut when they are made aware this is falsely attributed to the banks being nice to you or some UK claim to financial niceness.
p1456
aVThis allows the banks to pass off their charges as reasonable to the customer considering their lack of charges otherwise.
p1457
aVyou can and will be allowed by all (of the major banks at least) your first two charges back.
p1458
aVThey are instructed to challenged you but if you persist it is (or was last year) a bank policy to refund 'reasonable' requests.
p1459
aVThis is where it goes wrong though.......\u000a\u000a\u000ayou are worthless to the banks.
p1460
aVI don't care who you are or how big you think you, are there are richer and more important people than you, as far as the banks are concerned (it's the bank executives in case your wondering.
p1461
aV)\u000a\u000abanks are shareholder companies and their only concerns are meeting the global share index profit predictions (how much phat stacks they were planning on making off nice people).
p1462
aVto do this they balance their insurance income (basically free money) minus against their predicted payouts to customers for accounts, insurance and interest (several departments jobs are to find any legal way to keep this as low as possible).
p1463
aVTheir stock price gambling income (it's not gambling really, all banks have very successful means of inflating their profits and stealing/robbing money for customers, trading, investments and futures....... or at the very worst they just tell the public to cough up huge sacks of cash.
p1464
aV)  vs their investment debts (usually covered by tax payers.
p1465
aVThis all started again  after banks paid political figures for financial deregulation in the past 20-30 years.
p1466
aVI can only certainly say us and UK for certain.
p1467
aV) \u000a\u000a\u000ayou bank accounts etc are a petty cash fund that takes up the slack.
p1468
aVnow admittedly that's a lot of waffle to get to the pint of why the banks don't give a fuck but you effectively do nothing for them, thus they couldn't give a shit.
p1469
aVThe excess ID is so that if you have the cheek to play them at their own game and defraud them it allows them to hunt you nationally and depending on  the amount of money owed, internationally.
p1470
aVcurrently legislation stands at a 6 yr data limit.
p1471
aVso if you can avoid contact with the banks for what ever reason for 6 years they can no longer chase you for debt or fees.

p1512
aVPoint 20: There's a good reason for this, from Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrication_in_the_United_Kingdom#Wholesale.2C_retail_and_consumer_industries ):\u000a\u000a&gt;The changeover to selling of petrol by the litre rather than by the gallon took place after the Board was wound up.
p1513
aVIt was prompted by a technical shortcoming of petrol pump design: pumps (which were electro-mechanical) had been designed to be switchable between metric and imperial units, but had no provisions for prices above £1.999 per unit of fuel.
p1514
aVOnce the price of petrol rose above £1 per gallon, the industry requested that they be permitted to sell fuel by the litre rather than the gallon, enabling them to reduce the unit price by a factor of about 4.5 and so to extend the lives of existing pumps.
p1515
aVPersonally, as someone who's all for the UK finally finishing the metrication program and abolishing the imperial measurement system from our road signs, I wish they'd finally get on with it and do the job properly, rather than half-arsing everything like this.
p1516

aVYour complaints about the schools may be due to the specific place your step son is a student.
p1561
aVIn my experience secondary schools in the UK can vary in pretty much every aspect massively.
p1562
aVBy any chance is your step son taking foundation level GCSEs?
p1563
aV(I don't mean that in any offensive way I'm from a family of people who can't complete any kind of exam) I ask because I have family in Italy and my aunt read through some practice papers and kept commenting on how easy exams were here but I had to keep pointing out that she was in fact reading a foundation paper which, when compared to regular papers, are incredibly basic.
p1564
aVSchooling bullshit you say?
p1565
aVBack when I was doing my GCSEs, my school is one of those 'slightly old and a bit posh' ones, and has good grades.
p1566
aVI was a top student then (uni made me understand how wrong the system is cause I can't keep up with all the self-study you really have to do to be ok when I used to be ok just following homework cause the teachers do the reinforcement for you), but I was one of the slightly odd ones, being gay and not exactly getting on with the cruelty of immature teenagers and figuring how to not fancy someone, so naturally I had a bit of a bad time getting on with kids.
p1567
aVWhat did the school do?
p1568
aVPretends to help whilst actually gossiping in staff rooms, ostracising me in the guise of helping, and (maybe not so secretly) wanting me out, which was actually the best idea in the end cause I'll never fit in with the shit they do.
p1569
aVThis is when 'fitting in' is wrong because the crowd is corrupt thinking their 'tradition' of bullying and letting kids do it is acceptable.
p1570
aVGranted I was not the best person, but treating them like a freak is certainly the last thing you should do.
p1571
aVWeirdly I kind of had the opposite experience to you.
p1572
aVI was a top student in primary school but struggled in SATS, GCSEs and completely botched my A levels and now that I'm at uni I actually find it much easier to get decent marks.
p1573
aVPeople are just better equipped for certain things I suppose which I would say is the biggest problem with our school system.
p1574
aVToo much lumping together and tarring with the same brush.

aVAs for the bullying side of things I can sympathise.
p1577
aVI have a condition which made me stick out from every other student in the school but the teachers there were incredibly supportive.

p1684
aVThey've also removed loads of fees for being overdrawn and generally stopped being colossal dicks about it.

aVNah they are still colossal dicks.

p1691
aVThey also decided that the current account that I had, one that i'd had for many years and paid interest was no longer being offered - so they changed me to a different type of current account that no longer paid interest.

aVJust move banks, it's pretty easy these days. 
p1693
aVPoint 1 is also to serve the automatic overdraft.
p1694
aVIf they cannot find out where you live then you can just drain your overdraft and disappear.
p1695
aVIt's also going to be an immigration thing soon; Parliament just passed a new law that means banks could be fined if they open current accounts for people not legally allowed to remain in the UK, unless they've carried out a background check.

p1737
aV\u000aI agree with all your clever observations except this one:\u000a\u000a&gt;I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected.
p1738
aVsource:  French person who knows what first world rail infrastructure looks like.
p1739
aVWhere have you seen those trains?
p1740
aVI lived 3 years in France and I don't remember this 'first world rail infrastructure' when scnf trains stops because of drizzle. 
p1741
aV\u000aThe TGV held the rail land speed record for commercial trains for decades.
p1742
aVUnlike in the UK, in France I have never been told that the train is at a stop (for 5 hours) because "there are leaves on the rails" (in autumn).
p1743
aVAnd the UK has the most expensive rail in Europe.
p1744
aVTry to go by line J from saint Lazare to mantes la jolie during autumn or winter.
p1745
aVScnf is even worst in this matter since they cancel trains because rails are wet.
p1746
aVSometimes you stack in middle way without alternative transport since there is no taxi or buses
p1747
aVAre there some bad examples?
p1748
aVSure, any system has.
p1749
aVOn the other hand I can get on a TGV in London and be in the south of France in about 5 hours travelling at speeds approaching 300kmh.
p1750
aVYou can't complain about train service in Europe until you have been to the UK.
p1751
aVWhen I lived in Paris, I used to travel by TGV around Europe also to London.
p1752
aVI didnt found any problems with it ever.
p1753
aVI think I had really unlucky to scnf.
p1754
aVI was in august in France, unfortunately last connection around 10pm was always canceled without any reason, I was forced to take other train and walk later quite a long time.
p1755
aVOther time at 10am I was going again out of Paris to Mantes La Jolie, and this train stopped before Poissy and didn't move further for next 2 hours, so I needed to return back to St Lazare and take other train and later walk.
p1756
aVI was in France whole 6 days :).
p1757
aVFrom country where I from trains used to be worst than in France, but in case of break down they always provide some other type of transportation.
p1758
aVFrench don't care.
p1759
aVIn London I used to use underground and trains going to max 3rd zone, so maybe I had lucky, I nvr faced any troubles. 
p1760
aVAnyway, for me comparing trains which competitor are airlines to regular one have totally no sense.
p1761
aVSince I'm not french I always think which people are Scnf hiring to speak through speakers.

aV9) Were the guys in suits Russian oligarchs?
p1765
aVAs for 8, in most countries you find a single tap which allows you to get either hot water, cold water or some mixture of both (something like this: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Aerated_tap_water.jpg)\u000a\u000aIn the UK you always get two separate taps, one with hot water and another with cold water.

p1778
aVThese: https://i.imgur.com/lgEBnHA.jpg\u000a\u000aI'd never seen one until moving to the UK.
p1779
aVMajor WTF moment.
p1780
aVI'm guessing older style of taps with 2 taps 1 for hot &amp; 1 for cold rather than the more modern all in one.
p1781
aVYes It took me a while to figure out too!
p1782
aVWith regard to education: there is no hand-holding, expecting kids to be motivated and self directed from a young age.
p1783
aVAnd working while sick: stiff upper lip prevails, only the weak would stay home, sick days are for when friends come to town.
p1784

aVSpecial washing up bowls people put in their sink- I have been here for 13 years, and it still doesn't make sense.

aVMarks and Spencers makes amazing underwear- Umm, no it doesn't.
p1792
aVI hate to burst your bubble, but quantity =/= quality.
p1793
aV&gt;Special washing up bowls people put in their sink\u000a\u000aOh God, this drives me mental; we have one at home, which my wife swears is relevant, although I've yet to see a single use case that couldn't be answered by just using the fucking sink.
p1794
aVNo need for a separate, smaller sink inside it that just gets in the way the rest of the time.
p1795
aVWhich, since we also own a dishwasher, is most of the time.
p1796
aVUp voted for the passion this topic should receive more often.
p1797
aVGet rid of the nasty, germy washing up bowls now.
p1798
aVYou have nothing to lose except a crowded sink.
p1799
aVupvoted you both as I am also passionate about the subject.
p1800
aVProbably this is why I'm not yet married to my partner of 7 years as he is firmly in the washing bowl camp. 
p1801
aVwe need to start a movement.
p1802
aVwe really do!
p1803
aVmy god...
p1804
aVI've never noticed that the washing up bowl is irrelevant!
p1805
aVit's been a staple of my life for no reason 
p1806
aVMy house has just been blessed by one of these bowls.
p1807
aVI just don't understand them.
p1808
aVAlso have a dishwasher...
p1809
aVIf you have a porcelain sink it makes sense, otherwise you'll end up with broken crockery.
p1810
aVFor normal aluminium sinks I agree washing bowls make no sense at all.
p1811
aVIt's pretty simple -\u000a\u000aFirstly, you don't want your sink getting scratched.
p1812
aVSecondly, you're able to pour liquid down the side.
p1813
aVIf you have a single sink it can be a pain to dispose of the liquid otherwise.
p1814
aVWe use the washing up bowl to wash dishes when bathing a baby, to soak clothes and do the dishes AT THE SAME TIME .
p1815
aVThe thing I love most about going on Holiday to Europe is that when you and your friends fancy a drink, you sit at a table and someone comes and takes your order.

p1818
aVIt's the beer equivelent of Oliver Twist except we're not fucking poor.

p1822
aVThanks for writing this.
p1823

p1827
aV&gt;  Then he speeds up... by one or two mp/h and takes 60 seconds to move past me.
p1828
aVThen another.
p1829
aVThen another.
p1830
aVAll while I'm sitting behind some bloody truck, forced to slow down to 50 or 60.
p1831
aVEVERY FRIGGIN' TIME.
p1832
aVOne thing that really gets on my tits is the way people will ignore your indicator.
p1833
aVNow I'll be the first to deride the arseholes who think that using their blinker means they have right of way.
p1834
aVHowever I am constantly bemused by regular inconsiderate nature from other motorists: those who sit in the middle lane overtaking you by a few mph more and ignore your indicator.
p1835
aVSo you sit there waiting for someone to let you out, but no-one moves into the 3rd lane but just carry on crawling past.
p1836
aVI often wonder if that's one of the reasons why people sit in the middle lane: they know how hard it is to get out of the inside when there's a lorry coming up.
p1837
aVIn other regards I've noticed that sometimes people do let you out by leaving what they think it adequate room.
p1838
aVIt constantly amazes me how few people leave the requisite gap between them and the car in front.
p1839
aVMind you considering how often people think any sized gap is acceptable for them to pull into - the only stipulation apparently being "is it longer than my car?
p1840
aV" - perhaps I shouldn't be.
p1841
aVSorry, but your indicator is to say 'I am moving', not 'I would like to move'.
p1842
aVYou should only indicate when you are actually about to move.
p1843
aV(Remember - 'mirror, signal, manoeuvre' - the point being if you can see in your mirror that there isn't a gap then don't proceed to point 2).
p1844
aVThe reason people drive past you when your indicator is flashing is probably because you're not showing any actual sign of moving, meaning that they probably think you've just left your indicator on by mistake.
p1845
aVWhy are you sorry?
p1846
aVInteresting concept: I do recall mirror, signal manoeuvre.
p1847
aVHowever, as I mention in the comment, often times there is little to no chance of there ever being a (safe) space because people don't appear to move out of the centre lane.
p1848
aVOf course, one could simply stay in the inside in perpetuity but it's not something I think anyone would ever be happy to do.
p1849
aV&gt; Ill people at work\u000a\u000aI've gone to work ill before as my employer only allows 5 sick days in a 12 month period.
p1850
aVThis means that if I was ill all of last week, then I couldn't have one other paid sick day between Aug 2013 to Aug 2015.
p1851
aVI happened to have really bad food poisoning last summer and was off work for 6 days (1 unpaid) and then had the flu/bad cold last winter...
p1852
aVI went into work when I was all in the winter as I couldn't afford to have unpaid leave.
p1853
aVNeedless to say other people in the office got ill around/after the time I was ill.\u000a\u000aWe do have home workers where I work, but the view is "If you are ill you are ill, so can't work from home either". 
p1854
aV&gt;Do not hog the middle lane.
p1855
aVIt's for overtaking, not cruising.
p1856
aVI appreciate the patience with which you have embraced our culture, and agree with you to some extent on all except one point, which is about driving in the middle lane.
p1857
aVThe middle lane is an overtaking lane.
p1858
aVIt is not a cruising lane.
p1859
aVThe left hand lane is for cruising.
p1860
aVIf you are cruising at the speed limit and the car in front is going slower, by all means use the middle lane to overtake.
p1861
aVIf I am cruising, but going faster than you, and I am in the correct lane, I have to cross two lanes to go around you and come back in.
p1862
aVIt is people sitting in the middle lane that makes this very simple system of overtaking fall apart.
p1863
aV1..3: Yeah, banks suck.
p1864
aVThey're dated and need to pull their asses out of the 18th Century.
p1865
aV4: Ill people at work.
p1866
aVThis is partly "stiff upper lip".
p1867
aVAlso, ring in sick and you'll lose a sick day from your allowance.
p1868
aVHave your boss tell you to go home, no frigin way am I taking a sick day cause my boss told me to leave.
p1869
aVThat's like taking holiday because I've been fired!
p1870
aV5: Da fuq else do you do with vinegar?
p1871
aV6: Seriously, drive on the left.
p1872
aVThere is no reason to hog the middle lane.
p1873
aVSimilarly, there is no reason to do 72MPH anywhere on the motorway.
p1874
aVDo 55-70/80/90+ in the respective lanes.
p1875
aV7: Here was me thinking on street parking was pretty limited.
p1876
aV8-9: Taps and messy people, these piss me off as well.
p1877
aV10: Incompetence in services, yeah, see "stiff upper lip" and not complaining.
p1878
aV11: Insurance, I guess so.
p1879
aVVery little is required though.
p1880
aVI don't think I've ever had tennants insurance.
p1881
aVYou can choose to live the polish way and not have pet insurance?
p1882
aVBut what do you do in poland if your pet is injured/ill?
p1883
aV12..14: Agreed on the trains.
p1884
aVAnd the Daily Mail.
p1885
aVAnd Cameron is as bad as both combined.
p1886
aV15: Education, you might have just got unlucky and got a bad school.
p1887
aVOr you might be clinging to some poor examples.
p1888
aVThough I do see the benefits mentality more than I'd like.
p1889
aVI think reflection is why people also think the easter europeans want to do the same.
p1890
aVWe've got a class of people in the UK who do not value themselves or working for themselves.
p1891
aVThis is a sad thing.
p1892
aV16: Phat amaze balls, self-service means I don't have to talk to bored old ladies on the till.
p1893
aVThough, why would you use a walk around self scanner.
p1894
aVI need things, I put them in my basket/trolley.
p1895
aVI don't need a rolling total, I need the things.
p1896
aV17: No road police, but lots of static cameras.
p1897
aVThis bothers me to no end.
p1898
aVI'd far prefer to see road police who can make judgement calls, and provide aid to people, than the fixed cameras we have all over the place causing people to emergency brake.
p1899
aV18: Sour cream has limited use.
p1900
aVOff milk has none.
p1901
aVJust sayin'\u000a\u000a19: You want hot water?
p1902
aVCause boilers is how you get hot water.
p1903
aV20: Because all liquids have to be sold in metric, you damn europe types you!
p1904
aVBut cars run on proper measurements.
p1905
aV16.
p1906
aVHaving a running total is fanTASTIC when you're on a tight budget.
p1907
aVIt's not for everyone, or even every shop, but I've certainly been glad to have one in the past.
p1908
aVThe advantage of the portable scanner is speed.
p1909
aVYou scan all your items when picking them up, and once at checkout you swipe your storecard and pay with your debit card and you're done in less than 30 seconds.
p1910
aVDoes that actually happen though?
p1911
aVI can only imagine the security implications for allowing that.
p1912
aVI was under the impression that the portable scanners only allowed you to keep track of what you'd spent before you got to the till.
p1913
aVThen everything is scanned through as normal.
p1914
aVMy understanding is that the first few times your shopping will be manually checked and then once you've proved yourself you can just pay and leave.
p1915
aVSubject to the occasional random check, and of course all tracked via Nectar / Clubcard etc. 
p1916
aVNeat.
p1917
aVI might look to use them a bit more then.
p1918
aV11.
p1919
aVWe go to the vet and pay for a visit ... what's strange about it?
p1920
aVYou can do that in the UK... just you could, if you wanted, buy insurance to mean that's not so expensive on each visit.
p1921
aVI'm asking why having the insurance available is strange to OP.
p1922
aVI love this guy, about David Cameron I am just as puzzled how he is prime minister as you
p1923
aVI don't want to use the store scanner thing because the self scan checkout is enough of a twat, and if that scanner fucks up halfway around the store I would just leave it there.
p1924
aVAs you might have noticed the UK is a European developing country.
p1925
aVThe Industrial Revolution and democracy began in the UK.
p1926
aVJust saying.  
p1927
aVAll of the bad stuff you listed seemed livable until you got to the education.
p1928
aVIt sounds horrible!
p1929
aVThe education system is fine if the child is motivated by external factors (parents for example).
p1930
aVSchools don't encourage kids to learn or motivate them to put any effort in, they simply make the education available and some kids take it and some don't - largely depending on the home they come from I think.
p1931
aVFor example if the little girl's parents live off benefits, then chances are she's going to aspire to do the same, whereas the child with nurses for parents is going to want to get A levels so he can be a nurse too.
p1932
aVIt seems you're fitting in well in Britain, where complaining is a national pastime!
p1933
aVAnyhow, I'll go over these!
p1934
aV1.
p1935
aVThere's a reason why people are more likely to move house, than to switch their banks.
p1936
aVBanks are a pain in the ass in all senses.
p1937
aVOnly open during the times you're working (or wanting a lie-in on a Saturday, but they close at 12), still charging 'admin' fees for payments and direct debits, in what is ultimately now a pretty much automated business.
p1938
aVIt's nuts.
p1939
aV2.
p1940
aVSee above.
p1941
aV3.
p1942
aVNobody uses cheques, except for my grandma, and she only uses them to send money to other people because she's legally blind and can't use online banking, or get to the bank easily.
p1943
aVEven she uses chip and pin at the supermarket.
p1944
aV4.
p1945
aVThis depends on the company you're working at; mine will regularly ask ill people to go home if they're feeling crappy, for the very reasons you've stated.
p1946
aVThey won't even let you work from home if you're looking bad enough, because they want you to recover!
p1947
aVBut other places are complete bags of dicks about it.
p1948
aV5.
p1949
aVI won't have you sullying my tea and my chips!
p1950
aVStill, it's just a local cultural thing; me, I can't stand black tea, and love some salt and vinegar on my chips.
p1951
aVThey've got to be proper, chunky, and preferably slightly crunchy chips mind, because *fuck fries.
p1952
aV*\u000a6.
p1953
aV(Apologies for the wall of text, Reddit's lists don't allow line breaks!
p1954
aV) This is more of a safety issue.
p1955
aVSlower vehicles move to the left to allow traffic to flow smoothly without jarring changes in speed (remember it's not speed that kills, it's sudden changes in it :P), to provide drivers with the expectation that people will generally only be overtaking them from the right side (which decreases driver stress and improves safety; "undertaking" is actually illegal in some countries, with the exception of certain conditions), and to help prevent the [accordion effect](http://www.ajac.ca/web/resources/article.asp?aid=2); if you're in the middle lane, there'd better be something in the left lane, and if there is, you'd better be moving faster than stuff to the left of you, otherwise why aren't you in the left lane?
p1956
aVYou're all of 20 metres further ahead just to move at the same speed, blocking off a lane that could be used for overtaking by faster traffic.
p1957
aVIf the traffic ahead of you keeps slowing down, use that opportunity to overtake them if it's safe.
p1958
aVYou should be far enough back to see a truck's side mirrors (because otherwise they CAN'T see you), which should give you enough opportunity to manoeuvre.
p1959
aVIn any case, most larger vehicles (&gt;7.5 tonnes) are limited to 60MPH anyway, fitting with the national speed limit for these vehicles, so you should have an opportunity to overtake in most cases on the motorway.
p1960
aVAlso, whilst I understand that you might be doing the speed limit, let the assholes who are speeding pass; it's far safer to let them disappear off into the distance than it is to hold them up and have them then try and undertake you later on.
p1961
aVLet them get caught by the cops/cameras, you're not doing anybody any favours by playing traffic cop deputy.
p1962
aV7.
p1963
aVParking is interesting; expensive in places, but depending on where you live, it is nice to be able to park on the side of the road in places!
p1964
aVYou'll soon find yourself learning the free places to park in busy areas you frequent regularly, try to get there early for a spot, and then cursing the people who got there first as you grudgingly pay for parking elsewhere.
p1965
aV8.
p1966
aVDouble taps?
p1967
aVAs in water?
p1968
aVI didn't even know this was a British thing.
p1969
aV9.
p1970
aVYes, these people are assholes.
p1971
aVIt's not a British thing; assholes are everywhere, even if their behaviours differ by country/region.
p1972
aVDon't be like them!
p1973
aV10.
p1974
aVYep, services can be hit and miss.
p1975
aVIf you don't like it, complain, and take your business elsewhere; these guys don't deserve to remain open.
p1976
aVAs a result, it's not uncommon to rely on word of mouth here: Be sure to ask friends/neighbours for their recommendations!
p1977
aV11.
p1978
aVWell, you don't have to insure everything, I'm pretty sure my car insurance is the only legally required one!
p1979
aVI get medical insurance from my employer, and house contents insurance just in case.
p1980
aVYou're free to take any others as your own risk, but I would definitely recommend keeping animals insured if you have any, because vets bills can be killer, especially in their later years.
p1981
aVBut yes, you can buy insurance for virtually everything, which is good for people who do feel that they need it, but if you don't, outside of legally required insurance, don't feel that you have to buy it!
p1982
aV12.
p1983
aVThe quality of public transport varies greatly depending on your area, but yeah, trains are fucking expensive.
p1984
aV13.
p1985
aVMorons, or people who don't know any better.
p1986
aVIt's a complete rag.

aVThere are a *lot* of people who'd agree with you; his party didn't even get in with the majority vote.
p1989
aVUnfortunately the other main party didn't either, and their leader has all the presence of a wet rag.
p1990
aVPeople seem to be stuck with voting for one or the other, for fear of voting for any alternatives being a "wasted" vote.
p1991
aVAnd honestly, under the current voting system, it pretty much is as it's lead to the current situation; a shakeup of the voting system is sorely needed.
p1992
aV15.
p1993
aVThis depends on your area too; in some poorer areas, many kids feel that there's no point in trying any harder, whilst in some middle/upper-middle class aras, there are parents pushing their children so hard that they're virtual wrecks before they've even left the education system.
p1994
aVNot sure how to address this one, as I'm not a parent/child specialist myself, and whilst I hate the idea of a benefit state, benefits do need to be there for those who actually need them.
p1995
aVPersonally, I was raised to do my best, but never overly pressured.
p1996
aVI actually ended up not doing so well at A-level (due to some of my own issues at the time), but going straight into work after, then doing extremely well in university a few years later.
p1997
aVNow I'm reasonably well paid at a decent job and have a decent life; I couldn't imagine not working for a living.
p1998
aV16.
p1999
aVSelf-service cash registers are great for small purchases, but Christ, some people seem to have no idea how to use them.
p2000
aVWatching someone slowly scanning their shopping, or failing to understand how it works is something that stresses me out big time.
p2001
aVAt least manned registers have someone on them who just wants to get someone scanned and packed as quickly as possible.
p2002
aVI also use the portable scanners, but they're relatively new technology that not everybody is comfortable yet.
p2003
aVStores also seem to have gotten into the weird habit of having no bags at the cashpoint at the end, or a place to pack properly without holding up the register; I wish they'd fix that, I'd happily wheel my trolley over to a packing zone once I've paid for everything to pack it all up without feeling like I'm inconveniencing someone else.
p2004
aV17.
p2005
aVNo road police that you've noticed; we often get unmarked cars on some of the roads more popular with racers.
p2006
aVI've also heard that we have one of the most stringent driving tests in the world; I'm pretty sure overtaking on a corner would get you a fail, as well as undertaking a driver outside of congestion.
p2007
aVWe have the basics of road etiquette drilled into us as soon as we get into the driver's seat.
p2008
aVYou still get dickwads on the roads, but they're thankfully the minority.
p2009
aV18.
p2010
aVTell me about it.
p2011
aVI love fajitas, but I rarely make them because finding sour cream is a pain in the ass without paying through the nose for it.
p2012
aVThat said, it's easier to find here than it was for me in France, where virtually nowhere stocks it.
p2013
aVLuckily they have much higher quality food otherwise though.
p2014
aV19.
p2015
aVWe live in a very temperate climate with very changeable weather, and not having a boiler in the winter is a nightmare, especially if you live further north - Kent probably has much milder weather.

aVRegarding point number 9, the only people I see doing that are immigrants.
p2020
aVno way, immigrants especially from the poor countries are careful not to offend the local sensibilities.

aVwe take our litter home with us.

aVI fucking *hated* the boiler in my house when I lived in Knightsbridge.
p2029
aVThat mother fucker was fucking with me every fucking day of every fucking winter...it only ever seemed to work in summer.\u000a\u000a
p2030
aVMy only complaint from when I went to London was how 99% of the pubs close at 10/11pm.
p2031
aVIn the rest of the world where these places are open til 2am, that's just when we're getting going!
p2032
aV!
aVPubs =\u005c= bars.
p2033
aVIn london of all places there's are dick loads of places to drink past 11.12.1.2.3 etc.
p2034
aVPubs are to the Brits what coffee shops are to yanks.
p2035
aVA place to hang out with your mates, family, nan etc maybe have a bite to eat too. 
p2036
aVin the centre of london they close early, but a bit further out they are open much later.\u000a\u000a
p2037
aV&gt;&gt;Maybe every country has some?

aVInside, flats are cosy little palaces.

p2043
aVWashing machines in the bathroom?
p2044
aVI guess it kind of makes sense - there's already water and a drain.
p2045
aVDo you wear ear defenders when you're busting for a poo and its just started a spin cycle?
p2046
aV3.
p2047
aVEvery apartment block seemingly has a) a tanning salon b) an alcohol shop open from 6:00am to 4:00am.
p2048
aVNo corner shop.

aVDon't people ever need milk or eggs  or Bisto or a lottery ticket?
p2050

p2051
aVWinter tyres!
p2052
aVI didn't know these existed before I spent time in Poland.
p2053
aVI asked a friend how people managed to drive so well in freezing conditions - in the UK people slide into each others cars at T junctions at the first sign of a frost.

p2060
aVWhat is it with those ultra-salty twiglet-sticks and dry wafer biscuits?
p2061
aVIt's like crack to software developers.
p2062
aVEvery half hour they'd hit the kitchen to re-salt themselves, then eat two handfuls of dry pink wafers.
p2063
aVThe cupboard under the sink was stuffed with industrial quantities in catering packs.
p2064
aVEdit: more...\u000a8.
p2065
aVEducation.
p2066
aVThe guys I worked with were very well educated, ultra-bright and very academic.
p2067
aVSometimes this caused its own problems, partly I think because there wasn't the same built-in 'commercial awareness' you get in non-ex-soviet Europe.
p2068
aVWe were two days away from a delivery deadline when the development team leader asked me to "Please explain to customer that there is a six month delay and they must pay extra".
p2069
aVHe'd  been having a beer with his University Professor (he'd left university six years before), who had advised that the software architecture we were using was 'incorrect' so we would need to scrap the current build and three months work, design a new framework and recode the solution.
p2070
aVIt turned out that 'incorrect' meant not wrong, not faulty, not less supportable, just 'not perfect'.
p2071
aVWe delivered the original software on time, but it was an immense struggle to get pretty much the whole team to understand good-enough is perfectly acceptable, and that we'd have been out of business in a week if we'd changed to the new 'perfect' solution.
p2072
aVEdit: more..\u000a9.
p2073
aVAllotments.
p2074
aVAllotments everywhere.
p2075
aVTiny ones ingeniously squeezed in between railway signalling equipment with ramshackle sheds, and ones with sheds that have evolved into two-storey mansions.  
p2076
aVWait, are you saying winter tires arnt available in the UK?
p2077
aVOr do you just not pay attention to life?\u000a
p2078
aVNumber 6 - you're saying the guy is "too lazy" to overtake in the right Lane but actually you're the problem as you're too lazy to follow the road laws and always bear left.
p2079
aVJust sayin.
p2080
aVAlso, I hate middle Lane hoggers. 
p2081
aV&gt; Daily Mail.
p2082
aVSeriously?
p2083
aVWho buys this... thing?
p2084
aVThis.
p2085
aVI also wonder the same thing.
p2086
aV&gt; Daily Mail\u000a\u000aThe same people who make Fakt and Super Ekspres the best selling dailies in Poland.
p2087
aVExcept with different accents.
p2088
aVWork in a shop to help pay for uni.
p2089
aVOne thing I noticed is that the Polish love to pile up their money as far away from me as possible when making a purchase so I have to trot allll the way down to the end of the long counter!
p2090
aVBut when I do the same they make that confused Polish face and grunt till I put it in their hand?!
p2091
aVSeriously why?
p2092
aVThis is probably going to sound slightly offensive but I think many of these observations are to do with the area this person lives in and thus quality of schools, restaurants and class of people\u000ahe is hanging out with.
p2093
aVAs a South African who has lived in the UK for more than 6 years and has worked in educational psychology in the UK, I can honestly say that I've never come across many of the things he talks about.
p2094
aVFirstly, the UK has some of the top universities in the world and along with the US has a disproportionate number of top universities relative to it's population size.
p2095
aVIt goes hand in hand with this that it's schools can't be bad.
p2096
aVUnfortunately because the majority of people send their children to state schools the school you end up at depends on the area you live in.
p2097
aVSome schools in areas with high areas of immigrants fall sharply behind because the teachers are teaching children how to speak English while their contemporaries are moving ahead with other things.
p2098
aVWhat is great though is that all schools are independently assessed and ranked and so you can choose what area you live in based on how good the schools are.
p2099
aVSome inner city schools in poor areas have had so much investment from government and charities that they outperform schools in richer areas.
p2100
aVI use to work at one of these schools.
p2101
aVI've never heard anyone talk about their boiler unless the damn thing has unexpectedly broken but I'm sure this would be true of all people who own electrical appliances.
p2102
aVI've never seen dirty plates in a restaurant and I've never been into a place that offers vinegar with chips.
p2103
aVAlthough that is a traditional English thing it seems that in more upmarket areas it has died out.
p2104
aVWhat he says about cars, traffic and driving is largely me same as my experience.
p2105
aVOne other thing is that I find the Englishnto be amazingly unmaterialistic despite the eneonous wealth of many people.
p2106
aVIn many countries people spend a disproportionate amount of money on their cars.
p2107
aVIn South Africa someone with a house worth around £100k will spend £25k on a brand new BMW whereas in the UK people with £1 million houses will be happy driving around in a slightly worse for wear second-hand Volvo worth £12k. 
p2108
aVSomething that often gets left out in these sorts of discussions is World War II.
p2109
aVDuring the war, we had no easy way to replace anything, we were short on food, and the only way we were able to survive (and supply our troops fighting in Europe) was to make do with what we had.
p2110
aVThis culture of making do, and not *really* expecting things to get better, permeates the older generations in our society, many of whom were born into this environment (which persisted for years after the war).
p2111
aVWe're a tolerant people.
p2112
aVWe tolerate inferior products and services.
p2113
aVWe tolerate sub-standard food.
p2114
aVWe tolerate small homes and expensive energy, we tolerate *our consistently miserable climate*.
p2115
aVAnd so on.
p2116
aVBut - this seemingly miserable (but not *too* miserable) situation gives us a fairly unique character that I wouldn't trade for the world.
p2117
aVGreat post.
p2118
aVThings that struck me (an Englishman) returning from living in Thailand:\u000a\u000a1) Shoes in the house.
p2119
aVTake ya fuckin shoes off!
p2120
aVFilth from the street in my living quarters.
p2121
aVYuck!
p2122
aV2) Arse-wiping: The Thais are right.
p2123
aVBum gun over wadded tissue pressed into the anus any day.
p2124
aV3) Dining al fresco is basically impossible, the weather here being uniquely grey and damp.
p2125
aVGuess that's why we small talk about it all the time..\u000a\u000a4) Everything is so smooth.
p2126
aVI take your point about morons who don't know/don't care to help you out in shops, etc.
p2127
aVBut mostly, everything is where it should be, and services are reliable.
p2128
aV5) Agreed, we are the best drivers in the world.
p2129
aVThere ARE haughty, ornery pricks on the road (they are always older, white men with more money than me) but mostly the etiquette behind the wheel is in a league of its own, even amongst European nations.
p2130
aV6) We need to quit this Amercanised, watery frappatino "coffee" bullshit.
p2131
aVBuy a percolator; percolate.
p2132
aVThe Mediterranean way is the only way.
p2133
aV7) I actually think English kids are pretty intellectual.
p2134
aVI have been teaching English for a while in Britain to economic migrants from Spain, Italy, France, etc.
p2135
aVNot one of my students has been able to tell me how old the earth is.
p2136
aVNot one has been able to tell me why drugs are illegal.
p2137
aVNot one has been able to tell me who said "cogito ergo sum" nor what it means.
p2138
aVAnd these are all highly-qualified professionals - engineers, architects, chemists.
p2139
aVI find that strange.
p2140
aV8) That said, we English people are so propagandised.
p2141
aVWe have some education, but our political awareness is pretty low.
p2142
aVMy friends are aware that the queen is a nazi-sympathising vampire with 1/6 of the inhabitable land of planet earth in her possession.
p2143
aVBut most (older?
p2144
aV) people think she's "just a nice old lady".
p2145
aVFuck off.
p2146
aVShe's a thief and a parasite.
p2147
aVAnd Cameron.
p2148
aVCameron, Cameron...
p2149
aVHe's the kind of guy who takes Christmas seriously.
p2150
aVOkay.
p2151
aVNuff for now.
p2152
aV&gt; It's the XXI century\u000a\u000aWho still uses Roman numerals?!
p2153
aV;)
p2154
aVI have a shiny new and lovely condensing boiler!!!
p2155
aVI thought you should know :)
p2156
aVI can't comment on a lot of the things here, but as someone else mentioned, the education thing is very variable.
p2157
aVI went to state school in Cambridge through primary, secondary and sixth form and really enjoyed it every step of the way.
p2158
aVThere was the odd bad teacher, but in general all the staff were helpful and encouraging.
p2159
aVHowever one thing I have noted is that more recently younger kids and early teens are being given less and less freedom by schools and parents and their natural inquisitiveness is being stymied by overprotective parents and schools whose only motivation is to get good grades (as they rely on them for funding).
p2160
aVRegarding point 6:\u000a\u000aNever move to the right lane (in left-driving countries, vice-versa for right-driving) to allow someone to pass.
p2161
aVYou might think you're being a nice guy, but you're doing more harm than good.
p2162
aVOnly move into a faster (righter) lane in order to pass someone in a slower (lefter) lane.
p2163
aVStick to these rules or watch as your roads begin to resemble American roads.
p2164
aVYou don't want that.
p2165
aVBeing from Kent myself, I feel the need to ask, what kind of trains have you been going on?
p2166
aVLast time I traveled Southeastern they provided probably the worst service in the country!
p2167
aVConstant delays, outdated trains, filthy stations.
p2168
aVGenerally terrible all round.
p2169
aVAmerican here who's spent about two months in Yorkshire.
p2170
aVOne thing I can say that the UK does better than anywhere else I've been is MEAT.
p2171
aVYou guys live in meat heaven... with reasonably-priced access to high-quality meats of about any animal you want.
p2172
aVLamb, Beef, Pork, Cod, Prawns, Crab...
p2173
aVThank you England for doing meat right. 
p2174
aVthats just yorkshire really, everyone here is either a farmer, a butcher, a butchers son, or a farmers son.
p2175
aV[deleted]
p2176
aVThat's my tactic.
p2177
aVMy father would pull the e-brake (brake lights stay off) and hope they rear ended him, or at least had a heart attack. 
p2178
aVYour father sounds like an idiot.
p2179
aVIt was the 80's.
p2180
aVWe were young and the world was our oyster.
p2181
aVHe got better. 
p2182
aV6. if you're passing/driving faster than the lorry in the left lane, then you should continue to do that in the middle lane, and ignore the arsehole behind you, and let him overtake you in the right hand lane.
p2183
aVI believe he was saying he sits in the middle lane regardless of what is in the left lane
p2184
aVNope, left lane moves slower.
p2185
aVI added an update to my original post to clarify.
p2186
aVAh the M25, why didn't you say so?
p2187
aVAnything goes on that road mate haha
p2188
aVIf that's the case then he should pull over!
p2189
aVWhat do you mean?
p2190
aVIf you're correct and he sits in the middle lane when there is nothing ahead in the left lane, then when the arsehole comes behind him flashing his lights he should move into the left lane!
p2191
aVAre you saying the guy behind him should illegally undertake if the guy in the middle lane wont move back over?
p2192
aVno the polish guy should move into the left lane
p2193
aVYeah he should, thats what im saying lol\u000aIm always flashing middle lane hoggers im not trying to be a dick but i drive a lorry and im banned from using the outside most lane and its illegal to undertake so you get a lot of people who drive lazy in the middle lane, some move over but a lot of others are busy texting or making a phonecall and their speed is dangerously inconsistent!
p2194
aVI just wanna get to my drop in good time, time is money and i got bills to pay :)
p2195
aV&gt; Banks.
p2196
aVTo open a current account was way too tricky\u000a\u000aYeah.
p2197
aVOstensibly about money-laundering.
p2198
aVI don't understand it either.
p2199
aV&gt; Banks again.
p2200
aVDirect debits?
p2201
aVFees for no funds available?
p2202
aVBanks are greedy, they apply fees for everything until they get told it's illegal.
p2203
aVThen they apply more.
p2204
aVThere shouldn't be fees for standing orders.
p2205
aVDirect debits are different, they represent an outside contract, you're expected to not sign up for one that you can't afford.
p2206
aVThey're required to inform you well in advance of any change to the amount they're billing you.
p2207
aV&gt; Cheques.
p2208
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p2209
aVIt's XXI century.
p2210
aVNobody.
p2211
aVI haven't used one in years.
p2212
aV&gt; Ill people at work.
p2213
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak\u000a\u000aPeople are selfish, they think their sick days are more important.
p2214
aV&gt; Tea with milk and chips with vinegar.
p2215
aV\u2026 I guess I'm assimilated by now.
p2216
aVYep, assimilated.
p2217
aV&gt; "Do not hog the right/middle lane".
p2218
aVOK.
p2219
aVI get it.
p2220
aVBut consider that: I'm going on the middle lane, exactly at the speed limit with cruise control set\u000a\u000aThe lanes in the UK are for overtaking.
p2221
aVIf there are three lanes then two people can be overtaking at once.
p2222
aVYou should be in the inside lane unless actively passing a car.
p2223
aVAlso, other people are selfish assholes.
p2224
aVSee above.
p2225
aV&gt; Parking.
p2226
aVI love British parking!
p2227
aVAlthough it's strange that you just leave cars on the road\u000a\u000aOur garages are full of crap.
p2228
aV&gt; No, I won't be mentioning double taps.
p2229
aVThis horse has been beaten to a pulp.
p2230
aVNeigh.
p2231
aV&gt; But I'll mention the mess people make.
p2232
aVWTF?
p2233
aVI've once seen three guys in suits in a tube, around 8pm, eating (in a very messy way) some McDonalds meals.
p2234
aVAnd they left all the packaging on the seats when leaving the tube.
p2235
aVThese people hate being told off.
p2236
aVTell them off.
p2237
aV&gt; Incompetence in services\u000a\u000aYeah, true.
p2238
aVPatronise the places that are competent, it'll encourage them.
p2239
aV&gt; Insure EVERYTHING.
p2240
aVHere: car, house, house content, tenant's insurance, professional indemnity, bicycle, animals (small), animals (large, I have a horse), animal's third party insurance, dental\u000a\u000ahouse contents and tenant's are usually the same thing.
p2241
aVTenant's is for the contents you don't own.
p2242
aVProf. Indemnity is a very specific thing for people running a business.
p2243
aVThe rest are very much optional, work out if you'd like the peace of mind, but it's *unusual*\u000a\u000a&gt; I love: train services in my area, always on time and well connected.
p2244
aVI hate: train tickets price.
p2245
aVWTF, I know someone who spends over 1/3 of his salary just to get to work for a month!
p2246
aVDue to botched nationalisation.
p2247
aVPisses us all off too.
p2248
aV&gt; Daily Mail.
p2249
aVSeriously?
p2250
aVWho buys this... thing?
p2251
aVIt's the world's most popular news source.
p2252
aVFucking idiots.
p2253
aV&gt; David Cameron.
p2254
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p2255
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p2256
aVHe's nowhere near the worst.
p2257
aV&gt; Education.
p2258
aVI admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy.
p2259
aVOr wasn't.
p2260
aVUntil he came here.
p2261
aVSounds like he needs a better school.
p2262
aV:(\u000a\u000a&gt; Self-service cash registers.
p2263
aVI love them.
p2264
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p2265
aVWe dislike people that go always by the book.
p2266
aVIt makes them sound like robots.
p2267
aVA bit of humour and flexibility goes a long way with the British.
p2268
aVMachines can't provide that, so are useful only when we're not feeling social.
p2269
aV&gt; Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code\u000a\u000aLook at the bikes and the taxis.
p2270
aV&gt; Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing\u000a\u000aSour cream is available in most small shops, although probably not newsagents.
p2271
aV&gt; Boilers seem to be a centerpiece of every home\u000a\u000aI only hear this from my parents, nobody else.
p2272
aV&gt; Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p2273
aVBecause people are fucking mad.
p2274
aVI enjoyed your post.
p2275
aVI've been living in the UK for the last 8 year and I can relate to these quirks you have pointed out.
p2276
aV1: Correct me, if I am wrong, but I believe the reason why it is hard(er) to open an account int the UK is due to people who try to beat the system.
p2277
aVExample:Person lands in the UK, opens 5 bank accounts with £1000 overdraft, buys stuff with that money and leaves the next day.
p2278

aV15: I have been through Lithuanian education, completed School, College and University in the UK.
p2288
aVAt first I thought, oh great no homework at school.
p2289
aVHow cool is that.
p2290
aVCollege, what?
p2291
aVYou want me to do homework.
p2292
aVUniversity - give me more homework.
p2293
aVI can relate to your stepson.
p2294
aVI was an average student in LT.
p2295
aVIn the UK I have the highest level degree in Computer Science.
p2296
aVWTF?
p2297
aVI could go on and on about education side.
p2298
aVI feel the same as you - I love living in the UK too.
p2299
aVAnd yes service may be worse in other parts off the island, but its the people that make the difference.
p2300
aVI mean if I can walk down a street and people smile at you and you smile at them (not in a creepy way), walk into any shop - people are polite smiling, if someone bumps into me, they apologise with a smile and life moves on.
p2301
aVI can categorically say that I have not met a rude/unhelpful person (apart form call center adviser) yet.
p2302
aVAll the best.

aVWhat shop lets you take a hand-scanner round?
p2307
aVI've never seen those.
p2308
aVTesco has them in the Metro ones in London.
p2309
aVI've never got them to work properly, even when the nice lady came around the shop with me to help out.
p2310
aV&gt;What shop lets you take a hand-scanner round?
p2311
aVI've never seen those.
p2312
aVSafeway used to have them.... Don't know if Morrison's took up the baton when they bought them out.
p2313
aVTesco and Waitrose that I know of although not every branch.
p2314
aVOur local Sainsburys has a huge rack of them at the front door.
p2315
aVNever used them of course.
p2316
aVI assume you have to apply and submit to some intensive scrutiny to make sure you're not the type of oiky person who's going to put unscanned stuff in their trolley.
p2317
aVNope, you just agree to T&amp;C on the first use, and then you can be randomly checked every few times you shop.
p2318
aVThe random check is also random, meaning that they just compare five random items from the cart with the contents of your bill.
p2319
aVQuick and easy, you can pack everything into the bags as you shop, in a way that makes sense for you, then you just pay and go to your car.
p2320
aVWhen you put it back, they usually take a handful of items to check.
p2321
aVIf your lucky I'm sure you could probably get the odd free apple every now and then but are you really that bothered about 20p.
p2322
aVThere's a new Tesco somewhere in Lincolnshire that has them (about 15 minutes from the showground).
p2323
aVThey also have the new line of self service checkouts that are too amazing and complex to explain but they're amazing and I can't wait to see them in more stores.
p2324

aVThis sour milk you mention...is it like kefir or buttermilk?
p2328
aVWhat should I look for in Polish shops?
p2329
aVI'm a Dutch expat and I really miss my sour milk products.
p2330
aVLook for "zsiad\u0142e mleko".
p2331
aVIt's better than kefir.
p2332
aVHow much does it cost to board your horse in England?
p2333
aVDid you bring the horse with you from Poland or did you purchase it and England?
p2334
aVHow different is the horse scene in England versus Poland?
p2335
aVAt the current place where we keep one of our horses it's £650pcm.
p2336
aVFarrier, vet and supplements on top of that.
p2337
aVThen training with a coach and competitions.
p2338
aVCompared to that, I pay about £380pcm for the full board for my youngster in Poland which includes her being trained by a current Polish champion in Eventing.
p2339
aVSo it's much more expensive here.
p2340
aVBut the possibilities for training and competing are much better here - my fiancee feels that she knew nothing compared to what she learned here after 3.5 years.
p2341
aVAnd she has been riding in Poland for over 20 years.

aVTo open a current account was way too tricky.
p2345
aVOh yes.
p2346

aVDon't get me started...
p2353
aVRecently I was moving some money around between accounts and didn't realise I had a direct debit going out for a credit card payment the next day.
p2354
aVThe DD "bounced" and I was charged £12 by the card company and then £10 by the bank.
p2355
aVI made sure I immediately paid the money manually to the card company, before the day it was due, so it wasn't late or anything.
p2356
aV£22 of my money for an honest mistake and it cost the companies *absolutely nothing* - well the cost of an automatically generated letter, which certainly isn't close to that.

p2358
aVCheques.

p2363
aVParking.
p2364
aVI love British parking!
p2365
aVReally?
p2366
aVI have to wonder where you are that you actually like the parking situation.
p2367
aVHere in Kent it's a nightmare - there's hardly anywhere to park for free, even outside your own house a lot of the time - there are parking zones that you have to pay a yearly fee to get a permit for, to park outside your own front door!
p2368

p2387
aVAlmost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code.

aVOkay...seriously??
p2390
aVNow I must know where you live.
p2391
aVThe opposite is true around here, to be honest.\u000a\u000a

p2393
aVTonbridge area.

p2395
aVAnd averywhere it's fine compared to Poland.
p2396
aV&gt;Education.
p2397
aVI admit that, my stepson is not the brightest star in the galaxy.
p2398
aVOr wasn't.
p2399
aVUntil he came here.
p2400
aVFrom the worst student in his class, he stepped up to one the best in his year.
p2401
aVWhile knowing nothing.
p2402
aVI know, I've been testing his knowledge before his GCSEs.
p2403
aVThe kids here do not have to do anything.
p2404
aVThey have almost no requirements.
p2405
aVThey do not have to improve.
p2406
aVThey seem to have no concept of self-improvement at all!
p2407
aVA girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council.
p2408
aVSo, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14?
p2409
aVAnd if yes, is that intentional?
p2410
aVI was barely in the middle of my class of 30 back in Latvia, then shot up right to the top when my parents brought me over at age 10.
p2411
aVEnded up finishing with 10 A-A* GCSEs and 8 equivalents (BTEC, Nationals...).
p2412
aVI'd say that GCSEs were piss easy for me.
p2413
aVA-levels is where you start having to put in real effort, but I still finished top of the Sixth Form, and I am baffled by how many people struggle to achieve a pass at either level.
p2414
aVAnd yet, I wouldn't consider myself exceptionally smart.
p2415
aVI even think of myself as somewhat intellectually inferior to some of my friends with significantly worse results (Gs and Fs, and so on) than myself.
p2416
aVMore than anything, GCSE are a reflection on how effective your revision system and memory are, with a positive effect on your actual critical thinking/ wisdom if you put some thought into your work beyond memorising facts.
p2417
aVA-levels take some real effort and are actually challenging.
p2418
aVOne thing I would like to disagree with is the notion of "kids not having to do anything/ not having any homework" that is popular among Eastern European immigrant-parents.
p2419
aVI was fed this lie prior to coming to the UK, and much annoyed by it being repeated by my parents for years.
p2420
aVThere is a plenty of homework given to British schoolchildren, and although it may not be as intense as what I experienced as a school kid in Latvia, it is enough to give you enough self discipline and extra practice outside of lesson, if you choose to do it.
p2421
aVAnd put some effort in.
p2422
aVThe biggest difference between the two education systems I've experienced is that there is a bigger workload in Latvia, and you get serious consequences, mostly in the form of a parent giving you a beating.
p2423
aVI think the hogging the middle/right hand lane thing is only really a problem when traffic begins to build.
p2424
aVYou cannot undertake someone who is sat in the middle lane and therefore when there is more traffic it forces everyone (who obeys the law) to be bottlenecked into the right hand lane to legally overtake them.
p2425
aVThis is what can cause huge traffic jams because then people brake to change lanes and the person behind them then brakes harder and so and and so forth until the traffic comes to a stand still. 
p2426
aVWELCOME TO CAPITALISM IN THE WEST, where money is the only thing that matters, and all decisions are based mostly on emotions rather than logic, science and rational thought.
p2427
aVthe U.S. is quite similar in these regards.
p2428
aVI'm not British, but I had to laugh in irony when I read #9 after having experienced the harrowing journey between Prague and Krakow on a Polish train.
p2429
aV&gt;Almost no road police, no portable speed cameras that can be set up in any random place... and people generally drive nice, calm, and within the road code.
p2430
aVLove it.
p2431
aVPoland to the contrary: speed cameras EVERYWHERE, on top of that police catching people with portables in any random place (you meet them almost every day if you drive just a bit), and people driving like CRAZY: overspeeding by 50-100km/h, taking over on the corners, on double lines, doing three-lane slaloms around slower drivers, etc.
p2432
aVCan't understand how the driving works so well here with almost no enforcement.
p2433
aVAfter 3.5 years I'm now scared to drive in Poland.
p2434
aVI had a friend who was a driver, and he got assigned to deliver a package from Denmark to Poland.
p2435
aVWhen we entered Poland we were really surprised by the speed cameras.
p2436
aVThey were in every little road in small towns.
p2437
aVPOLAND EVEN HAVE SIGNS FOR THEM!
p2438
aV"In 100m we're going to test if you obey the traffic law or not.
p2439
aV" Like, how are you going to catch people speeding if you tell them that you're going to do so in 100m :D
p2440
aVMaybe the point is not to catch people speeding but to encourage them to drive at or below the limit!
p2441
aVThat could be.
p2442
aVUs danes wouldn't know about that since our government has a speed ticket budget to keep !
p2443
aV:D
p2444
aVYep, they actually introduced a law here that every stationary genuine speed camera (we also have some fake ones) has to be painted yellow to be clearly visible and have a warning sign a couple hundred meters before.
p2445
aVI really like it because the purpose of placing a speed camera shouldn't be more money to the government from speeding tickets but to actually reduce driving speed in certain spots like pedestrian crossing near school etc.
p2446
aVSour cream is near damn worshipped in this home.
p2447
aV&gt;  If I do not have money in my account, then do not send the bloody transfer, and let me handle that with my other provider.
p2448
aVYou're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances.
p2449
aVThose two statement seems conflicting.
p2450
aVIf you order them to send x amount of your money to person y, and it does that its following your orders.
p2451
aVIf you go under £0 because of that, then thats on you.
p2452
aVIf they refuse to and tell you they won't do it because you don't have money then sure thats *is* telling you what to do with your money.
p2453
aVIf you're not sure you will be able to afford setting to a direct debit, don't set up the direct debit.
p2454
aVAs a customer I would prefer the bank deny the transaction than to put it through and charge an extra fee.
p2455
aVI would too, but i don't think its right to complain that they don't in the same sentence as you complain about not wanting them control over your finances.
p2456
aVI guess we disagree over the meaning of controlling my finances.
p2457
aVIf I don't have the money to do something but try to anyway (because I'm an idiot and I do that occasionally) then loaning me money and charging me a fee for it is more controlling in my opinion than just saying "You don't know have the money to do that.
p2458
aV"  Instead of just saying no I'm now indebted to the bank.
p2459
aVPerhaps you should keep track of your finances better rather than relying on the bank to tell you when you don't have the money for something?
p2460
aVThe bank allow this to happen specifically to avoid exerting control over someones money, if you can't control your own spending you really can't expect someone youre not paying to do it for you.
p2461
aV&gt; Ill people at work\u000a\u000aPart of me thinks it's the stiff upper lip we take pride in.

aVTrust me I love Poland.

p2473
aV:)
p2474
aVHell, I got off at a small station just after Dorking, and the same there, you have to walk directly across both rail lines to get to the other platform, or leave the station.
p2475
aV(It's not a station, it's some vague attempt at a platform, a departure sign and a ticket machine, a couple of benches and nothing else, not a staff member or building to be seen.

p2482
aVMy A level maths books from the eighties taught much of the first year material of a mathematics degree.

aVBefore GCSEs, we used to have O-levels which were much more respectable and difficult.
p2484
aVOne thing you have not mentioned is our national religion: Health and Safety, more commonly known as 'elf n' safety.
p2485
aVLike any religion, it has good and bad aspects to it, and the extremists seem completely irrational, however, for me it is one of the most wonderfully British things.
p2486
aVLike you, I am an immigrant but I was raised here, and when I see my parents (who were raised in a different country) violate some of the most basic tenets of this religion, it makes me think "are you crazy!?".
p2487

aVBut the company had a no-pay-if-you're-ill policy so they couldn't afford to not come in to the office.
p2491
aVIt was shameful. 
p2492
aVSo what is the deal with boilers?
p2493
aVI live in a part of the US that has cold winters, really cold, not what passes for cold in the UK, but nobody talks about their furnaces much.
p2494
aVOr is this "boiler" some kind of tea making device?
p2495
aVWhat's a double tap?
p2496
aVBeing an American, a double tap is a specific technique used to fire two shots quickly with a handgun.
p2497
aVEdit: damn you Swype
p2498
aVExactly.
p2499
aVI'm American and have no idea what a double tap is nor a boiler.
p2500
aVBoiler isn't a furnace?
p2501
aVA heater?
p2502
aVI'm in California.
p2503
aVI have central heating air.
p2504
aVEverything runs off electricity and natural gas.
p2505
aVIs there some other way to do it?
p2506
aV'Faucets' are taps.
p2507
aVThere's a completely ridiculous, logically indefensible thing you find with some taps in the UK: they have [separate hot and cold taps](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=uk+separate+taps&amp;safe=off&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zcv7U_KvGqTN7Aa2hoH4AQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1099&amp;bih=806).
p2508
aVIt's barmy that *new* sinks are built this way.
p2509
aVI think your furnace = UK boiler.
p2510
aVYou can see how they work [here](http://www.britishgas.co.uk/products-and-services/boilers-and-central-heating/new-boilers/central-heating-and-boilers-explained/how-it-works.html).
p2511
aVSolar hot water here in PT, so no boiler talk for me I'm afraid.
p2512
aVI did a little research, this is exactly it, thanks.
p2513
aVSome places in the US do have separate hot and cold faucets, but it's highly unusual.
p2514
aVWhen I come across it and want to wash my hands, I plug the sink and rinse in the mixed water.
p2515
aV(the concept comes from when people used wash basins and were sparing about water use) \u000a\u000aBoilers are still fairly common here, but mostly in older homes and buildings.
p2516
aVRadiators for heat; it works well.
p2517
aVMore modern homes and buildings heat the air itself and force the heated air through the house, relying on both fans and convection to maintain a comfortable temperature.
p2518
aVThis can come from an electric heating element, or a flame from natural gas, propane, or heating oil. 
p2519
aVI've always washed my hands really quickly under the hot tap as it takes a while to go from cold to life threatening, moving to the cold tap when it crosses over into dangerous.
p2520
aVYou see steam boilers a lot in New York City - most older apartment buildings have them.
p2521
aVI don't know how it is done in other countries, but most houses in the UK have a central heating system consisting of a sealed set of pipes running through the property, branching off into metal radiators in each room.
p2522
aVThis is connected to a gas boiler that heats up the water flowing through the system.
p2523
aVThe boiler also provides hot water for the taps (faucets), showers, etc.
p2524
aVI don't know what double taps is referring to though.
p2525
aVSome properties have twin taps (hot &amp; cold), others have mixers.
p2526
aVIt varies.
p2527
aVSeperate faucets for hot and cold water, as opposed to a mixer type.
p2528
aVIt really makes no sense to have these in bathrooms- you have a choice between washing your hands in freezing cold or scalding hot water, or filling the whole basin. 
p2529
aVInterestingly enough, a technique developed by Fairbairne and Sykes, a pair of British policemen, probably more famous for [this](http://images.knifecenter.com/thumb/1500x1500/knifecenter/scorpion/images/SCTACTFSCnw.jpg).

p2549
aVI don't get that either and the banker couldn't really explain it.
p2550
aVHe admitted that it's probably just to make money (you can even pay them extra to have a service that warns you from them charging you, it's like they sell you protection from themselves...)\u000a\u000a4.
p2551
aVYes, people are really obsessed with face time here.
p2552
aVAnd you're not really allowed to lunch..?!
p2553
aVWhy do they how long I work and which hours as long as I do my job?
p2554
aVSometime I just sit around to look busy even though I could go home because I'm done with everything.
p2555
aVIt's like an incentive to work slowly...\u000a\u000a5.
p2556
aVChips are like a minefield to me.
p2557
aVSome weird combinations are surprisingly good while others are just terrible and it really takes a long time to get to know all of them.
p2558
aV8.
p2559
aVI think it's impossible to understand as a foreigner...\u000a\u000a9.
p2560
aVYes, the same is true in the streets in London.
p2561
aVThere are garbage bags everywhere, it really looks like a third world country some time.
p2562
aVI think it's a cultural thing.
p2563
aVNobody really care about the public space.
p2564
aVAlso a lot of houses don't look nice from the outside but are very nice inside.
p2565
aV10.
p2566
aVI agree, the average service person is quite incompetent and especially VERY slow.
p2567
aVAgain, it took me 20 min to book an appointment at the bank...
p2568
aV&gt; Yes, the same is true in the streets in London.
p2569
aVThere are garbage bags everywhere, it really looks like a third world country some time.
p2570
aVHalf the population of London is from the third world.  \u000a\u000a
p2571
aVRant posts are the best sometimes.
p2572
aVOn the subject of cheques, large sums and especially companies use cheques as it gives them more days credit, normal consumers don't use them but companies will. 
p2573
aVHaving recently visited and driven in England for the first time, I can confirm that while the narrow roads make driving and parking a challenge, the drivers there were all very courteous.
p2574
aVIt made the whole experience harrowing, but surprisingly pleasant.
p2575
aV&gt; 8\u005c.
p2576
aVNo, I won't be mentioning double taps.
p2577
aVThis horse has been beaten to a pulp.
p2578
aV[Shot to death, surely.
p2579
aV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_tap)
p2580
aVI have to admit I read your choice of words and expected [this instead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvj0i1PN-Pw)
p2581
aVHeh.
p2582
aVAnd though we may laugh, that's not so far from [something that actually happened.
p2583
aV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxStG3b76sE&amp;t=1m38s)
p2584
aV&gt; Can't understand how the driving works so well here with almost no enforcement.
p2585
aVResearch shows that driving enforcement has little to do with how well people drive.
p2586
aVIf anything, excessive enforcement reinforces the idea in peoples minds they are expected to cheat they system. 
p2587
aVRe: #20...
p2588
aVI'm from Detroit and I think we can claim responsibility for that one... Why bother programming two different equations?
p2589
aVLo siento, amigo/as.  
p2590
aVYou're aware that the imperial units are a British thing the USA adopted rather than the other way around, right?
p2591
aVOh, I know.
p2592
aVI just thought we were the only ones stubborn enough to keep using it... =)
p2593
aVBut American gallons are smaller than Imperial gallons.  
p2594
aV[deleted]
p2595
aVThank you :)
p2596
aV1.
p2597
aVThis is part of the British obsession with bureaucracy.
p2598
aVWe tend to design business processes to cross every possibility, even ones that are stupid.
p2599
aVAlso, businesses like to have as much information as possible on who they are dealing with, and the British as a people really don't give a flying fuck about their privacy or their rights- 'I have nothing to hide' is a common sentiment here.
p2600
aV2.
p2601
aVBanks can charge you when this happens, so they let it happen.
p2602
aVWhy?
p2603
aVBecause fuck you.
p2604
aV3.
p2605
aVOlder British citizens still use them as, I believe, do businesses.
p2606
aVThat said yeah, they really are totally unneeded in today's world.
p2607
aVHowever the British tend to be loathe to let go of anything in favour of something new if it's been around for a while.
p2608
aVThis is also visible in many other areas of our culture and the way that we do business.
p2609
aVWe are quite retrospective as a society.
p2610
aV4.
p2611
aVOh god this one.
p2612
aVThe British have the most fucked up set of work ethics.
p2613
aVIn essence, if you're off sick you're deemed to be 'less of a worker'.
p2614
aVIt's seen as a badge of honour to fight through your sickness and deliver a day's work anyway.
p2615
aVPeople who don't do the same are lesser workers.
p2616
aVNever mind if you fucked up the simplest tasks because you couldn't think straight or if you infected the entire office- you made the effort and came to work.
p2617
aVWell done.
p2618
aVThat guy who stayed home with the highly infectious flu?
p2619
aVFucking freeloader.
p2620
aV5.
p2621
aVSalt and vinegar on chips is flawless.
p2622
aVI don't drink that much tea (which makes me a freak among the British), but I do drink herbal teas, mainly to try and help me sleep.
p2623
aVThey don't need milk.
p2624
aVI take my coffee black though.
p2625
aV6.
p2626
aVThis one's been done to death, but yeah- don't hog the middle lane.
p2627
aVYou fuck up the traffic flow.
p2628
aV7.
p2629
aVAs a people we tend to polite to those we can see.
p2630
aVNot so much to those we can't.
p2631
aVSo when you're parking and make eye contact with people, decorum tends to take over.
p2632
aVIn parking you make eye contact.
p2633
aVExcept when you don't.
p2634
aVSeriously, you'll notice that people tend to 'steal spaces' and such far more often when you can't see their face.
p2635
aV8.
p2636
aVWe are finally catching up on the plumbing.
p2637
aVMost new bathrooms have single taps.
p2638
aV9.
p2639
aVYeah this is pretty common among a certain type of person.
p2640
aVTypically they're yuppies, but you get cocks in any walk of life.
p2641
aVThe psychology is 'if I'm somewhere else, it's someone else's job to clean it up'.
p2642
aVIt's like people who leave shit on the floor at the station because 'it's the cleaner's job to sort it'.
p2643
aVNo, it's the cleaning staff's job to handle daily wear and tear.
p2644
aVThat said many stations don't have bins anymore because it's too easy to put bombs in them.
p2645
aVSo in many cases you're ENCOURAGED to litter.
p2646
aV10.
p2647
aVGet used to it.
p2648
aVThe British have a shit way of doing things.
p2649
aVI spent 6 months arguing with British gas about a bill I didn't owe and have just spent another three arguing with Scottish power about the same thing.
p2650
aVI work for an outsourcing provider and our service quality is terrible.
p2651
aVBritish management is terrible management.
p2652
aVThey don't have the analytical minds associated with German business, or the charisma and confidence associated with Americans.
p2653
aVThey don't have the loyalty of the Japanese, or the hard work of the Chinese.
p2654
aVBritish management is a fucking disgrace, and it's a shame because the average British worker while they have some screwed up priorities (see sick leave) are generally dedicated and well meaning.
p2655
aVBut without decent managers employees can only do so much.
p2656
aV11.
p2657
aVInsurance is easy money when the British are generally happy to disclose almost anything on an application form.
p2658
aV12.
p2659
aVThis is a huge national problem and is only going to get worse.
p2660
aVOur method of privatization just hasn't worked.
p2661
aVAt all.
p2662
aVTaxpayers still subsidize the services a lot and service users still pay stupid prices.
p2663
aVIt seriously needs to be overhauled.
p2664
aV13.
p2665
aVToo many people.
p2666
aVThe average Brit is right wing.
p2667
aVThey often talk like they are left wing and hold left wing values in many parts of their psyche, but certain triggers just turn us into Fox news anchors.
p2668
aVThe Daily Heil has learned to capitalize on that.
p2669
aV14.
p2670
aVWe haven't had a genuinely good leader in a while.
p2671
aVTony Blair was a good politician, but his abilities as a leader (not to mention certain high profile decisions) are highly questionable.
p2672
aVThe current crop are just complete shits.
p2673
aV15.
p2674
aVOur education system is a favoured whipping boy.
p2675
aVHigh pass year?
p2676
aVExams too easy.
p2677
aVLow pass year?
p2678
aVChildren too stupid.
p2679
aVThe real issue is that many children are not taught a subject, but how to pass an exam on that subject.
p2680
aVActual proper education doesn't really start until University.
p2681
aVSadly the right wing element that is so common in Britain favours rote learning and rigid academia.
p2682
aVAs such this isn't going to change soon.
p2683
aV16.
p2684
aVSee Cheques.
p2685
aVPeople don't like new stuff here.
p2686
aVThat and there's also this other peculiar element of the British psyche that helps explain a lot of your observations.
p2687
aVIn essence, a British person would rather spend 10 minutes actively working on a task, than spend 3 minutes doing nothing, followed by 2 minutes of work, in order to achieve the same task.
p2688
aVBasically, we prefer to maintain constant activity rather than do something in a way that would require sitting around.
p2689
aVIn work, this means people tend to favour manually sorting and fucking around with spread sheets than using an automated system to get the same result.
p2690
aVWhen something goes wrong at an automated till, you wait 30 seconds to a minute for someone to help.
p2691
aVThat time is seem as wasted, even though accounting for that time you're still probably ahead of a regular till.
p2692
aVIt's a serious problem with our culture and I feel it holds many people back from realizing their potential.
p2693
aV17.
p2694
aVDangerous driving isn't polite.
p2695
aVThat said you will encounter nutters quite often.
p2696
aVCountry roads are filled with people who assume there's no one around and large cities have their petrol heads.
p2697
aV18.
p2698
aVWhat?
p2699
aV19.
p2700
aVNever encountered this.
p2701
aVAre you living in Worcester?
p2702
aV20.
p2703
aVWe didn't fully convert to metric for reasons I have already outlined.
p2704
aVAnd lots of other reasons of debatable veracity too.\u000a
p2705
aVHaha, I loved reading this.
p2706
aVAgree with many of the points, but I have so much more than you!
p2707
aVAnd I was born there.. You'd think I'd be used to them.
p2708
aVMy biggest gripe about England has got to be the drinking culture.
p2709
aVPut that in the bin, and England stands to gain everything.
p2710
aVWhat is double taps?
p2711
aV?
aVOne hot tap, one cold tap.
p2712
aVFor people who like scalding one hand while freezing the other.
p2713
aVA relic of a past era when people would use the plug to mix some water to wash in.
p2714
aVI read that whole post in a polish accet.
p2715
aV10/10 would read again.
p2716
aVNumber 2 really shocked me--that is, I was shocked that anyplace in the world doesn't do those things.
p2717
aVI live in America, and bank fees are just a fact of life--I seriously never considered that anyplace might not have them.
p2718
aVWhat the hell is a double tap?
p2719
aVAnd why the hell would anyone want sour milk?
p2720
aVThat's when you know it's time to dump it out.
p2721
aVI can't vouch for the UK, but in the US, if you  take three days off sick, you'd damn well better have a doctor's note and enough sick leave to cover it.
p2722
aVPeople work sick because to do otherwise is a severe risk of becoming unemployed.
p2723
aVIt sucks, but it happens all the time.
p2724
aVThose portable shopping scanners sound awesome.
p2725
aVMaybe in twenty more years, we'll have them.
p2726
aVAnd one more:  I feel your pain as to the education.
p2727
aVI have no idea what I will do if my kids ever become unmotivated the way you describe...I'll be completely in over my head, because school systems here, like the ones you're describing, mostly don't give a shit.
p2728
aVIt wasn't always this way--I remember it being otherwise when I was in school--but I was truly stunned when my kids started school a few years ago.
p2729
aVThings have really gone downhill.
p2730
aVDouble tap\u000aIn most of bathrooms in uk you have one tap with hot and another one with cold water.
p2731
aVSour milk.
p2732
aVPasteurized(or UHT) milk is getting spoiled(stinky, disgusting and bitter taste, not drinkable at all).
p2733
aVWhen you will take raw milk mostly it will became sour and more dense, which some people including me likes it a lot, its popular in eastern europe.
p2734
aVIts similar as yogurt in taste, consistence, but more sour.
p2735
aVJust different microorganism are participating during fermentation.
p2736
aVAh, okay.
p2737
aVMakes sense (the sour milk, that is).
p2738
aVAs for the double tap, hmm, interesting...here, you usually have just one faucet, with two knobs.
p2739
aVNot sure if that's what you're describing, or if you mean a single knob (which is how many showers operate here).
p2740
aVTwo separated faucets - one for hot water another one for cold one.
p2741
aVI was just few days in uk and I still didnt found a way to wash hands in medium hot water.
p2742
aVYeah, that was my thought, too.
p2743
aVThe entire purpose in having a single tap with two lines coming in, is to be able to control the water temperature.
p2744
aVAnd I suppose I could get used to this--but what if the plumber accidentally sets the hot water temp too high?
p2745
aVThird-degree burns?
p2746
aV&gt; And why the hell would anyone want sour milk?
p2747
aVThat's when you know it's time to dump it out.
p2748
aVNot if it's done properly.
p2749
aVThen it's [delicious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soured_milk).
p2750
aVBut you won't get UHT milk to do that :|
p2751
aVAs a 20-year expatriate about to move back to the UK, this helped, thanks :)
p2752
aVDid you get the licensing (tax) for your TV yet? 
p2753
aVDon't have a TV, so I can skip that one :-)
p2754
aVI can't say I've noticed people being messy on the underground in general other than leaving their newspapers behind but obviously you'll always get someone who seems to think he can leave his rubbish wheverever he chooses.
p2755
aVIt's certainly not the accepted norm though.
p2756
aVI will say, however, that I've regularly seen Easter European/Russian guys on the underground drinking beer/spirits.
p2757
aVThis is one thing that grinds my gears.
p2758
aVIf it was a one-off that'd be fine but it's quite a regular observation.
p2759
aVI guess I'm more aware of this as I often travel with my daughter on the underground.
p2760
aVExplain the parking?
p2761
aVYou mean you can park anywhere without a ticket?
p2762
aVIt's like that in America.
p2763
aVYou can't just park anywhere you want, but in most places you can park on the street.
p2764
aVIn downtown areas you usually have to pay, but free street parking is very common outside of large cities.
p2765
aVWhere is that not common?
p2766
aVAs a one-time resident in the UK:\u000a\u000a4) Was always amazed by this as well.
p2767
aVIt's really different in this respect from Eastern Europe.
p2768
aVMaybe it's the legacy of Protestant discipline, or something?
p2769
aV5) Always liked tea with milk.
p2770
aVChips with vinegar are still a thanks but no thanks kind of thing.
p2771
aV6) Have found the British to be some of the best (i.e.
p2772
aVleast impudent) drivers.
p2773
aV10) True dat.
p2774
aV13) I like The Daily Mail, I consider it to be the authentic voice of the British people.
p2775
aVThey have really developed the art of clickbait into something approaching a science.
p2776
aVRead The Economist to understand the elites; read The Daily Mail to understand the people.
p2777
aV15) Education:\u000a\u000a&gt; A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council.
p2778
aVSo, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14?
p2779
aVAnd if yes, is that intentional?
p2780
aVHow does the relative ranking of your Polish school compare with that of your son's British school?
p2781
aVBecause that's quite important.
p2782
aVI know East Europeans like to wax all superior about their school systems relative to the Brits or the Americans (I would know, being Russian) but for some reason it isn't getting translated into more productive workers or more innovative scientists.
p2783
aVI suspect a large part of it is accidentally comparing higher than average or merely average schools in their home countries with below average British schools.
p2784
aV18) Yes there's a whole range of East European stuff that's either unavailable or hard to find in the UK.
p2785
aVPersonally, my biggest bugbear is perhaps one of the most basic: These huge, shitty, overly watery cucumbers they have in the UK:\u000a\u000ahttp://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/27/article-1391526-0C4B00E100000578-11_468x286.jpg\u000a\u000aAs opposed to normal cucumbers:\u000a\u000ahttp://pngimg.com/upload/cucumber_PNG2049.png\u000a\u000aIt's also really bad for fermented products in general, which are only available in the more upscale places.\u000a\u000a
p2786
aVThe Daily Mail is NOT the voice of the British people.
p2787
aVIt is a pretty foul newspaper. 
p2788
aV"I like The Daily Mail, I consider it to be the authentic voice of the British people"\u000a\u000aNo, hell no.
p2789
aVThe Daily Mail is the voice of a small, typically small minded, minority.
p2790
aVThere are a hell of a lot of people who hate that paper, it is not the voice of the British people.
p2791
aVDavid Cameron is in power, so I suspect it is.
p2792
aVSour Milk?
p2793
aVConfused American!
p2794
aVIt's not the bacteria free milk that you kept out of the frigde for a year, next to your radiator - sour milk.
p2795
aVIt's the healthier, real milk, that goes through natural process thanks to all the positive bacteria that are usually removed, in order to let the milk have a longer expiration date and to be able to stay open in your refrigerator for many days instead of like 24-48  hours.
p2796
aVAlso, fresh milk does not have a year long expiration date.
p2797
aVYou drink it.
p2798
aVIt's mostly used as breakfast item, like you do with orange juice - we do it with sour milk and other similar items (like the ones made from butter), but it's great at any part of the day, or a fantastic cure for hangover.
p2799
aVIt taste much more like yogurt than spoiled milk that you may know.
p2800
aVMy friend spent a lot of time in the US, and she told me that you don't have the same yogurt culture as in most of Europe.
p2801
aVYour yogurt selections are terrible, and the quality is very low.
p2802
aVIt only changed recently to be a bit better, but I would guess that most americans don't even know the taste of a good quality yogurt and other diary items like sour cream, sour milk etc.
p2803
aVAlso, sour milk and cream are generally disliked.
p2804
aVFor the americans, the concept of putting sour cream on boiled potatos at lunch is horrible, but here in Poland it's almost a tradition and anybody would probably tell you it tastes great.
p2805
aVFor us, (not the present generation of kids), eating "crisps" as a potato substitute (as seen on american tv) for your lunch is just a travesty. 
p2806
aVUgh I've been out the country so long I assumed chips meant crisps and thought we'dcome full circle back to grandma times
p2807
aVLong haired carpets in the bathrooms.
p2808
aVDrafty windows and heaters going full blast (the British don't believe in double glazing - no, really, they *don't believe it.
p2809
aV*)\u000a\u000aThe Imperial System - nuff said.
p2810
aVElectric heating.
p2811
aVNot just in woodland cabins and caravans, but in fairly modern housing.
p2812
aV[deleted]
p2813
aVOh yeah, the British often run their water pipes on the outside of houses.
p2814
aVI suspect that stems from the same refusal to accept winter.
p2815
aVCreates a continual trade for plumbers, too.
p2816
aVWhat on earth do you want sour milk for?
p2817
aVSounds gross!
p2818
aVBecause it's delicious and healthy.
p2819
aVIt's a part of your complete breakfast, a quick meal when you are at work, a snack, a dietary solution and a great cure for hangover. 
p2820
aVThere's your problems with haircuts lad, your sending him to the hairdressers men go to barbers.
p2821
aVHmm, in Poland they are mostly unisex and if not - it's clearly marked.
p2822
aVSo maybe this one is a case of wrong expectations.
p2823
aVNever trust a Judy to cut your hair.
p2824
aVIn the U.S. depending on the culture of your particular work place, you very well may be expected to work when sick and even get in trouble if you are sick more than a few days a year.
p2825
aVI called out because of the flu back during "the Swine Flu" days.
p2826
aVI was informed that I would need to provide a doctors note or I would face disiplinary action.
p2827
aVThis was not related to anything on my part but moreover a general paranoid suspicion by my employer that thier employees were taking advantage of the swine flue scare.
p2828
aVSo I went to the doctor and waited for 2 hours and when a doctor finaly came to see me she was very angry "Why are you hear?
p2829
aV" asked very agrily.
p2830
aVI replied "I believe I have the flu.
p2831
aV"  and she said "but why the hell did you come here?
p2832
aVyou need to stay home.
p2833
aV"  I said "my employer told me I need a doctors note"  and she said "no you don't.
p2834
aVThey can't tell you that it is illegal.
p2835
aVIf you have the flu, stay home!!!!
p2836
aV"  Americans ~~often like to pretend we~~ have no weakness.  
p2837
aVPoland is fucking mental compared to the UK.
p2838
aVBeautiful, but mental.
p2839
aVWe're just quirky.  
p2840
aV1: US does this too\u000a\u000a2: US does this too.
p2841
aVIt helps them get money, and the bank owners become rich.
p2842
aVIt's not really for your benefit\u000a\u000a3: I don't know, a lot of places seem to require checks (US again... since that's my only source of knowledge) or stuff that is not cash, so that it has a lower chance of being counterfeit or something.
p2843
aV4: You only get a set amount of "sick" days.
p2844
aVA lot of people literally cannot afford to go over the amount of days they are allowed to be sick, or, in severe cases, can be fired simply for being sick too often even if they don't go over.
p2845
aVWhy?
p2846
aVBecause they are costing the company money for being absent.
p2847
aVI am not sure how this translates to Britain though, because the state I'm in has job laws that allow either you or your employer to terminate your employment at ANY time.
p2848
aVOthers force a notice of two weeks.
p2849
aV5: I don't know, this is British people being all British or something.
p2850
aVAlso at first I thought you meant "crisps" because we call them chips, with vinegar, and I was going to comment on how delicious they are.
p2851
aVI could see your version of chips being okay tasting too.
p2852
aV6: Middle/right lane are for faster travelers if I recall.
p2853
aVIt's common courtesy to let the guys who think they need to get somewhere in a hurry go in those lanes, and if you're driving slower to be in the leftmost lane (rightmost if in America or... Australia.
p2854
aVmaybe Canada too...
p2855
aVI think) Also what you described is called a "Douchebag", "Douchecanoe" "Wanker" or "Ass/arsehole".
p2856
aVSorry you come across so many of them.
p2857
aV7: If you visit America you'll find a lot of the same practices from Poland, it seems.
p2858
aVOnly specific areas you're allowed to park on the street for free, and it is not always calm.
p2859
aV8: I'm not following this one, sorry.
p2860
aV(I don't know what you're "on about".
p2861
aV)\u000a\u000a9: People who wear suits for a living are usually the most disgusting of us all.
p2862
aVThey're entitled assholes who treat everything and everyone else as if they are inferior (typically) even if subconsciously.
p2863
aVWelcome to the first world.
p2864
aV10: What the fuck?
p2865
aV....
p2866
aVOkay either you're going very cheap, or something is very wrong.
p2867
aVI don't know what's going on here, but that sucks.
p2868
aV11: In America we are pretty much forced to insure now, seriously...
p2869
aVIt's law.
p2870
aVHouse, Car, Health.
p2871
aVYou can have renter's insurance, phone insurance, bicycles, animals, life insurance, expensive item like tv's/computers.. Everyone wants to make money off you by promising money back if stuff fails, then making you go through hell to actually get some of the money you paid them already for said item.
p2872
aVYAY capitalism!
p2873
aV12: Trains...
p2874
aVTrains.. Oh those things that make my 50 mile commute take longer.
p2875
aVYeah, no.
p2876
aVI have no idea what riding on a train is like because my state is as large as the entire country you now reside in, and it would be woefully inefficient to set up proper mass transit to get from one side to another cheaply and effectively since our population density is far lower.
p2877
aV13: Is that a newspaper?
p2878
aVI have no idea.
p2879
aVThose aren't really circulated as much anymore.
p2880
aV14: Sorry, I don't keep up with politics.
p2881
aVIt just infuriates me, and I get enough of that from working in a call center.
p2882
aV15: Hit and miss here.
p2883
aVGeneral rule of thumb seems to be stay away from large cities with a reputation like milwaukee or detroit if you want to get a good education.
p2884
aVWhat you explain seems to be someone that tries to game the system for a free ride.
p2885
aVThey're not usually intelligent, and seem to think the world exists to support them.
p2886
aVIt can, kind of, but only barely.
p2887
aVThey'll be in crippling debt most likely for the remainder of their life if they stick to that plan.
p2888
aVOr at least that's what would happen here.
p2889
aV16: Technophobia.
p2890
aVOld people that have gradually seen technology rise around them are afraid of it, rather than embracing it, and prefer speaking with an actual person.
p2891
aVMaybe that or we are just sociopaths, since I do the same.
p2892
aV17: I think this has to do with how people are raised.
p2893
aVI assume it's similar where from a young age you are taught to look both ways, be kind or whatnot.. and the government likely advertises or supports driver safety in some way.
p2894
aVAlso I don't know how easy it is to find a very cheap car in Poland, but here it can be very very necessary (reminder: 50 mile commute, one way) so you want to take care of it because you can't afford not to.
p2895
aV18: It may be that I live in wisconsin, but we have a lot of sour cream things.
p2896
aVAlso cheese curds.
p2897
aVYou should try some :)\u000a\u000a19: boilers as in... machinery that heats water to make what comes out of the faucet/shower warm?
p2898
aVYou've got me, I can't imagine why it's so popular.
p2899
aV20: I apologize for the imperial measurement system, even though my country didn't start it, yours did.
p2900
aVWe didn't get the update though and forced it to stay 'popular'.\u000a\u000a
p2901
aVMy two pence as a duel national British American:\u000a1.
p2902
aVBanks are ridiculous.
p2903
aVDon't even get me started on things like mortgages, opening times, online accounts, over drafts.
p2904
aVRidiculous.
p2905
aV4.
p2906
aVIll people at work?
p2907
aVBritish people love complaining, if they stay at home then they can't voice their complaints to as many people!
p2908
aVI'd like to think that complaining also explains point 10 - we secretly enjoy a bad service so that we can moan about it.
p2909
aVMy girlfriend REGULARLY pays £50 for a haircut and ALWAYS complains that they didn't do it right but never says anything to them.
p2910
aVI got so fed up of having shit hair cuts that I started doing it myself and 9 times out of 10 I do a better job than they would!
p2911
aV5.
p2912
aVYou're wrong.
p2913
aVOn both counts.
p2914
aV11.
p2915
aVDon't insure everything.
p2916
aVEnsure your car and building and contents, then everything else is optional.
p2917
aVGetting a mortgage I had the bank trying to get me to buy life insurance for me and my partner teling me it was essential, but upon reading up I found out they just wanted the 25% commission from their chosen insurance company.
p2918
aVScumbags.
p2919
aVIronically, scumbags is also the answer to 13.
p2920
aV14.
p2921
aVWhy stop at DC?
p2922
aVName one politician who isn't a complete wanker, I dare you.
p2923
aV15.
p2924
aVIf you think the British system is bad, take a quick look at the US education system.
p2925
aVGoing from British to US and back to British I can happily say that British is far more advanced but there are some serious changes that need to be made.
p2926
aVHaving an actual teaching in charge of the gov's education department could be a good start... just saying.
p2927
aV17.
p2928
aVAre you serious?
p2929
aVIn London there are cameras ever 10meters.
p2930
aVIn Wales, we have lots of warning signs and no actual cameras though - swings and roundabouts.
p2931
aV20.
p2932
aVOur entire measuring system is flawed.
p2933
aVWe buy milk in pints but Pepsi in litres?
p2934
aVWe measure driving distance in miles but running in meters?
p2935
aVAnd let's not even get onto the subject of cooking... it just goes mental there.
p2936
aVGreat post, made me chuckle and think. 
p2937
aVAs a Brit I kinda agree with a lot of this, and there are some interesting surprises i just thought were "normal" but apparently aren't.
p2938
aVHowever the motorway thing, the rule is "Stay left unless overtaking" So you should always drive in the left most lane possible.
p2939
aVIf you're not actually overtaking anything, but still in the middle lane (speed is completely irrelivant) other drivers will get pissy.
p2940
aVIf you're actually passing something, no one will care that you're in the middle lane, but if that truck up ahead is like 100-200 yards away, but you're just staying in the middle lane to avoid having to change lane later, you're doing it wrong.
p2941
aVSure, they can just pass you, but eventually with so many cars sitting in the middle lane, to avoid changing lanes too much, creates conjestion.
p2942
aVThey actually made it a law recently i think, IIRC you can get points on your license and a fine for sitting in the middle lane when not overtaking.
p2943
aVYou speak better English than most English people.
p2944
aVConglaturation.
p2945
aVHogging the middle lane is standard in Poland, but I'm surprised you haven't learnt to do better over the years in UK.
p2946
aVAnd since overtaking in the outer lane is technically legal in Poland... that's usually the fastest lane as well (at least on 3+ lane roads around Warsaw).
p2947
aVTo chime in as a Kiwi, 4 years now:\u000a\u000aBanks - Agree with the debit thing.
p2948
aVNZ, commonly about 3-5 years behind on most things the US or UK will have (Internet Speeds, TV shows, Fashion, etc), has had EFT-POS for over 17 years (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale).
p2949
aVIt's instant, and declines if you have no money.
p2950
aVYou can also access up to 3 accounts from the one card.
p2951
aVUK, 1 card, 1 account, and it will then take between 2 hours and 5 days for the funds to be taken out.
p2952
aVThen you go into overdraft you didn't authorise.
p2953
aVThe account getting is worse than I think OP is letting on, and the same goes for Utility Bills and anything else.
p2954
aVTo get a bank account, they want a utility bill with your name on it.
p2955
aVThe get a utility bill with your name on it you need a bank account.
p2956
aVYou also need a job, typically.
p2957
aVMost work places won't put through you contract until they have all you bank details for HR and accounting.
p2958
aVTo get the account you need a signed letter saying you have a contract....\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy exactly do I have to remember my National Insurance number, and my NHS number?
p2959
aVThe only reason for the NI number is to contribute to the NHS.
p2960
aVOne number should cover both (again, I'm spoiled in NZ with a single ACC number)\u000a\u000aTransport - ok this one's very recent, and probably only for London - but if I have money I should be able to get on.
p2961
aVNow they are all card/Oyster card (travel card) only, but there are only top-up points at tube stations.
p2962
aVWell if I have to get a bus to get to the tube station...\u000a\u000aFood and Drink - Fish and Chips, why do they leave the skin on the fish, it's 15 seconds extra filleting, and you can eat the whole thing.
p2963
aVAlso, pints are served in pint glasses - so unless it's your drink you're buying and you sip it down a bit the moment you get it, you spill the first 2 mouthfuls carrying it away from the bar.
p2964
aVThis goes double for cider.
p2965
aVOther - Celsius when it's cold, Fahrenheit when it's hot?
p2966
aV(Ooh, it'll be down to -2 tomorrow... Oh but today it was in the nineties!).
p2967
aVI love this country and don't plan on going anywhere else at this stage in my life.
p2968
aVAnd the people are fantastic.
p2969
aVAll my little gripes I think could be traced back to some idiot in a very senior position not thinking something through fully before it's released to a whole nation/major city
p2970
aVI don't see farenheit used anywhere!
p2971
aVcelsius always!
p2972
aVMost of the points are fine, but I don't think I've ever seen the skin on fish left on, it's always battered fish in chip shops.
p2973
aVAlso Fahrenheit???
p2974
aVI don't know or remember a time Fahrenheit has ever been used by anyone here :s \u000a\u000aMy biggest gripe is the banks, we have to jump through so many hoops 
p2975
aVJust got my boiler fixed, only problem now is that I can only use the hot water tap for 5 seconds before I get 3rd degree burns. 
p2976
aVThis is amazing!
p2977
aVI lived in the UK for 3 years, in Edinburgh, as a student and in a homestay so most of this weren't things I was directly involved with, but man does this bring back memories.
p2978
aVDid you enjoy your time in Edinburgh, at least?
p2979
aVAs much as I like to nitpick, I enjoyed my time there a lot.
p2980
aVI was homesick (it was my first time living abroad) but whenever I got over it and decided to hang out in the city I had a blast.
p2981
aVOverall review:-\u000a\u000aCity: Awesome, with great public transportation and a preserved old heart.
p2982
aVWould recommend.
p2983
aVPeople: Mostly polite as you would expect.
p2984
aVA bit reserved and maybe with a shorter fuse, but break the ice and you are in for a treat!
p2985
aVIdiots exist though, like anywhere else in the world.
p2986
aVi dunno about the education point, considering out education system is second only to finland (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27314075) , but i do agree that students attitude can be changed a lot, being in a situation myself where i notice how unmotivated my peers are and how unmotivated i am, so it is food for thought
p2987
aVSome of this honestly surprises me, and I'M from the bloody UK.
p2988
aVI think were you live is a big part of it.
p2989
aVThe USA have their states, but this over-populated island has a different flavour with each city.
p2990
aVI loved this.
p2991
aVAs for the middle lane hogging thing- I agree with you.
p2992
aVIf you know you're going to constantly overtaking there's no need to move in.
p2993
aVOne thing that PISSES ME OFF is people taking the law into their own hands.
p2994
aVNo one has the right to tell you to move over- its not their fucking job. 
p2995
aVI enjoyed this post a lot, thanks for sharing. 
p2996
aVWait we have portable scanners in supermarkets?
p2997
aVTesco have them in some stores.
p2998
aVI remember them in Safeway a long time ago, too.
p2999
aVYour English is incredibly good for some one who has only been speaking it fir 3.5 years .
p3000
aVI was speaking it for much longer, this is a de facto standard language in IT.
p3001
aVThanks for the credit though :)
p3002
aVI agree with pretty much all these points as a born and raised Englishman.
p3003
aVEspecially Cheques.
p3004
aVCant stand the bloody things.
p3005
aVI do all my banking online apart from once or twice a year where my Nan still insists on sending her 29 year old grandson a £20 cheque for birthday/christmas.
p3006
aVI know I sound like an ungrateful shit but I'd prefer she didn't bother!
p3007
aVI feel like you just live in a shit part of the UK...?
p3008
aVWelcome to the West, where norm is maximum reward for minimal effort, because our "human rights" somehow means we don't need to earn our keep.
p3009
aVA lot of stuff about this country (and most westernised country) is designed to make as much profit for the company providing them with piecemeal benefits for the user.
p3010
aVOn the other hand, the people of Britain are a lovely bunch and the right cup of tea after a hard days work is to die for.
p3011
aVSo take the good with the bad I suppose, except here the good is really good and the bad really bends you over.
p3012
aVSome people are a real stickler for following the rules and get scared when they stray outside of it, which leads to anger and then things may start to get unreasonable.
p3013
aVAn example of this is middle lane hogging, where people think because they're going faster than the lorries that they shouldn't be in that lane because it's *effort* to change.
p3014
aVTo be honest, if the left most lane is clear you should be in there, it's not the "lorry lane", it's the left lane.
p3015
aVIf you aren't overtaking the people on the left at a reasonable pace then realistically you should drop a few MPH and travel with them.
p3016
aVWith regards to aggressive drivers, don't worry about them, some people aren't the most pleasant.
p3017
aVIf you get someone belting up behind you while you make a manoeuvre, just complete your manoeuvre then let them get on their way.
p3018
aVI usually drive at 80 on the motorways, it's the speed I default to, during the night it's easy, sit in the left lane, there's nobody around.
p3019
aVHowever during the day, this usually means I'm switching between the middle and right lane quite a lot.
p3020
aVI'm cool with the constant switching, if you check your mirrors in advance it's quite a painless experience indicating then switching lanes, but sometimes you will have people come up and start to be aggressive and to be honest, it doesn't really matter.
p3021
aVI usually find making brief eye contact using my rear view mirror to be an effective way to get them to back off.
p3022
aVA lot of people think that just because they're in their car, they are isolated from the world, reminding them that they aren't breaks their pattern of behaviour and all of a sudden they become so sheepish the nearest Welshman would try to herd them in a pen.
p3023
aVI am emphatically NOT a lane hogger btw, but I often suffer aggressive tailgaters in Spain.
p3024
aVLike Michal, I keep to the legal speed or a safe 10% over (speedo shows 130, really 120) and my response to tailgaters is the following:\u000a1.
p3025
aVReduce speed gradually to the marked limit (speedo 120, really 110) by disengaging cruise control.
p3026
aVTailgater then has to slow down.
p3027
aV2.
p3028
aVTilt interior mirror downwards (door mirrors outwards, obviously only if electric) so that tailgater cannot make eye contact with me\u000a3.
p3029
aVIf tailgating continues, repeatedly dab brake pedal sufficient to light up brake lights but without braking.
p3030
aVI obviously get out of the tailgater's way as soon as physically possible and never make eye contact.
p3031
aVWhatever the TG attempts to do (usually gestures and mouthing obscenities) it is totally futile if he cannot make eye contact.
p3032
aVA reaction only spurs them on.
p3033
aV4.
p3034
aVStill working on the hidden 007-style in-car machine gun,bazooka, etc.
p3035
aVMy oh my, what fun I would have with that...
p3036
aVI really really love Polish people and I hate the bad rap they get here in the UK, but this has just confirmed for me that Polish people are the absolute best.
p3037
aVI immigrated to England with my family 8 years ago, the main difference from my dad's point of view is that everyone behaves differently, actually, many of my family members noticed that.
p3038
aVOver here in UK, or England at least, no one hesitates to speak to random strangers or smile at them whether in a shop or out on the street.
p3039
aVMeanwhile in Poland there is none of that, no one says "Hi", or "How're you doing" unless you knew them for quite a while.
p3040
aVThat's pretty varied according to which part of the UK you're in.
p3041
aVYou're in Somerset which must be pretty friendly.
p3042
aVOther parts of the country won't dream of making eye contact with strangers.
p3043
aVWell, it kinda makes sense that in the smaller towns and rural areas people would be more likely to be doing that.
p3044
aVBecause.. You know, less people means that they're closer together.
p3045
aVYou are describing:\u000a\u000a1.
p3046
aVA Risk Society (see Beck)\u000a\u000a2.
p3047
aVThe experience of life in the lower income brackets\u000a\u000a3.

aVThe gin-soaked life of the working classes
p3052
aVAfter reading that, some parts of the UK culture is pretty much 'Murican
p3053
aVI have one thing to add - apartments and houses:  \u000a- you can feel a light breeze even when the windows are shut.
p3054
aVEveryone is really cool about this and seem not to care much.
p3055
aV- carpets in the bathroom, covering 100% of the area
p3056
aVThis made me want to move to Poland.
p3057
aVGod I hate UK banking.
p3058
aVPolish banking - you have to pay a fee for everything you do.
p3059
aVThere are no free accounts, as you have to pay a monthly fee for having an account at all.
p3060
aVDid you use vinegar in Poland?
p3061
aVIf so, what for?
p3062
aVI can't think of anything other than chips that I put vinegar on.
p3063
aVlol, vinegar is for salad!
p3064
aVnot chips\u000a\u000a
p3065
aVHaha well that explains it then, salad is not a thing with which I (Scottish) am familiar with ;)
p3066
aVneh, vinegar is for everything here in UK.
p3067
aVchips, crisps, salads, meats, fishes.
p3068
aVvinegar.
p3069
aVvinegar everywhere.
p3070
aVsalt and vinegar on pubs tables.
p3071
aVsalt and vinegar at fastfoods.
p3072
aVsometimes you can find some mayo.
p3073

p3074
aVmade in proportions like 1 tomato 500ml vinegar. 
p3075
aVsalads, preserved vegetables

aVYou would love reading Terry Pratchett.
p3077
aVHe pans the quirks of society very well (and he is British).
p3078
aVI already do love Terry Pratchett :-)\u000aAlthough recently I got the Long Earth trilogy from Audible that he's written in collaboration with Baxter.
p3079
aVWow, that was a long and boring experience.
p3080
aVI kept listening with the hope that something will finally happen... Nope.
p3081
aVAnd what did happen was mostly of no consequence.
p3082
aVNot recommended.
p3083
aVIt wasn't even funny like most of Pratchett's writing.
p3084
aVGood to know politicians are bad everywhere. 
p3085
aVNo mention how health care is "free"..........Thought not
p3086
aVyour point about education is very correct, I've been living in the UK for almost three years (I'm european), I am 25 and clearly remember one of my (british) friends telling me he didn't know much about WWII because they didn't study that in school.
p3087
aVI got my MA in the UK so I know universities are not bad at all but high schools look like a total mess to me. 
p3088
aVAre you sure he wasn't having a laugh?
p3089
aVI swear to god I asked him because it looked too strange and he just said they studied a very small portion of history in his hs! 
p3090
aVWow... what a terrible school haha.
p3091
aVYou can get sour cream in any supermarket.
p3092
aVThis was a very good read.
p3093
aVI was starting to give up on Reddit.
p3094
aVAs to the point made about illness: sounds like a typical American thing.
p3095
aVHere in the U.S., the attitude prevails that taking time off for illness harms productivity.
p3096
aVYour treated with suspicion and deemed lazy.
p3097
aVA weak link.
p3098
aVIrksome seeing a coworker shuffling around sneezing... especially if your work place is a restaurant.
p3099
aV&gt; Insure EVERYTHING.
p3100
aVIn Poland: car, house contents, maybe sometimes life insurance.
p3101
aVHere: car, house, house content, tenant's insurance, professional indemnity, bicycle, animals (small), animals (large, I have a horse), animal's third party insurance, dental (WTF, it is covered by NHS, at least partially, why do I need that?
p3102
aV), life, payment protection... name it.
p3103
aVIt's a jungle to understand what I really need, and what is just being actively sold to me.
p3104
aVWith the constant requests for me to insure something I bought to throw away in a year or two I have a simple policy.
p3105
aVI have an account which contains half of every insurance fee I've turned down (among other things, this is my general "what if shit happens" fund).
p3106
aVIt turns out I have more than enough in there to replace anything I might own, including my car.
p3107
aVPersonally my rule is I only insure stuff I couldn't simply replace out of that fund.
p3108
aVThe fund is my insurance.
p3109
aV&gt; Ill people at work.
p3110
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak, and spread germs so the next week half of the office is trying to cough their insides out.
p3111
aVLoss of productivity of you being away for three days is nothing compared to loss of productivity from 10 people succumbing to your flu.
p3112
aVI think this is a problem with the UK in general, being off sick is often seen as a bad thing, like you're letting people down. 
p3113
aV 21.
p3114
aVDoctors.
p3115
aVWhatever your disease is, they will ALWAYS advise you take some paracetamol/ibuprofen.
p3116
aVIf you go to your GP with an open wound, they will tell you to grind some paracetamol and sprinkle it over the wound.
p3117
aVIf you go to A&amp;E (which happened to my fiancee) they are likely to forget about you for about 3-4 hours (but still they will pass you by a thousand times).
p3118
aVJust a point added from a fellow Pole ;).
p3119
aV&gt;But consider that: I'm going on the middle lane, exactly at the speed limit with cruise control set, then some bastard sits on my rear bumper flashing lights\u000a\u000aEasy.

aVYou're both being cunts. 
p3121
aVI would say that your experience has a lot to do with living in a foreign country rather than living in the UK.
p3122
aVI'm British but live abroad and these things tend to just happen because the system was not designed with you (a foreigner moving to the country in the middle of your life) in mind.
p3123
aVFor instance, I found it horribly hard to open a bank account in Holland but when I talked to my Dutch friends they looked confused that I could find it difficult - it was seemless for them.
p3124
aVTalking to the tax office is impossible and you need an appointment for EVERYTHING, which I find incredibly annoying but the Dutch find normal... do you see what I mean?
p3125
aVAlso, the school your step-kid is in sounds fairly unpleasant- I don't know where you live nor where you came from in Poland but I can promise you that my educational experience was nothing like that, in spite of growing up in the poorest part of [England - which as this source points out is poorer than Poland](http://www.westbriton.co.uk/Cornwall-officially-poorest-area-UK/story-21062714-detail/story.html).
p3126
aVI wonder if you would have a different opinion if you were from the roughest part of Lodz?
p3127
aVBasically what I'm saying is that it's all relative and that a lot of your experiences/annoyances are probably simply caused by being foreign.
p3128
aVNot in a racist way that we hate foreigners but simply because the system is alien to you and not designed with you in mind.
p3129
aVI totally agree and this is more or less what I had in mind when writing this post.
p3130
aVTo share the experience.
p3131
aVAnd you can probably see that there are many things that - even though foreign and strange - I totally love about UK.
p3132
aVYou had trouble with a bank account in the Netherlands?
p3133
aVI only had to have my registration number (city council) and go to the bank (it took a while to actually open it, although something similar happened for me the UK, and yes, I have been an immigrant in both countries)
p3134
aV21.
p3135
aVWhat's up with the dirty tables in every pub/restaurant?
p3136
aVEither cover them with paper or at least clean them once in a while!
p3137
aVTo all the people banging on about choice, or not being allowed the option to bounce payments, what would actually happen in that case?
p3138
aVThe corner shop or petrol station you just shafted now can't get the money.
p3139
aVThey can't pay the wages of their staff.
p3140
aVThey use a recovery service so instead of a £30 bank charge you get a £130 debt collector charge.
p3141
aVThe knock on effect would be horrendous.
p3142
aVWhen you present your card, you are trading money for a service, if there was a significant risk of not getting that money, you wouldn't get the service or goods until the payment had gone through.
p3143
aVChaos would reign.
p3144
aVDogs and cats living together...\u000a\u000aEdit: I realise (somewhat late to the game) that people are actually complaining they would like to be told in the queue at the off licence or petrol station that their payment had been declined, rather than be forced into an overdraft.
p3145
aVI understand now, but I bet you most of you wouldn't actually prefer it really, when push came to shove.
p3146
aVIn Canada we get an "insufficient funds" message (right on the debit machine in the store) if you try to buy something that costs more than what you have in the bank (unless you have a prearranged overdraft at the bank).
p3147
aVIt is very embarrassing but  you can whip out a credit card or use another account to try again.
p3148

aVAnd people generally believe what he says.
p3162
aVAh.
p3163
aVNow I understand.
p3164
aVI think I'd be quite interested to read something similar from someone who moved to Poland.
p3165
aVIt's probably my most upvoted post ever, which indeed is surprising, but I enjoyed the discussion here :)
p3166
aVMaybe you should try posting an AMA request if you are interested in hearing the opinions of a Brit in Poland.

aV[deleted]
p3169
aVAbout the money thing, yes you're right.
p3170
aVBut this is a skill you need to learn, as before the whole concept of "tracking a balance" was non-existing to me.
p3171
aVLimits were hard, I kept two accounts open - one for bills, a second one for normal spending, and if I ever slipped I just made a transfer to my provider on the next day, after moving some of the balance between accounts.
p3172
aVHere, especially at the beginning when I had to buy furniture, spend money on rental deposit, learn the optimal ways to get to work, ship stuff from Poland, etc., I had some rough months from the financial point of view - and the way banks work did not help.
p3173
aVWhy have two accounts ?
p3174
aVJust have one and then all your money is in one place and you don't go overdrawn.
p3175
aVyeah maybe set up a savings account and move stuff into that at the end of the month just after you get paid. 
p3176
aVYour looking at it thinking your a customer and the bank should work for you and the UK would be a better place if it worked like that.
p3177
aVI think in the UK we've centred our economy on financial services and they've grown to powerfull.
p3178
aVYour suggestion would not help the banks make profit and we've got so used to thinking of banks as evil that we just accept their behaviour
p3179
aV[deleted]
p3180
aV15 years ago I tried to open an account that didn't have an overdraft facility and wouldn't pay out more money than I had in the account - guess what, there were no accounts like this.
p3181
aVIts a bit of a scam on the part of the banks.
p3182
aVMy bank is pissed off with me.
p3183
aVI opened my bank account 16 years ago.
p3184
aVIt has no over draft and it wont take money out if there is no money in there.
p3185
aVThe bank no longer has this service and whenever I need to go in they always try to get me to upgrade.
p3186
aVI have a savings account so I really don't need anything different for my main account.
p3187
aVI don't want an overdraft so every time I just say no.
p3188
aV[deleted]
p3189
aVIt wasn't a service I wanted, it was a service that was forced on me if I wanted a bank account.
p3190
aVNow the economics of free bank accounts may rely on forcing this service on you but that doesn't change the fact that for some its an undesired service that's pushed upon them.
p3191
aV[deleted]
p3192
aVWhen I have money in my pocket, if I spend all the money in my pocket there is no way for me to spend any more money.
p3193
aVImagine if your pocket had special magic coins at the bottom that were almost indistinguishable from real coins.
p3194
aVIf you don't remember exactly off the top of your head exactly how many real coins are in your pocket (given the multiple transactions you've engaged in over the last few days this isn't easy to do), and you accidentally spend one of the special magic coins, you get stung by a £9 fee.
p3195
aVSo whereas with money in your pocket you naturally regulate your spending, but bank accounts with overdrafts weaken your ability to regulate your spending.
p3196
aVIf you want to know how much money is in your pocket you count it, but for a bank account you have to go to a cash machine or phone up the bank - much harder to keep track of your balance thus much easier to incur accidental overdraft fees you had no intention of paying.
p3197
aVYes its possible to avoid these fees, but the banks have very carefully set it up to make it as easy as possible for you to accidentally pay overdraft charges.
p3198
aVIt doesn't have to be this way\u000a
p3199
aV[deleted]
p3200
aVYou *can*, but its harder to do which means some people fail, and that's all the banks need to cream money out of some people.
p3201
aVYou're coming at this from a personal responsibility point of view and you're right up to a point, but there are two parties involved in this - the bank and their customer.
p3202
aVIts wrong to focus on (and blame) only one party and pretend the other party's decisions have no impact.
p3203
aVI dunno, I can see his point.
p3204
aVIf you come from a country where your bank simply declines any transaction that there isn't funds for, then you would never need to watch your balance like a hawk.
p3205
aVToo much month left at the end of the money?
p3206
aVYou find out when your debit card stops working, not when you get a rude letter through the post saying "You went overdrawn without permission, we're charging you a £25 overdraft fee, a £10/week convenience fee and £30 for writing you this letter".
p3207
aVIt would definitely come as a bit of a shock the first time you got a letter like that.
p3208
aVProbably wouldn't even occur to you that it might happen.
p3209
aVThat's a bingo.
p3210
aVNope, it's the way banks work here that tracking the balance is necessary at all, under the penalty of charges.
p3211
aVThat was a foreign concept to me before, just something that you didn't need to think about at all.
p3212
aV[deleted]
p3213
aVThe difference is you cant spend money you dont have in other counties, it just gets declined
p3214
aVYup.
p3215
aVIf we did that here people would say we're forcing people into hardship (so we just do it by the back door, via overdraft fees, instead)
p3216
aVMoney management is one of those fundamental things everybody should know but nobody ever bothers to teach in schools.
p3217
aVChrist knows learning how to properly balance your weekly budget is more valuable information than what deity people half the world away pray to.
p3218
aVI think knowing about different cultures is still very important...
p3219
aVBut you don't learn about different cultures beyond "here's religion X" which is inevitably one of the Big Three.
p3220
aVI learned more about foreign culture in Modern Studies, which actually had a great unit on the Chinese political system.
p3221
aVThe bit you're missing is that the banks here will automatically give you an overdraft.
p3222
aVThe fee is not a "You are a bad person for not tracking your balance penalty", it is an explicit admin charge for them creating a loan for you.
p3223
aVIt's a fucking scam.
p3224
aVTry opening an account in the UK that has no overdraft facility.
p3225
aVYou can get a basic bank account that allows cards, no overdraft, direct debits and standing orders from every bank in the country fee free by law.
p3226
aV[deleted]
p3227
aVExcept you didn't ask for this service.
p3228
aVMany people would prefer that the transaction was declined instead of automatically getting an expensive loan.
p3229
aVAutomatic and non-optional services like that are a scummy business tactic IMO ('You should have paid attention' is not a good response.
p3230
aVPeople who make money by misdirecting people who aren't paying attention are scammers.
p3231
aV).
p3232
aVRight but it's not a service provided because you can't turn that shit off.
p3233
aVIt isn't a service a lot of people want.
p3234
aVI track my money but because I'm student I often have to pay for a bunch of stuff before my loan comes in.
p3235
aVI once got charged £25 quid because a deposit had an admin fee which pushed my overdraft into £0.25.
p3236
aVIt's bullshit, it's not a service, it's a trap.

aVThat's what I was using a two-account system for before.
p3244
aVHere I was happy I managed to open one account as a newcomer.
p3245
aVMy new company didn't pay me for my first 10 days here (last days of a month), had to wait until the end of next month to get all of that together.
p3246
aVWhile having to cash out for security deposit, more than I envisioned.
p3247
aVI had savings but in Poland and it took a while to transfer them here, while I started to get hit by fees that were at the least unfair and unexpected to me.
p3248
aVI still don't get it, the whole concept is strange to me - zero is zero, you shouldn't be able to make a card transaction that's takes you into the minus zone, and the outgoing transactions just shouldn't happen.
p3249
aVWhy do I have to pay charges for the fact that bank says 'no'?
p3250
aVI get that this is normal to you, but it wasn't and still isn't to me as it just worked in a different way in Poland.
p3251
aVMade my first two months here much more stressful than they should be.
p3252
aVBut if the bank bounces the payment that you agreed to, by using the card, then the shop you bought the goods or services from won't get paid.
p3253
aVThe system breaks down immediately.
p3254
aVIs your complaint with the method of transaction?
p3255
aVIf you only used cash in Poland I could understand, but I doubt that, so what happened to the company you owed money to in Poland when the bank says no?
p3256
aVNothing happens, because you just can't pay/finalize a transaction in such situation.
p3257
aVYou need to have account specifically set up with debit for such minus transactions (but it's not default and you don't get punished for it).
p3258

p3259
aVWhen you move countries, have funds at different accounts, are moving homes, etc it can be hard to keep track.

p3261
aVHe's making the point that its his responsibility to know how much he has.
p3262
aVI have a permanent overdraft ready on my account just to save me not getting £30 charges if I let the ball drop.
p3263
aVIf I didn't I would have to keep track properly.
p3264
aVIt's a pretty fundamental part of living in society nowadays I would say, and not being in control by diligence or arranging an overdraft leads to debt.
p3265
aVI understand what he's saying, I just think he's being a bit of a dick and not taking into account how the difference can be strange or how the circumstances might mean you're not 100% on the ball and get tacked with charges that really are a bit scammy.
p3266
aVIt's standard here in England but if it's a service you should be able to choose it.
p3267
aVI haven't had problems since that one time, and it doesn't seem like OP has either, we are just giving our opinion on the attitude of the banks here.
p3268
aVPermanent overdraft is common of course in Poland for accounts, but not turning it on on demand and punishing you for it.\u000a\u000a
p3269
aVWith all due respect, it's you who is missing the point.
p3270
aVI grew accustomed that it IS the bank's job to manage the zero if that happens.
p3271
aVHence it's been weird stuff to me, and stressful on top of that.
p3272
aVIt's not anymore, it took me 2-3 months but I got on top of that in the end.
p3273
aV[deleted]
p3274
aVYou're a prick
p3275
aVAnd the banks are responsible for milking people using overdraft fees (among other nefarious means - PPI, anyone?).

aVSometimes companies fuck up and draw more money than usual, or make a mistake on your bill.
p3281
aVYou could have budgeted perfectly down to the last penny, but if a company makes a mistake and draws more money than they are supposed to - why should the customer get hit with overdraft fees?
p3282
aVyou might say the company who made the mistake is responsible for reimbursing you the fees - good luck with that, also even if they do pay, it certainly won't be very quick.
p3283
aVLast year TalkTalk fucked up and took over £200 more than they should have on my bill, took 3 months to get them to repay me and another 3 months to refund the fees I was charged by the bank.
p3284
aVI'm still waiting for them to repay the interest.
p3285
aVNo overdraft should be an option if you want it with a bank.

p3334
aVI wonder why bus drivers are so nervous, everytime, especially at night shift they turn even more susceptible to external factors such as plead to open the door, ask the road, or ask for something else.
p3335
aVThere is always some prick in the lower deck who drives the driver nuts.

aVOn point 15, it's worth noting that much of Britain's education system revolves around a skills-based curriculum (particularly before A-Level or IB) rather than factual recall.
p3357
aVIt may be that he's developing well but your own judgement of "knowing things"  may be rather outdated now.
p3358
aVYes, because "knowing things" is a bad way to became a well educated member of the society.

aVOK, first of all, OP is complaining mostly about simple jobs: waiters, hairdressers, simple office workers, etc.
p3369
aVAlso, he is complaining that his son of about average skill and IQ, who struggled with previous education, now is rewarded without putting any more effort into his learning than he used to be, and that his friends don't really have any motivation to expand and learn, besides getting out of school and getting their welfare check or whatever.
p3370
aVHe pointed out that this education system promotes laziness, doesn't require effort and does not award any actuall skills, knowlege and basic IQ.
p3371
aVSomeone respondend that the education system is more focused on training actuall job skills, before basic knowledge and overall academic information.
p3372
aVWhat I meant, is that even me, who has some serious reservations to the education system, understands and agrees with the basic principles of a broader range of basic education.
p3373
aVIt's not to fill your mind with useless and forgetabble dates, definitions and strings of numbers.

aVNo child at the age of 10, 15 or even young adult of the age of 18 or even 20, despite their former educations being basic or very specific, will be able to fully tell you what he or she is going to be doing in his or her future, or what his best skills are and what type of job or carreer is the best for them.
p3376
aVBecause it's not that simple.
p3377
aVA human is a complicated organism, having a brain with a very large potential does not automatically mean you will use the most of it towards betterment of human species.
p3378
aVSome people, even smart people are very happy with their simple job, simple life and some people, even in their limited options, will always remain unhappy, whatever they decide or are forced to do.
p3379
aVOf course, there are always exceptions to the basic rule.
p3380
aVEducation does not equal future job skills and does not guarantee future employment.
p3381
aVEven if you dropped out of elementary school and went to welding school, it does not guarantee that you will be a welder in your future, as much as if you went to university to study science, does not guarantee that you will become a scientist.
p3382
aVBoth of you might end up flipping burgers or winning a noble prize in the future.
p3383
aVHowever, both of you are a bit more prone to end up in the field of your chosen education.
p3384
aVEducation is not for you to memorize poems, it's to learn history of literature, it's to let you understand poetry, to understand why some people are great at moving the hearts and emotions of millions ,and some people should not be allowed near twitter.
p3385
aVOf course not everybody will understand it, not everybody will appreciate it, but all of them should be given the option to do so, even if it means forcing young children to read boring poems and sometimes memorize them as part of your student activities in school.
p3386
aVIt's not all just gold stars and cheating on tests.
p3387
aVI wen't throug all the classic education.
p3388
aVI remember very little of it.
p3389
aVMy father went through all the classic education.
p3390
aVHe is a very learned, educated, well spoken man, and I envy his wast knowledge on some many fields of science, history, technical and literal skills.
p3391
aVIt just means that not everybody is able to fit in the education system, and for some people, university is not the best option.
p3392
aVNor is colledge, or high school, or technical school or whatever you may call it.
p3393
aVThat is why our education is segmented into parts with multiple options to fit the widest scope of humans.
p3394
aVI do agree, that the system is flawed, that universities fill you up on useless bullshit and studies are clogged up with paperwork, busywork, and copy and paste, memorize and forget type of in and out education.
p3395
aVHowever, I do not need a degree of physics to have a vague understanding on how a tv works or I don't need a degree in literature to be able to discern a good book from a terrible waste of paper.
p3396
aVI am able to do those things thanks to some of my education I took in school, which I didn't really want since I hate physics and I am very bad at it, but that does not exclude my main hobby to be hardware and computers, and does not forbid me from building pc's as a great use of my free time.
p3397
aVI've been building my computers for over 15 years.
p3398
aVI didn't like very much many of subjects I was forced to learn, but I need them to be able to discern bullshit from real science.
p3399
aVTo not believe creationism over evolution, and to not to give my money to solar highway scammers out there.
p3400
aVI need to know how my body functions, to understand how to feed myself and how to dress, and how to function, to discern when I'm sick and when I just have the cold.
p3401
aVThese all things are available to us through common education system.
p3402
aVAnd training us to be programmers or paper pushers or burger flippers does not allow it all.
p3403
aVSaddly, most of people who even are able to make a rational decision about their future when they are in their teens, won't end up in their chosen fields, and it is still mostly luck or connections that allow us to have great jobs, or even bad jobs at all, and not our very specific education, even it you have a very narrow specialization.
p3404
aVI myself for most of my life wanted to be in a specific field, I studied it wih a passion, I still love it.
p3405
aVBut I'm not working in this field, and I  am able to still be happy and to like my job.
p3406
aVNobody, except a very few lucky ones, knows what to do with their life, and even less people will be able to do what they really want to do.
p3407
aVThat is why they need the options to be somebody else, or else they end up unhappy and uneducated with nothing to help them in their unknow and uncertain futures. 
p3408
aVExactly, there's a strong move towards life long learning and as you mention skills and transferrable ideas stick and repeat with much more frequency.
p3409
aVWhether its in technological areas or the realms of literature, it leads to independent thinkers who can make a judgement on their own.
p3410
aVThe exams his stepson is preparing for are publicly administered and respected upon an international scale.
p3411
aVIt's not really possible for his school to lie their way through a child's education.
p3412
aVAlso there's regular, somewhat excessive tracking and checks of progress in all subjects in the years leading up to these exams.
p3413
aVGCSE's are what a school lives and dies by and any management system that fails to address that will be removed and replaced pretty sharpish.
p3414
aVIt's possible his child was the worst in the class before moving but the school has helped him to achieve.
p3415
aVIt's a shame that what may actually be a success story is instead phrased as his peers failing completely to make him look good.
p3416
aVDavid Cameron is a proper cunt though.
p3417
aVHe's bang on the money with that one.
p3418
aVWhy would you come to the UK in the first place?
p3419
aVWho leaves a country packed with ponies to go to a non-pony country?
p3420
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXy0tZ5eCG4
p3421
aVAgree with most things except your comments on the "middle lane"\u000a\u000aIt isn't a middle lane it's an overtaking lane.
p3422
aVPeople sitting in cloud cuckoo land in the overtaking lane whilst the inside lane is clear is my biggest pet peeve when driving.
p3423
aVA pole on reddit telling us our education is shit and that we should slow down on the right hand lane and plod along at 65 behind him.
p3424
aVNice one mate dae you fit right in.
p3425
aV[deleted]
p3426
aVThat's why we shouldn't have to sit behind somebody in the middle lane going 65 dumbass.
p3427
aVWtf is a boiler?
p3428
aVSteam heat.
p3429
aVThe boiler sends steam through pipes to radiators instead of a furnace blowing hot air through ducts. 
p3430
aVThanks, I live in Florida if I want heat I open a window lol
p3431
aV[deleted]
p3432
aVA huge metal cylinder, that heat's up the water in your house.
p3433
aVThe bigger the better they say.
p3434
aVAlso, mythbusters destroyed one in one of their shows and it shot hundreds of feet into the air, destroying a small house on the way. 
p3435
aVI still pay by cheque.
p3436
aVIt's a great way to postpone paying someone, you just make a mistake and send it off to them, then they send it back but have to confirm that the cheque has come in, therefore the payment isn't "late".
p3437
aVAt least, in my experiences. 
p3438
aVBut that tactic makes you a twat.
p3439
aVWhat's the problem with paying someone on time?
p3440
aVBeing skint might be one of them.
p3441
aVStill though, if you don't have the money do not enter into a contract with them then.
p3442
aVThe company I used to work for would not take checks because people would pull this kind of thing.
p3443
aVCash up front if you did want to pay by check we would not do any work until it had cleared.
p3444
aVBefore we introduced this policy I can think of a few cases where we never did get payed, it was not worth taking them to court over the money due the the fact that the cost of doing so would be higher than the value of the money they owed us.
p3445
aVSo in the end we just stopped working on the promise of a check.
p3446
aVWhat is your problem with cheques, they are still really useful
p3447
aVSure, if you're like, 80, or something.
p3448
aV:p
p3449
aVfor ?
p3450
aVThey are so much safer than cash and easier to pay in for one off jobs than a bank transfer
p3451
aVHmmm yeah I suppose so. 
p3452
aVwhen I process Attachment of Earnings deduction for our employees, I then need to send the deducted monies to the relevant councils/Child Support Agency etc.
p3453
aVYou'd be surprised how many of the recipients only take cheques. 
p3454
aVAhh ok, business use I understand.
p3455
aVI thought we were on a personal standpoint.
p3456
aVAlthough many companies are pushing towards e-invoicing. 
p3457
aVgovernment bodies are just...backwards :(
p3458
aVThe problems you've pointed out are all pretty subjective.
p3459
aVWhy move somewhere and pick apart it's nuances?
p3460
aVIsn't that what makes a country?
p3461
aVBecause differences between people is what makes life interesting.
p3462
aVThe sheer amount of comments on this post, mostly positive, tells me that people love to see them from someone's else perspective.
p3463
aVI definitely do and a few years ago I was reading with pleasure similar thing from US person who moved to Poland.
p3464
aVwhat the hell is a boiler?
p3465
aV-An American
p3466
aVex-NYer here and the old buildings with steam radiators use gas boilers in the basement.
p3467
aVUS equivalent would be a furnace or water heater.
p3468
aV(Serious) how do you heat your house?
p3469
aVIf your question wasn't sarcasm I shall happily explain to you the blight on our lives that is... A boiler. 
p3470
aVI guarantee we are all serious.
p3471
aVWe use a central air/heating system.
p3472
aVNatural gas heats an element and then a fan pushes the air through the house.
p3473
aVThis is the heater.
p3474
aVSame unit also does air conditioning in the summer.
p3475
aVWe pay for the natural gas to heat the element and the electricity to power the fan from the local utility.
p3476
aVWater heater.
p3477
aV30+ gallon water tank that uses a gas or electrical element to heat the water in the tank.
p3478
aVThen it is fed to the rest of the house via plumbing.
p3479
aVIn this instance, you pay for the water and the gas/electricity from the local utilities.
p3480
aVSome new water heaters use a very small tank (tankless) but those still use gas.
p3481
aVBoilers are sometimes used in large buildings or schools but just for hot water I think.
p3482
aVNot sure.
p3483
aVNot really commonplace here in the US. 
p3484
aVSame in Canada.
p3485
aVI've only heard of boilers in old schools and such. 
p3486
aVAh, I live in southern California.
p3487
aVI've never turned on our central heating unit.
p3488
aVI did once, and it smelled like burning dust.
p3489
aVso never again.
p3490
aVIf it gets a little to cold in december/january I have a little space heater.
p3491
aVIt doesn't boil however.
p3492
aV:D 
p3493
aVThe central heating always smells like burning dust the first time it is turned on in the fall.
p3494
aVIt goes away after an hour or so. 
p3495
aVWater heater for central heating systems and sinks etc. 
p3496
aV&gt;Daily Mail.
p3497
aVSeriously?
p3498
aVWho buys this... thing?
p3499
aVIt's got a crossword, a suduko, and it's cheap toilet paper.
p3500
aV3 good reasons to buy it.
p3501
aV&gt;David Cameron.
p3502
aVNo-one likes him.
p3503
aVNo-one.
p3504
aVCameron is better than the alternative
p3505
aVMillibean?
p3506
aVPossibly.
p3507
aVAt least Ed Millibean gets in the newspapers for things other than his 10 holidays a year.
p3508
aVTo each their own.
p3509
aVI think Cameron has been decent.
p3510
aV&gt;No-one likes him.
p3511
aVNo-one.
p3512
aVHowever, you can't deny that quite a lot of people would rather him than any of Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg or Nigel Farage in Number 10.
p3513
aVI would include myself amongst the people who think he's the best of a bad bunch, yeah.
p3514
aVHopefully BoJo will take his place as leader of the Tories.
p3515
aVIt's a shame that you've got to vote for a politician in the elections...
p3516
aV&gt;No one likes him.
p3517
aVNo-one.
p3518
aVI'm sure his wife is quite fond of him.
p3519
aVNo she thinks he's a ham-faced twat like the rest of us.
p3520
aVBut what about...There must be...Oh, come on, there's....\u000a\u000aGod!
p3521
aVGod loves cockroaches!
p3522
aV\u000aHad a chuckle at number twenty.
p3523
aVSo true yet stupid.
p3524
aVJust to echo what some others have said - cheques are, occasionally, still very useful, generally for paying individuals/small traders through the post, or for ad-hoc amounts that are rather too large for cash.
p3525
aVBACS (bank transfer) is the ideal, but it's not always possible, so I'm glad to have a chequebook available in such instances.
p3526
aV2.
p3527
aVDirect Debits are actually the payee withdrawing money straight out of your account.
p3528
aVSo NPower (or whoever) takes money from your account, but they don't get access to it do they have no idea what the balance is.
p3529
aVAbout the ill people at work, i never miss a day unless i'm dying and thats totally down to how i've been treated in work places by bosses and also the lack of social support when sick.
p3530
aVAny time i've taken days off sick i always got back to a sceptical boss quizing me about my illness and even maybe getting put on all the crappy jobs for a week as some kind of punishment for getting the flu.
p3531
aVAlso when rent and utilities are so high and wages getting so low these days missing days is a real kick in the finacial balls, most i've ever gotten paid for sick days was £12 a day and nothing for the first 3 days, and i'm normally not sick more than 3 days so nothing, just 3 days loss in pay.
p3532
aVThats more than enough reason for me to suffer through work and disregard co-workers wellbeing... sorry.
p3533
aVThe sickness point is a great point, but here's why I go to work when I'm ill. \u000a\u000aWe used to get sick pay for any time we took off.
p3534
aVSome people abused it, so it was taken off us.
p3535
aVNow if we are off ill, not only do we not get paid, we also get grilled on why we were off AND if a redundancy situation occurs you lose redundancy points, making you more likely to lose your job.
p3536
aVTherefore everyone I work with comes to work ill and spreads it around a bit.
p3537
aVThat way the company that decided that the system should be changed because a couple of people had an extra holiday loses production and hopefully the management get to feel lousy too, and at the end of the day I and my coworkers get paid and can still pay our bills, don't get bollocked for being off and have less chance of losing our jobs. 
p3538
aVTo give some context on point number 4, while most people don't consider their jobs "too important to take time off", in a hourly job you won't get paid for sick days, which for some people means they can't afford, financially, to take the time off to recuperate.
p3539
aVAnd in a salaried job, someone who takes time off frequently (i.e.
p3540
aVif they're ill more then the average person) will be top of the list come redundancy time, whereas someone who is in and poorly doesn't get noticed as much as a absence does, even if they do give it to everyone else.
p3541
aVe: Obviously if your off for a extended time for legitimate reasons, you can get a sick note from your GP and get SSP or whatever sickpay your job comes with, but if you have the flu for 3 days and then back at work, it won't help you get money back.
p3542
aV&gt;"Ill people at work.
p3543
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak"\u000a\u000aSadly bosses don't work that way over here.
p3544
aVI have had a few who i'm sure would still demand me to turn up if I lost a leg.
p3545
aVOn education: I think that might be a sign your kid is going to a bad-ish comprehensive.
p3546
aVWhile most schools are about the same in Europe, in the UK some schools are terrible and some are great.
p3547
aVHalf of Oxbridge places go to private school students and they make up 7% of the cohort.
p3548
aVAgree with you on banks - you have to jump through many hurdles to get an account and if you have a bad credit rating you might as well forget it (at least it was like that a few years ago.
p3549
aV)  Also on banks the charges for "bounced" direct debits used to be way higher; my bank charges about £8 now whereas 5+ years ago it was £36 if I remember correctly.
p3550
aVIf payroll fucked up your wages you'd lose a weeks pay when the gas/electric/phone bill direct debits all got returned...\u000a\u000aedit: excellent post btw
p3551
aVThis is brilliant and I think I agree with almost every word!
p3552
aVBut now you're used to it you need to move to the USA.
p3553
aVIt's pretty much everything you've written all over again...but BIGGER!.
p3554
aVI lived only for half an year in London and I agree completely with the points that I personally experienced.
p3555
aVStill can't forget the unknown asshole that laughed on the phone when I tried to explain the problem I was having with their extremely incompetent service.
p3556
aVNo wonder the Brits are so cynnical and edgy.
p3557
aVAs someone who visits UK often and not really living there, I can completely relate.
p3558
aVBanks are the worst.
p3559
aVI had to almost beg several banks to open up my business account because I don't live in the UK.
p3560
aVNot to mention outrageous charges.
p3561
aVFor example: £12 for a "non-sterling service fee" if I buy anything with my bank card in Europe/US.
p3562
aVAre you freaking nuts?
p3563
aVI know your pain.
p3564
aVIt's at times like that that I really wish we'd adopted the Euro in 2000. 
p3565
aVNumber 6.
p3566
aVYou drive on the M20 a lot don't you?
p3567
aV60 miles every day.
p3568
aVI have to say that the M20 &amp; M25 are probably the worst roads in the UK for shit drivers
p3569
aVYou're right about everything.
p3570
aVCareful with number 5 though.
p3571
aVYou knock that you'll get deported.
p3572
aVNumber 10 is a huge problem in this country in my opinion.
p3573
aVIt's as if no one cares about anything anymore.
p3574
aVMakes life extremely difficult when you can't rely on anyone from the person that serves you McDonalds to your doctor that screens you for the resultant cancer you get from eating it.
p3575
aVWhat do you think of the health care service?
p3576
aVI think both countries need to find a middle ground on this one:\u000a\u000a"Ill people at work.
p3577
aVWell, if you're ill, stay at home, not go to the office barely being able to speak, and spread germs so the next week half of the office is trying to cough their insides out.
p3578
aVLoss of productivity of you being away for three days is nothing compared to loss of productivity from 10 people succumbing to your flu.
p3579
aV"\u000a\u000aI work with a Poland design center daily and 'sick leave' for a week for a sniffle seems ludicrous.
p3580
aVFever?
p3581
aVStomach problems?
p3582
aVSure, stay at home until you feel better.
p3583
aVA little cold?
p3584
aVWe've all had colds and honestly after some meds/tea it's hardly noticeable.
p3585
aVIt's certainly not worth a trip to the dr. for a 1-week sick leave note.  
p3586
aVThe driving was big for me too!
p3587
aVHaving "learnt" how to drive in Africa where road rules are treated as suggestions.
p3588
aVI had to learn how to drive here all over again.
p3589
aVFeels strange having having to adapt every time I go home. 
p3590
aVThe law in our state (over here in the US) doesn't require employers to give sick time.
p3591
aVSo if an employee does not come in, often they do not get paid.
p3592
aVHere's a lot nmore our state doesn't require:\u000a 	\u000a&gt;Neither the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) nor Georgia law require breaks or meal periods be given to workers.
p3593
aVHowever, many employers do provide breaks and meal periods.
p3594
aVBreaks of short duration (from 5 to 20 minutes) are common.
p3595
aVThe FLSA requires workers be paid for short break periods; however an employer does not have to compensate for meal periods of thirty minutes or more, as long as the workers are free to use the meal period time as they wish and are not required to perform work during that time.
p3596
aVOh, or vacation or holiday time.
p3597
aVThe services one is explainable.
p3598
aVBasically anyone who could make a legitimate complains rarely does, meaning problems don't get fixed.
p3599
aVAlso anyone with an illegitimate bullshit complaint will find the nearest employee and scream at them, meaning that employee's will care less and less, even when a real issue arrives. 
p3600
aVAs a fellow Pole , living in London, have an up-vote.
p3601
aVI agree with almost everything and could add few more but those things enrage me more than they suppose to.
p3602
aVDon't agree on driving.
p3603
aVLine hogging is a bad practice, dangerous and not very smart.
p3604
aVIn some countries ,including Poland you can get pulled over for that.
p3605
aVThat would be bad Polish drivers behaviour you ranting about
p3606
aVIn response - \u000a\u000a1.
p3607
aVCurrent accounts are much easier to set up if you have always lived here, you would need a household bill and a passport.

p3611
aVThis is stupid.

p3613
aVHow do you pay a tradesman?
p3614
aVMost probably cheque as he can take the payment and give you a receipt right there.

p3616
aVIn my experience, people called in sick too often.
p3617
aVYou stubbed your toe?

aVthis was mainly my managers.
p3620
aV5.
p3621
aVThese are great.
p3622
aV6.
p3623
aVYes, if you learnt to drive, you learnt to drive in the left lane, if you want to use the middle lane.
p3624
aVUse the indicator, and signal out, the people coming will move out to the third lane.
p3625
aVDo not sit in the middle lane, this holds up traffic in the left and middle lanes.
p3626

aVThe last time I was in the UK(Northern Wales to be exact) to visit my grandpa in '89 I was severely disgusted by that.
p3663
aVNo, although some very touristy places have cones designed to look like newspapers. 
p3664
aVHeh, I remember the thrills of buying chips as a schoolkid and getting some tits with my chips.
p3665
aVNow they buy in special paper, same stuff as I think they use in off licences to wrap wine in.
p3666
aVDouble Tap?
p3667
aVYou mean a future space tap?
p3668
aVThe education one makes me sad because it's really a problem, a large percentage of young people just don't know anything.
p3669
aVI look at the difference between me in my mid twenties and my teenage brother who has just come out of school (the same one I went to) and I just can't fathom how the disparity between us in terms of knowledge has grown so large in a relatively short amount of time.
p3670
aVI mean basic things like practical skills which you get from Technology lessons like basic food prep, sewing, using a screwdriver, to things like geography and history.
p3671
aVIt makes me worry.
p3672
aVAs for youth general knowledge, pub quizzes should be on the curriculum because you shouldn't underestimate the benefit of knowing who won the golden boot at the 1990 world cup.
p3673
aVI used to work with a polish girl who thought the idea of a chip butty was the most disgusting thing imaginable.
p3674
aVI was flabbergasted.
p3675
aVI smother that bread in vinegar!
p3676
aVOM!
p3677
aVCze\u015b\u0107!
p3678
aVI notice you're from Kent.
p3679
aVI think we're lucky when it comes to road police.
p3680
aVThey are very lenient, calm and understanding when they are there.
p3681
aVI have gone months without seeing a police car on the road at least in the south east.
p3682
aVHowever in other parts of the country I feel the traffic police can be really bad in comparison (and in more plentiful supply).
p3683
aVAs for driving in the middle lane, I completely understand where you're coming from and this is why the problem subsides.
p3684
aVPeople get angry with middle lane drivers, then act in the exact way that makes people not want to use a lane properly.
p3685
aVPersonally the best I find this works is when the average traffic speed is around 80.
p3686
aVWe keep a faster pace and people seem to use lanes properly and it doesn't take too long for spaces to come and go to filter in and out of traffic.
p3687
aVSelf Service is awesome, just not in Morrisons.
p3688
aVWow.
p3689
aVIt becomes a talking point when you can get through using the Morrisons ones without it going wrong at least once.
p3690
aVMy dad buys the Daily Mail.
p3691
aVHe's a white middle class conservative man in his 60s.
p3692
aVApparently the Guardian is for "left wing poofs".
p3693
aVI'd be interested to see the age disparity with Daily Mail readers actually. 
p3694
aVI'm hoping it's like Fox News in American and give it 30 years and their customers will all have been wiped out by old age, and they'll be consigned to history.
p3695
aVNot wishing an early death on anyone, it's just that as a 40something who rarely sees anyone my age or under with any newspaper, I think they're going to struggle more each year.
p3696
aVWait, wait, go back to that portable scanner.
p3697
aVWhat is it and how does it work? 
p3698
aVIt's basically a little scanner you carry with you, scan items and then you take it to a special area where it downloads the data of things that you scanned when you placed the item in your trolley.
p3699
aVhttp://www.tesco.com/scan-as-you-shop/
p3700
aV&gt;I won't be mentioning double taps.
p3701
aVWould you, just briefly?
p3702
aVI have no idea what you mean and google suggests it's use when shooting someone, which is rarely a problem.
p3703
aVInstead of a single mixer faucet in the bathroom, they have separate hot and cold water faucets.
p3704
aVThank-you.
p3705
aVIt's a good thing reddit has taught me what a faucet is...
p3706
aVCan I ask?
p3707
aVIn poland do you generally pay a fee for a bank account or any sorts of charges for your banking facilities.
p3708
aVI suspect that these charges you speak of are subsidising other customers who manage their finances a little better.
p3709
aVThe charges used to be worse and the Office of Fair trading did a big investigation where many people hoped to get those charges reimbursed.
p3710
aVThe office of fair trading didn't really view the charges as unfair but the banks have tended to reduce the charges anyway.
p3711
aVwtf is a boiler?!
p3712
aV?
aVHot water heater I think.
p3713
aVI will accept this answer and remain baffled by the fact that people brag about it.
p3714
aV+1.
p3715
aVFeet on seats
p3716
aVThat's an American thing, we put our feet up on everything, even right now I'm rubbing my socks on your name on the screen.
p3717
aVYou said 'prick' you are one of us.
p3718
aVX
aVBritish guy here.
p3719
aVHave to agree on the service in the UK.
p3720
aVIt's utter shit.
p3721
aVCompanies just want the cash and try to get away with the lowest level of service possible.
p3722
aVProbably because in general Brits are, in my experience, less likely than other nations to complain.
p3723
aVClearly, that's not a good thing but it does comes from a general population that managed to muddle through for large parts of history.
p3724
aVPeople are used to putting up with crap experience and unscrupulous companies take advantage  of this.
p3725
aVAnd rail fares?
p3726
aVYeah, WTF?
p3727
aVSo expensive.
p3728
aVDecent enough service.But I pay the equivalent of about $10 a day to travel 17 miles and back to work.
p3729
aVOh and i dont do milk in my tea.
p3730
aVYuck!
p3731
aVfellow native here, living 7 years in the UK now\u000a\u000acan confirm most of these points but I think I'll never get used to vinegar on chips haha
p3732
aVNo.
p3733
aV2 I agree totally.
p3734
aVWhy in the hell am I being charged for not having money?
p3735
aVJust don't send it out, I'll deal with the guys on the other end.
p3736
aVThe bank has to take your money for not having any money, so they can give it to people as a reward for having loads of money.
p3737
aV:)
p3738
aVnumber 2 ruined me when I was young.
p3739
aVHalf of these baffle me and I'm a native, the education part in particular is scary.
p3740
aVSour milk is called "buttermilk" here so try looking for that.
p3741
aVI've no idea how easy/hard it is to get because it's horrible.
p3742
aVblasphemy!\u000a\u000a
p3743
aVI like the cut of your jib sir, let's be friends. 
p3744
aVnumber 20 drives me nuts aswell
p3745
aVNo.
p3746
aV16, portable scanners?
p3747
aVI have no idea what you are on about?
p3748
aVAnybody?
p3749
aVUnattended photo radar vans that the cops park in random places that snap your pic and send you a ticket, a big one.
p3750
aVIn the US they only work in better areas, when they try and use those in the hood somebody always torches it.
p3751
aVThere was a test run in my local store, essentially you register and collect a handheld barcode scanner, and scan your own shopping as you go, then at the end, put the scanner in a cradle, it tells you your bill, and you pay by card and go.
p3752
aVHas the small problem of people loading up £100 worth of groceries, scanning a single can of coke, and then paying their 49p and leaving.
p3753
aVI imagine they've improved the security angle since I saw it tried and cancelled within a month a good few years ago.
p3754
aVIf you were here before Cameron was in charge you probably wouldn't hate him so much.
p3755
aVI have to agree with your first point, I had to go through all of that malarky with my SO from hungary. 
p3756
aV&gt; Sour milk is only available in Polish shops.
p3757
aVJust sayin'\u000a\u000aOr as we call it, off milk
p3758
aVI immigrated to the UK a few years ago as well - you're spot on on all the weird bits for the most part.
p3759
aVNever had the issue with sour cream, but good peanut butter...\u000a\u000aAlso, had the same problem with cell service and TV/Internet service you had with the bank.
p3760
aV+ Horrible service on top of that...  took like 3 months for me to get internet in my house after I moved in.
p3761
aV3 - old people.
p3762
aVThe last cheque I used was 15 years ago, and the last one I received about 10.
p3763
aV4 - ticking boxes, meeting targets, and ensuring attendance is more important than productivity.
p3764
aV"It's not MY fault we didn't meet target this quarter - my department had 100% attendance.
p3765
aVBob's department had 3 people off sick!
p3766
aV" Yes, this is insane, but in this country a lobotomy is a requirement for any middle management position.
p3767
aV6 - Yes, sadly a large portion of this country, mainly Audi drivers, believe that right of way is determined by who will risk the most to collide with other road users.
p3768
aVUnfortunately modern car safety features have limited the chance for gene pool cleansing in this area.
p3769
aV12 - You know someone who is either in the wrong job, wrong transport, or living in the wrong town.
p3770
aV13 - This is our national shame.
p3771
aV14 - well at least he's not Blair/Brown.
p3772
aVOnly 99% as evil, a 1% improvement.
p3773
aV15 - Yes, living off the back of others is sadly seen as a valid career choice by a significant percentage of the population, instead of a safety net.These unfortunately tarnish the image of the others who genuinely just need a hand getting started in life, or who have fallen on hard times.
p3774
aV16 - Yours must work then.
p3775
aVThe ones here normally involve more interaction with a staff member than the normal checkout line.
p3776
aV20 - Well you see, despite supposedly having gone metric, we still measure road distances in miles.
p3777
aVMeasuring fuel consumption in litres per mile would be mixing metric and imperial units which would obviously be stupid.
p3778
aVHowever because we are mostly metric, fuel is sold in litres.
p3779
aVSo... ok, no.
p3780
aVI can't even pretend to explain this, it's absurd.
p3781
aVRE Schooling: In fairness, I think most British people realise that our GCSEs are a total joke.
p3782
aVTeenagers aren't pushed in the slightest and schools are much more interested in getting students through the exam than actually teaching them anything.
p3783
aVI like cheques.
p3784
aVI never feel comfortable carrying large sums of money; especially when it came to bringing money into school. 
p3785
aV&gt; Self-service cash registers.
p3786
aVI love them.
p3787
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p3788
aVEven better: portable scanners that I can take shopping.
p3789
aVNobody uses them but me.
p3790
aVPeople sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.
p3791
aVPortable scanners ?
p3792
aVNever seen one of those.
p3793
aVWhich shops have them?
p3794
aV?
aVTesco's near me started using them.
p3795
aVIt's just a posh calculator really.
p3796
aVcan you pay from them and thereby avoid the till?
p3797
aV[Here](http://www.tesco.com/scan-as-you-shop/).
p3798
aVIt looks like you scan all your stuff and then give it to a person on a till and they just scan that in, then you pay.
p3799
aVNo need for unloading stuff. 
p3800
aVsounds awesome, can't wait till my local shops get it...\u000acheers!
p3801
aVOur Safeway had them, I believe before it turned to Morrisons....for about a month, then without warning they all disappeared.
p3802
aVI imagine there was not much in the way of security measures and people had been filling their trolley, paying for a packet of chewing gum at the machine, then wheeling out their week's shopping, whistling cheerily to themselves.
p3803
aVNice rant, well done :)\u000a\u000aWhat's the deal with boilers in polish homes?
p3804
aVNever go wrong, or just people don't like to talk about them as much?
p3805
aVCentral heating everywhere.
p3806
aVIn bigger cities(mostly bigger communities), there is central heating.
p3807
aVI have flat in center of city in Pomerania build in 2006.
p3808
aVI have something called 'Junkers' - flow heater for water(doesn't store it as boiler and use cng instead of electricity).
p3809
aVI have also house on country side and we used cng furnace(winter) and solar panels(summer) to make water hot, furnace is also used for heating house during lower temperatures.\u000a
p3810
aVHaha!
p3811
aVBrilliant.
p3812
aVI've forwarded this on to a couple of my Polish colleagues, Micha\u0142.
p3813
aVWhile everything you say is true, finishing with point 20 was the perfect WTF.
p3814
aVI have never even questioned that once in my life.
p3815
aVDaily Mail.
p3816
aVSeriously?
p3817
aVWho buys this... thing?
p3818
aVDavid Cameron.
p3819
aVThe manipulative, populistic, clueless prick.
p3820
aVI always thought Polish politicians are the worst, but not anymore.
p3821
aVHow someone like that becomes a Prime Minister, I don't know.
p3822
aVAnd people generally believe what he says.
p3823
aVWhich brings me to...\u000a\u000aYou're now my friend.
p3824
aVlol 3 lane slaloms.
p3825
aVFavorite kind of slalom.
p3826
aVI need to move to London soon.
p3827
aVThough I spend a lot of my life in England I am somewhat not looking forward to.
p3828
aVOn the other hand, man, it can be great there! 
p3829
aVOP, next time you have fish and chips, make sure you have a cup of tea and some bread and butter too.
p3830
aVIf you're feeling adventurous, you can make a chip butty, but the tea always slips down nicely with a big, greasy plate of fish and chips! 
p3831
aVI got to the bit about boilers and just realised that I sent a snapchat to my mate of the new boiler I just bought, and had a 30 minute conversation to go with it, I like boilers.
p3832
aVWith regards to boilers;\u000a\u000aYes we have more problems than other countries because we take a much different approach (similar to America more than mainland Europe).
p3833
aVBasically Brits like their boilers on the cheap, they consider them to be a one off purchase, a one time expense.
p3834
aVWhereas other cultures take much better care of them, often have a contract with their installer who takes good care of it and services it reguarly.
p3835
aVHere if you can get it put on the wall cheap and leave it alone your laughing.
p3836
aVIt is frankly a naive and inefficient way to manage a product that you rely upon but that is the mentality by and large.
p3837
aVIs it weird for the accent to change very often?
p3838
aVbecause i feel in the UK it varies within tiny distances.
p3839
aVDoes this happen in most places? 
p3840
aVUntil about a hundred years ago or so, France was a patchwork or local dialects until the government forced a single French language on everyone.
p3841
aVThis is probably why they're so sensitive to English words making it into their language without approval from the government.
p3842
aVAnd if you've ever heard a Bavarian German complaining about his Prussian neighbours, well you start to realise that everywhere has its little variations.
p3843
aVFor centuries communities grew with little outside mixing when long distance travel and communication was at a premium.
p3844
aVAccents, slang and dialects abounded and if you moved you gradually adopted the accent and terminology.
p3845
aVBut now we travel further much more easily and communication is unrestricted, we're exposed more to these variations.
p3846
aVIf you move, you'll still find yourself adopting the accent, there's still a lot of linguistic momentum in each region, but there's also now the homogenising forces of the media and the internet, so who knows what'll happen with time...
p3847
aVSour cream is no issue in Canada.
p3848
aVSour Milk I'd not heard of, can't you just buy normal milk and leave it at the window in sunlight for a couple of days?
p3849
aV"One lump or two?
p3850
aV"
aVSour cream for your perogies buh!
p3851
aVhttp://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/jim-the-duck-comic-community-tumblr-monday.jpg\u000a\u000aU should make a bunch of those about uk
p3852
aVI agree with the part about being ill.
p3853
aVHowever work places expect you to be like a robot and having a sick day is only acceptable if you almost died.
p3854
aVWell that's what it feel like most of the time.
p3855
aVAt my place you get a lot of "are you sure?
p3856
aV" and "have you called the doctors?
p3857
aV" and "see if you feel better later".
p3858
aVYes I am sure I am ill, no I haven't called the doctors if it was that serious I would be there and not talking to you on the phone, and if I thought I was going to feel better I'd be sitting at my desk already.
p3859
aVI get it, they don't want people skiving off work, and some people do make more excuses than you could even think.
p3860
aVBut come on, I almost didn't get a promotion at work for having 2 separate sick days, about 8 months apart, and had to have 2 weeks off due to being hospitalised.
p3861
aVThis was over a whole year and it's not even a high paid job.
p3862
aVI loved this!
p3863
aVYou could collect these observations and make a small book out of them!
p3864
aV:))
p3865
aV20- No idea 
p3866
aVHear, hear!
p3867
aVYou clearly haven't lived in London if you're applauding the British parking set up.
p3868
aVThis guy you mentioned who spends a third of his salary on rail fare only to be able to afford to get to work and back?
p3869
aVHis alternatives are spending 3/4 of it on a mix of petrol and London parking fees (with the latter constituting a greater share) or getting a better paid job, a couple of housemates and living in London.
p3870
aVAfter having spent my last 10 years in London I've developed a case of "london fatigue", anyhow, I recommend "Capital" by John Lanchester.
p3871
aVAs for the Daily Mail...
p3872
aVI dabble.
p3873
aVThey all have their uses though.
p3874
aVTake the Guardian, splendid culture reviews and if ever one is short on red wallpaper... ;-)\u000a\u000aPs.
p3875
aVWhich parts of Polska dla Polaków do you hail from?
p3876
aVPPS.
p3877
aVr/polandball 
p3878
aVI swear so many people would be happier on half the wages at an employer 10 minutes away rather than 40 grand for a job in central London and the commuting.
p3879
aV&gt;1.
p3880
aVBanks\u000a\u000a Do they do post office accounts instead though?
p3881
aVNumbers 13 and 14 are my favourite!
p3882
aVCheques are hugely necessary.
p3883
aVLucky you that you have no transactions requiring them.
p3884
aVI wrote my first cheque in over six years the other day.
p3885
aVIt felt like defeat.
p3886
aVBank transfers all the way.
p3887
aVI got teased for referring to the boiler as a furnace.
p3888
aV:( It looks like one! 
p3889
aVThe bank observation is so true.
p3890
aVI recently became self employed and trying to open a business account was a nightmare.
p3891
aVIt felt like I was being interrogated.
p3892
aVI just wanted somewhere to put my money, you would of thought I was trying to rob the place.
p3893
aVI've moved to the UK from poland 10 years ago and I still don't understand  the vinegar on chips and crisps thing.
p3894
aVGreat stuff.
p3895
aVPint or a vodka sometime?
p3896
aV&gt;You're here just to execute my orders, not to bloody educate me on how to handle personal finances.
p3897
aVThis line early on Sec 2. is when I quit reading in a Polish accent and went straight to my best British.
p3898
aVThis dude is already British as shit.
p3899
aVJust in denial is all. 
p3900
aVAs a Brit living in Poland, it 'aint so rosy here mate.
p3901
aVI can relate to number 4.
p3902
aVI am a "temp" at a company (called a temp, but how long a temp actually is and how long a temp should be is quite different where I work) and as such, I am not entitled to benefits like pension, bonuses and sick days.
p3903
aVIf I do not work, I don't get paid.
p3904
aVOu put my feeling for Cameron into tangible words, where as before I'd just say "Fucking Cameron..." And swear a lot afterwards
p3905
aVWherever I do that, the site I commented on subsequently gets flagged as porn due to the language.
p3906
aVHeyooooo
p3907
aVThey still use steam boilers for heat there? 
p3908
aVNope, our boilers don't boil water they merely heat it to a reasonable temperature.
p3909
aVAlso driving directions.
p3910
aVI swear, get three English people in a room and you'll get a turn-by-turn description of every possible route to get there.
p3911
aVHow does GPS sell in this country anyway?
p3912
aVNever really understood the banks charging you for being over drawn when you have no money... Its just an easy way for them to make money!
p3913
aVIts happened to me a few times and every time it has I've rang them and contested it.
p3914
aVWorks like a charm every time, never had to pay over drawn fees! 
p3915
aVLouis CK covered this really 'Hi there, this is your bank calling, we need to tell you that you don't have any money'\u000a'Um, yeah, I know that'\u000a'Yeah, well, that's a problem, and as you don't have any money, we need to charge you $15... which we need to give to a really rich guy as a reward for having loads of money'.
p3916
aVI swear, it sucks when you have to refuse free stuff because you have less than no money.
p3917
aVFuck is a tyre?
p3918
aV- Merica'
p3919
aV&gt; Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p3920
aVBecause there are 4 or 5 litres to the gallon.
p3921
aVSobvious.
p3922
aVHello Michal :) Fellow Polish here, but with a much longer "residency" in the UK (9 years and counting...).
p3923
aVI could add a couple of things to your list, get rid of few, but it is surprising that they are pretty much similar.
p3924
aV1.
p3925
aVBanks - I fully agree with those.
p3926
aVIt used to drive me mad, but since everything can be done online, I simply stopped thinking about it.
p3927
aV2.
p3928
aVI am a freelancer and work at home.
p3929
aVWell OK, anywhere where the Internet is, which is almost everywhere.
p3930
aVWhen I worked at school (6 years - high school and colleges) sick people did not come to teach, because that meant spreading the diseases, so I guess it depends.
p3931
aV3.
p3932
aVTea with milk - god, no.
p3933
aVSalt and vinegar crisps and chips - hell yeah.
p3934
aVI sort of got "infected" with them by my son.
p3935
aVHis fault.
p3936
aVYes, I do like them.
p3937
aV4.
p3938
aVWeather!
p3939
aVIt might be crazy but I love English weather - warm summers and mild winters.
p3940
aVI never want to go back to snow (up to -30 in winter in Poland!
p3941
aV) and scorching sun (+40 in summer!).
p3942
aV15-20 degrees is perfect.
p3943
aV5.
p3944
aVParking and driving in general - It is shockingly easy to drive here (parking - well, if you are confident).
p3945
aVI drove left-hand drive vehicle for 7 years and I have never had any issues with driving, parking or the police.
p3946
aVPeople are generally kind, calm and you never have issues to join the traffic.
p3947
aV6.
p3948
aVCustomer service - sorry, but it is simply incomparable with Polish one.
p3949
aVI spent a week in July in Poland.
p3950
aVNot a single person smiled, looked in the eyes or made me feel welcome in any shop whatsoever.
p3951
aV7.
p3952
aVEducation - again, it depends where you "land".
p3953
aVI am a qualified teacher/lecturer and I have been working in education here for 9 years, so I could write a book about it.
p3954
aVI also have a son who finished primary school and just started high school, so I guess I know a lot about every key stage.
p3955
aVIt is a completely different world - it has advantages and disadvantages.
p3956
aVIf a parent bothers to find a good school and makes a serious effort in the child's education, then it beats Polish education by a mile.
p3957
aVIn fact, it was one of the most important factors of my arrival to UK - to be able to send my son to school here.
p3958
aVOfsted reports will give some basic indication of the school's quality, it is possible to see most schools in action, talk to students and parents.
p3959
aVOK, I'll stop here :)\u000a\u000a8.
p3960
aVI can't praise the paramedics/health care and police enough.
p3961
aVThose few occasions that I had to use the services were shockingly positive.
p3962
aVThe staff was always polite, professional and supportive.
p3963
aVI was never once "sent away with paracetamol" or ignored by the police.
p3964
aVIt was just the opposite.
p3965
aVYes, I am well aware NHS is a bureaucratic mess.
p3966
aVI sometimes do projects for them.
p3967
aV9.
p3968
aVTransport - buses - in my area are terrible -pricey and rare.
p3969
aVTrains - by far my favourite mode of transport but so terribly expensive.
p3970
aVI love travelling by trains!
p3971
aVEspecially to London!
p3972
aV10.
p3973
aVSelf-employment.
p3974
aVOh.
p3975
aVYes, no paperwork.
p3976
aVNo visits to the offices.
p3977
aVNo dealing with incompetent workers.
p3978
aVOh, no one is trying to destroy my company with constant inspections, taxes, forms, fees and whole load of Polish crap.
p3979
aVIn fact, it is just the opposite.
p3980
aVI am being offered help at any time to deal with the tax man properly and efficiently.
p3981
aVThis is beyond comparison with Polish reality.
p3982
aVI will be getting my British passport at some point this year and at the moment, despite quite a few bits that drive me mad (insurance companies!
p3983
aV), I would not change this place for anything else in the world.
p3984
aVI have a fantastic career, own house, friends and family here.
p3985
aVThis is my place too :)\u000a
p3986
aVI'm from the UK and some of what you say is very accurate (banks, boilers, petrol in litres, vinegar on chips).
p3987
aVThe boiler part had me laughing.
p3988
aVThe bank fees and train fares are both ridiculous too.
p3989
aVBut you need to say no to the insurance sellers!
p3990
aVWhat you described as normal in Poland is also normal here.
p3991
aVNot sure about the comments about customer service and attitude to education.
p3992
aVSounds like you're not in a great area?
p3993
aVOn the topic of education, and as someone who's just come out of it, I think you have a fair point.
p3994
aVI disliked school immensely.
p3995
aVOne year I had an attendance rate of 55%, and yet I was still credited as a hard working student for placing in the top three percent.
p3996
aVI did the very bare minimal, just quickly, on time, with a well learned syllabus.
p3997
aVSaying that, when I missed exam days, I would take them when I came in, in another classroom.
p3998
aVWhich class?
p3999
aVThe lowest graded children.
p4000
aVHaving sat through three classes of 30+ children being taught shapes and dimensions in year 11 was mind-boggling.
p4001
aVThey were taught to achieve C's, being drilled the same information for hours and hours.
p4002
aVOn the other hand, adults are constantly telling us how easy we have it today compared to them.
p4003
aVHow our exams are easy, how easy it is to find a job, we're just lazy.
p4004
aVRadio stations for call-in critics telling us how much harder O-levels were, stories of studies where teens fail old O-level test papers.
p4005
aVAt the end of the day, we're teaching kids to study and pursue their own interests, but that doesn't guarantee employment.
p4006
aVI can tell you all about old English authors, of renaissance scientists, the rise and fall of empires, and religions... but changing a light fitting?
p4007
aVI'd have to find a youtube video.
p4008
aVDrain a radiator?
p4009
aVYoutube.
p4010
aVSchool teaches you a little of everything, and then encourages you to specialize, leaving with a narrow set of skills, and a wide birth of inapplicable knowledge that you'll never, ever require.
p4011
aVI believe the system is an irreparable clusterfuck that fuels generation after generations complaints, ultimately achieving nothing.
p4012
aVPerhaps I'm too cynical. 
p4013
aVI have been here for roughly 60 days from the USA and I can say it's been interesting....
p4014
aVI echo the parking.
p4015
aVThe good ol US government gave me a Ford F350 to drive here, in America this is no big deal, but driving that here feels like a damn school bus, with parking designed for motorcycles, haha.
p4016
aVDriving down the street and literally seeing cars scattered everywhere was amusing....
p4017
aVThe cursing here is on a whole different level and I love it.
p4018
aVTrying to figure out the 'level' of frustration in the choice of words was interesting and the use of the "C" word here is unrestricted unlike America..\u000a\u000aRound-a-bouts.... Intially fucking hated them.... Now, huge fan.
p4019
aVI hardly have to stop!
p4020
aVHowever, heavy traffic areas, they blow.
p4021
aVIn america where I live there is like one roundabout in a 200 mile radius and it is a "test".
p4022
aVBikes, what is the obsession?
p4023
aVWomen fashion, I've seen more boob just walking around London here and it's not even attempted to be hidden lol, seem very free here compared to where I live.
p4024
aVPubs, everything seems to be a greene king with a different name?
p4025
aVI truly have enjoyed it here, I have seen very cool sites, lots of history, and Sampled some awesome beers.... With that being said, I leave in a few days... Been fun!
p4026
aVWho in God's name thought that an F350 was a good plan in the UK?
p4027
aVI mean, I've driven large pickup trucks and I've driven in the UK (fortunately, not at the same time), and the thought of putting the two together sounds like a complete nightmare.
p4028
aVAll they had for us , haha.
p4029
aVIt is funny driving around and seeing all the locals stare at us, I can only imagine what they are thinking, haha.
p4030
aVOn the banks thing I have a two fold answer, first and foremost the level of fraud in the UK, from both citizens and immigrants, is rife as fuck.
p4031
aVThe account opening is so intense to try and prevent as much of this as possible.
p4032
aVTrust me it is as annoying for us as it is for you.
p4033
aV(can confirm.
p4034
aVAm bank staff.
p4035
aV)\u000a\u000aSecond; (from my own personal experience) customers from Poland usually only want a simple account with a card and direct debits ect, totally understandable.
p4036
aVBanks do not want this, this provides no profit for them.
p4037
aVThey want you to take 'the package'.
p4038
aVThis includes a fee paying current account, savings, ISA and a good old insurance policy if you can pull it off.
p4039
aVIf these things aren't set up you get a whole heap of shit from the man upstairs.
p4040
aVBecause of this you will find that the member of staff may try and make you take a basic account (cash-card) or just fob you off to another bank.
p4041
aVShitty but true.
p4042
aVFortunately thanks to the splitting of the FSA and the shitstorm laid down after the recent scandals (PPI, Rate fixing) all of this is likely to disappear.
p4043
aVAnd I'm guessing this is also why banks in the UK are reluctant to open accounts for non-residents?
p4044
aVPretty much yeah, it is possible to open them but usually staff will try not too.
p4045
aVDirect Debits.
p4046
aVA direct debit (dd) is an authority that allows a third party to debit your account for a set amount at a set time.
p4047
aVYou agree that there will be money in the account to meet the payment.
p4048
aVThis isn't a payment sent by the bank; it's a payment claimed from the bank by someone else.
p4049
aVRe 6: You're very wrong and you've caused many people to contemplate murdering you.
p4050
aVI wish I could stay off ill when I'm ill.
p4051
aVIt would totally screw my colleagues over though so my only choice is to work through it. 
p4052
aV4) - Nigdy nie pracuj w Koreii - Idziez do roboty, nie wazne w jakim stanie i co mozez zrobic tego dnia; maz po prostu byc.
p4053
aVNumber 20 baffles me the most. 
p4054
aVCompletely and utterly agree with you in regards to driving.
p4055
aVDriving in the UK is an absolute pleasure compared to what I've seen in other countries.
p4056
aVEverything is extremely well organised.
p4057
aVYour points on school is kinda false from my own experience.
p4058
aVIf you don't put in any effort you won't get anything back.
p4059
aVBut then I guess it depends on the school your son goes to.
p4060
aVMy hairdresser is also fine.
p4061
aVCertainly I ballsed up school horribly because no-one could explain the value to me, and then returning to retake GCSEs as an adult, I sure as hell paid attention and did the damn work, and it paid off.
p4062
aVI still think there should be a gap before the last few years of school, where kids have to go do food service or retail for a year.
p4063
aVWhen they return, they'll study their arses off to ensure good grades to never have to stand behind a checkout or a fryer again.
p4064
aV15 and 16 seem related.
p4065
aVThe only one I want to call you out on (that is to say the one I object to most - I disagree with several) is the Middle Lane Motorist one.
p4066
aVYou're either going fast enough to over-take the truck, in which case you should get past it and get back into the inside lane, or you're not in which case you shouldn't be in the middle bloody lane anyway.
p4067
aVGiven all those cars go past you, that might suggest a problem with the approach, no?
p4068
aVYou can actually get sour milk from almost all Eastern European shops here in the UK - just saying 
p4069
aV"to have my custom"\u000a\u000aWhat does that mean?
p4070
aVAccording to Merriam Webster online, Third definition, "a :  business patronage"\u000a\u000aInteresting fact, it is derived from the latin word Consuetudo (Con-sue-eh-two-do), which means a habit.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4071
aVWouldn't one say "take my business elsewhere?
p4072
aV"
aVThe way he said it was in reference to business patronage.
p4073
aVIt has more brevity.
p4074
aVOne syllable less is brevity?
p4075
aVIt's also dependent on the concise nature of the words.
p4076
aVIt takes skill and thought to write a brevite sentence.
p4077
aVWhat an excellent post, this should become a subreddit.
p4078
aVI use checks to pay my rent, and to purchase art from galleries.
p4079
aVIf I wire money, it costs an extra $15, and why waste money when you don't have to.  
p4080
aVIn response to the ill at work part, bosses are fucking cunts sometimes.
p4081
aVSure, if I feel like i'm ridden with ebola with one day left to live, I know I will not be able to work properly and I sure as hell don't want to go in, but my boss is a heartless machine.
p4082
aVI've worked in this nearby Co-op for 6 months now and never missed a day, unlike all of my colleges.
p4083
aVI called in the morning, 7 hours before my shift, to say that I was vomiting uncontrollably with diarrhoea to which he responded "That's not my problem" and would not accept my pleas to die in peace.
p4084
aVI couldn't bring myself to go in, in the end.
p4085
aVI was almost fired for it. 
p4086
aVMy place is supposed to have a system, kind of like a 3-strikes system.
p4087
aVWithin 6 months, First time is a "back to work meeting", Your team-leader just asks you why you were off.
p4088
aVSecond is a "recorded discussion", No idea what that atually means, i've personally not been on one.
p4089
aVThird strike is a meeting with HR.
p4090
aVFinal time and you're out.
p4091
aVBut your boss takes the cake, At least my HR ask "are you sure you can't try to come in?
p4092
aV" No, i'm sure, the customer isn't going to be happy about me cutting a phone-call short to loudly die in the toilets.
p4093
aVI feel you on #6.
p4094
aVThis happened to me today and is all too often in Canada too.
p4095
aVIt amazes me when I merge out of the fast lane going 120 km/h and people are still able to whip past me. 
p4096
aVThere is only one driving lane and thats the left, others are for overtaking and it keeps the roads running smoothly, time it right and use a signal and most drivers will let you out into the middle to overtake that lorry without losing speed.. Lazy people sit in the middle lane and complacency isn't appropriate whilst driving 3+ tonnes of steel at 70mph\u000a
p4097
aV&gt; I've never seen anything like that before outside Russia.
p4098
aVI was born in Russia, (USSR), and go back a few times a year to visit family in and around Moscow.
p4099
aVIt always seems fairly clean to me.
p4100
aVCleaner than some other big cities I've been to.
p4101
aVBut otherwise, this stuff is brilliant.
p4102
aVI know my parents used to think like this when we moved here.
p4103
aVWhilst I assimilated and lost my accent and learned to love Fish &amp; Chips and the like, they still don't understand the concept of drinking non-alcoholic beverages in your spare time.
p4104
aV*Saying it's not dirty, I mean there's not huge amounts of litter erry' where.
p4105
aVSome places out in the deep get really fucking dirty in the rasputitsa.
p4106
aVYou don't happen to work in the ambassadorial field, do you?
p4107
aVNope.
p4108
aVOk thanks.
p4109
aVI know a Michal from Poland working in the UK, but he's in international relations.
p4110
aVAmerican here poking in from the /r/bestof link.
p4111
aVBy boilers, do you mean what we call [water heaters?
p4112
aV](http://ronaldtcurtisplumbing.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/suncity-water-heater-005.jpg) Or do you mean a boiler that creates steam to heat your house/flat?
p4113
aV[deleted]
p4114
aVMetric is (or was anyway) very much "imposed" upon the British people, and we've never really got on with it on the whole.
p4115
aVAsk the average Brit how tall they are and they'll tell you in feet and inches, but when you go to the doctor he will measure you in meters to calculate your BMI.
p4116
aVIn general, imperial is used for colloquial everyday measurements whilst metric is used for official figures or where there is a need to be very precise.
p4117
aVOunces for example are hardly ever used because grams is a lot more precise, but equally kilometers are hardly ever used because a mile is a reasonable enough measurement to use.
p4118
aVThe real fun ofc comes when you say something weighs "a ton" since both imperial and metric use the word "ton(ne)" as a unit of mass.
p4119
aV16.
p4120
aVSo you like people not having jobs/replaced by kiosks?
p4121
aV19 is hilarious..and true.
p4122
aVI agree to the last one, totally, Why can't we scrap the bizzare imperial units and purely have metric units?
p4123
aVOh man!
p4124
aVI love the "boilers" one.
p4125
aVYou must have a good boiler or you're no one.
p4126
aVAgree with it all except 18.
p4127
aVI'm a big sour cream fan and I can buy it in most supermarkets!
p4128
aVSour milk?
p4129
aVPlease elaborate
p4130
aVCultured Milk
p4131
aVI'm sorry but I have to strongly disagree with number 6.
p4132
aVThe middle lane is an overtaking lane, if you're not overtaking then move to the left.
p4133
aVThat's basic highway code.
p4134
aVYea, fuck the Daily Mail.
p4135
aVI will just say quickly that GCSEs are a piece of piss, but A-levels are actually difficult and require application of knowledge to solve problems in many cases.
p4136
aVMany of us go on to do A levels and nearly half of us (I read recently it was about 49% I believe) end up going to uni.
p4137
aVEducation is fucked at the GCSE level.
p4138
aVA-levels were okay but now they're 'reforming them' (read: fucking them up) without fixing the couple core problems first.
p4139
aV[We are ranked (by Pearson) as 2nd for education in Europe and 6th globally.
p4140
aV](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27314075)\u000a\u000aI just wanted to mention this simply because I feel a lot of teens are regularly shat upon by politicians and misinformed adults in the UK, where our exam records go up and up year on year, our students are more motivated than ever - and yet they're still told its because its so easy and 'back in my day we had it harder'.
p4141
aVThat may be true of GCSEs, but everything post-GCSE is *much* harder than it is often given credit for.
p4142
aVYoung people in the UK have it hard enough knowing that their degrees and training won't guarantee a stable job - they don't need baby boomers shitting on them from their positions that they got into with a couple relevant archaic O-levels.
p4143
aV&gt; 3.Cheques.
p4144
aVWho the hell uses cheques?
p4145
aVIt's XXI century.
p4146
aVCheques are awesome because they're a physical payment method you can use without fear of it being stolen or misappropriated.
p4147
aVYou can give someone the cheque as you would cash but at the same time you can carry it around and nobody can steal it (well they can steal the cheque but not the money).
p4148
aVThey're also useful if you need to hand over a large sum physically.
p4149
aVRather than a duffle bag full of notes you can write a cheque for £10,000 and be done.
p4150
aVAs long as cash remains relevant, cheques will too - electronic payment isn't always possible or practical, particularly for older people or those without internet access.
p4151
aV&gt; 15.A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council.
p4152
aVSo, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14?
p4153
aVAnd if yes, is that intentional?
p4154
aVSort of.
p4155
aVThe reason people can live off benefits so easily is because the previous Labour government (lasting 13 years) hugely expanded the welfare state (using borrowed money) to the point where it actually started to make sense to live off welfare rather than working, particularly if work was scarce.
p4156
aVThen the recession hit, jobs (particularly better-paid ones) became scarce and so naturally people just sat around at home on benefits instead of going out to work for less than they'd recieve otherwise.
p4157
aVThis issue was perhaps compounded by the open-border with Europe which was also affected by the recession so a lot of people (willing to work for less than most Brits) came here looking for work.
p4158
aVCameron was then elected (well, nearly.
p4159
aVHe needed some help from Clegg) to try and sort the whole mess out and whilst he's made some progress there's still a lot of work to be done.
p4160
aV&gt; 16.Self-service cash registers.
p4161
aVI love them.
p4162
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p4163
aVEven better: portable scanners that I can take shopping.
p4164
aVNobody uses them but me.
p4165
aVPeople sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.
p4166
aVBrits aren't generally huge fans of automation.
p4167
aVWe love technology but we have to be in control.
p4168
aVA good example is automatic cars - you don't see many here, whilst in the US they're everywhere.
p4169
aVBrits like the manual gearbox because we don't trust some newfangled thinkerbot computer to do things for us.
p4170
aVWe know what gear we want, and we're quite capable of changing it ourselves thank you very much.
p4171
aVThis extends to trusting another human more than we trust the device.
p4172
aV&gt; 18.Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing.
p4173
aVIt's considered gone-off or spoiled that's why.
p4174
aVIf milk goes like that we chuck it out, or perhaps sigh disappointedly and decide to make scones with it since that's about all it's good for.
p4175
aV&gt; 19.WTF is it with boilers?
p4176
aVCold, wet country with small homes so the boiler represents not only a major element in the house physically, but also functionally because it's responsible for heating I guess.
p4177
aV&gt; 20.Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?
p4178
aVBecause some genius decided we should adopt the metric system, but nobody liked it and most people kept using imperial anyway despite it being literally illegal to do so in a lot of cases, so ultimately we arrived at this stupid situation where, as you point out, some stuff is in imperial and some is metric.
p4179
aVGenerally, imperial is used colloquially but metric is used officially - miles are an exception, presumably arising from the fact that the average UK roaduser has almost no idea how long a kilometer really is relative to a mile and getting them used to it would be too much of a ballache.
p4180
aVPersonally, I prefer imperial for almost everything.
p4181
aVI only use metric for scientific work.
p4182
aV&gt;Banks.
p4183
aVTo open a current account was way too tricky.
p4184
aVWell the UK has a lot of immigrants from the 3rd world, perhaps Poland not so much.
p4185
aVGot to watch out for those Nigerian princes.  
p4186
aVIn Canada we buy gas in litres, drive in KMs yet car dealerships insist on selling cars based on UK MPG
p4187
aVNumber 4  I love.
p4188
aVdon't forget about schools being on your back if your kids takes a few days off to get over the flu or whatever exotic lurgy is currently doing the rounds and being spread by those who have gone in!
p4189
aVAlso no sympathy for periods, even though my girl's passed out from it in the school office before!
p4190
aVFFS, people aren't machines!
p4191
aVAnyway, welcome to  the island - there's plenty more weird stuff waiting to be discovered!
p4192
aVAt least you speak English.
p4193
aVI only use sour milk for scones, what do you use it for? 
p4194
aVwould be pointless to have mileage in kilometres per gallon, frankly.
p4195
aVAtleast know in Chicago you can get sour cream where ever you want.   
p4196
aVSour cream double taps
p4197
aV.6 Middlelane!!
p4198
aVGot that down to a tee and made me chuckle.
p4199
aVGood one!
p4200
aV-I've never seen anything like that before outside Russia.
p4201
aVThat's sounds weird.
p4202
aVI've been to Russia &amp; Poland &amp; Poles are alot messier in general.
p4203
aVRussians are pretty fastidious.
p4204
aVInteresting to compare this to Canada.
p4205
aVNow I know who to blame.
p4206
aVLOL.
p4207
aVYou should try the US!!!
p4208
aVYou would have a heart attack!
p4209
aVYou can get buttermilk (sour milk) in most big supermarkets.
p4210
aVI bought some from sainsburys yesterday 
p4211
aVFor 18.
p4212
aVTry looking for Crème fraîche instead.
p4213
aVSource: I'm a big sour creme fan too.
p4214
aVThe speed camera thing must be the area you live in?
p4215
aVThey're every bloody mile on most of the roads I know..
p4216
aVOh god, number 19 is so true.
p4217
aVNumber 6.
p4218
aVThere are 2 points here, and it seems that you don't get it yet.
p4219
aVPlease don't read this as a criticism of your driving, but more as an explanation as to why changing your driving makes sense (for you and others).
p4220
aVI enjoyed your post immensely, I miss so much about my home country, other things not so much (I'm talking to you, weather!
p4221
aV) \u000a\u000aThe first point is on safety.
p4222
aVYou may not realise it from your position, but it is exceptionally dangerous in the circumstances when two drivers travelling at different speeds, but faster than you arrive at the same time.
p4223
aVThey both have to judge and so just their speed, looking around unnecessarily.
p4224
aVAt high speeds the potential for driver error (not everyone is an amazing driver, sad fact of life that we have to deal with) is increased.
p4225
aVIt's pointless, just move over, consider others.
p4226
aVWhy do you feel the need to sit in the middle?
p4227
aV(Genuine question, please answer.
p4228
aV) \u000a\u000a\u000aSecondly, you should only really leave the left hand lane in order to overtake, it's the law.
p4229
aVNow, I and many others adopt a more dynamic approach.
p4230
aVYou have stated it seems ridiculous to hassle someone and then overtake at only a couple of mph faster...
p4231
aVBut you wouldn't think this if they were travelling that speed, having not had to get you to move over.
p4232
aVAs for the dynamic approach, I think there is nothing wrong with little burst of gentle acceleration in order to overtake a vehicle that is travelling very slightly slower than you.
p4233
aVYou may well be breaking the speed limit for a couple of hundred metres, you won't be burning in hell for that.
p4234
aVIn this way, you can accelerate into the traffic flow, when there is a reasonable gap, overtaking that Eddie Stobart, pulling back in and settling back to your comfortable speed, leaving the maximum amount of carriageway free for other road users.
p4235
aVThe only reason you would ever get stuck behind a slow coach in the left hand lane and is poor anticipation, particularly on motorways you should be looking round constantly checking mirrors (and blindspots if you need to) and always have a pretty good idea of what the traffic is doing 10, 15, 20, even 30 seconds from now.
p4236
aVParticularly large, slow moving vehicles... You can see them for miles, why not react sooner.
p4237
aVSource: I'm a motorcyclist, poor/inconsiderate driving technique normally translates as dangerous for me.
p4238
aVI'm also a British chap living in Marseille, where I constantly feel like the shoddy attitude of other drivers is nothing short of criminal negligence and downright murderous. 
p4239
aV&gt; 16.Self-service cash registers.
p4240
aVI love them.
p4241
aVBut why do I seem to be in a minority?
p4242
aVEven better: portable scanners that I can take shopping.
p4243
aVNobody uses them but me.
p4244
aVPeople sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.
p4245
aVthese things are the BEST I'm really annoyed that only Tescos does the ones you carry around cause I've fallen out with Tescos :/ C'mon morrisons, you gotta up your game here.
p4246
aV&gt; 18.Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing.
p4247
aVSour milk is only available in Polish shops.
p4248
aVJust sayin'\u000a\u000athis bugs me too, there's "sour cream" but it's like.. awful.
p4249
aVWe buy "crème freshe" which is much more like the sour cream I loved in aussie. 
p4250
aVNumber 6.
p4251
aVSitting in the middle lane for no reason is illegal btw.
p4252
aVMight want to read up on uk road rules.
p4253
aVI'm sitting there for a reason - read my update to the original post.
p4254
aVYes in your update you suggest that if you move in you'll be stuck behind a truck.
p4255
aVSo you're not really sitting in the middle lane but using it for passing.
p4256
aVOnce you've passed that truck then you move into the inside lane.
p4257
aVIt's pretty simple really - be in the most inside lane you can be unless passing something.
p4258
aVAlso, cruise control can be increased/decreased so anticipate your surroundings and adjust accordingly to go with the flow of traffic and cause minimal disruption.
p4259
aVSo many road issues are caused by people just not giving a shit about anyone else around them.
p4260
aVHighly entertaining old chap, jolly good.
p4261
aVWhat you do - that's not what "hogging the middle lane" is.
p4262
aVYou're using it correctly.
p4263
aV:)
p4264
aVIt's not just Cameron -- all politicians over here are, in general, utterly out of touch with the country they're governing; no matter the party.
p4265
aVEtonians, Harovians; almost all are educated privately.
p4266
aVThis is, of course, coming from someone who also was educated privately.
p4267
aVAnd why is it that all our politicians are wealthy, privately-educated, and out of touch?
p4268
aVBecause the state education system is, overall, a fucking travesty.
p4269
aVDon't get me wrong, you can find a good state school here and there, but when you look at how we educate our children, you see just how much of a mess we'll be in soon.
p4270
aVWe're failing bright kids.
p4271
aVI say bring back free grammar schools in every county -- we can't keep failing intelligent children.
p4272
aVAs to 15.
p4273
aVIf you want to stay dumb, you'll stay dumb and live your life because you wanted it to be so.
p4274
aVIf you want to achieve something - and are in a good school - then the level of knowledge is much higher.
p4275
aVI was talking to my Polish friend about education etc.
p4276
aVand he has shown me the equivalent of our A-Levels (Maturity exam or something like that?
p4277
aV) and the Maths exam took me a good half and hour, maybe 40 minutes and consisted of everything I was taught in the first year of my A-Levels... okay, maybe a bit of the second year too.
p4278
aVThe difference is that here you gain a lot of knowledge in (most commonly) 3 - 4 subjects whereas he said that in Poland you study extra 5 - 8 that you don't write an exam in but still have to pass.
p4279
aVI can see why Maths (for example) would be hindered.
p4280
aVin other words if you are lucky enough to be in a good school with proactive teachers or have parents who urge you to do well....
p4281
aVProblem is that schools here often do not even bother inspiring kids.
p4282
aVIts all menial.
p4283
aVAnd you end up with generations of people whose career is to farm babies and milk the councils.
p4284
aVNot really, just if you have an ambition and want to do well, I know a lot people who were in 'bad' schools or schools considered to be the worst in the city, and yet they manage to get into a good college / university because they tried hard.
p4285
aVIn every country there is a difference of educational classes in population because a lot of people are contempt with knowing less and living their life 'easy'.
p4286
aVEven if you have a strict educational programme you will not be able to force knowledge into kids/people that don't want to learn it - and quite sadly it is often quite a big number of them.
p4287
aVI have been lucky to attend a really great school where the teachers were - as you say - proactive and comparing it to some other schools it was really strict.
p4288
aVStill, a huge amount of people ended their education there and then and a lot of them didn't achieve awesome grades, just because they didn't want to.
p4289
aVGCSEs mean very little but at the same time you stand at the point of being able to determine your future.
p4290
aVMy friend was denied help from her school/college in doing maths.
p4291
aVShe has studied 2 modules on her own with some help from a tutor (and me).
p4292
aVShe herself registered for the two tests and passed them with an A and a B.
p4293
aVThen she re-applied for the second year of Maths and Passed it overall with a B and got into Computer Science at the University she wanted to go to.
p4294
aVAll you need is to really want to achieve and do good.
p4295
aVUnfortunately a huge part of the society chooses the 'easy' way.
p4296
aVI am not denying that there are exceptional people who work hard and overcome the social inertia.
p4297
aVHowever sad reality is for the most part - kids are what we raise them to be.
p4298
aVIf school and parents fail - the kids usually ... well like the OP said about that girl.
p4299
aVIf you are not overtaking you should be as far left as you can be, on any multi lane road.
p4300
aVIt's fun to have to undertake an outside lane stormtrooper white Audi in the outside lane of a 5 lane motorway at 3am.
p4301
aVAs a professional assassin, how do you ensure the target is eliminated in other countries without the double tap?
p4302
aVWhy wouldn't you use it?
p4303
aVMaybe it uses twice the bullets but they're hardly expensive now, are they?
p4304
aV6.
p4305
aVMiddle lane drivers wind me up, you should not be sat in the middle lane, *however*, this mentality is clearly cause by people who don't pull into the right hand lane when the person in the left lane comes up behind a lorry.
p4306
aVIn my opinion, if someone has the courtesy to obey the rules and use the left lane (as I do even though I sit at 85-90mph) then if I see that that person may need to pull out in front of me, I pull over to let them pull out also.
p4307
aVProvided that there is noone coming up behind me in the outside lane.
p4308
aVI hate people that pull out in front of faster moving traffic.
p4309
aVTLDR: Obey the traffic rules, for I am an angry man.
p4310
aV&gt;Dental\u000a\u000a\u000a:(
p4311
aVEven with the charges of NHS dentistry, it's so much cheaper and more affordable than any other option.
p4312
aVA checkup is in the £20's.
p4313
aVYou can get an extensive amount of work done for £45 (Including the initial checkup) and that includes root canals.
p4314
aVIts not perfect, but goddamn, when I hear my friends paying £60 or so for a checkup and then hundreds for any work, I am so goddamn thankful that I have an NHS dentist.\u000a
p4315
aVThe fact that some of your friends can't get an NHS dentist is kind of what I was hinting at.
p4316
aVIt's luck of the draw if you can actually get an NHS dentist where you live. 
p4317
aVNot sure if it is based on location, I live in Nottingham and I have never had trouble finding a NHS dentist is the three areas of Nottingham that I have lived.
p4318
aVNo more than 2, maybe 3 at most phone calls to get on a NHS dentist.
p4319
aVSame here, I've got two NHS dentists within walking distance of home and both of them are actively trying to recruit more NHS patients at the moment.
p4320
aV[deleted]
p4321
aVDepends where you are looking.
p4322
aVThe one I use is on Derby Road (https://www.nhs.uk/Services/dentists/MapsAndDirections/DefaultView.aspx?id=23684) I had no trouble getting on as a patient, and never more than a week or so to get an appointment.
p4323
aVWaiting time there isnt long when there
p4324
aVI use the one at the [university of Nottingham](http://www.crippsdentalcentre.co.uk/crippsdentalcentre/index.aspx).
p4325
aVYou don't have to be a student.
p4326
aVI got seen to and a filling within 2 weeks of first ringing up, would recommend.
p4327
aVThanks for all these recommendations!
p4328
aVI am indeed also in Nottingham and in need of a new dentist.\u000a
p4329
aVI was going to say the same - and I'm in Nottingham too.
p4330
aVEvery dentist I walk past says 'Accepting new NHS patients' or something similar.
p4331
aVMaybe it's a regional issue?
p4332
aVThey never even tried.
p4333
aVTheir family just stuck with a family dentist that was private. 
p4334
aVFuck, it makes you think how much stuff isn't true on reddit because the people telling you the stories don't realize.
p4335
aVIt's precisely why you shouldn't form an idea of any complex system\u005cphenomenon based on anecdotes.
p4336
aVEvery single individual point of view is limited, inevitably biased and lacks context.
p4337
aVWhen you read about a person that received subpar care at an NHS facility, the tale might horrify you, but neither you nor the person in question might now that the substandard care was due to the poor job done by a private contractor, for example, that was forced on the facility by 'liberalization'.
p4338
aVWait...It's hard to find an NHS dentist?
p4339
aVI like in Gateshead and there's more than enough choice in my area. 
p4340
aVYeah, I was thinking the same, theres at least 4 within walking distance of Gosforth, where I live. 
p4341
aVJust depends where you live.
p4342
aVI've lived in:\u000a\u000a* Leicester - plenty of NHS dentists to choose from\u000a* York - was only able to get on a waiting list, all NHS dentists were full\u000a* Grimsby - all NHS dentists full\u000a* Cheltenham - plenty of NHS dentists to choose from
p4343
aVI know people that have to drive 40-50 miles for one and the appointment can be months away.
p4344
aVNHS dentistry in this country is fucking SHOCKING in places and is largely left up to the few practises that can lower themselves to what they believe are criminal rates for NHS work
p4345
aVYou know people in **London** that have to do this?
p4346
aVThey're lying or being incredibly picky.
p4347
aVI got on to my NHS dentist with no hassle at all, and never have to wait more than a week for an appointment.
p4348
aVI don't think there are many in London.
p4349
aVMy own mother was an NHS doctor for many years and despite worshipping the service even now I don't think she has ever been to an NHS dentist- I can only assume that not many exist around here. 
p4350
aV3 near me, West London, two walking distance.
p4351
aVMight be to do with different incomes in London compared to Newcastle, less people want to pay hundreds for dental care and this has run private businesses out of the area, while NHS dentists continue to grow. 
p4352
aVSeems fairly random to me.
p4353
aVI live in lancashire and I can't get an NHS dentist, I pay £12 per month (because I have good teeth so I'm low risk) so it's not bad at all, and if I do need any work it's covered.
p4354
aVHaving experienced both I have to say I'd never go back to an NHS dentist.
p4355
aVMy private dentist is fantastic and I'm a lot more confident that his advice is based on good dentistry and not what eases the strain on the NHS!
p4356
aVI'm pretty sure all dentists have good education on the subject, NHS or private.
p4357
aVI pay £25 for two years, and whenever I need surgery there is no "cost issue" 
p4358
aVEducation is one thing but NHS dentists are under pressure to save money.
p4359
aVTherefore sometimes work that needs doing doesn't get done. 
p4360
aVDon't think it is anymore, I rang up a random one and got straight in as an NHS patient.
p4361
aVGive it a go and you might be surprised.
p4362
aVFor a little perspective, I am being charged **£160** for an extraction at a "low-income" dental clinic here in the states.
p4363
aVDitto.
p4364
aVI paid £250 for a root canal.
p4365
aVIt's finding one (especially a competent one) which is hard.
p4366
aVI signed up to pretty much the only one that wasn't a one person band locally, had them put in a crown, and when it fell out less than a week later they didn't want to know about redoing it.
p4367
aVThus I'm pretty much buggered as there aren't really any alternative local options, and, technically, I don't think I'm even entitled to another check up for X months.
p4368
aVThat really sucks and I'm sorry.
p4369
aVI've been fortunate, that my dentist is very good.
p4370
aVI am glad that NHS dentists still exist (same goes for NHS opticians!
p4371
aV) and I agree the system is far from perfect.
p4372
aVWe should never take it for granted and be fighting for improvements as much as we can.
p4373
aVOh, likewise.
p4374
aVI've had excellent NHS dentists before now, but it's a postcode lottery and they're definitely running the service down.
p4375
aVOr go to France, for £25 you get check-up AND cleaning.
p4376
aVPrivately.
p4377
aVWith no insurance.
p4378
aVThe difference is that in the UK dentists are able to ask for extortionate prices.
p4379
aVI know a french deneist that comes to work to the UK 3 days a week and takes 4 days holidays back in France.
p4380
aVHe still makes more than dentists in France.
p4381
aVBut isn't that because of France's relatively high tax levels?
p4382
aVWouldn't the dentists still have pay a lot in taxes, or is overseas income not taxed in France?
p4383
aVOr do dentists simply not get paid as much as the UK dentists?
p4384
aVI tend to find that French people won't tolerate fucking-stupidly-high price levels, they are a lot better at expressing dissatisfaction than we are.
p4385
aVIf they're not happy with something, they stop using it, they protest or they go on strike.
p4386
aVHowever, this has the aftereffect of making them seem huffy and stuck-up, whereas we insist on politeness, meaning we never complain and just hand over the cash.
p4387
aVOh we complain plenty, always to the wrong people though.
p4388
aVlodging a complaint to the complaint department (while queuing) isn't quite as effective as setting the streets of Paris on fire if you don't get 5 months off a year.
p4389
aVSo you're saying we should be setting fire to Paris instead?
p4390
aVIt'll be just like old times.
p4391
aVAmerican here.
p4392
aVAre you saying you can get root canals done for $77 and this includes the price of the initial check up?
p4393
aVI have dental treatment with a dentist who treats NHS patients.
p4394
aVThey have tiers of payment depending on the amount and the complexity of the treatment you need.
p4395
aVfor £45 (I think?
p4396
aVIt appears to be slightly more now), I had a checkup, 5 fillings (Genetically bad teeth, I swear...) and one of those fillings ended up needing to be a root canal because it was too deep and the root started dying.
p4397
aV[From the NHS choices website:](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1781.aspx?CategoryID=74) \u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; There are three NHS charge bands:\u000aBand 1: £18.50 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice.
p4398
aVIf necessary, it also includes X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment.
p4399
aVBand 2: £50.50 covers all treatment covered by Band 1, plus additional treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth (extractions).
p4400
aVBand 3: £219 covers all treatment covered by Bands 1 and 2, plus more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges.
p4401
aVFuck me, just walking in to see my dentist costs me $25, then fillings are generally in the hundreds of dollars each.
p4402
aVI'm moving to the US for three years next week, I will be very sad to leave the dental, optical and healthcare I have here behind.
p4403
aVI plan on getting treatments/checkups on holidays back here!
p4404
aVUnfortunately unless you maintain UK residency you can't use NHS services.
p4405
aVCitizenship is not enough.. 
p4406
aVIm going to study, so I am still technically resident. 
p4407
aVIn that case I'm jealous!
p4408
aVStill getting over some sticker shock from a mundane health screening which wasn't fully covered by my insurance..
p4409
aVSome employers chuck dental insurance in.
p4410
aVI don't have to pay anything and I can get a fair amount of non-cosmetic treatment covered.
p4411
aVIf I paid some trivial amount toward it I'd get even more.
p4412
aVPlus private dental insurance isn't actually that expensive even if someone else isn't paying for it, if they're paying lots for checkups and work they must not be insured.
p4413
aVI've never used an NHS dentist because it was impossible to find one at the time and I don't really need to switch back now.
p4414
aVMy last checkup and cleaning was £18 total for a 10 minute appointment.
p4415
aVI suppose it helps living up north.
p4416
aVIt took only 10 minutes to clean your teeth? 
p4417
aVI suppose it depends how well you look after them yourself.
p4418
aVI had an appointment earlier this week.
p4419
aVI sat in the chair, he looked and said there were two spots that could do with a scrape, scraped them and I was out inside 5 minutes.
p4420
aVYep.
p4421
aVIf you get a good dentist who does regular cleanings then it doesn't take long.
p4422
aVI went in for a regular checkup, offered a quick cleaning to help reduce tartar, no extra cost. \u000a\u000a
p4423
aVAlso in the north.
p4424
aVMine's £16.
p4425
aVIn and out.
p4426
aVTeeth are good.
p4427
aVIn canada our dentistry isn't covered under OHIP (or whatever province you're in).
p4428
aVNot even a basic check up.
p4429
aVIts really quite sad considering mouth health is VERY important. 
p4430
aVWithout insurance, and with a kind dentist who was also a family friend, I ended up paying $100 for a small cavity filled.
p4431
aVThis didn't include the $60 x-ray though.
p4432
aVIt should have been much more.
p4433
aVThis is in the U.S.
p4434
aVIf in pain dial 111 (while it's still in operation)  they have to find an nhs dentist which is fairly nearby to you to get you out of pain.
p4435
aV£18.50 for a check up.
p4436
aV£50.50 for nhs silver fillings (white on the front)  and root canal or extraction .
p4437
aV£219 will get you a crown or a denture. 
p4438
aVMakes me want to cry - the cuts we've made.
p4439
aVI realise that an aging population and our relative decline in the world order means that we're not able to accomplish as much anymore, but I do question our spending priorities.
p4440
aVSome good had better come out of this bloody great aircraft carrier.
p4441
aVThe amount of money being spent on the new aircraft carrier compared to the amount of money were wasting in other places which are much less important is equivalent to dropping a 10p coin. 
p4442
aVYour perceived decline is not due to the lack of ability or global standing of your country, but due to the exploitation by those who have of those who have not.
p4443
aVA minor bump in taxes on the global super-rich who congregate in London would easily pay for whatever cuts may have been done to the NHS.
p4444
aV&gt; A minor bump in taxes\u000a\u000aDoesn't even need to be that, just the closing of loopholes that allow them to get away with not paying their prescribed share.
p4445
aVIf the government paid half as much attention to tackling this problem as they do file sharing, internet pornography or drug trafficking the country would be ticking along splendidly. 
p4446
aVBut then their rich friends would withdraw support and another politician would take their place..
p4447
aVViva la revolucion!
p4448
aVThe fear, I think, is that taxing the London super-rich will cause them to go elsewhere.
p4449
aVI think that fear is exaggerated, they're not all just going to leave one of the centres of global finance if we increase taxes by a bit more.
p4450
aVEven if the fears are right, it's either live in a poorer more equal society or continue to live in one with large inequalities, I know which one I'd rather.
p4451
aVIt's a ridiculous fear I think.
p4452
aVEither way, where I live is so removed from London (the City of London more so) that 1) people are clamoring for independence from Westminster rule and 2) no one gicea a damn where the super rich go; London or elsewhere. 
p4453
aVIt's also due to the rise of other parts of the world compared to Europe.
p4454
aVThat's OK.
p4455
aVThe global super rich who live in London don't have their money here.
p4456
aVMany of them aren't even UK citizens.
p4457
aVThere is no money for you to tax.
p4458
aVThe only possible thing you could tax would be property values greater than £5m or whatever, but it's unlikely you'd get much from it.  
p4459
aVLondon has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita of any city in the world.
p4460
aVThe amount of money they could squeeze out of them...\u000a\u000aAlso, hej ven!
p4461
aVGodt at se jeg ikke er den eneste Dansker her ;) 
p4462
aVIsn't that kind of assuming they don't congregate in London due to the tax rate there?
p4463
aVI dare say treatment is more expensive too now
p4464
aVTo be fair we got rid of dental and spectacles in 1950 it's not like it was recent and that was only because it was costing more than we had anticipated! 
p4465
aVI would much, much rather take the chance of being able to register for an NHS dentist today, than suffer the level of dental procedures offered back then.
p4466
aVMy gran had all her teeth pulled out at 25 years old and replaced with dentures!
p4467
aVThere wasn't even anything wrong with the health of her teeth, apparently. 
p4468
aVIt used to be a common thing to do, it saved having problems with them later.
p4469
aVI've even heard that people used to have this paid for as a wedding present. 
p4470
aVThat's silly though.
p4471
aVLike, I understand why the military and astronauts have their appendix preemptively pulled out, because that will kill you in a few days with no prior warning.
p4472
aVBut your teeth?  
p4473
aVTeeth cause you immense pain, issues, and expense down the line.
p4474
aVHumans aren't meant to live as long as we do, and teeth degrade fairly early on in current human lifespans.
p4475
aVReplacing them all with artificial teeth is an easy and effective solution to avoiding a lifetime of intermittent teething issues.
p4476
aVI guarantee in the future replacement of teeth with better designed, technologically superior artificial teeth will be the norm.
p4477
aVTeeth that don't chip or break, that have permanent resistance to bacteria etc.
p4478
aVI strongly believe full teeth replacement will be the future of dentistry.
p4479
aVWell taken care of teeth can and should easily last your entire life with the exception of some sort of trauma.
p4480
aVI currently have braces on my teeth got through the nhs for the grand price of £0
p4481
aVIn the states my two kids cost 10k (£5k) for braces.
p4482
aVDENTAL PLAN
p4483
aVLisa needs braces.
p4484
aVThe times I've had this going around in my head.
p4485
aVIt's weird how easily repetition can get something into your head like that!
p4486
aVDENNAL PLAN
p4487
aVYou had one job.
p4488

aVI don't think it's wise to normalise the fact that it's largely been privatised.
p4496
aVIt paves the way to making further privatisation in the NHS more culturally acceptable.
p4497
aVWe should remember that terrible decision, and remain angry at it.
p4498
aVIt's not as if dentistry has been recently privatised.
p4499
aVHas NHS dentistry ever not been performed by largely private contractors?

aVGPs have been pretty much the same since day one.

aVBesides, it's a bit different to pay small private groups to do the work, and paying a faceless organisation like Serco.

aVThe attitude of "the NHS way is always the best way" is exactly why it won't improve.

aVNot that I'm aware of!

aVJust so you know, Titanium has one of the highest Youngs' Modulus to density ratio with 110GPa:4.5gcm^(-3).
p4530
aVBasically, it's good stuff.
p4531
aVAnd I'll never forget that from my A-level Physics.
p4532
aVSo you like the IUD?
p4533
aVWhy three? 
p4534
aVIUDs have an expiry date, the copper one I think is good for ten years.
p4535
aVThey can also fall out occasionally if not fitted correctly or there's a gap in your cervix.
p4536
aVYou also need to get them taken out to have children, then presumably replaced again afterwards, so you'd go through a few in the normal course of things.
p4537
aVMy (hormonal) IUD is good for five years, free to me on prescription, and in the US costs about $500 USD.
p4538
aVAnd I'm going to get it taken out after just over a year so I can have another child, which would be considered extremely wasteful in the US (I didn't realise the cost of that device til I saw it mentioned on TwoX recently).
p4539
aVThen I'll probably get a series of them afterwards, right up to menopause, since it suits me.

p4543
aVlong live the NHS
p4544
aV[deleted]
p4545
aVThis is not a unique situation, almost all universal health systems in counties are facing these issues.
p4546
aVIt could move to a hybridized system, or some cost is increased on medicines, or some care is moved out (like dental or optometry).
p4547
aVOr there's the alternative of greater investment.
p4548
aVOf all the things that tax money goes towards, the NHS is unquestionably one of the most important, and despite the obsession with 'austerity' meaning reducing spending with no increase in taxes (which nobody has managed to sell to me convincingly), I don't understand why a tax increase at higher brackets and/or savings elsewhere in the budget shouldn't be used to put more money into the NHS.
p4549
aVIt's not as if it's impossible to get the money.
p4550
aVOr money could be moved from the military budget to the healthcare budget, benefiting the taxpayer and limiting the number of evil brown people that the government decides should be killed
p4551
aVWhy is the cost of care rising when the tax base is constant?
p4552
aVAre people going to the doctors more than they did a few years ago?
p4553
aVDid the price of medical supplies increase? 
p4554
aVBecause there are so many more treatment options available nowadays, and a lot of them are incredibly complex and therefore very expensive. 
p4555
aVHah.
p4556
aVWeasel word!
p4557
aV[deleted]
p4558
aVImproved technology means improved care, which means more people living then would have otherwise died, which means more people to treat.
p4559
aVI once heard that the standard NATO bullet was designed to maim, not kill, as it takes only one person to bury a body, but five people to care for an injured man.
p4560
aVThe idea is to make the enemies casualties a burden to them.
p4561
aVThe same principal applies here; the longer people live due to improvements in care, the greater resources we have to find to look after them.
p4562
aVThe solution is clamping down on benefit cheats.
p4563
aVMore money for the economy.
p4564
aVNothing pisses me off more than fat, lazy fuckers who claim job seekers but have never even written a CV.
p4565
aVSome people need help and I'm all for that.
p4566
aVBut I don't respect uneducated, selfish people who only take.
p4567
aVBenefit fraud is a drop in the ocean of tax avoidance. 
p4568
aVBenefit cheats cost the UK government maybe 2 or 3 billion, so I can see why you think how you do.
p4569
aVBut, think about the tax avoidance that Vodafone, Amazon and many other companies go through.
p4570
aVThat costs the UK Government maybe 10 or 15 billion.
p4571
aVSo we would be better off letting the cheats cheat, and simply collect the taxable income that is available to us.
p4572
aVjust print more money
p4573
aVLong live shirking of responsibilities by many of its members of staff and negligence on a larger scale than the general public know!
p4574
aVBut carry on jacking each other off. 
p4575
aVNobody claims the NHS is perfect, but I quite the fact that when my Dad had a heart attack 10 years ago, we didn't need to sell the house to pay for his treatment, like would have happened in the US.
p4576
aVThen there's the reduced price prescription medications that I, my fiance, and both my parents take on a daily basis that would cost us hundreds of pounds a month each in a US-style system and actually cost me nothing and the others £8 ish each per month.
p4577
aVOkay, so it let down my sister a little because it goesn't do well with gender identity disorder, and she had to go private, but I think saving my Dad's life and my fiance's life without bankrupting us is definitely a good thing.
p4578
aVAnd I've been in and out of hospital all year with electrocardio problems and I am thankful that I didn't have to pay for it.
p4579
aVHowever, this sub is ridiculous with the circlejerk over the NHS.
p4580
aVObviously everyone has their own anecdotes, but when you've been in the system as much as I have in my life, you see the inadequacies first hand. 
p4581
aVSaying "happy birthday" to it is hardly a circlejerk.
p4582
aVNo, but the circlejerk is brigading against anything negative.
p4583
aVBut fuck it, if some people think it doesn't need change then I hope you enjoy a privatised health service in a few decades because there are incompetent idiots are running it right now, despite them being incapable to organise a piss up in a brewery. 
p4584
aVYou're constructing a strawman.
p4585
aVNobody is saying the NHS is perfect or "doesn't need change" as you claim.
p4586
aVAnd the only negativity I've seen is yours - which was a straight out attack to begin with - if anything, an anti-NHS circle-jerk approach.
p4587
aVAnd I reiterate: saying "happy birthday" and "the NHS helped me and my family in this way" isn't circlejerk.
p4588
aV*If* people were claiming the NHS were perfect, that would be circle jerk.
p4589
aVThis is not.
p4590
aVI am going on previous conversations on this subreddit and the fact the anything negative is downvoted instantly.
p4591
aVMy missus is a doctor in a hospital, so I hear a lot of shitty stories from her trust, and I am sure it is the same across the country.
p4592
aVAnd I reiterate: it's amazing getting free healthcare, but any counter argument here is stifled, which is a fucking circlejerk.
p4593
aVI've seen no counter-argument, just negativity in a place where it isn't appropriate.
p4594
aVYou want counter-argument, make a thread for it called "let's talk about the problems in the NHS" and *discuss* it, because all it's been here is *attack* not discussion.
p4595
aVStill proud of the NHS, let's not let any current or future government continue to cannibalise it for political gain.

aVThe only objective part of the report comes from WHO stats on good outcomes and healthy living which puts the UK at the bottom with the US.

p4692
aVThe NHS is not perfect, but it is about the very best.
p4693
aVThe absolute best?
p4694

aVPrivate involvement in the NHS has been in place for far longer than 2011.
p4754
aVI was born during Major's prime ministership (is that a word?
p4755
aV), so the only thing I've seen is privatisation via Tory "restructuring" or Blairite PFIs.
p4756
aVWas there a pre-Blair era movement within labour for NHS privatisation?

aV&gt; us voting for a different party\u000a\u000aThis is my plan.
p4758
aVI'm annoyed with the two horse race we've got at the moment.
p4759
aVI just hope that the people feel burnt after voting Lib Dems don't turn apathetic and stay engaged with politics.
p4760
aVThe low voter turn-out of the recent elections doesn't give me too much hope though.
p4761
aVMost Tories won't get rid of the NHS, look at the Lib Dems with Students' fees; it would be political suicide.
p4762
aVThe NHS just needs an overhaul and streamlining to provide the best service possible: However people are often scared that it will be completely "Privatised" and they will have to pay when this simply isn't the case.
p4763
aV&gt; However people are often scared that it will be completely "Privatised" and they will have to pay when this simply isn't the case    \u000a\u000aSince we don't have a written constitution, perhaps we could have a royal charter, (cross party support , super majority to change etc) which would guarantee the existence of the NHS in perpetuity.
p4764
aVThe NHS will still exist no matter what, regardless of there being a charter or not.
p4765
aVyou can't guarantee that.
p4766
aVIt may in practicality be political suicide but the point is people fear it may not.

aVIf people wanted no student fees, they would have voted Lib Dem.
p4769
aVThey didnt, never thought it was fair that Cleggers got such a hard time over it.
p4770
aVEnough people voted Lib Dem for them to hold the balance of power, which they then used to increase fees massively...
p4771
aVThey are the junior partner in a coalition.
p4772
aVThey cant get all there policies across, unless they are voted in fully.
p4773
aVMaybe Clegg could have made it part of the agreement for the coalition.
p4774
aVHe didn't.

p4795
aVHappy Birthday to the NHS, without which I probably wouldn't be here, and a big thank you to Aneurin Bevan for putting the National Health Service Act forward in the first place.
p4796
aVAfter being profoundly deaf for 20years, the NHS fitted me with a cochlear implant.
p4797
aVThen two years later, upgraded it, involving a two surgeons, a speech therapist and several audiologists.
p4798
aVIt costs nothing.
p4799
aVI am now functionally hearing (albeit in one ear).
p4800
aVI can use the 'phone, listen to radio plays, and participate fully in everyday life.
p4801
aVIn other places, I'd still be trying to get by on fuzzy noises from the hearing aids I could afford (prfound deafness being a pre-existing condition, natch).
p4802
aVThankfully I live in a civilised society.
p4803
aVI've only ever had good treatment from the medical side of the NHS but, as someone who is currently an inpatient within a general adult psychiatric unit, the mental health side of things is god awful.

aVTho we got Obamacare recently and things have become much better for our family (we can afford insurance now and check ups are cheap). 
p4810
aVThat's pretty sweet.
p4811
aVI assume your family already had a primary care physician(s)?
p4812
aVI'm having trouble finding one myself, though I've been put on Oregon's version of Medicaid, so that could have a lot to do with it.
p4813
aVAll the places I've called to schedule an appointment "cannot take any more patients at this time.
p4814
aV" Pretty strange, considering one of the points of it was to stop people from using the emergency room as their primary care.
p4815
aVAnyway, hope your experience turns out better!
p4816

aVWhy do people think this is free healthcare?
p4834
aVIt's quite obviously tax funded.  
p4835
aVQuite obvious because it's mentioned in the article!
p4836
aV:) One might use the term "free" because its cost to the individual can be quite a bit less than in a privatized system.
p4837
aVIt's free in the same way as using the roads is free.
p4838
aVOf course they're tax funded, but you don't even think about the cost in your day to day life.
p4839
aVIt's just there and does it's job and you can use it whenever you need to.
p4840
aVYou grumble about the potholes, or the occasional closed road, but that's it.
p4841
aVAnd when you're at your worst, sick and broken all you need to concern yourself with is getting better.
p4842
aV'Free at the point of service'
p4843
aVIt's free in the sense that a lot of it is funded by the top 10% of taxpayers, meaning the majority of people will get more out of it than they put in. 
p4844
aVCompared to Obamacare, it's basically free.
p4845
aVI left the military recently, and my health care costs were $26 USD/month.
p4846
aVWith this Obamacare at its cheapest for me, is $280/month.
p4847
aVAnd that's a bare bones package. 
p4848
aVNow let's hear what your costs would have been after leaving the military BEFORE Obamacare.

p4859
aVSuch a Shame that we have a liar of a prime minister who told us the NHS is safe in his hands.
p4860
aVA man that despite our health system being one of the best value health care systems the man states the systems is unsustainable.
p4861
aVAl lies.
p4862
aVWe have a government that is an asset stripping parasite.
p4863
aVwho see the juicy cancer contracts that their mates can profit from.
p4864
aVBut you wont see these companies taking up the less profitable areas, the is no money in it.
p4865
aVWhat we are going to end up with is a patchwork health system that is dictated by private profits.
p4866
aVIts already happening.
p4867
aVTrusts are being driven to the wall by interest on ppi projects.
p4868
aVAnother lie sold to us back in the day.
p4869
aVNEw contracts being entered in to by the people running the service are so punative that should we ever decide to try and find a better deal the penalties again would risk the existence of the service.
p4870
aVWhat we have here is a corporate fascist arrangement that will ensure that our beloved NHS will pay in to the cartel of health care vultures until it collapses and that will be it.
p4871
aVThey will walk away with their pockets bulging.
p4872
aVlike many other government contractors of IT systems schools hospital and other services.

aV&gt; How long are waiting periods in UK for seeing a neurologist?
p4882
aVDepends entirely on the severity of your condition. 
p4883
aV[deleted]
p4884
aVYou can for private care in the UK if you wish.
p4885
aVThat generally means you get to see a consultant straight away. 
p4886
aVNo.
p4887
aVThe NHS is based on the idea of "triage".
p4888
aVBasically, instead of providing aid to whoever has the most money, or whoever asked for aid first, the NHS takes care of those who need it first.
p4889
aVSo if you're bleeding out your anus and need immediate medical attention, you'll get it.
p4890
aVOn the other hand, if you need a liver transplant in a few years' time, you won't be given immediate priority.
p4891
aVIt's quite fantastic. 
p4892
aVJust a slight correction, but triage does not extend beyond your local accident and emergency department.
p4893
aVFor non-emergency treatment the NHS uses Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to measure the value of a given medical treatment.
p4894
aVThis essentially boils down to a quasi-utilitarian cost-benefit analysis of any given treatment.
p4895
aVSay you have a patient aged 58 with abdominal peritonitis.
p4896
aVTreating her would give her 15 more years of life, which for a healthy person would give them 15 QALYS.
p4897
aVThis patient, however, has an unrelated critical illness that significantly impacts the quality of her life, so each year of her life is only worth 0.6 QALYs.
p4898
aVThe treatment would provide her with 9 QALYs at a cost for the operation of £147,000, or a cost per QALY gained ratio of £16,333/QALY.
p4899
aVAnother patient is a male aged 26 with a particularly unusual congenital heart defect.
p4900
aVTreating the defect would give him another 50 years of perfect health, so it's worth 50 QALYs.
p4901
aVHowever, the treatment costs £250,000, yielding cost per QALY gained of £5,000/QALY.
p4902
aVThe NHS would prioritise this treatment over the 58 year old's.
p4903
aVAdvocates of the QALY contend that it's the most effective method of allocating limited resources in a way that maximises their benefit and utility to society.
p4904
aVOpponents of the QALY contend that assigning lower priority to the elderly or unfit is ageist and ableist, and that it's unfair that the elderly who have paid into the system for their whole lives are given lower priority than others.
p4905
aVThe NHS have been accused of chasing "easy QALY wins" and concentrating it's funding on easily treatable and common conditions for otherwise perfectly healthy persons to inflate performance figures.
p4906
aVA great explanation of QALY.
p4907
aVI get people's opposition of ageism and ableism, but I don't see a serious alternative rather than pure cost analysis.
p4908
aVAre they really saying that a 75 year old should get the same share of limited resources as a 25 year old?
p4909
aVI'd like to think that if I were 75 I would see the reasoning behind letting a younger person in front of the queue. 
p4910
aVWhile your explanation is generally correct, using peritonitis as an example to explain the use of QALYs in non-emergency treatment is not as helpful since that **is** an emergency.
p4911
aV&gt;It's quite fantastic.
p4912
aVEspecially when you've been in the A&amp;E waiting room for 4+ hours :(
p4913
aVYou lucky person.
p4914
aVYou must have been pretty well.
p4915
aVIf the hospitals had enough free beds for people to be sent out of A&amp;E it would certainly reduce the waiting time.
p4916
aVIf patients realised that a cough that's been going on for 2 weeks is neither an Accident nor an Emergency, then your waiting time might also reduce.
p4917
aVThat's all I ever think when I see or read stories about the strains GP surgeries are under.
p4918
aVAnd when I hear from friends of their experiences going to the doctors for minor things I personally would just sit out with, I can see why.
p4919
aVI'd like to see everyone in the country presented with a "bill" each tax year, to show the cost/value of the public services they've used for the year.
p4920
aVI think it would help people to understand where they may be over using the system, but also to understand how much value for money they're getting.
p4921
aVOf course, it might cause some people to think "I pay all that tax, and I didn't use anything!
p4922
aV", but I think the benefits would outweigh that.
p4923
aVJudging from the track record of government computer systems that would be close to a pipe dream. 
p4924
aVThat's how the ER works in the US too.
p4925
aVIt's called triage.
p4926
aVYou attend to the sickest person first, not on a "first come, first serve" basis.
p4927
aVSource: did my housemanship in Britain before coming to the US.
p4928
aVI think they use a similar procedure in emergency situations, sorting casualties into different groups.
p4929
aVFuck that.
p4930
aVMy dad would have died waiting for his liver over there.
p4931
aVThank god for private healthcare.  
p4932
aVWell, no.
p4933
aVIf he needed a liver immediately, he would've been placed at the top of the list.
p4934
aVAnd it wouldn't cost a single pound.\u000a
p4935
aVI dunno.
p4936
aVIt's looking pretty grim over there right now from what I can find.
p4937
aVOur Dr specifically told us that the UK and Canadian models would have failed us due to many variables.
p4938
aV"Leading health experts warned yesterday that Britain is heading towards a national "tragedy" where more people than ever will die waiting for organs"\u000a\u000a"The waiting list doesn't include the people who've been turned away and told there's never a chance you'd get it because there are other people who'd benefit more.

p4940
aVThe problems with organ transplant are solely due to lack of supply.
p4941
aVThe method of funding the health system doesn't come into it at all.
p4942
aVWhich is what I initially said.
p4943
aVMy dad would have died waiting.
p4944
aVThe United States, however, leads the world in actual transplant rates, which Dr. Tom Mone, a past president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, says means doctors can use more of the organs they harvest.
p4945
aV"It's fair to say we're doing as well or better than anyone else," said Mone, who is now the CEO of One Legacy, a nonprofit organization focused on organ donation.
p4946
aV"But we have such a large number of people and a very good chronic care system, so they can wait longer as the waiting list grows.
p4947
aV"\u000ahttp://abcnews.go.com/Health/organ-donation-rates-us-stacks/story?id=19437070
p4948
aVOrgan donation, as the name suggests, is due to people donating organs, it isn't anything to do with the NHS.
p4949
aVIf we went for people having to opt out instead of opting in it would improve things considerably. 
p4950
aVWith respect, how often do you see medical professionals during periods when you're being afflicted by your condition?
p4951
aVI would have expected that management of such a case would not involve seeing a doctor whenever you had an episode, but I do not know much about management of cluster headaches so I could be totally wrong.
p4952
aVIn any case, as Travisdk said, the notion of triage is employed.
p4953
aVNurses are not ignorant of the severity of cluster headaches and would certainly take your pain into consideration in determining the patients most in need of immediate medical attention.
p4954
aVIt is as simple as that.
p4955
aVI am not a nurse, but I would imagine that the management of cluster headaches is a matter of pain relief, while labour pains could imply delivery and the difficulties associated.
p4956
aV[deleted]
p4957
aVSumatriptan injections?
p4958
aV[deleted]
p4959
aVHere patients would be given an injectable form of sumatriptan (which has evidence backing it in the treatment of cluster headaches) that they can administer themselves at home.
p4960
aVThere would be no need to have a neurologist on speed dial.
p4961
aVIn the highly unlikely event that this wasn't effective they would be referred to a pain team that would provide support.
p4962
aVI see.
p4963
aVI was under the impression that management involved self-administered strong painkillers; thanks for explaining the case as it really is.
p4964
aVI do not know where you live, but I have not found in my experience (I live in Australia and use the public health system) that nurses are without empathy.
p4965
aVCould it be that you could find a better standard of service elsewhere?
p4966
aV- anyway, I will not go into that kind of thing just because I am sure you are managing that yourself and in any case have a much better understanding of your own situation; it is not like I could provide any helpful advice on this.
p4967
aVIt might sound rich for me to say because I do not suffer from cluster headaches and have not perceived that kind of pain before, but I do not think that they are deserving of hate for that reason - it is at the very least useless to expend your energy on hating people that are attempting to do a job that is good in itself (whether they are doing it well is another matter, but if they are not then that deserves something other than hate).
p4968
aVAnyway, triage does involve an assessment that goes beyond the visual perception of physical pain by a nurse or doctor.
p4969
aVHowever, it is certainly possible that the improper treatment of people who have not been diagnosed with this condition is a flaw with the system - as others have said, the NHS is incredible but imperfect - and if it is the case that cases like yours go undiagnosed then that is something that should absolutely be rectified.
p4970
aVWith that being said though, I think that the basis of the NHS, which is free healthcare at the point of use, does not conflict with your needs - there is nothing about the NHS that necessitates waiting periods but insufficient funding from mostly Tory but some Labour governments (and even that does not necessitate waiting periods, just more stringent management being necessary to mitigate waiting periods); waiting periods are not synonymous with public healthcare.
p4971
aVI think there was a post on /r/videos that was popular a few months ago showing a woman going through such an attack.
p4972
aVSeems bloody awful.
p4973
aVI'm sorry.
p4974
aV[deleted]
p4975
aVYou can also pay privately for a consultant appointment if you think is urgent but, for whatever  reason, your GP disagrees.
p4976
aVCosts around $100 for a private consultation and you can then get the nhs to pay for what he recommends (with some exceptions). 
p4977
aVIt's doubtful, but is anyone old enough to remember it being brought in?

p4984
aV[](http://imgur.com/zKs3f8E)\u000aI'm proud of the NHS, overtaken as it has become by politics and bean counters, and when I started out in it I had a youthful ideal of doing good for a great organisation and no thought of money or private practice.
p4985
aVAs a side note, anaesthesia in GB, medicine's secret service, founded it's own association to guide practice 16 years before the NHS was set up.

p4989
aVHopefully Ill bring my fat American hamburger ass to the UK.
p4990
aVBut let me ask, we hear plenty about America on reddit.
p4991
aVWhat does the UK complain about?
p4992
aVWhats good about over here and bad over there?
p4993
aVI never got to travel much.
p4994
aVId like to visit there sometime.
p4995
aVWe complain about everything, moaning is the national pastime.
p4996
aVJust a word of caution, don't try and join in unless you want to be inundated with a barrage of pithy, wry put downs.
p4997
aVPersonally I wouldn't want to live in America as it is right now simply because I have excellent legal protections as a homo in the UK, I wouldn't feel very safe in most of the states.
p4998
aVBut the things America has better; space, England is small and very densely populated.
p4999
aVMoney, there's just a lot more of it in America which is good if you want to run a business I think (at least in my experience selling to the US.
p5000
aV) Also I prefer America's attitude to freedom of speech, I wouldn't go so far as to say we have heavy censorship here but I have perceived a little bit of a squeeze over the past decade.
p5001
aVTo visit, the UK is great though, come on over!
p5002
aVAw man don't let the internet perception of us stop you from visiting.
p5003
aVWe're not a third world country, you won't be attacked for being gay or even insulted.
p5004
aVHe'll if someone does insult you they will in turn be insulted by every one around them, even in the south.
p5005
aVDon't let internet superstition scare you from something you wanna do.
p5006
aVIf that was the case I would never visit the UK for fear of da mooslims.
p5007
aVI was talking more about living rather than visiting, when I said 'safe' I was talking about the kind of precarious economic situations some gay people are put in in many US states due to lack of legal protections, things that I just would never have to deal with here.
p5008
aVI would *love* to visit America though and stuff myself with some delicious foods.
p5009
aVYeah I'm confused by the legal protections thing, we don't limit you in any way for being gay except for marriage. 
p5010
aVI think someone else posted a link but there are some really useful anti-discrimination laws that protect me in the UK that I wouldn't have everywhere in the US.
p5011
aVI only know about it because sometimes American users on some of the gay subreddits talk about how they daren't be open at work for fear of being fired.
p5012
aVMaybe it's not something that would actually realistically happen to them, but I feel more comfortable knowing that UK law protects me against this.
p5013
aVThere are certainly "at will" states, where you can be fired without giving any reason.
p5014
aVSo you couldn't legally be fired for being gay, but you COULD be fired for "wearing brown shoes".
p5015
aVI don't know about any other discriminatory laws they have in the US, but I've heard about at will.
p5016
aVEh, I'm not gay so I wouldn't know personally.
p5017
aVAnd I know a lot of (admittedly flamboyant) gay people who can get away with more because there gay.
p5018
aVBut I don't know every state law and if you're comfortable in the UK I can't take that away from you.
p5019
aVGood luck than.
p5020
aVBrit who has been to America many times, can confirm.
p5021
aVVery welcoming warm people
p5022
aVThe whole anti gay movement here is pretty much religions last stand with politics.
p5023
aVOnce we vote these old cronies out.
p5024
aVAnd REMOVE the old way of thinking.
p5025
aV(Which will take 20-30 years if not more.
p5026
aV) Things will get better.
p5027
aVIts like the Micheal Bay hate train.
p5028
aVThe movies are still good.
p5029
aVIts just easy to hate on him.
p5030
aVThey just use the bible to fall back on if they are called out as a biggot.
p5031
aVThe whole freedom of speech thing just allows people like /u/sarstan to run their mouth.
p5032
aVAnd give "facts" as he likes to call them from biased websites and articles.
p5033
aVI will make my way over sometime in the future.
p5034
aVCant wait till I get to travel.
p5035
aVBut first I have to make my way out of this close-minded town called Bakersfield.
p5036
aVHAHA.
p5037
aV&gt; What does the UK complain about?
p5038
aVIronically, the NHS :P
p5039
aVUk complains about immigration.
p5040
aVThere is (possibly justified) concern about Muslim extremists trying to infiltrate various things.
p5041
aVThe usual low level grumbling about corporate and media influence.
p5042
aVThe wage gap.
p5043
aVWe do not seem to have anywhere near the problems USA has with the buying of the legislature by corporate bodies though.
p5044
aVWe are all concerned about the NHS to an extent, although this is also affected by the immigration debate.
p5045
aVEurope is a big issue and also the perception that we are losing influence on the world stage.\u000a
p5046
aVMaybe its because other world problems are over shadowing yours.
p5047
aVKind of like, When you do something right people wont notice you've done anything at all.
p5048
aVAnd a seemingly endless wave of once great TV and Radio personalities being hauled off to jail for sex crimes.
p5049
aVIan Watkins, Jimmy Saville, Rolf Harris and Max Clifford to name some.
p5050
aV&gt; Its a Shame how our right wing politicians only see money here in America.
p5051
aVSome demo's too.
p5052
aVPlenty of countries use private health insurance without being accused of being full of greedy bastards.
p5053
aVWhat makes America different is that we have worked out a "compromise" that has created the worst possible combination of private and public.\u000a\u000a
p5054
aVPretty much comes down to the whole employer chooses your benefits type of thing.
p5055
aVAnd you have to abide by it.
p5056
aVCOUGH *hobby lobby* COUGH.\u000a\u000a
p5057
aVExactly.
p5058
aVThis kind of bullshit is caused by entrusting corporations with their employees' health care.
p5059
aVWho wanted this?
p5060
aV?
aV&gt; Hopefully Ill bring my fat American hamburger ass to the UK.
p5061
aV&gt; \u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; \u000a&gt; But let me ask, we hear plenty about America on reddit.
p5062
aVWhat does the UK complain about?
p5063
aVimmigrants, mostly...
p5064
aVthings we complain about include: bad tea, the weather, people try to talk to you in public, tourists, and football
p5065
aVThe weather! 
p5066
aVPersonally I really can't think of much that America has that's missing or worse in the UK.
p5067
aVI envy the vast size of their country, which means bigger houses, more variety in climate, bigger and more varied wild/open spaces, and cheap food.
p5068
aVAnd on its 67th year can we as a nation start to behave like adults, accept that no players in the political discourse of this nation actually want to get rid of it and stop with the partisan hackery every time any party suggests reform and judge that proposal on its merits alone?
p5069
aVIt's pretty much already gone, a lot of the NHS remains are just branding and being readied for sale.
p5070
aVWe were going to do this in America, but the cost of those leaflets were deemed too much of a burden on the taxpayers.
p5071
aVI've been in America for 15 years now, I miss the NHS.
p5072
aVEven with waiting for care, expensive prescriptions and all the other crap, it's still miles better than anything in America.
p5073
aVOh good, so we're (the US) only 66 years behind.
p5074
aVI moved to Australia 3 years ago.
p5075
aVOh how I miss this beautiful thing
p5076
aVIt looks so simple.
p5077
aVI got I.T.P a few years ago, not too serious a condition but it effects the blood so I've had to go in to hospital a fair bit for tests and treatment over the last 18 months or so.
p5078
aVThe staff at the NHS Hospital are unbelievably good, kind natured people who always seem extremely tired and over worked.
p5079
aVI would of been absolutely fucked had it not been for our free health service and I'm massively thankful for the care I've received.
p5080
aVI'm moving to Canada in September and it will be a real shock having to pay for this kind of stuff! 
p5081
aVIt's a system immediately glad to have absolutely even though I've rarely been in a doctors or a hospital but the few times I have were for some serious issues.
p5082
aVIssues that would of cost thousands privately.
p5083
aVPeople may complain about the NHS but it's good to know it's there.
p5084
aVAn organisation the size of the NHS is bound to have issues. 
p5085
aVBBC Archive: [Birth of the National Health Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/nhs/).
p5086
aVOnly 66.
p5087
aVFor some reason I thought it was much older. 
p5088
aVAmerican here: Damn, I'm jealous.
p5089
aV:/
p5090
aV3 cheers for free medical care.
p5091
aVIt's worth noting that the only reason we were able to afford this is because America gave us a shit tonne of money after we sent Keynes over to get us some aid.
p5092
aVThanks America!
p5093
aVAmerica day was yesterday, you can stop pretending to like them now. 
p5094
aVOh hey, I just get a kick out of the fact they paid for our NHS but refuse to pay for their own.
p5095
aVAlso a ton of profit from winning WW2 
p5096
aVThe war actually put Britain in a lot of debt, we didn't profit from WW2 at all, if my\u000amemory serves me right.
p5097
aVWe mostly just got a lot of aid from America.
p5098
aVWe tried to avoid pushing massive reparations on Germany again, and focused on rebuilding what we were put under control of, rather than stealing what they produced.
p5099
aVRussia stole whole factories from what they invaded of Germany which is one reason that East Germany was so fucked.
p5100
aVBut America dished out wads of cash to all the Allied countries an various other countries in Europe to try and increase American influence and capitalism, as well as make them more stable economically so that they were less likely to fall into communism.
p5101
aVPretty much the entire reason Western Europe is so well of is that we had American aid backing us up.
p5102
aVSay what you will about their intentions, argue over who 'won' the war, there's absolutely no arguing we owe America a lot of thanks for what they did after the war.
p5103
aVThat's exactly what they wanted of course, and it paid off, they still have our political friendship after all.
p5104
aVI realise I've gone off on a tangent here, you could know all this stuff and probably more, but maybe you or someone else doesn't and they find it interesting.
p5105
aVPlease, if I have anything wrong, correct me.
p5106
aVI'm a God-fearing Englishman, and I'm God-damn proud of my government. 
p5107
aVYet you just broke one of the commandments, well done.
p5108
aVIf you're talking about the "Taking his name in vain" one, IIRC that has less to do with "God damn", and more to do with putting words into God's mouth and using his name as a beatstick with your own opinion wrapped around it. 
p5109
aVSounds like he's quoting Lewis Prothero from Alan Moore's V for Vendetta.
p5110
aV&gt;I'm God-damn proud of my government.
p5111
aVWhy?
p5112
aVThe current one is trying to sell it off.
p5113
aVOur nation's finest moment.
p5114
aVKeep it up!
p5115
aVI want this.
p5116
aVIts stretched as thin as it can be with all the budget cuts, but its an invaluable service.
p5117
aVMy wife would, in all likelihood, not be here today if it wasn't for the NHS.
p5118
aVShe has had extensive work on her heart (2 valve replacements and a stent for an aortic aneurysm).
p5119
aVAll at no cost (apart from taxes of course).
p5120
aVI can only imagine what something like that would cost privately.
p5121
aVAnd I give it another decade until it implodes
p5122
aVImplodes?
p5123
aVNo, that assumes internal problems, it'll be torn apart by government vultures and sensible people won't let that happen, we do **not** want to drop to the level of the US.
p5124
aV[deleted]
p5125
aVThe quality of UK healthcare is higher.
p5126
aVMedicine isn't the only part of **healthcare**.
p5127
aV[deleted]
p5128
aV&gt; I'd prefer to purchase insurance and receive healthcare in the United States then be at the mercy of the NHS.
p5129
aVIf you're a stupid cunt and don't buy insurance then that's your fucking problem.
p5130
aVEver heard of social responsibility?
p5131
aVOh, no, you're a selfish sack of shit, you've already pointed that out.
p5132
aVAlso, you know that not everyone can *afford* insurance right?
p5133
aVOh wait, they're just not working hard enough are they?
p5134
aVPoor people should just get less poor amirite?
p5135
aV[deleted]
p5136
aVAnd yet..\u000a\u000ahttp://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148#.
p5137
aVSo much for affordability. 
p5138
aVHAHA, "assumes internal problems".
p5139
aVYou have no fucking idea do you?
p5140
aVThe Government aren't the only bad guy that will make the NHS fail.
p5141
aVDon't let your Guardian copy fool you.
p5142
aV&gt;  You have no fucking idea do you?
p5143
aVI'm open to learning.
p5144
aV&gt; The Government aren't the only bad guy that will make the NHS fail.
p5145
aVForeign and internal private health corporations with agendas are also a huge issue, as well as poorly managed contracting, increasing privatisation and inefficiencies that need to be solved rather than being cut.
p5146
aV&gt; Don't let your Guardian copy fool you.
p5147
aVLet's not start with the silly tribalism now shall we.
p5148
aVI haven't read the guardian in nearly 8 years.
p5149
aV&gt; It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care\u000a\u000aWell, 1 out of 3 aint bad...
p5150
aVWe still get some dental help and if you're poor or at high risk (IIRC) you get dental care free.
p5151
aVNursings still there for most people and you get nursing aid in hospices and hospitals.
p5152
aV&gt; all
p5153
aVSAVE THE NHS. 
p5154
aVFor all the NHS's faults (private purchases of medical equipment, GPs raking in up and indeed over one million quid per year, the hospital death panels that put poor people as young as 30 on the LCP, the drug companies who pay for human experimentation and our doctors who knowingly give you untested drugs purely to see the results, the fact that the biggest killer in the country is death in hospitals from misdiagnosed illness, followed by death directly caused by correct treatment (go and look up the stats for yourself), in fact GPs are the number one cause of death).
p5155
aVAfter all that mess, I still wouldn't want anything else, we now live in the safest country to have a car accident, paramedic training is brilliant, consultants and other specialists are great.
p5156
aVMy brother is very, very senior in the health service and he always tells people to avoid their GP.
p5157
aVIf you think you have something wrong with you go to a hospital, do not visit your GP.
p5158
aVAlso, never under any circumstances take anything other than pain killers or anti biotics prescribed by your GP.
p5159
aVGPs are NOT medical experts, they are General Practitioners - in the medical world they are the equivalent of one of the shop assistants who work in Curry's, they know just enough, but don't let them open up your computer and try to reprogram the hardware.
p5160
aVAfter some of the stuff I have flung at my GPs, I reckon a million quid a year is a bargain.
p5161
aVDoctors McKenzie and Finlay, I salute you.
p5162
aVI am only alive today because of you.
p5163
aVHow do you 'Muricans feel about this?
p5164
aVSeeing as how American reddit user are mostly left wing to a certain extent, I bet most of them are jealous.
p5165
aVI however am a right wing American so I am happy to not have an English quality healthcare system.
p5166
aVQuite right - it is not a charity and we are all paying for it.
p5167
aVIt's a shame that some people seem to forget that.
p5168
aVoh don't worry the daily mail will remind us,... well daily.
p5169
aVI hate my taxes going towards medical help for those in my society who wouldn't be able to afford it.
p5170
aVYeah, what a bunch of bastards.
p5171
aVBeing ill &amp; not rich.
p5172
aV&gt; it is not a charity and we are all paying for it.
p5173
aVMost people already know this.
p5174
aVWhat they mean when they say "free" is "not getting brutally dildoed by ridiculous medical fees as soon as the ambulance turns on to your street".
p5175
aVI don't know of anyone who forgets that. 
p5176
aVThe only people who take "free healthcare" to be anything other than convenient shorthand for "healthcare that is free at point of use" are those looking for strawmen to fight.
p5177
aVEveryone knows it's not literally free.
p5178
aVI find the NHS care appalling and am not sure it's anything to be celebrated. 
p5179
aVHaha...ha...freedom...

aVThe number of immigrants in this country and their benefit or burden to the UK economy has nothing to do with their religion.

p5183
aV[deleted]
p5184
aVGood job sourcing the BNP.
p5185
aVIs there an ordinance in the holy Koran to move to foreign countries and drain them dry?

aVYou're linking to the bnp site as if it's a *source*?
p5189
aVDon't be so ridiculous.
p5190
aVJust because they can find a 2 year video wirh no context that has someone saying it, doesn't make it true.
p5191
aVHere - have a read of a much more nuanced article that has data and numbers and actual maths in it - www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25880373
p5192
aVLinking the BNP as a credible source- that's even worse than using the Daily Mail for facts.
p5193
aVSo, 5 months later than in my country.

p5200
aV&gt;Study by Washington-based foundation \u000a\u000aGood job, mate.
p5201
aVYou cocked up.
p5202
aVSure the NHS has done very little good for me, messing up a few times.
p5203
aVBut then I see how many other people it has helped, and them messing up a few times on minor things is more than made up by someone not being slapped with 6 figure sums of money just because they were selfish enough to get cancer.
p5204
aVThe NHS is great for people who don't know any better, Stop pretending it's the best system in the world.
p5205
aVI have relatives in France and they're appalled by the waiting times I have to endure in the UK.
p5206
aVIn France, for a routine procedure that normally takes 2 to 3 weeks from the doctor's appointment to the hospital procedure itself, I had to wait 1 WHOLE YEAR in the UK and go to 4 different hospitals.
p5207
aVMy file even got lost, I had to help the doctor look for it in his archives room!
p5208
aVAs for the GP I never get to see the same twice, they have no clue and they can't prescribe ANYTHING stronger than aspirine without having to send you first to see all kind of specialists.
p5209
aVWhen I was in France the GP had the authority and common sense to prescribe anything he deemed necessary. 
p5210
aVThat sounds nothing like my experience with the NHS.
p5211
aVI can visit my personal favourite GP several times a month, on the very same day if it's an emergency.
p5212
aVIf he's not available, I can pick from several others who are just as qualified.
p5213
aVAnd he's prescribed me very strong antibiotics among other things without referring me to a single other person.
p5214
aVI've been in and out within five minutes in some cases.
p5215
aVNothing like forcing people to pay for something.
p5216
aVWhat are you trying to say?
p5217
aVThat socialism = communism?
p5218
aVDoesn't matter, already down voted to oblivion by the folks that don't have to pay, but still have the "rights" to receive. 
p5219
aVSo are you American?
p5220
aVOr are you from England, expressing your dislike of the immigrants and benefit claimers that use the system?
p5221
aVOf course he's American.
p5222
aVIn what way does the NHS provide more value...
p5223
aVIn caring for the most vulnerable members of our society or by pissing you off?
p5224
aVI'm not even sure.
p5225
aVYou know, you wouldn't be saying that if you knew someone who was in need of medical help, or it was you. 
p5226
aVThis fear tactic is such bullshit.
p5227
aVIt's like saying, Nobody wouldn't be against gun ownership while they're having their home invaded. 
p5228
aVStay in America then if you don't like it
p5229
aVWhat are you, American?
p5230
aVNah, this is for others who do not know "The queue".
p5231
aVWe have an innate queuing ability.
p5232
aVAh, it's cultural a guide for Johnny Foreigner.
p5233
aVYes, quite.
p5234

aVIndeed, only those bloody foreigners need these guidelines. 
p5251
aVHey!
p5252
aVNot *all* foreigners.
p5253
aVCanadians also innately know how to queue.

aV"Any violation of these guidelines will resulting in tutting.

aVAnd an ever so small frown in your general direction.
p5258
aVJust a mere down-movement of the eyebrows, mind you, nothing excessive of course. 
p5259
aVBut, god forbid, the miss-queuing-offender seeing you do this frown.
p5260
aVOtherwise, you yourself will be subjected to severe tutting. 
p5261

aVWe are the queue.
p5297
aVYou'd be surprised at how many people think they're entitled to just walk in front of you in a queue abroad, it's quite annoying sometimes.
p5298
aVI'm always baffled how in foreign countries people think it's acceptable etiquette to go in front of other's that were clearly there waiting long before they arrived.

aVThey're so bad at queuing that most places that require a queue (Post Offices, government offices, even the butcher's) have had to institute a number system.
p5316
aVWithout it, it becomes a scrum, and also subject to the people behind the counter serving their mates/relatives first.
p5317
aVAnd *even then* there's always some old tosser who will push in front of you without a ticket "just to ask a question" which then becomes an entire 10-minute-long transaction.
p5318
aVThe minimum time I've ever had to wait in a post office is about 45 minutes.
p5319
aVWatching two lanes of traffic trying to merge here is an exercise in exasperation.
p5320
aVThat's just rude. 
p5321
aVWell, the number system is used all over the place, including the UK.
p5322
aVIt allows you to queue while sitting down - what's not to love?
p5323
aVFor the rest, I assume you're British, right?
p5324
aVAs a Brit who grew up in Greece, I think there's a high chance you simply haven't yet fully understood all the intricacies of the Italian queuing system - there are probably hundreds of unwritten rules everybody but you is following. 
p5325
aV&gt; the number system is used all over the place, including the UK\u000a\u000aIn certain places, but not as frequent, and definitely not in the post office.
p5326
aV&gt;  there are probably hundreds of unwritten rules everybody but you is following.
p5327
aVCould be true.
p5328
aVThen again my Italian girlfriend also gets pissed off when people push in front.
p5329
aVDepends on the size of the post office I suppose...
p5330
aVI have definitely been in post offices in the UK with a number system.
p5331
aVAlso, pro tip: if Italy is anything like Greece, getting pissed off when people push in front is *part* of the system.
p5332
aVYou're supposed to do something about it (tutting and eye rolls don't count), preferably with an air of infinite sophistication and condescension. 
p5333
aVThe post office I used to go to in Leeds had a ticketed number system.
p5334
aVSavages.
p5335
aVIt's why I stopped going.
p5336
aVSomeone should write a pamphlet then?
p5337
aVItalian guide to queuing.
p5338
aVIt could be handed out at the airport.\u000a
p5339
aVThat just sounds... horrendous...
p5340
aVI noticed that in Germany, when queuing to get train tickets - people just pushed in front.
p5341
aVSo I thought, *when in Rome*, and did the same.
p5342
aVI got such ugly stares and comments made in my direction.
p5343
aVI guessed then that the German *pile-in-to-the-front* technique was maybe not as chaotic as it looked - there was some kind of secret etiquette they were all following.
p5344
aVBut they violated my queue, and had to pay for it, godamnit.
p5345
aVWhen I do that now, and get those comments and scowls, I know I'm doing good.
p5346
aVThey'll learn ;-)
p5347
aVI think the rule in Germany is that the rules apply to everyone but you.
p5348
aVI can't count the number of times I saw someone get all bent out of shape after seeing someone break a rule that they themselves had broken mere minutes ago.
p5349
aVDon't get me wrong, I love the Germans, I really do, but that doesn't mean I will ever understand them.
p5350
aVI think they vary so much more than any other nationality I know when as individuals compared to when in groups.
p5351
aVThe British tend to form groups of individuals, while the Germans become amorphous closed groups when out together.
p5352
aVIts fascinating, and I'm not being critical about that at all.
p5353
aVI may even be alone in that feeling. 
p5354
aVEspecially once they've twigged you're foreign.
p5355
aVWhen they spot yellow rear numberplates it's like they're a shark that smells Blood On The Autobahn
p5356
aVI was once told off by a colleague for "doing personal things at work".
p5357
aVI was reading my work email.
p5358
aVHe was on the phone with his wife about childcare.
p5359
aVThe rule is that you're allowed to push but you have to queue.
p5360
aVYou're not allowed to jump the queue, especially if the queue is long.
p5361
aVYou basically have to serve some time in the queue but nobody is exactly keeping track because everyone else is pushing too.
p5362
aVAh, so I stand out too much and become the scapegoat. 
p5363
aVIn the German speaking areas: yes.
p5364
aVBut [Cutting In Line In Front Of Italians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FloeB_fhFSE) might follow different rules
p5365
aVMy female friend was in shock when I went full Malcolm Tucker on a Spanish guy who tried to jump ahead of us at 2am in Barcelona and nick our taxi.
p5366
aVI've since been told I threatened to do things with his toenails. 
p5367
aVSo, who got the taxi?\u000a\u000a
p5368
aVThe Caledonian Mafia never fails lad. 
p5369
aVA German did this to me the other day.
p5370
aVHe appeared extremely upset that I was rude enough to have a problem with this.
p5371
aVThis.
p5372
aVI was in Tokyo a couple of years ago queueing for a ticket machine for the train and no less than three people cut out the entire queue (I think there was only three of us and we were probably all British).
p5373
aVIn NL they are crap at queuing ( three desks; three queues.
p5374
aV)\u000a\u000aI have had to adopt Dutch bluntness to deal with this:\u000a\u000a"Allo!
p5375
aVJa, Allo meneer!
p5376
aVEr is een rij.
p5377
aV"\u000a\u000aTranslation: excuse me.
p5378
aVYes excuse me good sir.
p5379
aVI think you will find there is, in fact, a queue.
p5380
aVSorry to bother you. 
p5381
aVI love dutch bluntness.
p5382
aVBuying a ticket in Amsterdam Centraal once, a guy behind me tried to jump in front when a window became empty.
p5383
aVThe assistant in the window immediately roared, in English, "SIR, THESE PEOPLE ARE IN FRONT OF YOU.
p5384
aVI WILL SERVE THEM AND THEN I WILL SERVE YOU.
p5385
aV"
aVi once was queuing for a cash machine in Amsterdam and a woman stood BESIDE me in the queue.
p5386
aVTerrifying. 
p5387
aV'Queueing' for a McDonnalds in Spain was the most traumatic experience of my life.
p5388
aVIt's just stressful not having a queuing system...
p5389
aVAnd to think, most of the time the queueing system in McDonald's is often just a slightly sporadic crowd of people here in the UK, what you're describing must be how hell feels
p5390
aVAs a foreigner I think British queueing is among the nicest things in this world.
p5391
aVIt makes me feel like the world is not actually such a bad place, with no order or care between people.
p5392
aVWish everyone was British
p5393
aV&gt;  Wish everyone was British\u000a\u000aWe had a pretty good go at that a couple of centuries ago.
p5394
aV[deleted]
p5395
aVand im backing it up with this gun. 
p5396
aVA couple of centuries ago?
p5397
aVIt was at it's height in 1922.
p5398
aVI'm sure if we go again there's still some residual Britishness left over in places.
p5399
aVWe can pick up where we left off. 
p5400
aVIndia has forgotten it all, everything. 
p5401
aVThey're quite good at cricket, it wasn't a total write off. 
p5402
aVIndians have the greatest manners ever, they even developed our social class system to a new level.......maybe not such a good thing on that last point.
p5403
aVGood?
p5404
aVBeing British means being bad at the sports we invent.
p5405
aVYeah, not like a majority of them all speak English or anything.. 
p5406
aVDo they?
p5407
aVThey didn't seem to when I was on holiday their last week.
p5408
aVDefinitely a minority that spoke English beyond basic market selling. 
p5409
aVSorry got that wrong, around 20% do, which is some 125+ million. 
p5410
aVPretty sure more Chinese speak English per capita than Indians, but I take your point. 
p5411
aVNot really surprising, given the difference in literacy rates. 
p5412
aVMore Chinese speak English than Americans do.
p5413
aVBoy, could you speak *American?
p5414
aV*
aVAs with most places in the world those who are the better educated will learn English, usually pretty damned well too, probably better than the average slosh I hear around me in Wales.
p5415
aVIt's an enormous country, language there is certainly regional.
p5416
aVActually a lot more to do with class, ie if you're rich or not and thus how you were educated, rather than regional.
p5417
aVEverything is written in both English and Hindi everywhere, but only a small percentage can read and understand the English.
p5418
aVI'm not sure that 20% is such a small percentage, certainly not compared to China's 0.73%.
p5419
aVAnd overall they're pretty good at it- India ranks 3rd in Asia for English proficiency http://www.ef.com/epi/
p5420
aVTrue, but there are 20 or so "official" languages (IIRC), with over a thousand other dialects and languages.
p5421
aVYou get plenty of places where people don't speak Hindi, but Bengali or Gujarati.
p5422
aVIt doesn't help that every concerted effort to have a national language, has been met with (understandably) fierce resistance.
p5423
aVEnglish is a hangover from our occupation of India, with some of the higher education still being taught in English.
p5424
aVThen in 1776 some englishmen lost their way, started killing other englishmen, throwing away almost eight centuries of tradition and heritage all for the sake of lower taxes. 
p5425
aVAnd so they could keep having those oh-so-profitable slaves for another century or so.
p5426
aVFreedom, what a gimmick.
p5427
aVTo borrow an American phrase...
p5428
aV*ZING!
p5429
aV*\u000a\u000aAhem.
p5430
aVQuite.
p5431
aVOther places that are relatively good at queueing: Ireland, Hong Kong, ~~Japan~~*, [South Africa](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01389/vote2_1389530c.jpg) er... that's it I think.
p5432
aV\u005c* [Apparently not](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28xy4m/possibly_the_most_british_thing_ever/ciflhxh).
p5433
aV\u005c** [Hmm conflicting information](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28xy4m/possibly_the_most_british_thing_ever/cifl6zp).
p5434
aVNow tell me, what do 3/4 of these countries have in common?
p5435
aVYour point.
p5436
aVI see it.
p5437
aVLet's add ~~Australia and~~* New Zealand then.
p5438
aVHow are Canadians at it?
p5439
aVI'm guessing they're quite good.
p5440
aV\u005c* [Man down](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/28xy4m/possibly_the_most_british_thing_ever/cifm27y).
p5441
aVOh we're good at it.
p5442
aVMum would never approve if we took too many qualities from our neighbour.
p5443
aVJolly good.
p5444
aVStand down that man.
p5445
aVAustralians don't queue.
p5446
aVThey mill about until the very last minute then everyone tries cramming in or through or on at the same time.
p5447
aVSource: grew up in Australia, was shocked at how orderly the bus stop queues were here in the UK.
p5448
aVBut after ten years of living here I went back to Australia for a visist and was frustrated at the lack of queues.
p5449
aVThat's when I realised I was more British than Australian.
p5450
aVWell that and being asked constantly where in England was I from! 
p5451
aVIt usually depends on where the queue is, I've found (at least in Perth) that people are usually good at queueing for most day to day things except for trains and sometimes buses.
p5452
aVThe bus queues are usually OK unless it's a stand that services more than one route and then it's worse than the 'queueing' for the trains.
p5453
aVEvery holiday I go on someone asks me where in England I'm from, I really need to learn to speak welsh.
p5454
aVI think the problem is that other countries say England instead of Britain.
p5455
aVEven my mum (in Australia) is confused, she says I'm in Wales in England!
p5456
aVYou'd think with the number of places named after us in the world they'd know better :p
p5457
aVdriving on the left, right?
p5458
aVAll of those countries drive on the left
p5459
aVAnd Japan is a small, overcrowded island with a monarchy, former imperial ambitions and a record for politeness
p5460
aVWeren't too polite to the chinese unfortunately...or the rest of Asia a few years ago. 
p5461
aVHence I put "Imperial ambitions" before it.
p5462
aVI think it's the Thais (definitely a SE Asian country...) that have the best system - you leave something of yours in a queue.
p5463
aVOn my fb wall the other day, someone had posted the queue to a yoga session in their gym.
p5464
aVIt was a trail of water bottles and towels.
p5465
aVYou can go off and do something useful in the mean time.
p5466
aVExcellent.
p5467
aVIsn't that the same as the "50p on the side of the pool table" system?
p5468
aV***British***.
p5469
aVAh, quite right.
p5470
aVWe did invent it first after all!
p5471
aVThat is pretty good.
p5472
aVI would enjoy having a go at that style of queuing. 
p5473
aVUntil some bastard comes along and nicks everyone's things...
p5474
aVOddly, I found Argentines to be good queuers.
p5475
aVNot brilliant.
p5476
aVBut good nonetheless.
p5477
aVMaybe that is their real reason for wanting the Falklands: they just want to learn our queuing habits. 
p5478
aVI would say Portugal is pretty good at it as well.
p5479
aVIf you like a British queue, you should try a Japanese one!
p5480
aVFunny you should mention Japan.
p5481
aVI've been in Japan, and while people will queue nicely, it lacks spirit.
p5482
aVThose queues are a bit too cold, and silent.
p5483
aVHere there'll almost be a random person, especially elderly people, who will just chat you up to pass the time.
p5484
aVEven if not with you, then with someone else.
p5485
aVMakes the whole place feel more lively, and human.
p5486
aVFeels great.
p5487
aV&gt;  I've been in Japan, and while people will queue nicely, it lacks spirit.
p5488
aVThis is true.
p5489
aVOn the other hand I find talking to strangers rather un-English.
p5490
aVUnless for a limited range of topics like Where is the bus?
p5491
aVor Lovely grey sky.
p5492
aVThat's why it's usually elderly people.
p5493
aVThey A) don't give a fuck anymore and B) just want someone to talk to.
p5494
aVI live in Japan at the moment, and the amount of fucks old people don't give in comparison to younger people is quite severe.
p5495
aVOld men and women will talk to me all night and day if possible, but starting a random conversation with anyone under 60 is nigh on impossible. 
p5496
aVTIL I'm elderly. 
p5497
aVYou probably learned that yesterday as well but forgot.
p5498
aVSorry, learned what? 
p5499
aVMust be a brummy thing.
p5500
aVEdit : that's where I'm from too
p5501
aVIs brum even English anymore?
p5502
aVI've been talking to random people for at least since I was in my mid-twenties.
p5503
aVI find people who are unable to engage in meaningless chit-chat to be missing what it means to be British.
p5504
aVactually it's very English.
p5505
aVI've been living in Sweden and no one does it here.
p5506
aVAs soon as I touched down, everyone from the guy who checked my passport to the lady I brought water from at the kiosk to the man I brought my coach tickets from, everyone was chatty and nice.
p5507
aVIn sweden, the bare minimum is "hello, that's 230 SEK please, bye.
p5508
aV"
aVRemind me not to go to Hampshire.
p5509
aVOr is it everywhere these days?
p5510
aVI dread to think it's become like that since I left.
p5511
aV[deleted]
p5512
aVMy boyfriend (who is English) goes basically apoplectic when I (recovering American) talk to people on the train.
p5513
aVFair enough.
p5514
aVWhy would you think they'd want to talk to you?
p5515
aVHaha, I've had several times when I've left Chesham and someone has sat next to me and we've talked all the way into London.
p5516
aVThey tend to be older ladies, but I enjoy it.
p5517
aVPeople are interesting and everyone has great stories.
p5518
aVWe're very tolerant of foreigners, I suppose.
p5519
aVMostly we just don't like to cause a fuss or upset anyone.
p5520
aVShort of being stuck next to someone on a cross country train where you're unlikely to see anyone else for the next 8-10 hours I can see no reason to talk to someone on a train.
p5521
aVEven then it would be limited to small talk regarding the lateness of the train or the weather. 
p5522
aVNever talk on trains.
p5523
aVI was showing some ladies (older ladies mind, before my girlfriend reads this) where the train station was.
p5524
aVAs soon as the shuttle pulled up we went silent.
p5525
aVThen talked again when we got off.
p5526
aVEngerlund.
p5527
aVIt is permissable to break into conversation when discussing how late the train is and to crack a joke about the irrelevant announcement from the guard.
p5528
aVThis is very accurate.
p5529
aVI live in Japan, and am British.
p5530
aVThe British queue is way way more amusing.
p5531
aVYou would never ever get anything sociable or in the spirit of fun happening in a Japanese queue.
p5532
aVThey do wait their turn nicely, and hats off to them for doing so (the mother FUCKING Chinese on the other hand; fuck those cunts), but you can't get any banter going at all.
p5533
aVRespectfully, I have to say the British queue beats the Japanese one, but the Japanese certainly put in a decent effort.
p5534
aVPlease don't lump all Chinese under the same banner.
p5535
aVThe former colony in Hong Kong is very good at queuing. 
p5536
aVFormer colony of which who...  haha, 
p5537
aVThis post is even more British than the original post \U0001f604
p5538
aVExcept while you're trying to send a business email from your phone and they relentless go on about the horse racing and how the cost of a pint at the royal legion recently went up to £1.60 like it was a sign of the end times.
p5539
aVAs a Brit, I fucking hate queuing.
p5540
aVI never push in or grumble, but man do I hate queuing.
p5541
aVI'm a foreigner too and I agree that it's very socialised how the British queue instead of the pushing everywhere else.
p5542
aVHowever, sometimes I find it quite annoying that queues are basically used as an excuse for bad service.
p5543
aVTo me, queuing itself is a sign of bad service.
p5544
aVA business shouldn't let people wait, I find it rude.
p5545
aVSure, you can't avoid it completely but sometimes I feel like that the British are more willing tolerate it that the have to wait for everything all the time just because there's a nice queue.
p5546
aVSo... the reason other countries don't do the queuing thing is because service is better?
p5547
aVJeeves, you're sacked!
p5548
aVNot necessarily, my point is more that it seems that I tend to get more upset about queuing than the British while the British get more upset when their isn't a proper queue.
p5549
aVHaving a nice queue is a good thing in my opinion but queuing itself isn't, it's just waiting.
p5550
aVImagine how much everything would cost if we doubled all ticket offices etc?
p5551
aVpffft I'd rather queue for 5 mins
p5552
aVIt's not that the UK is the only country with queues and obviously doubling all the ticket offices would be an overkill.
p5553
aVIt's more that I noticed that people don't seems to border that much if they have to wait but get very upset if someone jumps the queue. 
p5554
aVIt's just impractical to have enough desks/staff as to not require a queue.
p5555
aVLong queues are still hated by all though, just we moan quietly or not at all about it
p5556
aV&gt;  Wish everyone was British\u000a\u000aBNP member spotted.

aVQUEUE JUMPING WILL NOT BE TOLERATED!

p5570
aVThanks a bunch.
p5571
aV[deleted]
p5572
aVI don't think I ever fully appreciated how brilliant our queuing system is until I went to China.
p5573
aVBloody hell, it's total anarchy.
p5574
aVI'd be halfway through ordering a coffee and someone would push in front and try to order theirs.
p5575
aVOh God, and getting on the plane.
p5576
aVI still have nightmares.
p5577
aVHere's the PDF:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/W14_CH_046_5_Guide_to_queueing.pdf
p5578
aV&gt;If you have chosen to queue overnight, in the morning\u000a(approximately 06:00) you will be woken by the Stewards,\u000aasked to dismantle any equipment, and close up into tighter\u000aformation so as to create space for those joining The Queue\u000aon the day, arriving on the first tube.
p5579
aVHoly shit they capitalise the queue.
p5580
aVAlso, tube. 
p5581
aVIt's 25 pages?
p5582
aVHow?
p5583
aVWe have our standards organization, we are good at lengthy documentation:\u000a\u000ahttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103\u000a\u000aThat's a much more British document in my opinion
p5584
aVOne after the other, tight formation, creating space for those to come via the first tube.
p5585
aVMy guess: years of people travelling there at great expense to then queue in their own interpretation of what queueing means, leading to upset/arguments etc. 
p5586
aVI'm just....
p5587
aVI...
p5588
aVI'm just....
p5589
aVI mean....
p5590
aVI'm just so PROUD!
p5591
aV*wipes away patriotic tear*\u000a\u000aAlthough now we're teaching other nations how to do it, there is a danger that they'll become better at it than we are, as with every other national sport...
p5592
aVSteady there, steady.
p5593
aVQueuing is nothing so base as a sport.
p5594
aVIt is a way of life, a mentality that spreads to every facet of our existence. 
p5595
aVReminds me of a favourite quote from [Georg Mikes:](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/g/georgemike133330.html)\u000a\u000a"An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue of one"
p5596
aVSeeing the queue at my local Waitrose it is surprising how many are bad at it.
p5597
aVThe fast lane checkouts are always busy at lunch.
p5598
aVThat first person who isn't fully inside the queuing area gets to choose where the spill over goes.
p5599
aVThere are three options.
p5600
aVYou can block every till in the store by queuing left (surprising how popular this choice is).
p5601
aVYou can block all motion through the store by queuing straight into the isle behind.
p5602
aVOr you can queue to the right which only blocks the newspapers (this was the least popular choice).
p5603
aVThey've had to put a rope up to try and guide people on how to not queue like a moron.
p5604
aVThere's a Waitrose in Clerkenwell, in the centre of London that I go to a lot, and at lunch every day, a queue forms that circles the entire shop.
p5605
aVSome unseasoned shoppers take one look and leave, but it actually only takes a few minutes to get around as they have all 25 or so tills on at once - it's constantly moving.
p5606
aVI'm sure there'll be others on here who have been to this Waitrose and will know what I mean - efficiency in the highest order.
p5607
aVThis reminds me of the post office prank.
p5608
aVYou get a bunch of friends to form a queue out the front of an empty post office, or other business that won't interfere, and eventually people start forming behind you.
p5609
aVWait for a significant number of people to join in and then leave all at once.
p5610
aVMight not work as well these days but my old man and his mates would get away with it occasionally back in the day. 
p5611
aVSo they're just left queuing for nothing?
p5612
aVThat's brilliant.
p5613
aVThe most british prank ever.
p5614
aVThe queueing system at Wimbledon is actual quite complicated, hence needing a guide.
p5615
aVThere are different types of tickets available each day and different queues for the people that camped out overnight for tickets.
p5616
aVI have queued once for Wimbledon where I camped in the nearby park for 2 nights in order to get centre court tickets for mens quarter finals day.
p5617
aVWhen you get to the park, you get a 'queue ticket' which guarantees your place in the queue for that day.
p5618
aVThe next day you can either use that queue ticket to get in line for tickets that day or get a new queue ticket if your staying another night.
p5619
aVThe different types of tickets are the 3 (or maybe 4?
p5620
aV) show courts and then ground passes.
p5621
aVThere are limited numbers for each.
p5622
aVIf your staying overnight again, you're issued a new queue pass with a different number and it means you're now further in front of the queue as some people have gone in to the grounds that day.
p5623
aVYou also have to move your tent and keep it in line depending on your queue number.
p5624
aVAll that being done, the day you finally decide to cash in your queue ticket, you pack up your tent and line up ridiculously early.
p5625
aVStewards come down the line and exchange your queue pass for a wristband depending on what type of ticket you want i.e.
p5626
aVCentre Court, Court One etc.
p5627
aVOnce a certain wristband runs out, thats it, tickets for that court are up for the day.
p5628
aVAll the people that come early on the same day to get into Wimbledon join the back of the queue of the people that have camped out.
p5629
aVThen you all move in line to the ticket office at the entrance to the grounds.
p5630
aVShow your wristband and buy the ticket you want.
p5631
aVYeah, we like queueing. 
p5632
aVIt's televised you know?
p5633
aVThe most British thing I have ever seen was a Air Cadet Squadron who copied the performances of the Red Arrows (where feasible) whilst pushing red wheelbarrows around, calling themselves The Red Barrows
p5634
aVSurely this is the least British thing ever, True Brits know how to Queue instinctively and require no guidance other than the tutting of their Queue mates.
p5635
aVBravo
p5636
aVThis is absolutely the most Chinese thing ever.
p5637
aVThose fuckers can't queue worth a shit. 
p5638
aVPDF of the guide to queueing...\u000a\u000ahttp://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/W14_CH_046_5_Guide_to_queueing.pdf
p5639
aVI saw a badger eating a cheese sandwich once which was pretty British 
p5640
aVSounds like something Karl Pilkington would say...
p5641
aV/r/BritishQueuing is now a strictly private affair.
p5642
aVShould you wish to apply please have the correct forms in triplicate and join the appropriate line.
p5643
aV&gt; line\u000a\u000aSorry, I don't speak foreign.
p5644
aVYou'll need to talk to the supervisor then.
p5645
aVYour ticket number is 76.
p5646
aVWhich documents will you accept as proof of address? 
p5647
aVNone of the ones you have easily to hand.
p5648
aVI found out earlier in the year the only birth certificate my mum has for me is the short form one..... which only proves I was born at a time in a place.
p5649
aVnothing else.
p5650
aVworthless for anything that requires a birth certificate
p5651
aVBut what about applying to get your birth certificate?
p5652
aVI recently sent off for a copy of mine. 
p5653
aVI've never actually needed it and only searched it out recently.
p5654
aVhow much does it cost to get it?
p5655
aV£9.95 apparently https://www.gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate\u000a\u000a
p5656
aVDeath certificate?
p5657
aVha.
p5658
aVCongratulations, you've finished!
p5659
aVOooh, it's up from £7 a couple years ago.
p5660
aVIn fact, I was able to request them to send me my grandparent's "original" birth certificates, now, funnily enough, bilingual (English/Welsh), so I could prove their birth to another government agency.
p5661
aVPassport, two recent utility bills, and a Blue Peter badge ( any level ).
p5662
aVMy Blue Peter badge is still registered under my maiden name - will that affect my application? 
p5663
aV&gt; Passport\u000a\u000aSo basically you're shut for next 6 months
p5664
aVAnd yet, when a new till opens at the checkout in Sainsbury's, and the queues re-jig to fill the gap, it is every man for himself - fastest to the till gets to the front, no question.
p5665
aVThere is absolutely no social agreement that the people who have been queuing the longest should be allowed to the front.
p5666
aVNo way!
p5667
aVI got here first, now *fuck off*!
p5668
aVIt's so unusual to me, a Singaporean, that people around the world have to be instructed to queue.
p5669
aVWe are natural queue-rs. 
p5670
aVThat's good.
p5671
aVQueuing is polite and civil.
p5672
aVAhh, but that is not just any queue, it is The Queue.
p5673
aVThe Queue at wimbledon is a formal managed entity/structure.
p5674
aVThere is a prequeue to get a ticket to get into The Queue.
p5675
aVTo get into the prequeue you may have to camp out the night before or be there before 6am.
p5676
aVOn joing the prequuee you get a "Queue ticket" that lets you join The Queue to get a "real ticket".
p5677
aVIf The Queue is longer than the number of "real tickets" (+ a few reserves for people who either give up or get the front and fail to pay properly) then you will not be allowed to join The Queue.
p5678
aVAlso The Queue has different sub queues for the different tickets.
p5679
aVEdit QueueTickets are actaully wristbands so you can't change places with people in "The Queue"
p5680
aVIs this an actual thing?
p5681
aVIt's handed out to everyone who queues for Wimbledon.
p5682
aVSource: I'm queueing for Wimbledon. 
p5683
aVHow's the pamphlet working out for you? 
p5684
aVGoing for a show court or just a ground pass?
p5685
aVDidn't queue early enough for show courts.
p5686
aVPeople have been camping since yesterday for those.
p5687
aVAt least I'm in the first 3000 though! 
p5688
aVYeah my girlfriend and I queued in 2009 from 6pm ish the night before; Ordered a pizza, played some cards &amp; had a great time &amp; we got onto Court 1, but only about 40/50 places behind Centre Court (but C1 matches ended up being better anyway :) )\u000a\u000aMy advice is to either camp from 5pm ish, or just rock up on the day and get a ground pass like you've done - there are plenty of decent matches on outside courts
p5689
aVHi Kendo!
p5690
aV#
aV:(
p5691
aVI genuinely said the same thing to my dad yesterday!
p5692
aVIf you don't mind me asking, how is the queue working out?
p5693
aVI'm considering campaign overnight in Friday with my girlfriend and some friends 
p5694
aVI'm not sure how the overnight queue goes, we got here at 5:50 and we're in the first 3000 (first 5000 guaranteed).
p5695
aVThe people queueing for tomorrow's show courts (centre and no.1) are pitching their tents now (9:30am).
p5696
aVIt should be noted that "queuing" in this context doesn't just mean a standard queue.
p5697
aVYou queue the night before and have special cards for your place in the queue, you select a wristband based on your place to get into certain courts and you have to be there at a certain time.
p5698
aVSo "queue" in this instance is a bit more complicated.
p5699
aVhttp://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/W14_CH_046_5_Guide_to_queueing.pdf
p5700
aVDid you have a good day?
p5701
aVThe guide is needed for the Germans.
p5702
aVBoy, do they need to learn how to queue...
p5703
aVDear Brits, I see you have guidelines for queueing.
p5704
aVAre Brits very likely to queue into random lines that form at a given place?
p5705
aVMy German countrypeople used to stereotype themselves as queue lovers.
p5706
aVAnywhere a line forms, you'd queue in just to not miss anything.
p5707
aVIt's our national sport!
p5708
aV^^and ^^the ^^only ^^one ^^we ^^stand ^^a ^^chance ^^of ^^winning! 
p5709
aVWas actually expecting a picture of myself.
p5710
aVI was out walking my Victorian bulldog, in my Liverpool shirt, with a football.
p5711
aVHaving said that, it was a world cup football, so maybe it wasn't THAT British... :(
p5712
aVDidn't bite anyone did you? 
p5713
aVI'm more of a Gerrard (9 years ago) guy myself.
p5714
aVYou were beating up DJs at a club!
p5715
aV?
aVMaking it rain disappointment!
p5716
aVWell 9 years ago he won the champions league.
p5717
aV(God I hate myself for pointing that'd out)
p5718
aVThat's what I meant, then accidently referred to the present.
p5719
aVI moved over here a few weeks before the London Olympics.
p5720
aVI bought a ticket to a few of the football matches at St James' Park, and needed to queue to pick up the tickets.
p5721
aVI arrived to find a well-organised queue, snaking single file across the carpark.
p5722
aVIt was then that I knew that I was truly in Britain.
p5723
aV... and then it started drizzling.
p5724
aV... but I had brought a brolly with me.
p5725
aVMeant for johnny foreigner who seems oblivious to principles of queuing.
p5726
aVIn fairness, it isn't just a stupid guide to being in a normal queue - at least it wasn't when I did it a couple of years ago!
p5727
aVI queued overnight and there's lots of info about when you have to get up/get a move on, what to do with your stuff, what size stuff you can take, ticket prices (knowing you might not get what you want) etc.
p5728
aVVery British though.
p5729
aVSomeone got in front of me in a queue about a week ago, and I ended up tutting twice, then gave a sigh before he turned around.
p5730
aVI raised my eyebrows in disapproval, and he moved to the back of the line.
p5731
aVKids are getting horrible these days =/
p5732
aVI dont see a tea bag...needs a tea bag...
p5733
aVThe queue actually seems to be dieing out in some places of the UK - well, in central Manchester and London anyway WRT public transport.
p5734
aVMy bus has become a free-for-all.
p5735
aVQueue jumpers will get stern looks and perhaps even a talking to!
p5736
aVJust need the 'moaning at a bus stop' leaflet next.
p5737
aVThey need to make pamphlets for the Mainland Chinese!!!
p5738
aVThey don't/can't queue for shit!!!!!!
p5739
aV!
aVOne of the funniest things I've ever heard was in a World of Warcraft game session.
p5740
aVSomeone mentioned that the 'kway' was taking too long.
p5741
aVIt took me a solid minute before I realized that he'd butchered the word 'queue'.
p5742
aV^^Disclaimer:  ^^both ^^individuals ^^are ^^American.
p5743
aVI love Brits. 
p5744
aVI don't understand queueing or what the deal is, its just standing in line isn't it?
p5745
aVYou're comfortable with your use of the word "possibly"?
p5746
aVSuch a shame that most of the queue system is just abolished within London.
p5747
aVBritons wouldn't need a guide on how to do it.
p5748
aVTrue, but there are a lot of foreigners who may not know how to avoid upsetting the natives.
p5749
aVThe post office is the worst.
p5750
aVIt's literally the last place anyone wants to queue, so when someone just walks straight to the front, you're guaranteed to hear more than a few tuts.
p5751
aVTIL, British are not born with a 6th queuing sense.
p5752
aVThe Brits need no instruction on the subject, this is obviously for visitors.
p5753
aVI'm sure they must print many in French.
p5754
aVI went to a conference full of people of many different nationalities and come coffee break time the queue was the most abysmal tragedy I've ever seen.
p5755
aVI just gave up and went and sat down.
p5756
aVThey need to implement these in the village and town as well.
p5757
aVWhen the Tennis is on they get packed with tourists as well who all seem to have no concept of queuing, especially in the pubs.
p5758
aVI had to stare, tut and murmur under my breath 3 times earlier today whilst getting pints in. 
p5759
aVI was reading the AMA earlier with the owner of the Harris hawk that they use to scare of the pigeons at Wimbledon.
p5760
aVTurns out even the hawk has Wimbledon approved headwear.
p5761
aVI like that even the birds of prey have to dress appropriately when attending tennis. 
p5762
aVWhen I was at Disney world, people didn't que in single file for the monorail.
p5763
aVIt irked me.
p5764
aVI sometimes feel like everyone on Reddit has been brainwashed by Americans to believe we're obsessive about being in queues.
p5765
aVWe're not.
p5766
aVNobody likes it, people DO cut in and generally queue like cunts all over the country.
p5767
aVCan we stop propagating this idiocy and stop pandering to American Reddit?
p5768
aVYeah I don't get why Brits on here keep trying to play up to the tea-and-crumpet polite-queueing thing, it's kinda sad.
p5769
aVThere's so much ridicule of Americans for their ignorance but sometimes this place looks like it's just a bunch of American teenage girls roleplaying what they think British people are actually like.
p5770
aV"Oh yes, we drink tea all day and tut, God Save The Queen!
p5771
aV"
aVIt's just a circlejerk, like the Canadian's being polite.
p5772
aV[deleted]
p5773
aVI thought that was taking cheap shots at Americans and bad teeth
p5774
aV~ SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT QUEUING YOU UNFUNNY CUNTS ~
p5775
aVQueueing. 
p5776
aVSettee: A sofa/couch
p5777
aVOk thanks :D
p5778
aVQuick tip for the future - use google voice search, and put on your best over-exaggerated British accent
p5779
aVI'll try that!..
p5780
aVGuv'nor :D
p5781
aVThis has bought so much joy to my day
p5782
aVIt's true then.
p5783
aVIgnorance is bliss :D
p5784
aVOP is learning English and he's got wittier responses than me.
p5785
aVDamnit.
p5786
aVJust don't use Siri or it'll come up with "I didn't understand that, did you mean Teepee?
p5787
aV"
aV"Speak American dangnamit!
p5788
aV"
aVOh it's not even northern slang as I thought it was, weird that I hadn't heard it before then.\u000a
p5789
aVNorthern slang?
p5790
aVIsn't Micky Flanagan a massive cockney?
p5791
aVOh - you're right.
p5792
aVI mistook it for northern due to my danish ignorance.
p5793
aVProbably because the only other time I have had a hard time understanding someones show, was when I watched Peter Kay.
p5794
aVIt's not like anyone in the UK can tell the difference between an Åarhus accent and an Esbjerg accent so I wouldn't worry about it.
p5795
aVÅarhus?
p5796
aVIs that the one in the middle of the street?\u000a\u000a
p5797
aVMate - you're pressing your 'A' key too hard and forcing bubbles to form at the top! 
p5798
aVIt was our castle and our keep
p5799
aVWe would hitherto sleep there on occasion
p5800
aVUnderrated comment of the year contender.
p5801
aVOutstanding.
p5802
aVlol'd so hard
p5803
aVIt is if you live on Tyneside..
p5804
aVI cringed so hard at that I almost turned into pre-surgery Renee Zellwegger.
p5805
aVår hus, i mitten av veien, år hus.
p5806
aVSpeak for yourself.. nah I'm kidding I have no idea :P\u000a\u000aRoskilde was nice though.
p5807
aVThe biggest difference in Danish accents is Copenhagen and Jutland iirc
p5808
aVActually each region in denmark has its own accent.
p5809
aVEven though in modern day it is blanded out due to TV, a danish person can tell the difference between sealand, fyn, southern/northern jutland and bornholm.
p5810
aVIt used to be really distinct.
p5811
aVI remember, as a kid, going to visit my fathers side of the family in jutland and not understanding much of what they were saying because we live on sealand.
p5812
aVIt's a shame TV has caused accents to become less distinct.
p5813
aVEven the Geordie accent up in Newcastle isn't quite what it once was any more :(
p5814
aVWhen I was a kid, we used to go from South London up to my Dad's family in Yorkshire, then across to my Mum's lot in Manchester.
p5815
aVI didn't understand a word from the moment we left home.
p5816
aVMy partner thinks it's bizarre that I can sing On Ilkley Moor all t' way through.
p5817
aVI love how the unofficial anthem of Yorkshire is a cautionary tale about how going out without a hat can cause you to catch your death of cold.
p5818
aVAccording to my old English teacher from back at school, regional accents are actually becoming stronger in inner city areas.
p5819
aVSo there's that!
p5820
aVI can still tell village by village the accents of people from sussex.
p5821
aVAnd then there's streets in Durrington with their own distinctive phonological ticks.
p5822
aVApart from that bloke who narrated Big Brother who got more Geordie every year - not sure if he still narrates it, I stopped watching it years ago
p5823
aVIt was Marcus...something.
p5824
aVTodare in the Big Broova Harrs... 
p5825
aVI wouldn't say people finding it easier to communicate is a bad thing.
p5826
aVDevil's advocate: at the expense of their identity.
p5827
aVIt is if it's with Geordies. 
p5828
aVPrepare for possible confusion if you ever come to Tyneside.
p5829
aVThe Northern accent there is incredibly similar to the cadences of Danish.
p5830
aVThe words are different, but spoken in the same way (if that makes any sense...) To the point where I can't sit in the same room whilst my other half watches subtitled Danish dramas, as it sounds like people speaking nonsense in my own accent.
p5831
aVI often confuse The Killing with Byker Grove. 
p5832
aVHahaha that is funny :D
p5833
aVThe further north you go in the UK, the more likely you are to hear us using the proper pronunciation of 'house' and mouse' aka, the way that's also Danish :P
p5834
aVThere's a moose loose aboot this hoose
p5835
aVThere's northern words left over from Danelaw like "laik" for play.
p5836
aVI know!
p5837
aVJust couldn't think of any.
p5838
aVBairn (I think its barn in danish?
p5839
aV) for a young child/baby as well - pretty much everyone I know in the north east uses it.
p5840
aVYes!
p5841
aVI can never remember which words are Danish and which are just random northern words.
p5842
aV&gt; The further north you go in the UK\u000a\u000aI was in Inverness last year and everyone seemed to have an English accent.
p5843
aVTV must be a very powerful accent diluter  ;)
p5844
aVAt that point, you've gone too far and come out the other side.
p5845
aVSpent two years in Aberdeen which I can only describe as Glaswegian and Geordie had a bastard love child called Doric.
p5846
aVFoods ya doos.
p5847
aVOur friends were bemoaning the lack of Highland accents any more :(
p5848
aVYou don't have to go far outside of Aberdeen before the locals need subtitles though.
p5849
aVYou may find http://www.vox.com/2015/3/3/8053521/25-maps-that-explain-english interesting
p5850
aV"go home" in Geordie is *gan hyem*, which I think is very close to the Danish way of saying it. 
p5851
aVGo home in danish is "Gå hjem" so yes, it is closer :)
p5852
aVFucking Vikings.
p5853
aV*Bloody Vikings...
p5854
aV*Bloody Vikings ;)\u000a\u000ahttp://youtu.be/4Zp8jHvsepk
p5855
aVAnd some of the NE dialect has equivalents in Scandinavia as well.
p5856
aVI think 'Ah's gannin hyem' is perfectly good Danish/Norwegian (can't remember which). 
p5857
aV[Prosody is the word you are looking for](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_%28linguistics%29)
p5858
aVAhhh that might explain why I find the nordic dramas agreeable to watch, whilst the Italian ones irritating.
p5859
aVFrom the thing Mrs Pope was watching last night:\u000a\u000a&gt; "Snurblah ivva wentley gannin at a giraffe bead like y'kna?
p5860
aV"
aVIt's easy to think that any broad/difficult to understand english accent is a northern one.
p5861
aVAccent is a class distinction as well as a geographical one, and most english accents you're likely to hear abroad are middle/upper class ones.
p5862
aVCockney is a dying accent, unfortunately!
p5863
aV\u000a\u000a&gt;Cockney is a dying accent, ~~un~~fortunately!\u000a\u000a
p5864
aVGarlic bread?
p5865
aV! 
p5866
aV'Garlic Bread' - bread spread with butter and crushed garlic and heated in the oven, often served as a side dish.
p5867
aVThat's quite a rude thing to say.
p5868
aV"The North" is getting bigger\u000a\u000aWE'RE TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK!
p5869
aVIt's a Victorian word for a very specific type of seat, but over time can now be used to refer to any kind of sofa or couche. 
p5870
aVIt is considered more working or lower middle class.
p5871
aVA lot of people around Britain say it, but more in Norther England which has a correlation with socio-economic class.
p5872
aVMy university made a dialect map in which you can see where settee is used.
p5873
aVhttp://projects.alc.manchester.ac.uk/ukdialectmaps/lexical-variation/furniture/
p5874
aVI must be weird, I use them totally interchangeably.
p5875
aVDon't worry, that's normal, a lot of people do that.
p5876
aVIt's called code-switching.
p5877
aVEveryone changes their language slightly depending on the people and situation they're in.
p5878
aVYou probably grew up with family and friends who all might have used different words and nobody corrected you or stopped you from saying either.
p5879
aVDue to media/globalisation, boundaries between accents and dialects are broken down more and more.
p5880
aVE.g.
p5881
aVCouch is considered American and due to their influence on media, it's used more frequently.
p5882
aVQuite possibly the most adorable thing I've ever seen asked on this Sub.
p5883
aVI know, I've got a big grin on my face just reading through this thread.
p5884
aVOP's just so damn infectiously happy!
p5885
aVIts great!

aVThanks for the laugh!

aVHaven't seen that one before.
p5896
aVOh my god tell me about it.
p5897
aVWould you like to come and live with me little viking?
p5898
aVI'll let you pillage in the garden, and feed you from the table.
p5899
aVYou're adorable
p5900
aVYou must use this as a chat up line if you meet someone English you fancy.
p5901
aVIt's pure gold.
p5902
aVIt kind of only works in text, otherwise he's just asking what a settee is...
p5903
aVYeah but he's Danish.
p5904
aVIt'll be fine.
p5905
aVTinder.
p5906
aVThis is perfect Tinder ice breaking.
p5907
aVI am the lord of the dance settee.

aVAnother\u000a\u000ahttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W7fu0ulzS7M\u000a\u000aGiven the Putin news this song is relevant...
p5911
aVNope, we never had that one.
p5912
aVSing Hosannah is the only other one I remember. 
p5913
aVMy name sounds like Hossanah, people used to substitute my name with it during that song in their mornings.
p5914
aVMy favourite post on this sub now
p5915
aVAny post that doesn't involve death, corruption, politics (ok it's election time fair enuff... but still), and basically - just corporations/people being dicks - is extremely welcome.
p5916
aVYeah, I was shocked to see something that wasn't about politics 
p5917
aVTories are trying to outlaw the use of the word "Settee", and enforce the use of "Sofa" to make Great Britain sound more world traveled.
p5918
aVSouthern tories sit on a chaise longue.
p5919
aVIt was a couch round ours.
p5920
aVFunny we have at least 3 words for the same piece of furniture.
p5921
aVWe're like Eskimo's and Snow.
p5922
aVA chaise longue is actually a specific variation though: it's like a sofa missing half the back and an armrest so you can lie down on it.
p5923
aVBut it is silly we have sofa, couch and settee which all do mean the same thing.
p5924
aVIs that because of the corporate mates at Sofa Workshop?
p5925
aVThose damn Tories!
p5926
aV!
aVI was wondering wtf this post had 1500 upvotes for.
p5927
aVI get it now.
p5928
aVThis week I'll settle for any post that isn't about Clarkson
p5929
aVCock in the hole, though..

aVAh, but we can't all relocate to Birmingham, can we?
p5936

p5937
aVI got a Set X off the market once, not as nice looking but it does the job.
p5938
aVTake your set F and LEAVE!
p5939
aVhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314910/SET_F___06-14.pdf
p5940
aVBut the point of a set F is that you don't leave.
p5941
aVAlso, why is it an indefinite stay for children, when children usually become older than 18?
p5942
aVMore importantly, it says "children over 18", but I'm pretty sure that the definition of child is an under 18.
p5943
aVKiwi guy once asked me what "more-ish" meant.
p5944
aVHe guessed it was how we describe food brought over by the Moors (like Othello!
p5945
aV), or maybe from the Devon/Cornwell region, but there didn't seem to be a similarity in the type of food being described.
p5946
aVIt was very funny watching him come to terms with the degree to which he had over-thought the expression!
p5947
aVBilberries are both very moorish and very moreish.
p5948
aVDo you have any other words we can help you with? 
p5949
aVNot off the top of my head, but I will say it's really confusing watching Peter Kay the first  time because apparently tea = food and brew = tea :D
p5950
aVTea = dinner (evening meal) and yes brew = tea (hot drink) for northerners 
p5951
aVAnd dinner = lunch.
p5952
aVConfused the hell out of me with my northern housemate mixing those up. 
p5953
aVIt's why you have dinnerladies at school......
p5954
aVShit it all makes sense now.
p5955
aVWe called them lunchladies because dinner is an evening meal.
p5956
aVI don't know what to believe anymore.
p5957
aVWow.
p5958
aVTIL
p5959
aVYeah.
p5960
aVi used to confuse the hell out of americans by having dinner and tea instead of lunch and dinner when I worked there.
p5961
aVWhen I was on German exchange, I asked (in English, of course) my host: "what's for tea"?
p5962
aVThey looked confused and said they didn't understand.
p5963
aVI tried to clarify by suggesting chicken, gravy, potatoes...
p5964
aVIt's when they looked horrified that I realised how annoyingly ambiguous this language is.
p5965
aVDamn Germans, turning their noses up at some good ol' chicken gravy tea. 
p5966
aVAre you an outlander?
p5967
aVThat's fairly well known even down South.
p5968
aVYes.
p5969
aVI'm a BOTC.

aVFinally turned citizen.
p5971
aVBring Orangutans To Court?
p5972
aVHaha.
p5973
aVBritish Overseas Territory Citizen.
p5974
aVOh thanks, I was genuinely curious!
p5975
aVOoh, you're one of them fake brits :P.
p5976
aVI like to call it: descendant who found his way back home.
p5977
aVDo any Northerners know of the word 'favver' meaning 'to look like'?
p5978
aVLike if someone is skinny you might say "he favver's Jack Skelington!
p5979
aV" for example.
p5980
aVApologies for the tangent.
p5981
aVNo idea, I'm a southerner (as southern as they come!
p5982
aV) and I've never heard of it.
p5983
aVSome Yorkshire people said they use favour to mean resemble.
p5984
aV'He favours his dad' for example.
p5985
aVIn my neck of Lancashire it has evolved into a separate word!
p5986
aVUsed it many times, and is quite common up north
p5987
aVThere's a local ale near where I'm from called Tea too.
p5988
aVAsking for a pint of Tea is always interesting. 
p5989
aVNo problem with a SportsDirect mug.
p5990
aVAm using one now.
p5991
aVCan confirm.
p5992
aVDouble Bagging is required, however.
p5993
aV...technically its T.E.A.
p5994
aVGood stuff though.
p5995
aVTetley's is also tea and a brand of bitter.
p5996
aVConfused the fuck out of me when I was a nipper.
p5997
aVTea is an evening meal, and also a brewed drink as in "green tea".
p5998
aVOr.. Just tea.
p5999
aVThe latter was meant to refer to the fact that northerners will say "brew" instead of "tea".
p6000
aV&gt; Oh, I'd love a hot brew right now.
p6001
aVSome southerners do, but it's much more rare.
p6002
aVUnless they're ultra northerners...
p6003
aVThey have Irn Bru, which is made from girders but is drank.  \u000a\u000a
p6004
aVDo people ever refer to Scottish folk as 'Northern'.
p6005
aVMy mate is Scottish and refers to me as Northern, which I always thought was a bit odd.
p6006
aV[Unpronounceable, too...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvkByxe33ZM)\u000a\u000a
p6007
aV&gt;ultra northerners\u000a\u000aBbbut London is in France, aye?
p6008
aVYup.
p6009
aVIt's not strange for people to call a bear/cider a brew either.

aV)
aVAlso a steep little hill going down to a river!
p6016
aVNot OP but perhaps you could help me with brit bar culture though.
p6017
aVAnd tipping culture in that context as well.
p6018
aVSpecifically when am I expected to sponsor drinks etc
p6019
aVDo you mean buy other people drinks?
p6020
aVUsually people will take turns getting rounds in, and also you might be with people who play games where the loser has to get the next round.
p6021
aVBut usually its taking turns, I'll get everyone a drink, then Steve does, then you do, etc.
p6022
aVAs for tipping, its not usually done.
p6023
aVIf you're getting excellent service like lots of complicated cocktails served well, or drinks brought to your table, you might tip then but we dont normally tip for standard bar service. 
p6024
aVTips for bar staff usually go in a shared pot next to the till to be shared equally among the bar staff at the end of the night.
p6025
aVWhen paying for your drinks you can offer a tip by saying "and your own" or "and yourself" as you hand the cash over.
p6026
aVThe bar tender will then take 20p or so from the change and put it in the pot.
p6027
aVThats LetterWang.
p6028
aV/that doesn't quite work as well.. :-/
p6029
aVIf they ever make a remake they need to call it that.
p6030
aVWell there is [Wordwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHktd1VrGY)!
p6031
aVSCRABBLE!
p6032
aVI'm a little late to this party, but I did read a book called [Watching The English](http://www.amazon.de/Watching-English-Hidden-Rules-Behaviour/dp/0340818867) by [Kate Fox](http://www.sirc.org/about/kate_fox.html).
p6033
aVShe explains how to determine which 'class' somebody is by the words they use for things, and Settee is one example:  \u000a&gt;**Settee**  \u000aOr you could ask your hosts what they call their furniture.
p6034
aVIf an upholstered seat for two or more people is called\u000aa settee or a couch, they are no higher than middle-middle.
p6035
aVIf it is a sofa, they are upper-middle or above.
p6036
aVThere\u000aare occasional exceptions to this rule, which is not quite as accurate a class indicator as \u2018pardon\u2019.
p6037
aVSome younger\u000aupper-middles, influenced by American films and television programmes, might say \u2018couch\u2019 \u2013 although they are\u000aunlikely to say \u2018settee\u2019, except as a joke or to annoy their class-anxious parents.
p6038
aVIf you like, you can amuse\u000ayourself by making predictions based on correlations with other class indicators such as those covered later in\u000athe chapter on Home Rules.
p6039
aVFor example: if the item in question is part of a brand-new matching three-piece\u000asuite, which also matches the curtains, its owners are likely to call it a settee.
p6040
aVIt's an excellent book!
p6041
aVMade me aware of parts of English culture that I really would never have thought about, as well as the astonishing number of ways in which I (and my family and friends) conform to 'Englishness' without realising it.
p6042
aVDon't suppose anyone knows of a link to it online... You know... For free...
p6043
aVPlease?
p6044
aV:)
p6045
aVMate if you just google "(book title) + pdf" you'll find something 9 times out of 10. 
p6046
aVThanks, you're right - I was just on mobile last night :)
p6047
aVWhat a load of shit that is
p6048
aVShe pisses me off.
p6049
aVShe seems to think working class people don't understand irony.
p6050
aVIf a middle class person does something tacky, it's ironic.
p6051
aVIf a working class person does it's sincere. 
p6052
aVOh my god I'm reading that very book right now.
p6053
aVI'm like "Hahaha who the fuck does th.... oh me.

p6059
aVBrutal 
p6060
aV-f and -i are the opposite of each other.
p6061
aVYou could just do `rm -rf` instead of `yes|rm -fir`.
p6062
aVOr you could do `rm -irf`, which works because the command line arguments counteract each other in the order given, if that makes sense.
p6063
aVRight you are.
p6064
aVI was decaffeinated at the time...
p6065
aVyou want to know what a poof is?
p6066
aVI (a gay man) went to stay at my Mancunian friend's place and I said I didn't mind where I slept and not to make a fuss and her mum said \u201cShall we put the poof in that corner over there?\u201d\u000a\u000aHow we laughed.
p6067
aVDid you go?
p6068
aVOn the Isle of Wight the word queer is very common.
p6069
aVI nearly spat my tea out when I was first heard someone got a bit queer.
p6070
aVIs the Isle of Wight real or is it in an Enid Blyton book?
p6071
aVThe Isle of Wight is in a different time zone to the rest of the UK - 1956
p6072
aVFunnily enough the only people I know who live there are a very hot, modern gay couple. 
p6073
aVYou know me and my partner?
p6074
aVWow.
p6075
aV;)
p6076
aVIt's the only place in the world where there is still a whimpy's
p6077
aVTIL my local high street is stuck in 1956... And so is the next nearest one after that.
p6078
aVPlease note that the one in the Isle of Wight had to close for some time in the early 00's as the person occupying the flat above died,  rudely didn't tell anyone and proceeded to leak through the ceiling
p6079
aVWell where do you live?
p6080
aVWelling, London.

aVOne in Eltham too, always looks reasonably busy.
p6084
aVMust be a South East London thing. 
p6085
aVYeah that third link seems to show that hey're much more common in South East London than anywhere else.
p6086
aVThey're also in Woolwich, Lewisham, Deptford, Dartford, East Wickham, Beckenham and Sydenham.
p6087
aV"Queer" is still common to describe something as odd.
p6088
aVYep.
p6089
aVGot detention as a kid for using it in that context.
p6090
aVDidn't know it had an alternate meaning, so naturally the teacher wasn't too please I called him queer.
p6091
aVWhen my family moved from South London to Bournemouth, my Nan went from calling it a \u201cpoof\u201d to a \u201cpoofèt\u201d.
p6092
aVMy family calls it a "tumptey".
p6093
aVI am fairly sure that my family are alone in this as we have a ridiculous "language", but I'd be happy to be proven wrong. 
p6094
aVNope!
p6095
aVThis lovely word has seemingly been erased from history except for [this old Victoria Wood/Julie Walters sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEtqRjRBj3A).
p6096
aVNo way that's amazing! 
p6097
aVDo you know the word 'favver' meaning 'to look/be like'.
p6098
aVI thought it was 'If ever he is as' all smushed up into two syllables but it turns out its an old word in itself.
p6099
aVI think it's just favour, if person A favours person B it just means that A looks a bit like B. \u000a\u000a
p6100
aVIts pronounced with the a in hat, not the a in hate though.
p6101
aVAlso I've never heard of 'favour' to mean 'resemble'.
p6102
aV&gt; Also I've never heard of 'favour' to mean 'resemble'.
p6103
aVThats definitely a thing - "he/she favours his dad" means they look more like their dad than mum.
p6104
aVcool, never heard that.
p6105
aVWe have 'favvers' which is pronounced distinctly different from 'favours'.
p6106
aV'Favvers' must be derived from an old pronunciation of 'favours'.
p6107
aVIt's still used in parts of Lancashire, particularly by the elderly - definitely derived from "favours".
p6108
aVYon babby proper favvers ees dad!
p6109
aVSource: lived in Wigan for several years, heard many weird and wonderful pronunciations, and learned that steak pudding is often referred to as "babby's yed".
p6110
aVI say it, as do all ym family.
p6111
aVBut I didn't know if it was a single word or a slurred-together phrase.
p6112
aVWe mostly use it as a stock joke to liken something to something else.  
p6113
aVCheese pooféts?
p6114
aV&gt; https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/314910/SET_F___06-14.pdf\u000a\u000aI thought my family were the only ones in Bournemouth to call it a "poofèt" \u000a
p6115
aVIn London people used to call them poufées too ...
p6116
aVI don't know if they still do because I haven't heard anyone mention the item in question for a very long time
p6117
aVI hear DFS has a sale on them at the moment, such a rare occurrence. 
p6118
aVDon't forget it's ending soon!
p6119
aVYou're lovely!
p6120
aVCome and stay in Britain with us!
p6121
aV!
aVI was in Denmark last week.
p6122
aVI didn't want to come home.
p6123
aVAwesome place!
p6124
aVThat's very nice of you to say!
p6125
aVI was in scotland when I was younger and to this day I still think if I become a millionair I will buy a secluded house in the highlands and live there in the summer.
p6126
aVThat is my version of paradise :)
p6127
aVI'm glad you like the Highlands!
p6128
aVI drove up there just over a week ago and it's beautiful, even when it's dull and rainy. 
p6129
aVYeah it was dull and rainy when I was there too, and I loved the view from the tour bus, but I imagine it's nicer to be outside in the summer, and still beautiful :)
p6130
aV"Summer"
p6131
aVThe rain is slightly warmer, and falls vertically instead of horizontally.
p6132
aVScotland have "Summer"?
p6133
aVThe east coast does.
p6134
aVFor 2 hours on the third Sunday in July. 
p6135
aV&gt; I will buy a secluded house in the highlands and live there in the summer\u000a\u000aIt seems a bit excessive to buy a house that you'll only be living in for three days of every year...
p6136
aVUnfortunately my only connection with Danish culture is watching The Bridge but as a Scot I noticed several similarities in dialect.
p6137
aVFor one, the characters would often say "braw" meaning good.
p6138
aVWe say that in eastern Scotland.
p6139
aVAlso "noo" for now.
p6140
aVI believe the Norwegian for child is "barn", which is where we get "bairn" from in Scotland.
p6141
aVI would love to go to Denmark.
p6142
aVYou and all the bitey beasties.
p6143
aVHad a cracking holiday on Skye, walking and climbing.
p6144
aVWeather was pretty good.
p6145
aVThought I would lose weight, but I'm sure I put on a couple of pounds just from breathing in midges.  
p6146
aVI could do a whole thread on the funny Danish slang I've heard.
p6147
aVI am a Londoner that has been living in Denmark 10 years to the day today.
p6148
aVThis thread made me chuckle a lot.
p6149
aV:D
p6150
aVSounds like a good idea!
p6151
aVHe was probably talking about a settee which is effectively a couch/sofa
p6152
aVset e is Settee.
p6153
aVIt's a sofa / couch
p6154
aVI'm wondering how the "can I come in your ass/house?
p6155
aV" joke worked for you.
p6156
aVI got it :)
p6157
aVGood.
p6158
aVIt's one of my favourites!
p6159
aVMy South African friend takes full advantage of his acccent when buying cubes of frozen water for parties:\u000a\u000a "D'you sell Ass?
p6160
aV/ How much is your ass?
p6161
aV"\u000a
p6162
aVMa ass iss free for you, my friend!
p6163
aVSeems like a good place to ask:\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat's the difference between a settee, couch, sofa and a suite? 
p6164
aVSettee = Couch = Sofa  \u000a  \u000aSuite is the collective term for comfy sitting room furniture  \u000a  \u000a(I am basing this on 5th hand knowledge, passed down from father to son for generations in the BombTV blood line) 
p6165
aVSettee, couch and sofa are all used interchangeably.
p6166
aVCouch is a little more American but I have plenty friends who use it.
p6167
aVTo me, settee and sofa imply squishy comfort.
p6168
aVA suite is a matching set of sofas and armchairs, eg a 3 piece suite could be a 3 seater sofa, 2 seater sofa and an armchair (or a sofa and two armchairs or whatever).
p6169
aVI *think* a three piece suite is always a sofa (of indeterminate seats) and 2 armchairs.
p6170
aVMight be wrong.
p6171
aVAlmost always.
p6172
aVI've certainly come across a few stores over the years selling a *two settee + one armchair* package as a *three piece suite*.
p6173
aVIn her excellent book "watching the English" Kate Fox argues that what we call our furniture is a surprisingly good indicator of social class.
p6174
aVIn fact she includes it in a list of 7 words that she thinks are the most reliable indicators of lower social class (along with 'pardon', 'toilet', 'serviette', 'dinner', 'lounge' and 'sweet').
p6175
aVShe writes:\u000a\u000a&gt;Or you could ask what your host calls their furniture.
p6176
aVIf an upholstered seat for two or more people is called a couch or a settee they are no higher than middle-middle.
p6177
aVIf it is a sofa, they are upper-middle or above.
p6178
aVI'd recommend the book, incidentally, it's very good.
p6179
aVMade me aware of parts of English culture that really would never have thought about, as well as the astonishing number of ways in which I (and my family and friends) conform to 'Englishness' without realising it. 
p6180
aVBoom!
p6181
aVI call mine a sofa.
p6182

p6219
aVCan someone explain?
p6220
aVEd Balls joined twitter, and then he (or an aide) typed his name in the wrong box and made his first tweet Ed Balls.
p6221
aVThat's literally the whole thing.
p6222
aVTwitter finds this a lot funnier than they should.

aVAnd every April 28th, it's Ed Balls day.

aVNot heard of this before but it's pretty funny!
p6233
aVI think it's fucking hilarious.
p6234
aVIt's not just because he typed in the wrong box, but because it shows he was actually searching for himself.
p6235
aVI think he said he was just going into Asda and someone (staff member) texted him that a story had been done about him so he'd better read it and so he was trying to find it but typed in the wrong app.

p6285
aVI love it when he tells Jon to stop being so snooty.
p6286
aVGod, I fucking love Charlie Brooker.
p6287
aVI would so gladly pay for a night on town with him just to have his company.
p6288
aVIf by some miracle you read this Charlie, and you're not too freaked out with the idea of meeting some random guy from the internet, PM me.
p6289
aVBit of a long shot.
p6290
aVDito
p6291
aVI'd say more along the lines of *painful*, or *cringe-worthy*..
p6292
aVReally?
p6293
aVI thought it was an interesting observation of generational differences and stuff.
p6294
aVIn a weird way Jon held his own.
p6295
aVI guess I'm too familiar with generational gaps and IT.
p6296
aVThe thing that was most cringe-worthy here is he's clearly being fed questions via headset, so he has no idea what he's asking, nor does he listen to the answer.
p6297
aVThat was really emotive to watch, Jon was so dismissive, although he did do a good job of representing the general publics view of computer games.
p6298
aVCouple of point I think Brooker could've brought up,\u000a\u000a&gt;Whats the point in playing computer games?
p6299
aVWhats the point in reading a book?
p6300
aV&gt;It's violent and horrid.
p6301
aVNo more than Bugs Bunny or Tom and Jerry, but those cartoons have been accepted by mainstream media in a way that hasn't yet occurred with games.
p6302
aVPapers Please was an excellent game to cite though.\u000a
p6303
aVI thought Brooker really undersold gaming in this, he said so at the end himself.
p6304
aVThere were several times when he could have easily replied with the points you listed, as well as the poor explanation of how a typical videogame progresses.
p6305
aVIn films you might have a prologue before the title appears; in books, the same.
p6306
aVVideogames typically have an opening cutscene and a tutorial level, especially a game like Lego Marvel.
p6307
aVAlso people DO meet and get married and stuff through gaming.
p6308
aVThere are many examples across the world, whether it be meeting each others avatars in an MMORPG or meeting in real life at a gaming event, of which there are many.
p6309
aVThere was so much that Charlie missed out on talking about, even though Snow was, perhaps purposefully, very difficult to talk to about it.
p6310
aVHoly shit, this is fantastic
p6311
aVI lost a lot of respect for Jon Snow watching this.
p6312
aVHe wouldn't let Charlie finish any of his answers; he just steam-rolled right over him and refused to accept anything that he didn't agree with.
p6313
aVAnd the stuff about female gamers?
p6314
aVWhat the hell, Jon Snow?
p6315
aVI cracked up at "Somebody tell me how to eject the disk!
p6316
aV"
aVBeing a female gamer, Charlie Brooker has risen a few levels in my esteem, whilst Jon Snow's esteem has slipped a few!
p6317
aVEdit: But this was funny!
p6318
aVCan't be coincidental, surely...
p6319
aVNo, he's aware of the connection.
p6320
aVHe interviewed Kit Harrington a while back on his show so this is tongue in cheek.

aVTo those outside of the UK.

aVI don't understand how people can try and explain this picture without mentioning this.
p6408
aVGame of Thrones character is named John Snow.
p6409
aVThere is also a game of thrones meme that says "winter is coming", typically personified by a picture of Sean Bean. \u000a\u000a

p6415
aVWinter is indeed coming, and British people do like talking about the weather.

aV"You know nothing, Jon Snow" is a line repeated by another character, and love interest to Jon Snow.

p6434
aVRegarding these "other avenues", Schmitzberger stated, "[w]hat they are, I am not at liberty to disclose, but we will not stand for the Fucking signs being removed.

aVWe just want to be left alone.
p6441
aVWe don't harm anyone and just want to live in peace.
p6442
aV"[19]\u2014and added that he would prefer not to see the village being featured in the press any more.

aVI found his name added to the hilarity.
p6455
aV&gt;One version of the sign features the village name with an additional sign beneath it, with the words "Bitte \u2013 nicht so schnell!
p6456
aV" ("Please \u2013 not so fast!").
p6457
aVThe lower sign\u2014which features an illustration of two children\u2014is meant to advise drivers to slow down, but tourists interpret it, in conjunction with the "Fucking" sign, as a double entendre.
p6458
aVThis is my new favourite thing ever
p6459
aV&gt; Bitte\u000a\u000a"Bite" in French is slang for "Dick".
p6460
aVWe found our German lessons a lot funnier than they should have been.

p6498
aVPeople assume that time is a strict progression from cause to effect, but actually, when you look at it from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey... stuff.

p6574
aVI play football on a Sunday in Pirton so use this road on many weekends.
p6575
aVIt is actually quite an undulating country lane so I assume thats why it got its name.
p6576
aVI believe they changed the name because people kept stealing the sign. 
p6577
aVAha wow never expected to see Pirton on reddit, I live here.

p6584
aVTo be honest its only anecdotal information im providing there from people I know in Pirton, that might not be the reason they changed it.
p6585
aVIf that indeed was the issue then it has worked because I dont recall the sign being missing since I started going past it regularly which was probably about 10 or so years ago.
p6586
aVThe sign in the picture is certainly how I have always seen it.

aV[Rowley Regis has a pretty good one](http://i.imgur.com/IMire0q.png)

p6589
aV&gt;americanized\u000a\u000aWe're too late.
p6590
aVZ is Oxford spelling, with an s is Cambridge.
p6591
aVBoth are acceptable.
p6592
aV(Is the opposite of a grammar nazi a grammar communist?
p6593
aV)
aVNo, the opposite of a Grammar Nazi is a Grammar Nasi
p6594
aVMagnificent. 
p6595
aVIn fact, it goes back further than that.
p6596
aVThe suffix -ize is the Greek way of verbali*z*ing a noun.
p6597
aVe.g.
p6598
aVnoun: American\u000a\u000averb: Americanize\u000a\u000aThe problem came about because uneducated people didn't know when a word was supposed to end in -ise and when it should end in -ize.
p6599
aVe.g.
p6600
aVsurprise vs criminalize.
p6601
aVCriminal becomes a verb by adding -ize, but surprise isn't derived from a noun, so it ends in -ise.
p6602
aVTwo different words but with the same *sound* at the end.
p6603
aVhttps://grammarcops.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/verbalized/
p6604
aVSort of.
p6605
aVIt's a rule that was made up, stating that if a word comes from a Gk root it should use z, and if from Latin, it should use s since Latin has no z in the alphabet.
p6606
aVHowever it's not as though the "ise" or "ize" words in English are taken verbatim from either language, and the z convention for words with a Gk root has never been common.
p6607
aVCool.
p6608
aVThanks for clarifying!
p6609
aVPunctuation for the people!
p6610
aVno, Cambridge is the only acceptable.
p6611
aVZ is Oxford English Dictionary spelling, s is everyone else - it's not as though Oxford town or Oxford University follow the z convention.
p6612
aVThe OED is great for etymology, but has some odd and prescriptive ideas about spelling which just don't reflect how people do it.
p6613
aVI remember spelling books in primary school (in the 80s, Northern Ireland) listing words which could have either ending.
p6614
aVI remember my spelling wasn't too hot back then so I settled on -ise for convenience.
p6615
aVAlthough, many of my older teachers in secondary school used the -ize endings.
p6616
aVWas it a maybe a generational thing?
p6617
aVWas -ize the British way but we changed recently and now think it's only American.
p6618
aVI actually quite like the -ize endings, but don't use them since it looks like no one else does.
p6619
aVThe OED rule is to use z for words derived from Greek, and s for words derived from Latin.
p6620
aVIf this were to have worked in the past, the general population would have to know a fair amount of Greek or memorise the aberrant spelling of thousands of words.
p6621
aVEither seems a bit unlikely.
p6622
aVAlso I haven't noticed "ize" as being common in 19C editions of books, of which I have a few.
p6623
aVSo overall, I don't think that this was a generational thing.
p6624
aVI feel like when you're using that word a Z is appropriate
p6625
aVPersonally, I enjoy Agent Carter's wibbly wobblys...
p6626
aVI don't think it compares to what is now [Grape Lane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gropecunt_Lane) in York...
p6627
aV&gt; Gropecunt ... appears to have been derived as a compound of the words grope and cunt.
p6628
aVThanks captain obvious-pedia. 
p6629
aVI think whip-ma-whop-ma-gate is one of the better street names out there while we're in York.
p6630
aVWhat about mad Alice's lane?
p6631
aVThere was a Gropecunt Lane is Bristol at some point, as well.
p6632
aVThere was a gropecunt lane in most towns I think 
p6633
aVAnother one [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie_Lane,_Oxford).
p6634
aVI regularly drive past a Fanny Hands lane and often wonder if it's a cleaned up variant of Gropecunt lane. 
p6635
aVMy guess is that it compares *exactly* to it.
p6636
aVAt one time there was a fashion for renaming Gropecunt Lane or its local variation, but there was a law requiring that the former name also be displayed.
p6637
aVTo get around this, they would rename a lane, then rename it again after only a day.
p6638
aVSo my guess is that it was only Wibbly Wobbly Lane for a day.
p6639
aVNo, I live round there and it was Wibbly Wobbly lane for as long as I can recall.

aVIt would be even better if it had been called Wibbly Wobbly Timey Wimey Lane.
p6706
aVProbably the reason they changed it in the first place was due to Doctor Who fans stealing the road sign.
p6707
aVThat makes perfect sense, wouldn't surprise me.
p6708
aVMight make sense but unfortunately it's not the reason, that sign has been there since long before David Tennant was the Doctor. 
p6709
aV[deleted]
p6710
aVHe's not saying that you said it was named after the Who quote, but that the name change to Carters Lane predates the reference and so is not "the reason they changed it in the first place.
p6711
aV"
aVSorry if I misunderstood but I thought you meant "It may have been changed as Doctor Who fans kept nicking it due to the resemblance to the quote".
p6712
aVAnd thus my reply that "It was changed long before the quote existed and therefore that couldn't be the reason" makes sense.
p6713
aVDo we know the reason?
p6714
aVDid the residents just not like the name?

p6723
aVI seem to remember a blog post which asked a local councillor who also said they didn't know the exact reason.
p6724
aVMy guess is that Wibbly Wobbley was just a local name and never official, and when they started putting road signs up in the area they added the local name to the bottom to avoid confusion.

aVThat's not a change for the better.

p6752
aVIt's a cynical way to get morons to text the answer at "£1.50  plus one standard network rate message"\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHow else is Loose Women or Dickinson's Real Deal meant to fund themselves?
p6753
aVPlus in the UK, giveaways are taxed higher than competitions
p6754
aVCompanies run the risk of running illegal lotteries unless they can demonstrate skill is involved within the competition.
p6755
aVHowever, these companies want as many people as possible to enter so lower the barrier of entry to such a degree that the result is amazingly obvious answers such as these.
p6756
aVAnd it works.
p6757
aVWasn't it settled a while back that these questions were considered a lottery and thus subject to the laws regulating them?
p6758
aVI don't think so, i've made a bunch of these (recently) and they're all obvious answers.
p6759
aVOne of these, in the middle of daytime TV, can easily make £40k.
p6760
aVIt's quite insane.
p6761

p6778
aVI thought lowering the number to 200k would be good enough but apparently not oh well.
p6779
aVAhh well it depends what you mean by 'house'.
p6780
aVI've ended up using the word synonymous with flat now, kind of bad.
p6781
aVNot seen that many actual houses for sale in Brighton - or if I have they're the crazy nice ones for 500k+
p6782
aVnaah just slap the word 'bingo' on some other word and you're golden
p6783
aVsurely lottery is a gamble and not a quiz competition?
p6784
aVIt was decided that if the question was so easy that realistically very few people would get it wrong that you'd effectively have a luck of the draw situation.
p6785
aVIIRC it was GMTV who got told off for their stupidly easy questions.

aVIt's Commoners' dreams isn't it.
p6795
aV4 All of the above
p6796
aVObviously 1.
p6797
aV2 is just plain stupid 3 is too obvious to be correct.
p6798
aVI do not know, but I would hope so, as that would mean common sense would have prevailed. 
p6799
aVI think this applies to Ireland
p6800
aVSo how does it work with shows like the gadget show where they just say "text gadget to..." \u000aIs that not just a lottery? 
p6801
aVPretty sure it's only friends and relatives of the production crew that win the Gadget show stuff, there was a post on here a while back about it.. 
p6802
aVLink?
p6803
aVI'm sure it's legit, I know someone who won it.
p6804
aVLucky bastard 
p6805
aVWasn't that the case with another channel 5 show many years back, Brainteaser, where, although anyone could apply (and was encouraged to) to go on the show during and after every show, only the people that were connected in some way with the people running the show were ever chosen and it was, subsequently, cancelled and taken off air.
p6806
aVShame, I actually liked that show.
p6807
aVNah, that was one of the few not doing it on channel 5.
p6808
aVIt is possible that as fives owners, northern and shell operate the healty lottery, hoops have already been jumped through and it is easier to license.
p6809
aVHow the fuck has the gadget show not been bought by an actual good channel is beyond me.
p6810
aVHave you ever heard anyone say "oh that show on channel five was really good" in the last 5 years to anything but Gadget Show?\u000a
p6811
aVThe side effect is that stupid people think they're being clever by getting the right answer.
p6812
aVAnd some people still get it wrong, which is what they use a evidence of accused of running a lottery. 
p6813
aVIt's more complicated than that.
p6814
aVIf you run it as a giveaway, it is legally classed as a lottery.
p6815
aVWhich means you need to jump through a whole lot of licensing hoops.
p6816
aVMost of those hoops go away if you introduce some element of skill, turning it into a competition. 
p6817
aVI presume this was the same thing that the BBC ran foul of a few years ago?
p6818
aVwhen they had to cease all competitions?
p6819
aVThat was different.
p6820
aVMostly fake winners from the production team were used, usually to make up for technical difficulties with phone ins.
p6821
aVIn some commercial shows like Richard and Judy on Channel 4 the winner was selected while the phone lines were still advertised and open.
p6822
aVDon't forget ITV
p6823
aVThere was also an issue with people who called competition phone lines after they'd closed, heard the same "your vote has been accepted" message - but, as the line now goes, "your vote won't be counted and you may still be charged".
p6824
aVIIRC they'd not bothered to properly close the phone lines when they said they would, so there was a small window where people could still call and *think* they'd entered.
p6825
aVThen there was Channel 5's Brainteaser show.
p6826
aVAha, good to know.
p6827
aVStill, yet more reasons not to ever phone in for these things.
p6828
aVIt's actually more complicated than that.
p6829
aVThis falls under the prize competition and free draw part of the gambling act 2005.
p6830
aVI'm pretty sure they could replace that question with 'contact us now for your chance to win £10,000' and they still require no licensing, because they have the 'free' option of the postal entry and it becomes a free draw, Free is defined as normal rate in this instance, so a stamp is the normal rate to send a letter so the entry is classed as free.
p6831
aVSee below for a couple of PDF downloads about the topic.

p6834
aVDidn't know this.
p6835
aVExplains a lot.
p6836
aVStrictly speaking, would they not be considered a lottery if all people had to do to enter was pay a fee (via text)?
p6837
aVI believe that's the reason why the questions are so simple.
p6838
aVYou can enter all the ITV ones for free on the website.
p6839
aVI do a few every week but have never won.
p6840
aVWouldn't surprise me if they didn't even include website entries when picking a winner but as there are so many entries I'll never know.
p6841
aVI would like to know whether they include web entries too, or if I've been wasting my time for the last few years.
p6842
aVAnd hello fellow Cornish dweller.
p6843
aVI assume they have to if they are saying it's a form of entry.
p6844
aVThey do.
p6845
aVBut you're one in one hundred thousand.
p6846
aVThe chances of winning on these is ridiculously small.
p6847
aVIf each message is £1 and they are giving away £2500 cash, your chance is a *maximum* of 1/5000 since they have to earn the prize plus the cost of running the thing plus profit.
p6848
aV--edit-- i are gooder at words
p6849
aVNot to mention the gadget show.
p6850
aVThe competition they run everyweek will cost them like 15k, but probably make them 100k
p6851
aVDidn't they run afoul of this a few years ago though?
p6852
aVIf I can recall they got into serious trouble over their phone in competitions.
p6853
aVEveryone did, because it turned out that if you called after the end date you still got charged, but had no chance of winning.
p6854
aVHence the disclaimer "please don't call after the lines have closed as your vote won't count and you *may* still be charged".
p6855
aVHello and this is Dickinsons real deal and for today's competition we will sell this 1960s vase and whatever it sells for we will give that away!
p6856
aV*vase sells for £34*\u000a\u000a\u000awell that's no good!
p6857
aVlet's round that up to 40, stick a "0" on it, x4 and divide by 2.
p6858
aVyou can enter Loose women and Real Deal compos through their websites though
p6859
aVthanks captain obvious.
p6860
aVI remember a show years ago that had the question "what is the phone number you have to dial to enter this competition?
p6861
aV".
p6862
aVThis Morning doesn't even bother with a question, so even the *really* dumb housewives can enter.
p6863
aVThat's actually fairly honest.
p6864
aVIt's not like the question is a barrier to entry, it's about creating an illusion of a barrier to stop the half-interested brain from realizing the astronomical odds and comparing them to the prize.
p6865
aVThen again, there is that story about the text line that had Yes/No/I don't know options, and received thousands of people voting "I don't know".
p6866
aVSo maybe daytime TV is just watched by lots of thick people.
p6867
aVI was always under the impression it was for legal reasons.
p6868
aVIf you have a question then it is a "contest" with lots of winners, one of whom is chosen randomly.
p6869
aVIf you don't have a question then it is a lottery and is regulated as such.
p6870
aVThe question is so simple because they don't want anybody not to know the answer and not call.
p6871
aV&gt;That's actually fairly honest.
p6872
aVIt's not like the question is a barrier to entry, it's about creating an illusion of a barrier to stop the half-interested brain from realizing the astronomical odds and comparing them to the prize.
p6873
aV&gt;Then again, there is that story about the text line that had Yes/No/I don't know options, and received thousands of people voting "I don't know".
p6874
aVSo maybe daytime TV is just watched by lots of thick people.
p6875
aVIt's a legal matter.
p6876
aVIf you have a question, it's a quiz with a prize so no requirement for a license.
p6877
aVIf there's no question then you need to pay for a license as it would be a lottery.
p6878
aVAhhh, of course.
p6879
aVWell, the argument for it stands.
p6880
aVMaybe...
p6881
aVWas that The Haunted Fishtank?
p6882
aVThey always had hilarious questions.
p6883
aVYeah, pretty sure it was, came here to post this but I guess I got beaten to it.
p6884
aVEven saves you the bother of sorting the right answers from the wrong answers. 
p6885
aVSurely it's better to have a slightly challenging question.
p6886
aVOne that tricks the watchers into thinking they will get the answer right and have a good chance because other people might not know it, yet one that remains actually easy enough to get a lot of entrants.
p6887
aVIt's because these types of competitions are lotteries, but they're not allowed to run them as such (without a licence).
p6888
aVSo they have to throw a bad question on it to make it seem less so.
p6889
aVIt's the same with all these types of 'competitions'.
p6890
aVYep, sadly this is the right reason.
p6891
aVAnother of our silly Laws...
p6892
aVI suspect it's more to do with psychologically making people more likely to enter ("I know the answer so I have a better chance of winning").
p6893
aVI'm pretty sure they avoid the anti-lottery law by having the free entry option, notice the option to send in entries by post.
p6894
aVNope, they have to have an element of 'skill' to avoid being a lottery.
p6895
aVHence those "tell us in 25 words or less" competitions.
p6896
aVThat way they can pretend they're not just pulling it out of a hat.
p6897
aVThe "tell us in 25 words or less" competitions have another justification too: There's a well established psychological effect that gets people to align their beliefs with statements they make.
p6898
aVIf you write 25 words about how you *love* some product, some proportion of people will actually come to believe some of what they write, so it helps to improve brand loyalty.
p6899
aVIf it was just the skill bit, they'd just pick a stupidly simple multiple choice question like the TV competitions tends to do.
p6900
aVIt's something to do with it being a "test of skill" that sets it apart from a simple give-away.
p6901
aVIt's has to have an element of skill, if it's entirely chance based it's considered gambling (which i think would be illegal on tv).
p6902
aVGambling on TV is illegal?
p6903
aVAlso, it would be considered a lottery if it had no element of skill involved which would mean it would need a license.
p6904
aVJasper Carrott's skit has become reality:\u000a\u000a&gt;What's the capital of England?

aVI'm gunna phone in twice and make shure I got the right aan'saa.
p6907
aV*
aVI remember one a while back (seem to remember it being Tim Lovejoys chat show) taking the piss, with phone in questions like "which of these answers have played football for Scotland and cricket for England?
p6908
aVA) Kenny Daglish  \u000aB) Denis Law  \u000aC) Graeme Souness and Ian Botham"
p6909
aVIs the idea that someone can't play for two different countries or that one person can't play two different sports? 
p6910
aVPeople can play two sports, or for two countries.
p6911
aVIt's just that none of those 4 did. 
p6912
aVSo how can anyone answer it?
p6913
aV...
p6914
aVThe third one has two people in the answer.
p6915
aVOne who played football for Scotland, the other who played cricket for England. 
p6916
aV[deleted]
p6917
aVnone of those four did *both*.
p6918
aVOne did football and the other did cricket.
p6919
aV[deleted]
p6920
aVMaybe I didnt word the question exactly how they did, it was years ago.
p6921
aVyou got the gist of it though surely?
p6922
aVI thought these were illegal now, and you have to make it an actual challenge. 
p6923
aVThe one on BGT got me, it said what overlooks the houses of parliament, so I thought straight away, the queen as she oversees all of parliaments actions, but that answer didn't come up and Buckingham palace did, so I assumed it was that\u000aAnyway, the answer was Big Ben :/
p6924
aVThe Queen isn't a what and Buckingham palace is a couple of kilometres away from parliament... 
p6925
aVI think he'd confused overlook with oversee.
p6926
aVI know but I was sure it was talking about how our parliament works 
p6927
aVA small oversight
p6928
aVKilometres?
p6929
aVWe have an imposter, lads!
p6930
aV&gt; a couple of kilometres away from parliament\u000a\u000aIt's actually just about exactly 1 km from the visitor's entrance facing Parliament Square to the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace.
p6931
aVJust thought that was interesting.\u000a\u000a
p6932
aVThat probably is a challenge.
p6933
aVYes, for a very select few, but still a challenge nonetheless. 
p6934
aVThe only people this is a challenge for are blind with the TV stuck on mute, and they've still got a good shot at it!
p6935
aVStatistically, by not entering you're going to be better off so I suppose you could argue that the real challenge is deciding not to bother. 
p6936
aVNow that's wishful thinking.
p6937
aVI don't think so, This Morning doesn't have a question, it's just 'call to enter'.
p6938
aVIt is a challenge for the main viewer base of Dave.
p6939
aVThese things are just prize draws, you cant ask difficult questions these days due to the amount of information everyone has available to them because internet.
p6940
aVThey could ask how many times per weekend do Dave show Red Dwarf marathons that finish just after I realise they're on.
p6941
aVYou can't find that on the Internet!
p6942
aVIs it all of them?
p6943
aVIt is in fact, all of them.
p6944
aVYou win a luxury spa getaway for none, and a £5 giftcard for Harrods.
p6945
aVGreat!
p6946
aVDo i have to collect them in person from some random location in the west country?
p6947
aVYou have to book 184 weeks in advance, by which time said spa has changed ownership and won't honour previous bookings.
p6948
aVEnjoy your relaxing day!
p6949
aVThe giftcards have just expired, you didn't spend them in time.
p6950
aVOr how many episodes of Top Gear they've shown that week.
p6951
aVThey did try that once, but their systems crashed because they couldn't cope with processing numbers that high.
p6952
aVHow many times a week do they show that episode with the amphibious car, and why do I watch it every single time?
p6953
aVI imagine Dave's Red Dwarf marathons are totally unwatched, and then have a spike into millions of viewers just as they end
p6954
aV"D: Jump leads.

aVThat implys they were ever trying in the first place.
p6956

aVKnowing Dave these questions were probably featured on the BBC five years ago, now living their second life being shown at least once a week on Dave.
p6966
aVThere is a very good reason why they ask these simple questions.
p6967
aVIt is to get around UK laws on gambling.\u000a
p6968
aVI would love to be the person who collaborates votes.
p6969
aVWould be interesting to see how many people don't get it right!
p6970
aVThe last time I saw The Gadget Show, they had abandoned the question altogether for their ridiculous prize draw - they just gave you the number to call or text.
p6971
aVFor the past series or two of The Gadget Show they haven't even bothered with a question at all.
p6972
aVRealise, they dont care about how many people get it right, they just want everyone to use the premium rate phone line to enter, the draw will run for a few weeks, maybe even months,people will think having the right answer gives them a chance, the reality is its a lottery and the phone call is the entry fee.Ask people to enter a lottery,they are less likely than a competition.
p6973
aVPlus gambling regulations and fees to deal with
p6974
aVPerhaps testing for default, in case there are bots.. though I can't see why that would be an issue.
p6975
aVYeah well think about who's in charge.

aVWasn't there a big thing a few years ago where all the tv companies had to stop doing this because making the answer really obvious/easy was considered a lottery and not a quiz or something. 
p6979
aVFor the kind of person who spends money calling these phone lines, it probably is quite a challenge to answer that.

aVI have to imagine that Sir Tim was royally pissed off when some computer geeks in Illinois added a bunch of American English spelled words to his glorious HTML 2.0.\u000a
p7011
aV&gt;Is it like zeh-brah, where we say zee-brah?
p7012
aVIt is, yeah.
p7013
aVz is pronounced zed, so where you say zeebra we say zebra.
p7014
aVNow I'm wondering about other ze words.
p7015
aVWhat about zeppelin, zenith, zero, zest?
p7016
aVI (we) say zeh-pellin, zee-nith, zee-ro, zeh-st.\u000a
p7017
aVZee-nith?

aVAs poor as this is and indeed, it being just a rudimentary 'skill test' so that it's a quiz and not a lottery... at least it's not as bad as those late night call in quiz shows that went on for 8 hours and led to usually no-one winning anything, because the question was 'fill in the blanks to this phrase - THE ______ '\u000a\u000aOr the answer would be something no-one had ever heard of, so after six hours of people throwing money at RED ____ with alert, light, devil, rooster, etc... you'd find out the missing word was ecosystem or something.

aVMy granddad said "I bet someone either got fired or promoted for that"
p7037
aVI feel like TV contests have been like this for as long as I can remember (though this is an extreme example, I suppose).
p7038
aVBut stupidly simple questions for phone-in contests is definitely not a new thing.
p7039
aVThey have to have *some* kind of question to make it a "contest" rather than just a "giveaway" (there's probably some kind of legal distinction that means they'd have to pay more tax or something otherwise), but they still want as many people as possible to enter.
p7040

aVThe questions they had at the end of CSI on C5 used to be questions related to the show you just watched.
p7043
aVThen they became questions that were just general knowledge.
p7044
aVThen they actually scrapped the question altogether - because "Which country is New York in?
p7045
aV" was too difficult - and made it simply "Ring this expensive number and give us your money and you might win something"
p7046
aVNone of the above.

p7066
aVThank you!                  
p7067
aVThe thread itself was funny enough but right about here is where I lost it.

aVBeen crying with laughter for the past 10 minutes....
p7069
aVglad to be of service. 
p7070
aVNone of the above, it's secret answer "D: Wearescammingyou"
p7071
aVSwiss/Belgian here, I cannot express in words how thankful I am that you have such amazing healthcare.
p7072
aVI slipped and fell on an outdoors stairwell on New Year's Eve this year in London (thankfully after I had partied enough), which left a big bleeding gash in the side of my head.
p7073
aVI passed out momentarily, a doorman hailed a cab, who got me to a hospital in a flash, and a few hours later I was out of the hospital with the wound patched up.
p7074
aVBest part: zero bills, zero hassle with my insurer.
p7075
aVHow are things different in Belgium/Switzerland? 
p7076
aVWell, in Switzerland, health insurance is mandatory, and my insurer only reimburses payments already made (which means that if I get hurt in the US, I get to pay myself first and then get reimbursed later).
p7077
aVI suppose a foreigner getting hospitalized in Switzerland would have to get their insurance involved, but I'm not 100% on it.
p7078
aVI don't think the patient would have to pay if they're uninsured, though.
p7079
aVDoesnt Belgium use a similar system to the French?
p7080
aVThe state is responsible for 2/3 the cost of treatement, the remaining 1/3 is provided by insurance, this leads to competition to lower prices while standards are maintained.
p7081
aVBelgium has one of the highest cancer survival rates in the world, my dad still goes back for his treatment there after having throat cancer 10 years ago.
p7082
aVI have no idea about Belgium's system, sorry.
p7083
aVI haven't lived there in the last twenty years, I only keep an eye on the political system from time to time.
p7084
aV&gt;  (which means that if I get hurt in the US, I get to pay myself first and then get reimbursed later).
p7085
aVSo what would happen if, say, you were in America and something went *badly* wrong?
p7086
aVLets say you ran up a £200k medical bill and you don't happen to have £200k lying around to pay the hospital with.
p7087
aVWhat happens then?
p7088
aVMy understanding is that the government funds healthcare for people with low incomes or certain disabilities ("Medicaid") and the elderly ("Medicare").
p7089
aVHospitals that receive government funding through those programmes (i.e., most of them) are required to provide emergency treatment to anyone, regardless of ability to pay.
p7090
aVIf you don't fit into any of those categories and can't afford treatment, then I think you just have to wait until your health problem turns into an emergency.
p7091
aVPretty much, yeah.
p7092
aVBut although they have to provide emergency treatment to everyone, that doesn't mean it's free (that'd be silly and socialist!).
p7093
aVInstead, they will bill you after the treatment.
p7094
aVIf you can't pay it, they will sue you for it, typically ending up with a payment plan based on your circumstances (perhaps at a much reduced, yet still difficult to afford price).
p7095
aVI'm Swiss and my sister used to work at a hospital and this is not an uncommon situation.
p7096
aVBasically they only help you to the point where your life is save and you're not really suffering too badly anymore.
p7097
aVThey won't let you ran up a 200k bill unless you can proof that you're with an insurance recognized by the hospital.
p7098
aVOtherwise you have to bring the cash upfront.
p7099
aVThe other side is the terror of needing to navigate another country's health system, perhaps in another language, while needing healthcare. 
p7100
aV&gt; I suppose a foreigner getting hospitalized in Switzerland would have to get their insurance involved, but I'm not 100% on it.
p7101
aVYes, sometimes insurance isn't enough because the hospitals don't recognize all insurance companies.
p7102
aVI think the insurance need to have a legal entity or partner company in Switzerland that gives a guarantee.
p7103
aVAs the costs for treatments can be very high and the hospitals don't have the capacity to track down insurance companies all over the planet, they're usually quite strict and require an upfront payment, bank guarantees or so.
p7104
aV&gt; I don't think the patient would have to pay if they're uninsured, though.
p7105
aVWithout insurance or upfront payment, they won't treat you beyond the point where your life is save.
p7106
aVAnd you will have to pay for that too.
p7107
aVSure, if you don't have any money at all, at some point they will have to let you go and it would be very hard for them to get your money back once you're back in your home country, so you could get away with it.
p7108
aVBut this is a rather exceptional situation.
p7109
aVUsually foreigners have to pay their bills before they can leave.
p7110
aVIf you are a UK citizen, the NHS will pay for any treatment abroad once you come back to the UK. 
p7111
aVDo homeless people have to pay or are they a burden of the state?

aVALWAYS get travel insurance when travelling to the US!
p7114
aVOut of pocket costs are INSANE if you don't have valid insurance.
p7115
aVALSO all billing codes are different which is a nightmare.
p7116
aVTravel insurance WILL cover you and then once you're back they will try to get it back from your insurer.
p7117
aVBut you don't have to deal with it.
p7118
aV(I am Dutch, live in the USA, travel frequently with family.
p7119
aVI now ALWAYS have travellers insurance.
p7120
aV(Which is pretty cheap anyway.
p7121
aVAbout $10 a day fro a family of four.
p7122
aV)\u000a
p7123
aVhaving bills is a waste of time, you need to employ accountants and stuff do actually deal with money, it is much better for you to just get fixed up and sent home, it is the most efficient way. 
p7124
aVThe provider will then bill the CCG though.
p7125
aVJust because the patient doesn't get a bill doesn't mean there isn't accountants and finance. 
p7126
aVof course there will be accountants and finance, but there is a lot less so than there would be if every patient had a bill and insurance paperwork
p7127
aVTotally agree!
p7128
aVFuck yeah.
p7129
aVSo much this.
p7130
aVI love the NHS.
p7131
aVSame here, I refuse to vote for any political party that tries to break it by making it more "private".
p7132
aVNot the main three then... And certainly not UKIP!
p7133
aVWho do you vote for?
p7134
aVI haven't voted recently, but I wanted to (I won't explain in detail, but tldr; mistakes and fuckups).
p7135
aVSince I knew I wasn't getting to vote, I haven't thought about who to vote for in a while.
p7136
aVNext time I actually get a valid polling card I'll think about it.
p7137
aVLast time I voted for the Lib Dems though, and well..
p7138
aVI was a student at the time.
p7139
aVAs you can probably imagine I'm not going to vote for them again for a while.
p7140
aVAlso, UKIP run exactly counter to everything I stand for.
p7141
aVI absolutely abhor the scum.
p7142
aVOh I hate UKIP too!
p7143

p7161
aVWell, Walter's motivation for making money (at least initially) wasn't to pay for medical bills.
p7162
aVHe was a teacher and would have had excellent health insurance through the teacher's union and would have only paid for a miniscule portion of his medical care.
p7163
aVHis motivation was to leave a monetary legacy for his family, which ultimately mutated into leaving a legacy to the world that would show them what he was truly capable of.
p7164
aVBut the reason he needed to leave that money was because of the cost of payment - it would have eaten up savings/pensions so he needed to replace it.
p7165
aVInstead of those long scenes of the family eating dinner it would be him sitting in the waiting room.
p7166
aVFrom previous discussions on the NHS vs the US systems, waiting times are quite similar and depend far more on the individual hospital/service than country.
p7167
aVAye, it's very noticeable there.
p7168
aVLots of other forums are similar too.
p7169
aVFor example, with cochlear implants, its a similar thing.
p7170
aVThe problem is that the NHS falls down on specialist care, if you can pay in America you have much better odds for cancer than you do here. 
p7171
aVI was under the impression from this post that the US don't have better cancer healthcare than the UK do.
p7172
aVThey do if you can pay for it.
p7173
aVTo be fair, if you go private, so do we.
p7174
aVThere are some treatments which are very expensive and are not available on the NHS
p7175
aVOh right I see.
p7176
aVI'd assume that for he people who can get it it's better in America...but a lot of people can't afford treatment, so that brings down the average quality...because they get 0 quality
p7177
aVNo they do not.
p7178
aVSpecialist care on the NHS is as good as anywhere.
p7179
aVThey start to refuse when people go in asking for boob jobs.\u000a\u000a
p7180
aVIt just isn't.
p7181
aVCancer care is terrible here, the drugs are just too expensive. 
p7182
aVThen how did two members of my family get cured of cancer by the NHS?
p7183
aVYou're talking bollocks mate.
p7184
aVCancer care on the NHS is good.
p7185
aVHow come I know four who died.
p7186
aVIt depends on the type and location of the cancer.
p7187
aVFor example bone cancer and pancreatic cancer are virtually untreatable using current NHS drugs.
p7188
aVMany palliative drugs (perhaps with good reason) are withheld because they are deemed "to expensive" for the extra months they give people. 
p7189
aVI don't know why you're getting downvotes this is accurate.
p7190
aVPeople try and make the point that Breaking Bad couldn't happen in the UK because Walt wouldn't have the pay for his treatment.
p7191
aVThe whole point was that he went to a specialist oncologist that cost more money.
p7192
aVThere are lots of treatments/drugs etc that NICE deem not worth spending NHS money on, in the US you'd pay a huge insurance premium and be able to get those.
p7193
aVI rather the UK system but it's crazy to make out that it's not without its downsides. 
p7194
aVYeah, pretty anything experimental is happening in the US, especially in prosthetic research.
p7195
aVDid you see the article on the bionic hand?
p7196
aVProbably the biggest breakthrough is the advanced mental sensors, you could control a wheelchair or one of the upcoming exoskeletons even if you are totally paralyzed.
p7197
aVUnfortunately this is all prohibitively expensive for the NHS at the moment. 
p7198
aVKey thing is, it is also prohibitively expensive in the US.
p7199
aVIf you get private insurance in the UK you can get drugs the NHS won't give you, and its basically the same in the USA.
p7200
aVAlso, most of the advances in myoelectric prosthetics are coming from [Europe](http://www.intorobotics.com/three-advanced-bionic-hands-designed-with-the-sense-of-touch/) with the UK currently leading the way.
p7201
aVThat's why we also have BUPA.
p7202
aVAfter being diagnosed with type-1 diabetes a couple of years ago, I was pretty shocked by the culture of US-dominated diabetes forums.
p7203
aVThere's a very stark divide between the haves and the have-nots: loads of people use insulin pumps (which cost several thousand pounds a year and are not normally funded by the NHS), while many of the rest are constantly worrying about insulin prices and sharing tips on where to get it cheap.
p7204
aVSad to see a lot of "but if you can afford it, you can get the best medical care in the world!
p7205
aVdon't worry guys we're still number one" said without even the slightest hint of irony.
p7206
aVAs if every person is a billionaire.
p7207
aVYeah but poor people are poor for a reason, right?
p7208
aVThey must be *super lazy* - said the rich person who inherited millions of dollars.
p7209
aVI find it stupefying how a lot of Americans still defend their current healthcare system.
p7210
aVI think a large part of it is that too many people are easily manipulated into believing that a universal healthcare system is socialism, and that socialism is evil. 
p7211
aV[this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/28ci0q/us_health_care_ranked_worst_in_the_developed_world/) is pure gold.
p7212
aV&gt;Read it again.
p7213
aVWe have the worst healthcare system, not the worst healthcare.
p7214
aVtop fucking kek
p7215
aVI find that thread more depressing than funny.
p7216
aVIt's like eating a mars bar in front of a starving African child refuge. 
p7217
aVRampant individualism and the American Dream - they genuinely believe that people achieve what they deserve in life.
p7218
aVTaxing the rich to pay for the healthcare of the poor is taxing the deserving to give to the undeserving.
p7219
aVThe best bit is when some of the poor have been brainwashed so much that even they are outraged at the idea of commie free healthcare.
p7220
aVThat's some impressive big brother shit right there.
p7221
aV\u201cSocialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.\u201d
p7222
aVIt's not strictly true though.
p7223
aVSocalism and even communism were pretty big there at the beginning of the 20th Century; there was a large and aggressive labour movement which helped introduce many of the protections and benefits of which Americans still enjoy a (smallish) proportion today.
p7224
aVFor example, they were the "armed wing" which provided the threat that helped the trade unions push for the New Deal.
p7225
aVIt was the Cold War and McCarthyism which ultimately did for them (Stalin didn't help of course).
p7226
aVThat is a great quote.
p7227
aVWhere is it from?
p7228
aVEither a paraphrasing or misquote of John Steinbeck by Ronald Wright in 'A Short History of Progress'. 
p7229
aVAmericans have a greater fear of government than we do,  they hate the idea of the government controlling their health care and reducing their choice on what they can get.
p7230
aVI don't think it's a great system at all but they do develop a lot of medical technology and have access to the best care in the world even if it does cost a fortune. 
p7231
aV&gt; they hate the idea of the government controlling their health care and reducing their choice on what they can get\u000a\u000aThe funny thing is, I'm sure nobody over there is advocating the abolition of all private healthcare, just the addition of a single payer, tax-funded system.
p7232
aVAn extra option - more choice, more freedom.
p7233
aVWhat's interesting is they actually spend more on healthcare than we do.
p7234
aVThe USA has the worst of both.

aVI think that there is a distinction between life saving procedure and elective procedures.

aV(we charge 200K$ per day in the ICU the next hospital is an hour away would you like to ask them ho much you would be paying there?
p7239
aV)
aVI live in the US so talk about this a lot.
p7240
aVOne big hurdle I feel is that so many people think national healthcare is all about helping poor people get something they haven't worked for.
p7241
aVI try so hard to explain that national healthcare does benefit the poor... but it benefits the not so poor, the middle classes, the upper classes - basically everyone except the very richest who can pay for cancer treatment in cash.
p7242
aVEvery single person I discuss it with would save money, have less stress and better outcomes with national healthcare, but they're too busy making sure poor people don't get something for free.
p7243
aVIt is because their state run services get the worse of both worlds.
p7244
aVThey pay the inflated prices the drugs companies can charge when not faced with a national monopoly.
p7245
aVThen they get all the problems of the state.
p7246
aVThe US actually spends per person as much on state health care as we do.
p7247
aVIt only covers 50m or so people.
p7248
aVI can understand them being sceptical when their state health care is 6 times the cost of ours per person it actually serves.
p7249
aVReforming the system in the US is much more involved than going single payer.
p7250
aVOn the surface they are simply right when they say having the government pay for everything won't fix the problems.
p7251
aVThey need reform of IP rights and stronger protection from drug monopolies.
p7252
aV[deleted]
p7253
aVIt depends on what you mean: public spending or overall personal healthcare expenditure.
p7254
aVWhen it comes to public spending (money spent by the government), the US is about equal to the UK on per capita terms.
p7255
aVThe really disgusting stat is the overall healthcare expenditure: Americans spend around *three to four times* what the British/most Western European nations do.
p7256
aVIt might be.
p7257
aVIIRC it was about 10% of their GDP goes on Medicare and similar.
p7258
aVThey spend a further 8% on private healthcare.
p7259
aVbut medicare only covers 15% of the population\u000a
p7260
aVThat is about right yes.
p7261
aVThey spend as much per person (across the whole population) as we do on the NHS but it only covers 15% of their population.
p7262
aVI don't have the statistic right now, but I remember reading somewhere that it was like 18% of the US GDP
p7263
aV10+8=18
p7264
aV18% is for their whole health system.
p7265
aVThat's exactly what it is.
p7266
aVAlso a lot of Americans are seemingly bonkers.
p7267
aVAmericans think what they're told to think.
p7268
aVPride keeps them from doing anything with any degree of honesty with themselves.
p7269
aVAnd they only believe socialism is evil because of the USSR.
p7270
aVHealthcare and Education are two things that should always be out of the hands of the Free Market and I will be willing to fight Torys, Lib Dems and UKIP every step of the way to keep it that way.
p7271
aVSince when do Lib Dems want to privatise NHS?
p7272
aVAs am I but the only way we can stop the recent spur in NHS privatisation is to repel the 2012 health and social care act which I'm not sure any of the ConLibLab parties would do. 
p7273
aVLabour have committed to repealing it.
p7274
aVAndy Burnham also wants to roll the care sector in to the NHS to create a national care service. 
p7275
aVI don't disbelieve you, but can you provide a source for this?
p7276
aV[It's only a partial repeal](http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/policy/burnham-sets-out-plans-for-repeal-of-health-act/5063697.article#.U6AEOPldUpg) but Labour has committed to repealing the clause which allows for competition with the NHS.

aVNo one knows exactly what UKIP wants, as they prefer to rely on their branding to carry them, rather than actual content.

aVYou missed out 'naively leftist'
p7348
aVBetter naively leftist than naively rightist.
p7349
aVBoth have led to tyranny, mass death and war in the past.
p7350
aVTo argue one is objectively worse than another seems strange.
p7351
aVThe naivete of communists in believing in collectivisation led to almost ten million deaths in Russia, and tens of millions of deaths in China.
p7352
aVThe naive belief amongst fascists that they had a right to takeover 'lesser' countries led to tens of millions of deaths as well.
p7353
aVPerhaps the leftists have better intentions.
p7354
aVBut in practice the reality has often been just as brutal.  
p7355
aVBecause taking the extreme points as your comparison misses the reality of the mainstream politics.
p7356
aVThe conservative governments of the UK (and Aus, USA, Canada etc) are despicable anti environment big corporation supporting, welfare hating, racist, xenophobic rich white men who have no desire to make the world a better place.
p7357
aVMeanwhile, the Labour/Democrat governments are just a little bet less than of all of that than the Conservative governments.
p7358
aVMost people's ACTUAL political position is far more left than what governments implement, so we should be voting between Labour and Greens in order to get what we want.
p7359
aVWhy does you party always have to be right, and the right-wing always wrong?
p7360
aVI could just as easily argue that those right wing governments look past the naivete of the left and attempt to free economy and business to grow so we have a chance of catching up to and/or staying ahead of Asia and South America in the global economic race of the 21st century.
p7361
aVI could just as easily say that pouring billions into inefficient environmental programs would be a colossal waste of money at a time when our governments are deep in debt and other countries are catching up.
p7362
aVI could just as easily argue that allowing mass immigration is damaging at a time when many are still unemployed.
p7363
aVI could just as easily argue that many Green policies, for example, such as their transaction tax or their nuclear policies, are so laughable from an economic perspective that they would damage our countries' finances for decades if they were implemented.
p7364
aVWhy are you the arbiter of righteousness?
p7365
aVWhy do you get to decide who people can vote for?
p7366
aVAnd as to your point about people being Left of governments, that's only partially true.
p7367
aVMany would like to see rail and power nationalisation, certainly, but they would not be for further authoritarian leftist laws on political correctness, or banning/restriction on junk food or sugar levels, for example, not to mention much higher taxes or further immigration.   
p7368
aVBecause you only need to compare USA to Scandanavia.
p7369
aVAny politician trying to move us more towards the USA is fucked, and any politician keeping us generally on the track of the scandanavian countries is doing alright.
p7370
aVThe UK is largely doing alright..it has plenty of issues, every country does, but it has welfare and medical cover for everyone.
p7371
aVMedical cover once again shown to be one of the best in the world, just like Aus (where I'm from), but I'm sure your conservatives are trying to take money away from your great system and make you more USA like...the worst system on the planet (considering their outcomes vs cost).
p7372
aVSo while you want to think that the right ring parties "can just as easily argue", I've seen enough of those 'arguments' to know that they are purely ideological spouting, and very sparse on the actual evidence.
p7373
aV"freeing up the economy" sounds like a great idea, except that it results in boom-bust cycles, and scams/rip offs/cons by the wealthiest who lack regulation (GFC anyone?
p7374
aV) and abuse of the poorest.
p7375
aVHooray, the rich get richer, and the poor get fucked some more.
p7376
aVBut the GDP has gone up, right?!
p7377
aVToo bad the rising number of poor people mean more crime and more theft.
p7378
aVDon't worry, the rich can afford personal guards, they'll be fine!
p7379
aVToo bad about the middle class though.
p7380
aVThey keep being robbed, and attacked by the poor.
p7381
aVAnd now the middle class are getting poorer thanks to no minimum wage and ongoing abuses and scams by the banking class.
p7382
aVNow we have no middle class.
p7383
aVOh shit, now there is no one for the rich to sell their shit to.
p7384
aVAnd the whole system collapese.
p7385
aVDon't worry.
p7386
aVYou can blame it all on immigrants and the poor though.
p7387
aVIt was probably their fault for wanting to live good honest meaningful lives.
p7388
aVNo.
p7389
aVI'm not buying it.
p7390
aVConservative politicians are ideological arseholes with no real connection with reality.
p7391
aVThere's nothing more naive than a right-winger.
p7392
aVThe huge gaps in the reasoning of a true right-wing person just defy all logic.
p7393
aVI'm reading Friedrich Hayek's "Road to Serfdom".
p7394
aVApparently, Hitler was a socialist (despite his professed belief that he was saving Germany from socialism) and all "progressives" are closet communists.
p7395
aVI started reading it because it's supposed to be the great monetarist work which underpins Thatcherism.
p7396
aVI was hoping it would change my views in some small way.
p7397
aVBut it just comes across like partisan politics raving against any who dare oppose the supremacy of unbridled capitalism.
p7398
aV&gt; Hayek\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt; monetarist\u000a\u000aI though Hayek was more Austrian school?
p7399
aVMilton Friedman loved Hayek, and based a lot of his monetarist thought on Hayek's ideas.
p7400
aVYes, I believe Hayek would have described himself as Austrian school, but that label is not really relevant today, while monetarism (which is received with reference to Hayek) is.
p7401
aVI wanted to start with the beginning.
p7402
aVFriedman was heavily critical of a lot of Hayek's economics though.
p7403
aVHis review of Prices and Production is famously very negative.
p7404
aVBesides things like:\u000a\u000a&gt; based a lot of his monetarist thought on Hayek's ideas\u000a\u000ais hardly unique to Friedman.
p7405
aVA lot of mainstream economics outside of pure monetarism has adopted a lot of Hayek's ideas (price signalling for instance is a mainstream position). 
p7406
aVHaving been born after Thatcher left office, yet wanting to find some degree of understanding of the economic landscape surrounding the changes Thatcherism has wrought upon this country, I see Hayek as the beginning.
p7407
aVThatcher herself slammed a copy of "the Constitution of Liberty" onto a desk and declared to her cabinet: "This is what we believe!
p7408
aV"\u000a\u000aMy academic background is physics.
p7409
aVI don't have the time to go back all the way to someone like Adam Smith and study the whole of economics.
p7410
aVFor the economics of the UK, reading Keynes and Hayek seems like the logical starting point.
p7411
aVNo that's fair enough, I didn't mean to come across as critical.
p7412
aVI would probably recommend *A Monetary History of the United States* if you are interested in the reasoning behind monetarism, which did seem to be applied to an extent in the UK given the emphasis on the control of inflation in the 80s.
p7413
aVThe thing with Hayek is that things like *Road to Serfdom* will tend to be more political science rather than pure economics.
p7414
aVWhich of course is not a reason to rule them out, but if you want an *economic* summary may be slightly tangential.
p7415
aVAlso, read some of Hayek's other work- it's not all strict capitalism.
p7416
aVHe seemed to be in favour of a UBI/negative income tax (Friedman also favoured the latter) as I commented elsewhere. 
p7417
aVThanks for the pointers.
p7418
aVOf course Hitler was a kind of socialist, he was leader of the National Socialists after all.
p7419
aVSocialism isn't a monolith, it incorporates a vast array of often contradictory ideologies.
p7420
aVNazi style groups often tend to have collectivist policies -- after all they do advocate total state control.
p7421
aVToo much power to the private sector would undermine them.
p7422
aVThe political spectrum is better thought of as a circle, the extremes of left and right often look as alike as the centres. 
p7423
aV&gt; The political spectrum is better thought of as a circle, the extremes of left and right often look as alike as the centres.

p7430
aVFascism was originally considered "the third way", since it is neither laissez-faire nor communism.
p7431
aVTo his credit, Hayek does explain the idea of socialism as alternatively describing a means and an end: an end which everyone agrees is a good thing, but a means which he to be discredited.
p7432
aVHe describes the means as "centrally planned state economy", which Hitler's National Socialist party clearly did not institute.
p7433
aVPrivate ownership was alive and well in Germany, [with most corporatists toeing the line and profiting directly from slave labour](http://archive.adl.org/braun/dim_13_2_forgetting.html#.U6ALrPldUpg).
p7434
aVAll that said, I certainly wouldn't consider the NSDAP to be "right-wing", since that represents laissez-faire economic freedom.
p7435
aVThey are the perfect example of an authoritarian centrist party.
p7436
aV&gt; Fascism was originally considered "the third way", since it is neither laissez-faire nor communism.
p7437
aVAt the time of the rise of fascism and nazism, socialism/communism, liberalism and conservative ideologies were already well established.
p7438
aVSo third way?
p7439
aVFourth if we're being generous, but in reality the ideological landscape was already vastly more fragmented.
p7440
aVYou may be thinking of Third Position, which was an extreme right, ultra nationalist set of related ideologies that could be seen as proto-fascist/nazist.
p7441
aVTheir argument was that they were against both socialism and capitalism, and took ideas from both.
p7442
aVHowever Third Position groups are generally ultra-nationalist and pro-racial segregation, and while they are notionally "anti capitalist", they were/are "anti-big-capital" and "anti-capital-owned-by-brown-people" rather than against all forms of capitalist economy.
p7443
aVSome refer to Third Position as a precursor for Apartheid, for example, as it is probably the closest an actual government has gotten to Third Position politics.
p7444
aVIn the UK, Third Position split out of National Front to form "Official National Front" (and later went through a number of renamings) at some point in the 80's I believe.
p7445
aV&gt; He describes the means as "centrally planned state economy", which Hitler's National Socialist party clearly did not institute.
p7446
aVThe idea that socialism requires a planned economy is an idea one often finds drawn out of a lack of knowledge of socialist ideologies - not even authoritarian socialist ideologies like Leninism/Stalinism are intrinsically tied to a planned economy, and many libertarian socialist ideologies are specifically either opposed to it, or contradicts it in principle (as many libertarian socialist ideologies takes Marx' discussion of the "withering away of the state", ironically made most famous by Lenin's discussion in State and Revolution, seriously, and sees the dismantling of central power as a vital).
p7447
aVA centrally planned state economy was something the Bolsheviks didn't intend either.
p7448
aVIt became doctrine as a result of the wartime economy put in place because of the European powers supporting the White's in the civil war.
p7449
aVSpecifically, the original policy of central planning was called "War Communism" and was the official Bolshevik policy until 1921 and was a pure "survival mode" to keep things running during the civil war.
p7450
aVIn 1921 it was replaced by "New Economic Policy" which remained in force until Stalin replaced it with increased collectivisation in 1928.
p7451
aVNew Economic Policy actually *loosened up* on the government control of the economy (Lenin described it as "state capitalism"), and Lenin intended it to last for decades to help develop and prepare the economy.
p7452
aVThe full step back to central planning was supported mainly by Stalinists and Trotskyists.
p7453
aVMany other socialist ideologies explicitly favour the use of markets for resource allocation.
p7454
aVBut in the SSSR, non-authoritarian socialist ideologies were either already outlawed, or about to get you executed, towards the end of NEP.
p7455
aV&gt; All that said, I certainly wouldn't consider the NSDAP to be "right-wing", since that represents laissez-faire economic freedom.
p7456
aVThey are the perfect example of an authoritarian centrist party.
p7457
aVThat requires employing a rather novel left-right wing axis.
p7458
aVLiberal and libertarian ideologies started out to the left of conservative groupings by the original left/right grouping: The left were originally those that supported republicanism in the French parliament, while the right where monarchists.
p7459
aVIn fact, in several European countries you find this even reflected in party names.
p7460
aVIn Norway, for example, the liberal party is name "Venstre" (literally "Left") and the conservatives are names "Høyre" ("Right").
p7461
aV*Some* laissez-faire parties get placed on the outer right - generally certain forms of right wing populist parties where the main draw of laissez-faire is tax-cuts.
p7462
aVLaissez-faire first came to start being associated more with the right after 1848 when the capitalist part of the European left sought out the monarchist right to forge alliances against the working classes, which is how we came to get the right-wing libertarian construction of being for the reduction of government interference *except* in the enforcement of property rights.
p7463
aVThat Laissez-faire is seen as a "right wing" thing is a modern phenomenon, because "our" modern right consists of a merger of the original monarchist right and parts of the centre-left, while libertarian socialist ideologies were marginalised from the early 1900's until after the fall of the Soviet Union.
p7464
aVHitler *did* on occasion talk about taking parts from socialism, but then again he was in good German right-wing tradition in doing so: The worlds first "proper" welfare system was introduced by Chancellor Bismarck.
p7465
aVHe was "accused" of being a socialist by other parts of the right over it, but made the argument that it was a necessary means to undermine the socialist parties, by giving just enough to pacify the working classes, and then he adopted the "slur" his opponents had used against his policies by explicitly referring to his policy as "state socialism".\u000a\u000a
p7466
aVThank you for this post, it makes a lot of things extremely clear for me.
p7467
aV&gt;You may be thinking of Third Position, which was an extreme right, ultra nationalist set of related ideologies that could be seen as proto-fascist/nazist.
p7468
aVApologies, I have no formal economic education so the jargon is a little hard for me to grasp at times.
p7469
aVThis proto-fascism of racist capitalism sounds very familiar to me when I read accounts of National Socialist economic practices.
p7470
aV&gt;The idea that socialism requires a planned economy is an idea one often finds drawn out of a lack of knowledge of socialist ideologies \u000a\u000aI don't necessarily disagree, but your position here diverges rapidly with the position stated by Hayek in TRTS.
p7471
aVAs I'm sure it's clear, my thoughts on what socialism "is" are not in agreement with Hayek's.
p7472
aV&gt;That requires employing a rather novel left-right wing axis.
p7473
aVI would smugly argue that the left-right axis is a poor comparison of different views of political though, in an effort to avoid having to defend something I know relatively little about.
p7474
aV&gt;Laissez-faire first came to start being associated more with the right after 1848 when the capitalist part of the European left sought out the monarchist right to forge alliances against the working classes, which is how we came to get the right-wing libertarian construction of being for the reduction of government interference except in the enforcement of property rights.
p7475
aVI see, but is this appropriate when one is attempting to consider the modern, post-1848 right wing where laissez-faire is usually the rule and not the exception?
p7476
aV&gt; He was "accused" of being a socialist by other parts of the right over it, but made the argument that it was a necessary means to undermine the socialist parties, by giving just enough to pacify the working classes, and then he adopted the "slur" his opponents had used against his policies by explicitly referring to his policy as "state socialism".
p7477
aVDoesn't that return to my original objection, that Hitler cannot be accurately described as a socialist?
p7478
aVThese words are really just labels, not religious dogma, so surely they only hold value based on how accurately they describe ideas.
p7479
aV&gt; I don't necessarily disagree, but your position here diverges rapidly with the position stated by Hayek in TRTS.
p7480
aVI'm not surprised.
p7481
aVFor a consideration of how silly the idea of socialism as requiring state control, consider that during the period of the First International (the International Working Men's Association), exactly the issue of the role of the state was the foundation for a major power struggle in the organisation, between Bakunin and Marx.
p7482
aVThe main difference between Bakunin and Marx was that Bakunin saw the destruction of the state as an immediate goal, while Marx saw the state as a temporary tool for restructuring society, until it would "wither away".
p7483
aVBakunin explicitly rejected state power as too dangerous, and this is now one of the defining characteristics of anarchism - both socialist and non-socialist forms.
p7484
aVBut Bakunin was clear that he was a socialist _and_ anarchist.
p7485
aVThus even before considering that major tendencies within Marxism either explicitly rejects central planning, or is open to decentralised or market methods, one of the two major factions in the first international socialist organisation explicitly wanted to make centralised planning impossible by removing any central authority.
p7486
aVIf one assumes that Hayek is talking about "Soviet socialism", his argument may be reasonable, but then it also applies only to a small subset of socialist ideologies, and even within "Soviet socialism" it only really applies with Stalin onwards.
p7487
aV&gt; I would smugly argue that the left-right axis is a poor comparison of different views of political though, in an effort to avoid having to defend something I know relatively little about.
p7488
aVThat we can agree with.
p7489
aVThe left-right axis works best if you simply treat it as an indication of the historical development of ideologies.
p7490
aVWithout that, it gets messy very quickly.
p7491
aV&gt; I see, but is this appropriate when one is attempting to consider the modern, post-1848 right wing where laissez-faire is usually the rule and not the exception?
p7492
aVPretty much none of the dominant right wing parties in Europe are strongly laissez-faire, so I think so.
p7493
aV"Social conservatives" in particular tend to not stomach laissez-faire very well, since it would involve stripping away most laws founded in moralistic concerns where they interfere with business.
p7494
aV&gt; Doesn't that return to my original objection, that Hitler cannot be accurately described as a socialist?
p7495
aVThese words are really just labels, not religious dogma, so surely they only hold value based on how accurately they describe ideas.
p7496
aVThat part we agree on.
p7497
aVI just disagreed with details about why, and had a strong urge to procrastinate ;)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p7498
aVThanks for your posts.
p7499
aVGood luck with whatever you're procrastinating away from!
p7500
aV&gt; Of course Hitler was a kind of socialist, he was leader of the National Socialists after all.
p7501
aVThat's a ludicrous argument.
p7502
aVBy this line of reasoning, North Korea is a democratic state.
p7503
aVAfter all its name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
p7504
aVThe name in itself is just a label.
p7505
aV&gt; Socialism isn't a monolith, it incorporates a vast array of often contradictory ideologies.
p7506
aVHere we agree.
p7507
aVCase in point: In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels devoted a whole chapter to bitching about forms of socialism the did not agree with, ranging from utopian socialists (Fourier, Owens etc.
p7508
aV), to "reactionary socialists" that argued for the use of socialist policies, often either out of morality and/or as a means of pacifying the working classes, while propping out feudal power structures (Bismarck and his social welfare program could possible be argued to fit into this category).
p7509
aV&gt; Nazi style groups often tend to have collectivist policies -- after all they do advocate total state control.
p7510
aVThere's nothing about collectivism that makes an ideology more or less socialist.
p7511
aVMany socialist ideologies are explicitly individualist.
p7512
aVMore relevant to evaluating nazism this way, nazism explicitly put the protection of private property rights high on their agenda.
p7513
aVIf Hitler was in any way "socialist", it was in the way a feudal lord was "socialist": He subordinated society and its members to the state.
p7514
aVWhen you belong to the state, rather than the opposite, the state has a vested economic interest in providing a certain level of care for you: You're an asset; if you die or stay sick you can't meet your duties to the state.
p7515
aVIf you use the word "socialism" the way Marx used it, it may not then be unreasonable to describe this as "reactionary socialism".
p7516
aVBut Marx' point with this classification was to tear them a new asshole by pointing out that despite the superficial similarities, these ideologies were actually actively damaging to the economic and political interests of the working class.
p7517
aVOf course pretty much nobody uses "socialism" that way today anyway - the meaning started shifting already in the 1840's and 1850's.
p7518
aVThe NSDAP were explicitly trying to capitalise on the word to draw in working class voters, while at the same time appeasing other parts of society with Hitlers insistence that "their socialism" had nothing to do with Marxist socialism.\u000a\u000a
p7519
aVAccording to that type of ideology the main political conflict is not seen in the traditional left/right way, for them it is seen as individualism vs collectivism.
p7520
aVThe Road to Surfdom is primarily an argument against any Type of total collectivism (fascism, socialism or communism).
p7521
aVOne of the problems I see with Serfdom's reasoning is that it equates fascism, socialism and communism, in essence as well as outcome.
p7522
aVIt equates them in practice.
p7523
aVIt's the same as when a Marxist always tells you that no states were ever really Communist etc... and of course that's true.
p7524
aVBut that clearly suggests that the system doesn't work if out of 30+ attempts, none have succeeded.
p7525
aVHayek looks at the concepts both in theory and (perhaps more significantly) their implementation in practice (ie what the layman considers communism or socialism to be), and that is more relevant imho to real life. 
p7526
aVBut that begs the question; "does process matter less than outcome?
p7527
aV"\u000a\u000aThere is so much variation within both ideologies that the two do not have equal implementations in practice: does China today look like the Soviet Union under Stalin?
p7528
aVBoth claim to be socialist states.
p7529
aVThey certainly do not provide the same lifestyle for the common man. 
p7530
aVCertainly there are differences.
p7531
aVI would argue modern China rejected Socialism of any sort (either national socialist or marxist socialist) the moment Deng Xiaoping stood outside and announced that 'to get rich is glorious' or whatever it was he said exactly.
p7532
aVMao was ideologically very Marxist, far more so in fact than Stalin or even Lenin in many ways.
p7533
aVBut that fervour died with him in many respects, China today is just a good old fashioned oligarchy run by a Party Elite.
p7534
aVIf one was to look at the political scale as  'statist' on one side and 'liberal' on the other, then China (due to its economic freedoms and the fact that you can leave if you want) is significantly further to the right than Stalinist Russia (or Maoist China for that matter).
p7535
aVBut it is nowhere near as liberal as our own democracies.
p7536
aVWhat I am arguing is that on said scale, both Fascism and Socialism in practice tend significantly towards the left hand (or statist) side.
p7537
aVThey both stand for government control of society and to a degree, the economy.
p7538
aVBy contrast, the far right hand side of the scale would be dominated by Anarchism and Libertarianism.
p7539
aVTwo ideologies that are quite different in their relationship with property, for example, but share a fundamental distaste for the State.
p7540
aV(I often find, quite humorously, that my Anarchist and Libertarian friends have more in common than they might at first think).   
p7541
aVMarxism wasn't the only form of socialism.
p7542
aVHitler hated Marxism, which he saw as dominated by Jews and Intellectuals.
p7543
aVHe also hated "Bourgeois Liberal Democratic Capitalism", which he also saw as dominated by Jews of a different sort (ie bankers).
p7544
aVHitler and Mussolini both disliked Capitalism, but they saw it as useful in terms of organisation and distribution in order to win the great war of expansion they planned.
p7545
aVMussolini coined totalitarianism in saying that everything should be under the State.
p7546
aVHe and Hitler simply saw it as being taken over on a longer term basis than on the day they took power, as the Marxists did.
p7547
aVBut in many ways they were very similar.
p7548
aVBoth National Socialism and Marxist Socialism are fundamentally based upon the collective will of the people executed through the total control of the state.  
p7549
aVWhich is usually all their beliefs are pinned on- the idea that 'Well, I've done ok out of this system, and I'm going to bloody well agree with it, because of my subjective preference for maintaining the status quo, or perhaps even tipping it further in my favour'.
p7550
aVWhen that is the true root of all your beliefs, expect a lot of your opinions to be coated in bullshit.
p7551
aVHayek actually had some rather radical ideas though.
p7552
aVFor instance I think\u000a\u000a&gt; The assurance of a certain minimum income for everyone, or a sort of floor below which nobody need fall even when he is unable to provide for himself, appears not only to be wholly legitimate protection against a risk common to all, but a necessary part of the Great Society in which the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of the particular small group into which he was born\u000a\u000awould go down quite will with the UBI crowd. 
p7553
aVShame that part was ignored.
p7554
aVMuch like religious texts, people will just use academic works to back up their own agenda rather than listen to everything they have to say.
p7555
aVGetting lectured by a Leftist on logic, hahahahaha.
p7556
aVBrilliant.
p7557
aVLet's give full socialism another pop guys!
p7558
aVIt's only killed hundreds of millions of people so far!
p7559
aVWhen did I imply I wanted to begin a faux-communist dictatorship?
p7560
aVI'm not aligned to anything, but anyway, the NHS is socialism, and it's one of the only good things left in our country that hasn't yet been fed to the parasites.
p7561
aVYou claim to possess logic, but then you take the word 'privatised' which in this context means 'privately provided', and interpret that to mean privatised as in pay at the point of use.
p7562
aVThis is dumb as shit at best, and dishonest at worst.
p7563
aVThere have been no hints at people even paying for crutches.
p7564
aVNo where have the Conservatives said anyone pays directly for anything.
p7565
aVSo the medicine is still socialised.
p7566
aVIt doesn't need to be provided by a huge monolithic institution to be free at the point of use.
p7567
aVYou must surely know that even state-owned does not mean automatically free at the point of use.
p7568
aVWhen the state owned trains we all paid for tickets still. 
p7569
aVYou must be on some other plane of anti-logic, because you seem to be defining the words 'privatised' and 'privately provided' when their meaning was not being debated, and now telling me about crutches.
p7570
aVSorry, what?
p7571
aVIf you had learned to read properly, you might have read that I simply said the NHS was a socialist system, because at present, it is.
p7572
aVI also said I was not aligned to anything. 
p7573
aVSo you bleating on about how Right wingers are inherently anti-logic is you being unaligned with anything.
p7574
aVRiiiiight. 
p7575
aVBeing blindly pro-capitalist (in the modern sense) and all the bigotry that comes with being right wing (in most cases) means I don't agree with many things that right wing people say.
p7576
aVI have plenty of opinions, and those opinions are shared by people from lots of different political ideologies.
p7577
aVI don't really stand by any set of ideas 100% and the world would be better if more people did that.
p7578
aVThey seem to be fairly rooted in the idea that the healthcare itself is the best in the world and it's just the finances which are screwing them over.
p7579
aVAre some of them just completely ignoring the table in the article?
p7580
aVThe United States didn't come first in *anything*.
p7581
aV&gt;Are some of them just completely ignoring the table in the article?
p7582
aVNo, their position is the care is first-class for the *have*s, and they want to ignore the *have-not*s
p7583
aVAnd yet if you mention that their system is far from the best anywhere on reddit you get bombarded with "Anti-American circlejerk" and "It's the best healthcare anywhere ever, it's just expensive" comments until you want to delete your account.
p7584
aV"but you pay taxes" is the one I get bombarded with whenever healthcare comes up in discussions. \u000a\u000a
p7585
aVUS citizens pay a higher %age of GDP to cover the cost of Medicare &amp; Medicad than we do for universal health care for everyone.
p7586
aVSo, in tax terms they all pay more than we do already
p7587
aVI'm a fan of that one also.
p7588
aV"Hurr durr you pay taxes so it's not free healthcare" Yeah, still get my healthcare cheaper than you do.
p7589
aVAnd all the cretins saying:\u000a\u000a"I don't want to pay for all the moochers.
p7590
aV"\u000a\u000aOr the classic:\u000a\u000a"I'm a fit and healthy 18 year-old.
p7591
aVWhy should I have to pay for other people's medical bills?
p7592
aV"\u000a\u000aCrazy doesn't begin to encapsulate such lines of thought.
p7593
aVIt's selfishness at the root of it.
p7594
aV&gt; "I'm a fit and healthy 18 year-old.
p7595
aVWhy should I have to pay for other people's medical bills?
p7596
aV"\u000a\u000aThat's as loopy as saying, "I've never needed to call the Police, so why should I pay taxes to maintain the service?
p7597
aV"\u000a\u000a
p7598
aVYep.
p7599
aVAnd the crazy thing is, a bunch of people would actually agree with that statement.
p7600
aVMy favourite part is how some of them are trying to save face by saying we have the worlds biggest obesity crisis and stuff.
p7601
aVAs someone who has been with the German the French and the UK system, I'm not supprised.
p7602
aVNot because the others are bad, far from it, but the NHS always struck me as particularly effective and efficient.
p7603
aVSuer there are parts from the continental services that I would have liked to have, but the same goes the other way.
p7604
aV10th in healthy lives ffs - go for a run you fat fucks!
p7605
aVRunning to the chippie now...
p7606
aVUsed to run to the video store but no need for that anymore.
p7607
aVNo need to run anywhere with the internet.
p7608
aVAll I do is stay indoors on the internet and then kill myself on a treadmill running nowhere... indoors.
p7609
aVThe obesity epidemic in the UK is actually embarrassing.
p7610
aVI am generally annoyed that we have so many fat people here in the UK.
p7611
aVPeople being lazy, greedy fucks costs us [billions a year](http://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/obesity_and_health).
p7612
aVI do believe that if you're fat enough to need extra NHS support or even hand outs from the gov and you're doing nothing to tackle your weight then you should be ashamed of yourself. 
p7613
aV&gt; I am generally annoyed that we have so many fat people here in the UK.
p7614
aVSorry.
p7615
aVWhat annoys me more is when people claim that 'diets do not work', rather than looking at the actual reasons why people put on weight after dieting.
p7616
aVIt's a lack of willpower.
p7617
aVAll people have to do to lose weight is eat less.
p7618
aVIt's not difficult to eat what you want and still lose weight, but the amount of people I know who jump onto the latest fad diet, like the 'juice diet', lose some weight and then immediately rebound back is ridiculous.
p7619
aVYou don't need to sacrifice all the food you enjoy to lose weight, and it shouldn't feel like punishment, but I suppose years of stuffing their faces full of cake, pies and sugar means they know more about this subject than I do.
p7620
aVPhysics dictates that you cannot gain weight if you take in less energy than you require.
p7621
aVThis is a very basic 'formula' that a lot of people seem to think is bullshit.
p7622
aVAnd all this is disregarding the fact that obese people are known to over-report the amount of exercise they do, and under report the amount of calories they take in ('I only eat 1000 calories a day but I keep gaining weight').
p7623
aVIt's generally good advice to disregard what someone says about their own body when it comes to calorie intake:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454084\u000a\u000a*The failure of some obese subjects to lose weight while eating a diet they report as low in calories is due to an energy intake substantially higher than reported and an overestimation of physical activity, not to an abnormality in thermogenesis.
p7624
aV*
aVA surprising amount of people have an unhealthy relationship with food - bordering on an addiction.
p7625
aVIndeed certain foods activate the 'pleasure centres' in the brain [\u005c[1\u005c]](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2013/06/26/ajcn.113.064113.abstract?sid=44ef5031-b040-4501-8e93-af85301d69c6) , in a similar manner to addictive substances.
p7626
aVIt seems a little unfair to chalk this up to just a 'lack of willpower', and say 'just eat less'.
p7627
aVDo you think telling an alcoholic to 'just stop drinking' works?
p7628
aVI may have worded it poorly.
p7629
aVOne of my points is that dieting doesn't need be the removal of every type of food you like.
p7630
aVCake isn't inherently bad for you, but having 6 large cakes a day wouldn't be a great diet.
p7631
aVWhen you want to lose weight, you could eat McDonalds every day and still lose weight (but this would introduce temptation, I admit).
p7632
aVIt's not so much about what you eat, but how much you eat.
p7633
aVAgain, this type of addiction can be improved by weaning yourself off slowly.
p7634
aVAs you take a few snacks out per week, you'll slowly stop gaining weight, and then as you become more proactive about portion sizes, you'll gradually lose weight.
p7635
aVThe real problem is when you switch from having 10,000 calories per day from sugary sweet foods, to eating small salads every meal.
p7636
aVYes, it is effective at losing weight, but our bodies are conditioned over time.
p7637
aVJust as you put on weight over time, your appetite can be conditioned.
p7638
aVThe problem with proper obese people is that they become seriously psychologically addicted to food.
p7639
aVMost of them understand very well that they are massively unhealthy.
p7640
aVBut it's that cliched spiral of being unhappy because you're fat, and food being a quick fix that makes you happy again.
p7641
aVSimilar to drug addiction.
p7642
aVWe should just give them free NHS heroin and be done with it.
p7643
aVYou won't eat much when you're smacked-up.
p7644
aVIt will balance itself out eventually.
p7645
aVProbably cheaper than a gastric band.
p7646
aVYes I am a doctor.
p7647
aVThis is a problem for a lot of people.
p7648
aVPeople focus on carbs, protein fat unnecessarily.
p7649
aVA lot of people base their food choices on fat content rather than calorie content because they misunderstand their roles in weight gain.
p7650
aVThey also tend to buy into crap like "no carbs after 7pm" and other such nonsense.
p7651
aVSo they end up focusing on the wrong things, then complain that diets don't work and give up.
p7652
aVObviously some simple research would clear this up for them but they seem to be averse to that. 
p7653
aVI just came back from living the Netherlands, now I can't help but notice how unhealthy the average person in town looks. 
p7654
aVEveryone in the Netherlands looked really healthy and glamorous when I went last year.
p7655
aVBig difference compared tot he UK\u000a
p7656
aVTerribly dressed, though.
p7657
aVSeriously, I don't understand how the Dutch have such an epidemic of awful dress sense.
p7658
aVIt's astonishing.
p7659
aVreally?
p7660
aVIt's certainly different but I wouldn't say awful.
p7661
aVBut saying that, I'm studying Physics so my views on fashion sense are probably opposed to that of the general population...
p7662
aVThey have all taken power clashing to heart.
p7663
aVThey all wear those shiny black puffer jackets.
p7664
aVWhat's that about?
p7665
aVI saw someone wearing one in Bristol the other day and bet my partner they were Dutch, and they were.
p7666
aVSo strange...\u000a\u000aEdit: [Picture, for reference.
p7667
aV](http://www.footasylum.com/images/products/medium/049405.jpg)
p7668
aVYeah exactly, they all do things on the weekend too.. things other than shopping I mean.
p7669
aVIt's really refreshing, I plan on moving back there asap. 
p7670
aVWeird thing is that they get fed up on lots of milk products as babies.
p7671
aVOh man, that's what I'm missing the most.
p7672
aVYogurt drinks galore, not like we have them here - I'm totally addicted and having dairy withdrawals.
p7673
aVAlso, its totally normal for a couple of old men to be sitting around a cafe bar drinking glasses of milk at 8 in the evening.
p7674
aVSounds like a work for the Netherlands tourist/dairy association...\u000a
p7675
aVWe would see many taking milk with their lunch (kaas, of course) in the office cantine.
p7676
aVWe would joke about the baby nederlanders being contamined with Bovine Growth Hormone from all that dairy, hence growing to 185cm and above.
p7677
aVThere might be an awkward truth in that, it would explain a lot! 
p7678
aVTheir tendency to cycle everywhere helps a lot, and having the best cycling infrastructure in the Europe in turn encourages that.
p7679
aVAbsolutely.
p7680
aVCycling is much more popular in the UK now, probably thanks to Bradley Wiggins, we just need some intercity cycle paths now so that they don't all get run over! 
p7681
aVjust go into any town and the take aways are always rammed\u000a\u000alike chicken places are always so full\u000a\u000aAs a country we have a problem with food.
p7682
aVThey do cost more whilst they are alive but they also die earlier which I believe balances out the cost more.
p7683
aVLast time I was in hospital I'd say 9 out of the 10 people on the ward were 70+.
p7684
aVThe guy in the best opposite me had been in for a year!!
p7685
aVThey were having a big gathering for him leaving and the nurses were crying and stuff.
p7686
aVSo yeah, the biggest problem we're facing in terms of NHS budget is old people.
p7687
aVWe should be encouraging people to smoke and over eat!
p7688
aV(not entirely serious there, but you know, dying early saves the NHS a lot of money). 
p7689
aVYeah there are huge savings to be made just from stopping everyone being so overweight.
p7690
aVAs someone who recently lost a fuckton of weight, I can also attest to the fact that losing weight is really really easy.
p7691
aVLike I was embarrassed at how people were saying how good I looked because literally all I did, was only eat when I was hungry.
p7692
aVWhich was easy.
p7693
aVCurious question, are you a bloke?
p7694
aVFor women, it's generally much harder to lose weight this way.
p7695
aV(Our bodies seem to be obsessed with holding fat to prepare for potential babies) I say generally, because some people are different.
p7696
aVI eat much like you do but although I'm very slowly losing weight I'm not having drastic losses or anything.
p7697
aVWhy would you want to eat when you weren't hungry?
p7698
aVPeople are obsessed with eating three meals a day right?
p7699
aVWell basically, and I'm not saying this would work for everyone, but if I wake up in the morning and I'm not hungry, I don't eat anything, if by 11 I'm a bit hungry I'll eat something small, see how long it takes for me to get hungry again, then I'll just have a sandwich or something for lunch, but in the evening I won't have a massive meal I'll just eat something small again, to stop me feeling hungry, but sometimes if I've gone out for lunch or something I won't be hungry at all so I won't eat anything.
p7700
aVbut the key is I just eat to stop me being hungry.
p7701
aVOther than that, I don't eat and I don't eat more than I need.
p7702
aVI find eating a small amount stops me feeling hungry for several hours, so yeah...
p7703
aVBoredom. 
p7704
aVBecause food is fucking amazing.
p7705
aVunhappiness
p7706
aVBoredom.
p7707
aVIt's always boredom.
p7708
aVErr because cake is amazing?
p7709
aV&gt; People being lazy, greedy fucks costs us billions a year\u000a\u000aNo, they die at a younger age, saving money on pensions/benefits, and I suspect it mostly balances out.
p7710
aV(A lot of fat people are heavy drinkers - so that's loads of alcohol tax going to the government too)\u000a\u000aPeople just love to hurl hate at fat people, as it's too socially unacceptable to hurl it at anybody else these days.
p7711
aV[deleted]
p7712
aVIt's a finger pointing epidemic.
p7713
aVEveryone wants to be able to blame everyone else for their issues.
p7714
aVOur bodies are cruel, and they're all different.
p7715
aVYou just have to work with the cards you've been dealt.
p7716
aVIt is not impossible for anyone to lose weight, but obese people would rather blame companies whose sole purpose is to sell their food.
p7717
aVIt's ridiculous frankly.
p7718
aVThere was an article about this, where a doctor called Coca Cola hypocrites for funding an anti-obesity campaign.
p7719
aVHypocrites?
p7720
aVThey never said to drink 5L of coke a day until you get obese and/or diabetic.
p7721
aVIt's sad when those who are supposed to be logical abandon all logic.
p7722
aVI don't really like defending big companies, but they are trying to sell their products.
p7723
aVSaying that their product made you obese is just another way of saying that you have absolutely no fucking willpower. 
p7724
aV&gt;I don't really like defending big companies, but they are trying to sell their products.
p7725
aVSaying that their product made you obese is just another way of saying that you have absolutely no fucking willpower.
p7726
aVPersonally, I can say that I have resisted cocaine and heroin and have even managed to avoid tobacco.
p7727
aVWhen companies are using teams of psychologists to try to sell stuff to you, it is much harder.
p7728
aVWe are evolved as opportunistic eaters to like sugars and fatty foods (our ancestors didn't always have plenty).
p7729
aVIt isn't surprising that a percentage of people are caught by this.
p7730
aVI agree that they use increasingly devious tactics to sell their products and make us want them, the thing is that until we turn into lifeless drones, we do have control over our actions.
p7731
aVGoing cold turkey is also not a great way, it just gives an even more intense craving.
p7732
aVMy main problem with obesity is when people say it's due to genetics and such, as well as blaming companies for selling their products.
p7733
aVI hate to sound like a self help program, but the first step to dealing with a problem is admitting it.
p7734
aVIf one believes it is not one's eating habits that has caused one to be obese, then this person will never change his/her eatings habits and go in search of other people or things to blame.
p7735
aVBut essentially, I agree with what you've said.
p7736
aVI think we basically agree, but I do feel that perhaps the companies themselves have a role to play, or at least regulation.
p7737
aVYes, in the end it is down to the individual but once addicted, it really is harder to break that habit, whether crack or sugar.
p7738
aVAnother of the problems the left refuse to address is the class issue.
p7739
aVThere was a post on this sub the other day that i cant currently find due to reddits shit searching system but it was about us having the fattest women in Europe.
p7740
aVThat article at one point essentially said 'is it class related?
p7741
aVYes, but we're not going to address that'.
p7742
aVNow you could argue that those who earn less cant afford healthier foods, but is everyone below the poverty line obese?
p7743
aVNo.
p7744
aVIf some can stay healthy then im sure the others can.
p7745
aVThere is a culture of ignorance in the UK and thats especially when it comes to staying healthy. 
p7746
aVIt's more about education than social inequality.
p7747
aVIt's also about food being one of the few things poorer people have to reward them selves.
p7748
aVYou can't afford a holiday, or a nice car, or a nice house, or a new pair of shoes, or to go to the cinema, so a fish supper it is then.
p7749
aVWent out with six friends the other night, I was the only one not overweight.
p7750
aVTwo of them are currently suffering from joint problems because of their weight, and the NHS (rightly) won't provide treatment until they lose the weight.
p7751
aVNo sympathy for them.

aVAustralia is [just as bad](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26131403), yet comes fourth on the 'healthy lives' rating.
p7762
aVThe difference in outcomes isn't solely because of "the fat fucks".
p7763
aVseriously and its far far worse in th north of england.
p7764
aVI travel between ldn and manchester a lot and always notice the difference up north
p7765
aVWhen you're paying London rents, you can't afford to eat.
p7766
aVOr drink beer at London prices...
p7767
aVpretty much
p7768
aVDidn't work out so well for Rik Mayall.
p7769
aV:-(
p7770
aVIt's actually surprising to me, considering how much TV and media we consume that demonises being fat, that we are still all so unhealthy.
p7771
aVEndless TV shows about losing weight with tables full of a week's worth of terrible foods aimed at shaming this episode's victim into going for a jog and yet there's no change in society.
p7772
aVCelebrity Fit Camp, Biggest Loser, You Are What You Eat *et cetera ad infinitum*.
p7773
aVIt's on the news all the time; there can't be any person who isn't aware that being fat is unhealthy, a growing problem in the country (pun absolutely intended) and what to do about it...and yet people don't do anything.
p7774
aVThe best way for the NHS to save money is to make the country healthier.
p7775
aVThe Department of Health needs to invest money into health campaigns to keep people out of hospital thereby killing 2 very overweight birds with a single stone. 
p7776
aVI think many people just think 'fuck it' in the face of unachievable self-image.
p7777
aVNot sure this is a particularly sophisticated point I'm raising, just noting that certain nigh unobtainable aesthetics aren't necessarily aspirational.
p7778
aVMy gym is doing a biggest loser thing, with diet plans, fitness programmes, etc for £15
p7779
aV&gt; It's actually surprising to me, considering how much TV and media we consume that demonises being fat, that we are still all so unhealthy.
p7780
aVSo maybe it's time to reconsider the pervading wisdom that the best way to deal with obesity is to make fat people feel shit about themselves, then?
p7781
aVYou may think that is a lot, but what is much, much more pervasive are adverts showing beautiful, shiney, delicious food.
p7782
aVEVERYWHERE.
p7783
aVIt is in every ad break, billboard, magazine, it sponsors every sporting event, music event, general gathering of people to some description.
p7784
aVAlso you have to remember that most of us work at very boring sedate kind of jobs, and we tend to think about food more when we're bored, so people graze and snack without realising. 
p7785
aVMore emphasis on P.E in school.
p7786
aVIt should be every day, not once or twice a week.
p7787
aVThere should also be investment in after school sports teams.
p7788
aVNot enough emphasis is put on physical activity and education surrounding health was at least bare bones when I was at school.
p7789
aVEvery day?
p7790
aVMy school didn't have the time/space for that.
p7791
aV1 hour PE lessons were phased out however once they realised it gave us about half an hour or less of actual PE between set up and getting changed.
p7792
aVBut I agree, PE needs reforming.
p7793
aVWe need more non-competitive things as well.
p7794
aVI'm not going to enjoy a game like football if I can't compete at all, especially when everyone else takes it so seriously.
p7795
aVSeriously, sports clubs, sports day and other PE related things are dominated by a small minority of students who are very good at it.
p7796
aVI'm not advocating the "everyone gets a medal" mentality but I kind of gave up on most of PE when it became clear that I was a detriment to whatever team I was on and would get excluded by others for being so shit.
p7797
aVBest PE for me was hockey with this one teacher who was a complete cunt.
p7798
aVHe shoved everyone who wasn't good in his eyes to one side and ignored us, playing with the others.
p7799
aVMost fun games I've played without that prick breathing down my neck.
p7800
aVIn primary school we had PE every day, 1-2 hours.
p7801
aVIt was probably because they didn't have anything better for us to do but it did make for a healthy class.
p7802
aVPE was horrible.
p7803
aVIt put me off sports for life.
p7804
aVAnd yeah, I'm a fatty now.
p7805
aVSchools need to give kids a chance to learn to *enjoy* sport, not force them to play rugby in the rain after being bullied in the changing rooms.
p7806
aVAnd there is more room for improvement.
p7807
aVI am not criticising the NHS, more the people who run it.
p7808
aVThe staff and doctors are demoralised and confused every few years when a new system comes in, whether it be hierarchical structure, training systems or accountability and all of this wastes money.
p7809
aVThe second problem is with those people who criticise it, this totally demotivates and demoralises the workers leading to poorer care and a worse system.
p7810
aVI think that the NHS is a wonderful institution but the half of my family that work for it say that change needs to be made about how it is perceived in the public and that a change in system doesn't always equal improvement.
p7811
aVEDIT: Rephrased to make the point clearer
p7812
aVITT: People using anecdotes to claim the statistics are wrong...\u000a\u000aThat great British pass time of never accepting that we're ever good at anything.
p7813
aVMost of the complaints can be nullified by pointing out we were ranked 3rd in timeliness and 10th in healthiness (only 1 above the US).
p7814
aVApparently the good heavily outweighs the bad...
p7815
aVImagine if we spent an extra $1,000 per capita, like France...
p7816
aVI think that 3 in timeliness would go up a bit :p
p7817
aVThe NHS is an excellent institution that I will fight to save from Tory and Lib Dem destruction. 
p7818
aVNo matter who is elected in the next general election standards in the NHS will suffer.
p7819
aVIt's not about left/right or ideology.
p7820
aVIt's about economics.
p7821
aVWe have an aging population.
p7822
aVIn order to maintain standards, the NHS budget will need to be heavily increased.
p7823
aVHowever we also have an enormous debt, and we continue to run a large deficit.
p7824
aVSo far the current government has halved it.
p7825
aVBut if we wanted to break even as a country, we'd need to see the other half of the deficit removed as well.
p7826
aVEvery single one of the main stream parties has committed to tackling the deficit.
p7827
aVNone of them will fund the increase that the NHS needs to maintain care standards.
p7828
aVWhen you blame individual parties, as much of this thread does, then you are missing the big picture.
p7829
aVWhen you indulge in petty point scoring, you are standing in the way of really understanding the serious problems the UK faces, and should your favoured party win the next election, they will inevitably disappoint you.\u000a\u000a
p7830
aVYou realise that it was Labour who began the process of privatising the NHS?
p7831
aVIf your idea of fighting for the NHS is voting for Labour, you are in for a nasty surprise. 
p7832
aVThe survival of the NHS is a healthcare issue, not a party political one.
p7833
aVWhilst it is reasonable to brand the coalition with wanton destruction of [the wonderful NHS](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/06/16/once-again-u-s-has-most-expensive-least-effective-health-care-system-in-survey/?tid=rssfeed), and also to blame New Labour for getting the ball rolling, it remains a healthcare issue and trying to reduce it to a mere argument about how one behaves at the ballot box is a bit shallow.
p7834
aVI agree only to an extent, only because no matter who gets in out of the big 3 parties, the NHS is set to be flogged off for the profit of unaccountable entities.
p7835
aVThis is a highly political issue, health provision always will be.
p7836
aVI totally agree it is a highly political issue, but styling it a *party* political issue is missing the point a bit.
p7837
aVHence my argument that the debate should be about healthcare, not voting intentions.
p7838
aVSadly, I also agree that political and financial expediency means that Lib/Lab/Con are all likely to shaft the NHS :(
p7839
aVthe culture that brought about PFI is to blame.
p7840
aVThe NHS is dying by a thousand cuts of privatisation.
p7841
aVI heard a really interesting idea a little while back.
p7842
aVSomeone suggested that the NHS should be made separate from the government but state owned, like the bank of England.
p7843
aVHopefully this would keep actual senior healthcare workers in charge of the NHS, rather than politicians who tend to have a pretty tenuous grasp on healthcare at the best of times. 
p7844
aVWow, that would be great if they could do that for education too!
p7845
aVNo more Gove-travesties.
p7846
aVI really know quite little about what the coalition has done with the NHS, can someone explain to me what it is they've done that causes people to say they're privatising it?
p7847
aVLike most voters of all parties these days.
p7848
aVNEW Labour.
p7849
aVThe rebrand was more than a name change, it was a lurch to the right to try and and soak up all voters that had previously put Thatcher into no.10 3 times.
p7850
aVLabour under Ed Milliband is more of a brownite old labour party, which if you want to keep the NHS safe, is an infintely better choice than the lib dems and Tories.
p7851
aVI'm not against private if it is proven to be more beneficial.
p7852
aVWhat I am against is the biggest top down reorganisation of the NHS ever just so it is setup for ypur mates to tender for the profitable bits of our NHS.
p7853
aVIt was a smash and grab and left community care decimated.
p7854
aVIt will take years to recover from it, but I have faith in the commitment of NHS staff to see it through, as long as the voters recognise the urgency.
p7855
aVI used to work in NHS Blood and Transplant and I doubt that a single person didn't think that reorganisation was needed.
p7856
aVWhether what they are doing now is right or wrong, there is so much wastage and unnecessary middle-management in the NHS which deserves to be cut.
p7857
aVI don't mean doctors and nurses and hospitals, just the bureaucracy and pencil pushing.
p7858
aVLarge institutions are always in need of some sort of reform.
p7859
aVIt doesn't matter whether it's a large business, bank or the public sector, some vast part of it will be crap and inefficient.
p7860
aVThe important question is if it's effective in it's entirety.
p7861
aVGiven that the OP's graphic shows us spending the second least amount of money to give the best healthcare, the NHS is absurdly efficient.
p7862
aVBeing more efficient than others doesn't mean that you are 'absurdly efficient'.
p7863
aVThere's always room for improvement.
p7864
aVThe NHS is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but from spending a week in an institute you can see  money bleeding out of the walls which could be saved.
p7865
aVThe reorganisation didn't cut waste.
p7866
aVIt created whole new bureaucracy in the CCGs and CSUs.
p7867
aVIf anything it's costing more, they made everyone redundant and hired the back on higher grades.
p7868
aVIt's a mess that isn't being reported. 
p7869
aV[deleted]
p7870
aVIt's more difficult I think when these decisions have a human at the end of the with life and death at stake.
p7871
aVPeople tend to be more risk averse I these situations.
p7872
aVI'm not saying it's right but I can understand it.
p7873
aVI have been a couple of times in the German system:\u000a\u000a&gt;there is so much wastage and unnecessary middle-management in the NHS which deserves to be cut.
p7874
aVYes, the NHS may have room for improvement, but imagine an environment where every aspirin has to be billed to a patient and that bill cross checked by an insurance company.
p7875
aVGovernment meddling isn't going to solve the problems of unnecessary bureaucracy and middle management though is it?
p7876
aVIt's like putting Weightwatchers in charge of helping anorexic people...\u000a\u000aA huge top-down reorganisation is exactly what the NHS didn't need, surely?
p7877
aVYou don't get rid of bureaucracy by creating more...Top down policies are what RESULTS in bureaucracy and time-wasting exercises.
p7878
aVIt's not like the culture of box ticking came from the cleaners or regular nurses, it came from the higher-ups...
p7879
aVIf you want to get rid of waste, the workers at the bottom should be making the decisions.
p7880
aVThey work in the sector, they know what's a waste of time and what isn't.
p7881
aVThey know which managers do fuck all and which are actually doing an important job.
p7882
aVUnfortunately bottoms-up reorganisation doesn't result in huge government contracts going to party donors/politicians, so it isn't going to happen.
p7883
aVIf the government is too shit to improve the NHS they should stay out of it altogether. \u000a
p7884
aVThere are at least 70 Labour Lords and 14 Labour MPs who have interests and Investments in companies that would benefit from greater NHS privatisation. 
p7885
aVThe chances are, most people with savings indirectly have "investments in companies that would benefit from greater NHS privatisation".
p7886
aVIf those companies stopped growing/being profitable then their banks/investment managers would just put their money elsewhere.
p7887
aVThere are all people who have direct investments or links with private companies who would gain from NHS privatisation, such as Owen Smith, who was a former lobbyist for Pfizer, or Frank Field, who is a director of Medicash Health Benefits Ltd, a private health insurance company.
p7888
aVI judge someone by their actions not by what they own.
p7889
aVSo you condemn Tory and Lib Dem members for:\u000a\u000a&gt;the biggest top down reorganisation of the NHS ever just so it is setup for ypur mates to tender for the profitable bits of our NHS.
p7890
aVBut not Labour members for the exact same thing? 
p7891
aVYou have a somewhat rational stance, however it may also result in you remaining more than just a few steps behind those with interests that negatively impact yours.
p7892
aVConflict of interest is a shield to protect not a preventative measure; once certain choices and actions have been made it can otherwise be difficult to reverse them.
p7893
aVYou just sound like you don't want to say anything other than Labour is good for the UK.
p7894
aVLabour is better than the Torys for the NHS.
p7895
aVThat's all I'm trying to say.
p7896
aVOk, better.
p7897
aVBut they're still not good for the NHS.
p7898
aVNo party is.
p7899
aVthere is no way private will be more beneficial.
p7900
aVbillions of pounds will be drained out of the system in dividends and bonuses.
p7901
aVand then when it breaks, the government will foot the bill, because it is a necessary service.
p7902
aVlook at what happened with G4S and the olympics .
p7903
aVfirst - due to budget cuts, you send some policemen home, thank you for you service etc.
p7904
aVthen you need more security for the Olympics, so you pay a third party A LOT  of money to hire under-qualified guards.
p7905
aVincluding iirc 250M in management bonuses.
p7906
aV(as opposed to the iirc 500M management overhead - because hiring 10000 minimum wage wrkers for three months doesn't cost anywhere near the money G4S  got.
p7907
aV)\u000aTHEN they screw up and the police and my are called to fill the gap for a cost that greatly exceeds the original budget cuts.
p7908
aVwould you say that you are in favour of privatizing the police or the judicial system?
p7909
aVhow about the fire brigade ?\u000a\u000a
p7910
aVI'm not in favour, I'm just not counting it out as an option.
p7911
aVI like to consider as much as I can.
p7912
aVThe idea of a profit motive where life and death is concerned do go against my gut instinct though for reasons you mentioned. 
p7913
aVWell labour are the only main party committed to ending the current privatisation of the NHS. 
p7914
aVThey cannot.
p7915
aVWe have already agreed to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal, which Labour supported, and which opens up  NHS contracts to bidding from private firms from both the EU and US.
p7916
aVHow do Labour propose to end any further privatisation while we are still bound by this deal? 
p7917
aVSimply not true.
p7918
aVNo deal has been made and Andy Burnham said that any Labour support depends on an NHS exemption.
p7919
aVhttp://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/02/andy-burnham-nhs-must-be-exempted-eu-us-free-trade-agreement
p7920
aV&gt; Andy Burnham said that any Labour support depends on an NHS \u000aexemption.
p7921
aVSince when has Labour stuck by it's pre-election promises?
p7922
aVThey have a hard enough time meeting their manifesto commitments, yet alone isolated statements by individual spokesmen.
p7923
aVIndividual spokesman?
p7924
aVHe's pretty much the architect of the party's health policy and has been stuck on repeat for the last 3 years in saying that the first thing a Labour government would do is scrap the reforms.
p7925
aVJust google 'burnham scrap nhs reforms.
p7926
aV' \u000a\u000aIf you think the party would let their principle member on the issue be this categorical without having the intention of backing him up, then I don't think you understand how political PR works.
p7927
aVLabour heavily trades on its reputation as the NHS custodian. 
p7928
aVThe last labour government hardly stopped the march of privatisation, they embraced it.
p7929
aVJust like how they didn't renationalise the railways after promising to do it. 
p7930
aV&gt; has been stuck on repeat for the last 3 years in saying that the first thing a Labour government would do is scrap the reforms.
p7931
aVJust google 'burnham scrap nhs reforms.
p7932
aV' \u000a\u000aI suspect they will scrap the NHS reforms.
p7933
aVIsn't it traditional whenever a new minister comes into power, from any party (even the same party as his predecessor) to scrap half the current policies and then replace them with a whole set of new ones?
p7934
aVHowever we were talking about TTIP, and I haven't detected nearly the same level of commitment in this area.
p7935
aVThe Labour party broadly supports the treaty, and is beholden to many of the same vested interests that created it.\u000a
p7936
aVSeeing as Labour was the party who started the whole privatisation process, I have my doubts that they will do much to stop it now. 
p7937
aVI very much doubt that the Shadow Health Secretary would make statements like this one:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/political-news/burnham-promises-labour-will-repeal-health-reforms-in-first-queens-speech/20004431.article#.U6AU8ZSwJuA\u000a\u000aif he then had no intention of following through on it.
p7938
aVLabour left the NHS in pretty good shape and the protection of a universal health service is far too important to the party's reputation for them to go back on the kind of promises being made.
p7939
aVThe TTIP has not been finalised.
p7940
aVIt's still in the the negotiation phase, and after that it will have to be ratified by individual parliaments.
p7941
aVHowever I agree that it represents a threat.
p7942
aVWe haven't agreed to it yet, it can be repleased.
p7943
aVCheck 38degree as of yesterday for the current campaign
p7944
aVAll 4 of the main parties will privatise our NHS
p7945
aVThe Greens certainly wouldn't? 
p7946
aVBut they're 5th
p7947
aVAnd they are represented in the Commons and they run a council.
p7948
aVThey are the fourth most powerful party. 
p7949
aVI'm not really out to disprove that, just the way I view it altho green did better than lib dem in euro recently, lib dem are still in power, and ukip definitely did better than green\u000a\u000aBut this is all semantics.
p7950
aVOf the 5 parties, only greens won't privatise NHS.
p7951
aVThey are the only party to vocally oppose ttip
p7952
aVWell Labour have vowed to repeal the health and social care act, the only argument against that is 'I don't believe them', which can be used against any party on any issue. 
p7953
aVBut even then, its only greens that we can't cite a reason why we don't believe them as they haven't been in power and ignored their pledges
p7954
aVWell you could say that every other party had reneged on pledges so the Greens probably will as well.
p7955
aVThe point still stands that of the three main parties, if you don't want the NHS to continue to be privatised then Labour are your only choice. 
p7956
aVAll other parties have so greens probably will, well they are separate for the right reasons there\u000a\u000aAnd yeah if you omit green from the equation then labour are your least worst choice
p7957
aVAgreed.
p7958
aVThe NHS has saved the lives of three of my family.
p7959
aVI owe it to the NHS to fight for it.
p7960
aVSaved my life three times and I'm only 30!
p7961
aVThe NHS is our greatest monument to the WW2 generation.
p7962
aVThat generation went thru the war, and came out wanting to create a better, fairer Britain, and the NHS is a cornerstone of this\u000a
p7963
aVI'd argue that the only organisation comparable in it's impact is the BBC.
p7964
aVThe NHS is why I vote 
p7965
aVIt is the media you want to fight.
p7966
aVEven now we'll get the usual bullshit about "well it isn't perfect so we should obviously emulate those nations doing worse than us".
p7967
aVWhat are the Lib Dems doing about it?
p7968
aVSomething something Clegg Clegg student betrayer Tory Judas orange booker turncoat literally thatcher rabble rabble rabble 
p7969
aVUnbelievable bravery.
p7970
aVYou are aware that the Tory's didn't start the decline of the NHS right?
p7971
aVOr that it is in decline?
p7972
aVWe've gone from 3rd of five to 1st of 11 in ten years.
p7973
aVI do wonder how much of that is us improving vs everyone else getting worse.
p7974
aVEither way we come out on top. 
p7975
aVNot worth a lot if the UK standards have just fallen the least.
p7976
aVThat's a very shallow victory.
p7977
aVYes they did, during the eighties.
p7978
aVand the fact pfi's came into effect in '92.
p7979
aVSpose that's Labour's fault too.
p7980
aVYes they did.
p7981
aVThey defunded it heavily under Thatcher.
p7982
aVThe NHS was barely functional in 1997.
p7983
aVAs a premature baby just after the thatcher era, seemed to work well enough for me. 
p7984
aVYes not everyone who touched the NHS in that time period died.
p7985
aVThis doesn't alter the fact we did have one of the worse systems in the world in 1997.
p7986
aV[deleted]
p7987
aVYes they did.
p7988
aVI've watched it happen from the inside and out.
p7989
aVAdmittedly the Lib Dems were the enablers, something I will never forget.
p7990
aVHave you now?
p7991
aVIts funny because I also work in the NHS and from where I'm standing we're no worse off than we were under Labour.
p7992
aVEven when you take the different economic situations into account.
p7993
aVAnd where do you work?
p7994
aVClearly not at ward management level, or in service provision.
p7995
aVSurely you're not asserting your ward mirrors all other wards in the country?
p7996
aVMy 'ward' is maybe 100 different wards spread over the East Midlands region.
p7997
aVThey aren't enablers, on healthcare many of their members are more right-wing than the Tories.
p7998
aV&gt;You are aware that the Tory's didn't start the decline of the NHS right?
p7999
aVThere is no decline because we are #1!
p8000
aVSo suck it UKIP and Tory scum! 
p8001
aVNot for long.
p8002
aVThe effects of tory rule are starting to really bite now.
p8003
aVI work at a financially sound hospital trust but this year we are starting to have to make redundancies and making choices over things that is introducing unnecessary risk.
p8004
aVThis NHS has had to make billions in cuts every year, sorry not cuts silly me, the "Nicholson Challenge".
p8005
aVCall it what you like but cuts are cuts.
p8006
aVAlso it must be considered that inflation in health is much higher than normal inflation so to freeze or cut budgets for years has a much more devastating effect than first considered.
p8007
aVThe NHS is creaking.
p8008
aVIt needs investment.
p8009
aVWe need to vote out those who are blindly and ideologically opposed to this notion or we will lose our greatest peace time achievement.
p8010
aVIn the time of an aging population we need it now more than ever. 
p8011
aVI agree that healthcare inflation rises faster than broader measures of inflation.
p8012
aVSo, let's have it your way.
p8013
aVNHS budget increases in line with "healthcare inflation".
p8014
aVSo in 2015 the budget increases by 6%.
p8015
aVAnd in 2016 too, and every year for 20 years.
p8016
aVAll of a sudden the NHS eats all the money in the country, Parliament disbands itself, the monarch abdicates and we rename the country The UK of NHS.
p8017
aVYou can't keep increasing the proportional amount of money the NHS gets.
p8018
aVIt has to be balanced with reality.
p8019
aVNot everyone gets to live, not everyone gets to be healthy, the NHS will not get access to all the things it wants.
p8020
aVThe Tory's aren't opposed to investment.
p8021
aVYou're just against how that investment would get there.
p8022
aVFurthermore if you do work at a trust, you know a big problem is wastage and bureaucracy.
p8023
aVWithout those we could probably extend the life of the NHS for years to come.
p8024
aVMillions of pounds are wasted on trivial things like paper, labels.
p8025
aVMillions if not billions on bigger equipment.
p8026
aVCut down salaries like our head of infection prevention (who's job is to essentially say wash your hands upon entering a ward) who is on, get this, £120,000 a year.
p8027
aVThat's one position in one trust who is not doing a particularly essential service.
p8028
aVIts incredible.
p8029
aVA MRSA infection cost the NHS about £40,000.
p8030
aVInfection control pays for itself if it prevents three additional infections a year, let alone all the additional adverse events that will be prevented at the same time.
p8031
aVI really want the best person possible in the infection control job, and I'd be prepared to pay serious money for them to work at the NHS and not some bank somewhere.
p8032
aVFor what its worth, it's a nurse who worked her way up to that position.
p8033
aVI've seen what her job entails and given the amount of work other employees put it on far less money, it is nothing short of a joke.
p8034
aVI don't disagree there - the work some of the nurses and HCAs put in for an absolute pittance should shame many hospital directors on £100k+ salaries.
p8035
aVI guess what I'm saying is that while £120k/year is cheap for good infection control, £30k/year for an excellent mental health nurse is practically exploitative and I'd love to see a substantial pay rise for the workers on less than a Band 7 pay scale.
p8036
aVIn theory I agree.
p8037
aVIn practice however I've been told that our trust is one infection away from breaching the quota so its getting worse this year compared to previous years.
p8038
aVYes and no.
p8039
aVThe HCAI targets have been decreasing year on year.
p8040
aVLast year, our Trust target was 1, this year it's 0.
p8041
aVEven though we did breach with 3 total last year.
p8042
aVAnd it's so low because historically we've had very low serious infections - but that's no reason to set such an arbitrary 0 for the year now.
p8043
aVStupid system.
p8044
aVI'm not suggesting there is no waste.
p8045
aVI am suggesting we are on the brink of losing the NHS.
p8046
aVOnce profit becomes the driving motive it will be a massive net negative for the majority of the population.
p8047
aVParticularly an aging population like we have.
p8048
aVInvestment is needed. 
p8049
aVThere are no plans to make the NHS for profit.
p8050
aVYou are confusing allowing competition to reduce costs of specific procedures will the NHS or organisations linked to it making profits.
p8051
aVIf a company rises a cost to try and make money off the NHS, and another company offers it at the original cost, then the NHS is obliged to switch provider.
p8052
aVAt all times safety is Paramount and switches aren't made just for economic reasons.
p8053
aVYou are aware that government decisions don't necessarily have immediate visibility, right?
p8054
aVOf course, but that likewise means you can't judge a government until said changes are visible.
p8055
aVWhich is exactly what the OP did.
p8056
aVYou can infer from the policies a government is enacting that ruin is impending.
p8057
aVThis government's policy takes us closer to being the American system, and just look at that league table and see the results.
p8058
aVThat table is the result of the Labour party's increased NHS funding (which the Conservative party once promised to match, pound for pound).
p8059
aVNo you cannot infer before data even exists.
p8060
aVYou hold an untenable, speculative position.
p8061
aVSo you think governments should always get a second term, because the effects of their first term may not be completely evident?
p8062
aVEven when there is clear evidence of policy which has demonstrably poor performance in other countries?
p8063
aVIf yes, should they get a third?
p8064
aVA fourth?
p8065
aVAt what point do you say "No, I believe the other guy's policy and track-record with the NHS is better"?
p8066
aVYou're arguing a straw man argument.
p8067
aVI never said that they should get continual terms because the evidence hasn't yet emerged.
p8068
aVI'm saying you can't call a policy piss poor until you've seen its caused problems.
p8069
aVIe common sense.
p8070
aVYou can't compare selling ineffective **parts** of the NHS for specific things to the wholesale private market in the US, for example.
p8071
aVYou cannot reasonably demonstrate, yet (or perhaps ever), that this policy is causing harm.
p8072
aV&gt;You're arguing a straw man argument.
p8073
aVThat you accuse me does not make it so.
p8074
aVVoting is necessarily speculative, as the voter has to infer from policies they believe will benefit the nation.
p8075
aVI am therefore asking you, where a term of office is not sufficient for full numerical analysis (an obvious impossibility irregardless), how long should we wait before forming of opinion?
p8076
aV&gt;I'm saying you can't call a policy piss poor until you've seen its caused problems\u000a\u000aI quite agree.
p8077
aVThat is why you should observe the complaints of the medical professionals in this very thread.
p8078
aV&gt;You can't compare selling ineffective parts of the NHS for specific things to the wholesale private market in the US, for example.
p8079
aVYou cannot reasonably demonstrate, yet (or perhaps ever), that this policy is causing harm.
p8080
aVNow, that *is* a straw argument! 
p8081
aVIn 2004, this same study put the NHS 3rd overall, now it's 1st.
p8082
aVThis bollocks that gets thrown around saying the Tories are destroying the NHS is just uninformed, party-politics fueled crap.
p8083
aVThere's a delay in these effects.
p8084
aVLeft unfunded for longer and all the labour improvements made to the NHS will be lost. 
p8085
aV[deleted]
p8086
aVIt's right to vote for what you believe in. 
p8087
aVYou know that an Independent Scotland will have a smaller health budget to work with than it does now, if anything you wanted Scotland to stay devolved. 
p8088
aVIf the current government was doing a bad job, why did the UK rank first?
p8089
aVStop unnecessarily politicising an otherwise positive story.
p8090
aVThe NHS was not set up by the current government, in case you weren't aware.
p8091
aVIt takes many years to build or destroy an institution as large as the NHS, and most other developed countries have also recently seen a rise in popularity of right-of-centre political parties that have similar policies on health care funding.
p8092
aVWhat next, crediting the fall of the Soviet Union to Cameron?
p8093
aVIf the current government was doing a bad job in foreign policy, why is Poland in the EU and not part of the USSR?
p8094
aVCheckmate.
p8095
aVI wasn't crediting the creation of the NHS to the current government, in case you weren't aware.
p8096
aVI was crediting the fact that the NHS is still working during the recovery from a devastating recession to the current government.
p8097
aVThis is Reddit, not chess.
p8098
aVGet over yourself.
p8099
aVIs it positive?
p8100
aVThis is what I read in the [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html) in the Independent about the same thing.
p8101
aV&gt;Britain slips up marginally on its \u201ctimeliness of care\u201d and **ranks a shocking second to last for the \u201chealthy lives\u201d indicator, which had looked at life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.
p8102
aV**\u000a\u000aFunnily enough everyone is swarming over this post to circlejerk about the NHS, instead of the one that actually at least mentions in passing the problems with the NHS.
p8103
aVYes it is positive.
p8104
aVIt's certainly not perfect and there are elements which need desperate improvement, such as life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.
p8105
aV&gt;The UK has short waiting times for basic medical care and nonemergency access to services after hours,\u201d it says.
p8106
aV\u201cThe UK also has improved waiting times to see a specialist and now rates fourth on this dimension with the US ranking third.\u201d\u000a**Overall, it was said that the UK provides \u201cuniversal coverage with low out-of-pocket costs while maintaining quick access to specialty services.\u201d**\u000a\u000aOverall this is a positive story and I would certainly argue that there are services and areas which are in need of improvement.
p8107
aVThat's why these studies and reports are necessary and so is healthy debate. 
p8108
aVExcept nobody apart from you and one other person has even acknowledged that the part there the NHS scores badly is a problem and needs improvement, they just use the rest of it to talk about how fantastic the NHS is without caring about death rates and outcomes.
p8109
aVI bring it up people just say things like "oh, well it's probably because Brits are overweight and drink a lot".
p8110
aVWhenever I tell people about the mistreatment I faced which actually made my health worse (permanently, I have to live with it for the rest of my life), they just say "well you can't know if it would be different in another country (I can, I'm in another country now, it has been better here the moment I landed), or start going on about how "do you want to privatise it?!
p8111
aVdo you hate the NHS?!".
p8112
aVThe NHS seems immune from criticism, even as the problems are discussed in newspapers (even the Guardian), which scares me.
p8113
aVAccess and costs are important, but it is a *healthcare* system and I'm worried about the standard of healthcare provided.
p8114
aVBut at the end of the day, if people don't want acknowledge the problems and try to fix them then they're the ones who have to face the consequences.
p8115
aV(I haven't said anything about privatising the NHS, I don't want it to be, especially not by handing out contracts on monopolies the way the Tories seem to believe.
p8116
aVI just want it to work, for patients.
p8117
aV)\u000a\u000aWe have "quick access to specialty services" but the second lowest "healthy lives", which covers death rates for conditions treatable with medical care - just above the US where many people can't see specialists.
p8118
aVThat doesn't seem right to me.
p8119
aVAnd with all the talk about how great access is, there is nobody discussing the huge regional variations in the standard of care you relieve, the "postcode lottery".
p8120
aVEven if the NHS is amazing and does work properly in a few areas, that doesn't justify people suffering unnecessarily in other areas solely because they live in the wrong place.
p8121
aVIt should be good in all parts of the UK, as a *National* Health Service.
p8122
aVHealthy debate is very important, but there is very little about the NHS.
p8123
aVThe NHS is something to be proud of it, but it also has significant problems.
p8124
aVOkay, what's the plan?
p8125
aVVote for a party not ideologically against the very idea of socialised health care.
p8126
aVContact your MP.
p8127
aVProtest where you can.
p8128
aVCounter the Daily Mail propaganda.
p8129
aVThat's a start.
p8130
aVGood luck with that under FPTP.
p8131
aVApparently we needed new maternity units- not an alternative voting system. 
p8132
aVI have a lot of respect for the NHS, but are we all really just ignoring the fact that we're second from last in the 'healthy lives' row?
p8133
aVArguably outcomes are more important than efficiency, especially to the individual.
p8134
aVFrom the report:\u000a\u000a&gt; The U.S. ranks last overall with poor scores on all three indicators of healthy lives\u2014mortality amenable to medical care, infant mortality, and healthy life expectancy at age 60.
p8135
aVThe U.S. and U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from conditions amenable to medical care than some of the other countries, e.g., rates 25 percent to 50 percent higher than Australia and Sweden.
p8136
aVOverall, France, Sweden, and Switzerland rank highest on healthy lives.
p8137
aVHow much of that is to do with the NHS though?
p8138
aVWouldn't factors like diet, inequality (linked with the last one I guess) and other externals play a bigger role than provision of healthcare?
p8139
aVAnd Scotland.
p8140
aVLet's not forget Scotland is still in the UK.
p8141
aVAfter they leave our Healthy Lives ranking should rise a few points :)\u000a\u000a(just kidding Scotland, we love you really, please stay!
p8142
aV)
aVScottish NHS isn't in as much bother as England, the devolved government has refused to carve it up.
p8143
aVIt has its problems but it's a damn good system.
p8144
aVYeah, but it's paid for using general taxation (ie.
p8145
aVpartially funded by English taxes).
p8146
aVIf it had to be funded purely off of Scottish taxes it'd probably be a very different service.
p8147
aVWell that's debatable in that it's funded by the money Scotland gets back after it contributes to the UK.
p8148
aVI think it's currently something like Scotland contributes 9.4% (not including Oil, Gas and a few other revenue streams) and gets back 9.3%\u000a\u000aThis whole "English tax payers pay for healthcare and free prescriptions in Scotland" is a narrative started by Red Top papers and disingenuous politicians.
p8149
aVIt's perpetuated by people who should really know better.
p8150
aVThen again from the other comments some people seem to think that all of Scotland is a minority Glaswegan caricature.
p8151
aVCome on man, you're living in the past.
p8152
aVMost people have grudgingly come around to the fact that Scotland pays it's way.
p8153
aVThat myth comes about by the fact that THE ENTIRE COUNTRY runs on a deficit i.e.
p8154
aVthere is not as much money coming in as there is going out.
p8155
aVSome bright sparks twisted that fact to make Scotland look like it spends more than it gives, ignoring the fact that the entire country does the exact same thing.
p8156
aVActually all countries do, except maybe Norway and a few others.
p8157
aVThe truth is that Scotland actually runs on a surplus, giving more than it gets back.
p8158
aVLondon is the only other region of the UK which also gives more than it gets.
p8159
aVIn case of independance it may change but I don't believe it would, I would rather not get into an independance debate in /r/unitedkindom.
p8160
aVThe point is the government is wanting to move to a more American model of healthcare, one which is clearly shown to be more costly and less efficent. 
p8161
aV[deleted]
p8162
aV&gt; which in my personal view you should\u000a\u000aYeah, same here.
p8163
aVIt's possibly the only way that an independent Scotland would be financially viable in any case.
p8164
aVI don't know how realistic the 90% figure is though.
p8165
aVIs it really the case that 90% of North sea oil in Scotland's waters (as Salmond would suggest)?
p8166
aVIf it is then fair enough, that should be Scotland's.
p8167
aVNot going either side here on the whole independence thing because frankly there are more important issues than subsidies, but Scotland generally pays more tax *in* than it gets out (if I had to take a guess it would be to do with oil).
p8168
aVOn top of that the formula they use to calculate these things don't take into account projects like the Olympics which hugely benefited London but not so much Scotland\u000a\u000ahttp://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/28/would-scotland-be-economically-better-off-it-was-independent\u000a\u000amore neutral article: \u000ahttps://fullfact.org/factchecks/will_an_independent_scotland_be_better_off-28889
p8169
aVThats blatantly untrue, it has just the same problems as the english system, if not more.
p8170
aV[deleted]
p8171
aVFor the most part they are the same system, they share common problems.
p8172
aVHowever, the elephant in the room is that the NHS in England is being privatised, services being sold out to health contractors.
p8173
aVConsidering the complete clusterfuck we have seen of public service contracts being given out to private entities (I'm thinking ATOS and G4S olympics security) how do think this is going to turn out?
p8174
aVScottish parliment has refused calls to privitaise parts of the NHS in Scotland, it is a completly devolved matter.
p8175
aV&gt;  However, the elephant in the room is that the NHS in England is being privatised, services being sold out to health contractors.
p8176
aVThe "business opportunities" involved with outsourcing are essentially being cherry-picked by contractors.
p8177
aVThe contractors rely on there still being an NHS to do the "heavy lifting" (expensive emergency surgery).
p8178
aVOnly if you ignore all the problems that are being created
p8179
aVWould you care to elaborate?
p8180
aVWhat are you slebbering about?
p8181
aVI'm trying to find the article I read about free personal care.
p8182
aVI'm sure I read somewhere that it looks like it is going to have to be scrapped because of the rising costs. 
p8183
aVI think he means that the Scottish are really quite unhealthy regardless of the NHS, which brings down the UK average
p8184
aVI dunno.
p8185
aVI can imagine that deep fried mars bars and heroin probably constitute the highest quality of life imaginable.
p8186
aVI know Scotland are meant to be famous for deep fried Mars bars, but from what I've seen, England eat them just as much.
p8187
aVI've lived in Glasgow all my days and have never seen one.
p8188
aV*Or* anybody else eating one for that matter.
p8189
aVReally?
p8190
aVWhere?
p8191
aVI've only ever seen them available in Whitby in England.
p8192
aVNice to know if I can get one without having to visit Glasgow.
p8193
aVPretty much every chippie van I've seen has them, but those have all been in Hampshire and the East Midlands.
p8194
aVWhere are these chippie vans with deep fried mars bars in Hampshire?
p8195
aVWinchester, Andover, Southampton.
p8196
aVMate just go into a chippy and ask them to batter a mars bar and deep fry it.
p8197
aVI'm far too middle class and terrified to do that.
p8198
aVDeep fried Wild Alaskan Salmon supper.
p8199
aVDo it.
p8200
aVJust once.
p8201
aVYou'll probably not be able to get past two bites, but it is heavenly.
p8202
aVThen feel really bad about yourself as you throw the rest away.
p8203
aVThis post momentarily gave me the most stupidest of thoughts...
p8204
aVIf deep fried Mars bars and heroin are considered Scottish,  would deep fried heroin be the most Scottish of national dishes?
p8205
aVAnd the most moreish.
p8206
aVHeroin is sort of fried.
p8207
aVIf you smoke it on a foil, some of that is definitely some sort of oil because it leaves behind a sticky mess.
p8208
aVAnd injecting users have to heat it up in a spoon.
p8209
aVSo it's already perfectly Scottish as it is pal!
p8210
aVThis is by far the biggest problem in UK healthcare.
p8211
aVThe amount of money, time and effect to be saved if everyone stopped being such a fat bastard is enormous.
p8212
aVI read in the BBC the other day that they want to introduce tomato pills.
p8213
aVJust eat a fucking tomato dickheads! 
p8214
aVIf you spend every day in a hospital you will see that the majority of the patients in there are not fat, they are old.
p8215
aVThin people live longer.
p8216
aVOlder people have more health problems.
p8217
aVOlder people spend more time in hospital.
p8218
aVHospital care is expensive.
p8219
aVFat people die of the same things that older people do (stroke, MI, cancer) but at a younger age, saving us 20 years of caring for them.
p8220
aVTomatoes are expensive.
p8221
aVGranted, the overall health of the nation has some impact, but as per the quoted text: 'The U.S. and U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from **conditions amenable to medical care** than some of the other countries'.
p8222
aVSo I think this is showing what we already know: reform and budget cuts are driving ever increasing efficiency at the expense of point-of-care quality.\u000a
p8223
aVIt's difficult to make any sense of this chart.
p8224
aVFrance scores badly on everything and yet comes top in healthy lives, whereas the UK is completely the opposite.
p8225
aVI can only conclude that the the health of the nation is inversely correlated to the quality of health care. 
p8226
aVThe two things are largely unrelated I think.
p8227
aVI imagine to determine 'healthy lives' they looked at dietary, exercise and sedentary lifestyle type things.
p8228
aVThe healthcare is how good the country is at healing the sick, the healthy lifestyle is how good the country is at not getting sick in the first place?
p8229
aVI don't know.
p8230
aVNo, as it says in my quoted text: 'The U.S. and U.K. had much higher death rates in 2007 from **conditions amenable to medical care** than some of the other countries...'
p8231
aVCultural factors too.
p8232
aV"Don't want to make a fuss" etc.
p8233
aVGiven the way the French drive, drink, smoke and eat I'm sure I don't know either!
p8234
aVFor such an efficient service, the only obvious way to improve outcomes would be to increase funding for additional or expanded services.
p8235
aVFunny how coming out on top in something important like this is sort of ignored compared to if 11 of our men were able to win the world cup.
p8236
aVFunnily enough, England winning the World Cup would increase general feelings of happiness, making people feel more healthy. 
p8237
aVAh, but the longer we stay in the World Cup, the more alcohol-related injuries there will be.
p8238
aVFunny how if we're good at something we'll focus on something else and moan about that instead, although its completely unrelated. 
p8239
aVAs a Canadian I can never understand why people complain so much about the NHS.
p8240
aVEven though healthcare is technically free in Canada the system is much better over here, and I didn't need to worry about figuring out insurance while I waited for it to kick in after I moved here.
p8241
aVAlso, dental care is so much cheaper, which I greatly appreciate.
p8242
aVAgreed.
p8243
aVI like how it also includes prescription medication.
p8244
aVOne of my inhalers cost over $100 in Canada (not that I actually ever paid that much though, with workplace insurance), but here it only costs £8.05 or whatever the flat rate is now.
p8245
aVI just paid for my drugs in Germany myself as I am pushed into the private system there.
p8246
aVCost \u20ac470 for 100 days.
p8247
aVI will have it réfunded but the cost in the UK would be about £34 (if it is still pay per type).
p8248
aVThey complain because The Sun and The Daily Mail have been driving home for years how abysmal the NHS is.
p8249
aVIt isn't.
p8250
aVI really think 'Healthy Lives' and general obesity problems are driven far more from socioeconomic factors than healthcare provision (although there's problem an argument that very good healthcare provision should try and seek out and change these factors, something which the NHS has tried, but is extremely difficult).
p8251
aVTo make a massive generalisation, when I spend time in a wealthier area I see a MUCH higher percentage of people out jogging/exercising.
p8252
aVIt's a marked difference.
p8253
aVI'd wager that gym memberships are more common in wealthier areas.
p8254
aVSimilarly, go to a Waitrose in a wealthy area, and a Tescos in a poorer area and compare what's in peoples trolleys. 
p8255
aVVery sad that people support UKIP when UKIP want to sell the NHS to the highest bidder and let people die in the street whilst they quaff champagne.
p8256
aVUKIP are nothing but sociopaths.
p8257
aV&gt; when UKIP want to sell the NHS to the highest bidder\u000a\u000aSource?\u000a
p8258
aVHis website seems to be down for some reason but Paul Nuttall wrote that he wanted to privatise the NHS on his blog.
p8259
aVThis is a quote:\u000a\u000a&gt;Dear Editor,\u000a\u000a&gt;I would like to congratulate the coalition government for bringing a whiff of privatisation into the beleaguered National Health Service.
p8260
aVThe fact that successive governments have undertaken what they call \u2018substantial\u2019 changes to the NHS should tell us all we need to know: there is something fundamentally wrong with how we treat the ill in our country.
p8261
aV&gt;The NHS is the second biggest employer in the world, beaten only by Walmart, but as with all state monopolies, it is costly, inefficient and stuffed with bureaucrats.
p8262
aVIn New Labour\u2019s NHS, for every nurse there is a manager and vital workers, such as midwives, are falling in numbers.
p8263
aV&gt;The problem, however, goes far deeper.
p8264
aVI would argue that the very existence of the NHS stifles competition, and as competition drives quality and choice, innovation and improvements are restricted.
p8265
aV&gt;Therefore, I believe, as long as the NHS is the \u2018sacred cow\u2019 of British politics, the longer the British people will suffer with a second rate health service.
p8266
aV&gt;Paul Nuttall MEP\u000a\u000ahttp://samedifference1.com/2014/05/18/paul-nuttall-ukip-mep-on-the-nhs/
p8267
aVUKIP members all seem to say different things due to being such a rapidly growing party that maybe lacks a little bit of organisation/consensus on issues not related to the EU or immigration.
p8268
aVIn the case of outsourcing parts of the NHS, I have no doubt /u/SmashUKIP heard that at some point, from a TV interview or whatnot (Or maybe even in their 2010 manifesto, I don't know).
p8269
aVRight or wrong, it's not the official policy of UKIP until we see it on their manifesto (Even if it came from Farage's mouth), so he can't provide a source. 
p8270
aVJust look at the party members and their general ideals.
p8271
aVIt'll come out in the next proper manifesto I'm sure
p8272
aVHoly shit.
p8273
aVI never knew that. 
p8274
aVI voted UKip, will do in the general election.
p8275
aVOur government doesn't want to address immigration.
p8276
aVThe fact that there are huge ghettos of people in the UK where there are a lot of immigrants, but also council houses/estates...
p8277
aVI think is msadness, an that those people shouldn't be in the UK.
p8278
aVOne of the managers in our work however is from South Africa, if his greencard expires or he needs citizenship I'd be the first to sign forms/have an interview to keep him here.
p8279
aVHe is an absolute beast at what he does and his teams sales have gone through the roof.
p8280
aVHe is genuinely a benefit to the country as the majority of ppl here do not have that work ethic/drive.
p8281
aVAnd guess what?
p8282
aVI don't think ppl in the UK should die if they cant afford healthcare.
p8283
aVI just don't want ghettos in the UK, think that poorer European countries in the EU should sort themselves out and it shouldn't be my taxes that do, as they should be spent in the UK.
p8284
aVSo I think we're getting a bad deal and want out of the EU as well.
p8285
aVIt doesn't matter how left or right wing people are, if theres a problem it needs fixing.
p8286
aVGhettos in the UK are a problem to me.
p8287
aVThey exist because our immigration laws are severely inadequate. 
p8288
aVIf someone wants to come live in a ghetto from another country because it's a better way of life for them, I'm all for it.
p8289
aVRisking the chance of the NHS being privatised, and jeapordising my own health is not worth there being less foreign people living in areas of our city that I never even see.
p8290
aVWell, that's where we differ.
p8291
aVI don't want any ghettos in our country at all and believe we should invest heavily in them, ie knocking down older terrace houses and building more modern estates, giving these areas huge facelifts and relocating people towards more middle class areas.
p8292
aVImmigrants shouldn't be confined to ghettos, creating poorer areas and cultural divide across the country.
p8293
aVA lot of people are upset about immigration and feel government isnt tackling it.
p8294
aVSay for example half a million immigrants come over and live in ghetto areas.
p8295
aVThese people are getting a better life for themselves so I don't resent them, everybody does whats best for themselves.
p8296
aVBut I don't want them here in ghetto communities, I think the UK shouldn't have any areas like this and that we should sort out our immigration rules so we only take in skilled people we need, people who won't move to these areas... and then invest heavily in regenerating them.
p8297
aVI'm not alone in thinking this, many millions of people across the country think the same.
p8298
aVWhich is why we vote UKip.
p8299
aVwhat is "Healthy Lives" and why do we suck at it?
p8300
aVToo many fat fucks
p8301
aVlegit.
p8302
aVThis is from the Independent [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html) about the same thing.
p8303
aV&gt;Britain slips up marginally on its \u201ctimeliness of care\u201d and **ranks a shocking second to last for the \u201chealthy lives\u201d indicator, which had looked at life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.
p8304
aV**\u000a\u000aAnd we should be very concerned about it.
p8305
aVsounds slightly like we are just encouraging survival of the fittest to me, it's not like we have a lot of space.
p8306
aVHardly the 'best healthcare system' for people's health which such poor outcomes, is it?
p8307
aVno, but I never said it was.
p8308
aVSorry, I didn't intend to aim that at you personally.
p8309
aVI'm just very frustrated and disappointed with the treatment I've received, I had mistreatment actually make me worse and cause more damage, and not only do people seem willfully blind to the problems but many will also go out of their way to attack anyone who criticises the NHS, no matter how legitimate the criticism.
p8310
aVIt's unsettling, blaming the people that suffer rather than acknowledging there are problems as well as positives.
p8311
aV"We're number one!
p8312
aV*not with healthcare outcomes, but we save so much money!
p8313
aVso efficient, having people die or unable to work"
p8314
aVI come from a family of NHS workers so I understand that the NHS can often be blindly defended from criticism, and it is a very flawed organisation, but it really does excel at some things.
p8315
aVHonestly I feel like the Health Lives statistic is partially low due to many British people's stubbornness and reluctance to seek help for illness until it is too late, but that could also be down to the NHS not prioritising early diagnosis, which puts people off.
p8316
aVYou may have had bad experiences, but there is no way for you to know if your experiences would have been better in a different country.
p8317
aVLast Saturday I had appendicitis, turned up at the hospital at 9 o'clock in the morning in severe pain, they had diagnosed, operated and fed me by \u000a9 o'clock in the evening at which point I went home.
p8318
aVJust in time to do all my exams Monday...
p8319
aVSounds like we have one of the world's most efficient health care systems.
p8320
aVI'm happy your life was saved. 
p8321
aVI have been a patient in Germany and the UK.
p8322
aVI recently discharged myself early from a German hospital who were quite upset with me for doing so even though, medically it would have just been for a follow-up.
p8323
aVAs a private patient (I can't take public insurance), they wanted to keep me for a week longer than a public patient.
p8324
aVI had checked the NHS brochure on care and quoted that back at them.
p8325
aVThe young doctor was annoyed and started telling me how the NHS was killing people with poor care...
p8326
aVI left.
p8327
aVThe German hospital was good and very well equipped.
p8328
aVHowever the German system is disjointed.
p8329
aVIt was up to me to organise follow-up checks and so on as it is all different organisations.
p8330
aVThe NHS collects and builds on the expertise of its staff which increases its efficiency.
p8331
aVIn Germany staff share knowledge, but this is not institutionalised.
p8332
aVFor example, the NHS statistics may indicate that certain treatments are more effective than others but Germany doesn't gather the same data.
p8333
aVThe NHS administration has been in the past exceptionally "lean".
p8334
aVIn Germany, every aspect of looking after a patient must be billed and the insurer must check the bill.
p8335
aVDifferent insurers may have different treatments on their lists.
p8336
aVThe administrative overhead is eventually paid for by the end user.
p8337
aV[deleted]
p8338
aVThe NHS is very poor at treatment continuity I find.
p8339
aVThat is to say, I've never had a single person who appeared to say "Hey, I'm taking on this problem, and I'm with you 'till it's fixed".
p8340
aVHaving sufferred from two chronic conditions in my life, in both cases it was pretty much just a case of "Go here and see this person and try this" or "Wait a bit and see if it improves" - so I think you've got a point, for long term issues the NHS can be pretty poo.
p8341
aV[deleted]
p8342
aVYeah,the NHS is top of the line if you've got something straight forward or short term.
p8343
aVWhile I've found them more than willing to do very expensive referrals for things, the problem can be that if no-one fixes your problem there's not someone in the picture who says "Hold on a minute, no-one fixed this, what are we going to do for this guy?".
p8344
aVInstead the final person in the chain inevitably says "See how it is and come back in 3/6 months" and that's basically them saying "Can't fix it, see ya".
p8345
aVNot where i fucking live.
p8346
aVAnd there is the US, 11th in cost-related problems.
p8347
aVi don't understand this ranking in light of the fact that the uk has the lowest survival rate for many diseases, but particularly cancer, in western europe and that the u.s. has the highest survival rate.
p8348
aVi would have thought that that would have been reflected in the 'effective care' column.
p8349
aVfrom the NHS website\u000a["Researchers say the main reason for low survival rates in the UK seems to be delayed diagnosis, underuse of successful treatments and unequal access to treatment, particularly among elderly people.
p8350
aV"](http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/12December/Pages/UK-cancer-survival-rates-below-European-average.aspx)\u000a\u000afrom the BBC onsurvival rates\u000a["There were also large regional variations within the UK, which were linked to differences in access to care and ability of patients to navigate the local health services.
p8351
aVBoth are directly linked to deprivation.
p8352
aV"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7510121.stm )
p8353
aVCancer is a funny one, because the usual stat which is reported - 5 year survival rate - depends in an obvious way on when the cancer was diagnosed.
p8354
aVSuppose we have a cancer which automatically kills you after six years, and we can diagnose it immediately.
p8355
aV100% of people survive 5 years, so our healthcare system looks really good.
p8356
aVBut then someone in the NHS goes 'You know what, this test we're doing to screen for this cancer isn't actually adding any healthcare; people are still dying six years after catching the disease, we're just diagnosing it earlier'.
p8357
aVSo the NHS switches to a cheaper test which only catches the cancer two years after it appears.
p8358
aVNow our five-year survival rate is 0%, but everyone is exactly as healthy as before.
p8359
aVThis is what happens in real life; the Yanks spend a lot of money on fancy diagnostic equipment that catches cancers earlier and earlier, and this leads their five- and ten- years rates to be much better than ours.
p8360
aVBut the average age of death for most cancers is statistically indistinguishable between the US and the UK, suggesting our care is about equivalent.
p8361
aVIt's just another example of the confusing world of hospital statistics
p8362
aVThe problem with your vignette is that treatment will tend to be more effective at earlier stages of cancer.
p8363
aVIn fact you didn't mention it at all, which seems a little odd.
p8364
aVWhile there may be some statistical artefact to the overall survival rate, I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that it explains it entirely.
p8365
aVAlso:\u000a\u000a&gt;  But the average age of death for most cancers is statistically indistinguishable between the US and the UK\u000a\u000adoes not imply that the care is the same quality.
p8366
aVTo go for another toy example, in the UK I have 10 people who die at age 70 from stomach cancer.
p8367
aVIn the US I have 10 people diagnosed with stomach cancer, of whom 5 die age 70, and the other five die later from *something else*.
p8368
aVClearly the care is better in the US, but the mean age at death is the same because you are ignoring the fact that people survive to die from another cause.  
p8369
aVYour first point is very valid; I only didn't mention it because it won't relevant to the point I was trying to sketch out in the toy example.
p8370
aVIn reality, if treating early makes a difference it would show up in both the survival AND mortality rates.
p8371
aVIf we see a difference between the survival rates but not the mortality rates for two countries, we can conclude treating early makes no difference to age of death, and we shouldn't pay for earlier diagnosis.
p8372
aVYour second point is also quite interesting; in the UK we typically under-treat prostate cancer compared to the US.
p8373
aVThis is because prostate cancer is slow-growing and most people will die of something else before they die of prostate cancer.
p8374
aVIn the US, prostate cancer is aggressively screened for and treated with chemo.
p8375
aVThis means that in the UK, slightly more people die of prostate cancer than in the US (23.7 per 100,000 compared to 23.0 in America), but almost none of those 23.7 people will have had debilitating chemotherapy, and so will go on to live longer on average.
p8376
aVBasically, the UK system always tries to maximise the number of healthy life-years people live, even if that means doing odd things like deliberately setting up the population to die of prostate cancer more often.
p8377
aVThe US system competes in a much shorter time frame, so the 'appearance' of good medicine is more important (for example aggressively treating everything that might be a cancer, including benign lumps).
p8378
aVSo I don't disagree with you - standardised mortality rates aren't everything - but don't be fooled into thinking they tell you nothing either.
p8379
aV&gt; Basically, the UK system always tries to maximise the number of healthy life-years people live, even if that means doing odd things like deliberately setting up the population to die of prostate cancer more often.
p8380
aVI would like to read more about this sort of thing.
p8381
aVDo you have any references - books, articles, etc - that you could point me to?
p8382
aVIt's a bit dry, but this is what a QALY is and how it is calculated:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/features/measuringeffectivenessandcosteffectivenesstheqaly.jsp\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I don't know any centralised reference for the weird effects which this construct generates, but there are a lot of philosophical papers on the implications with regards to (for example) disability and age discrimination.
p8383
aVExcellent comment, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNiORew3uRY) a video.
p8384
aVThe *big* problem with the NHS, in my experience is that you really have to be proactive in pushing your treatment forward, you often have to ask to be referred, follow up on tests/scans etc and make sure that you don't get lost in the system.
p8385
aVIf you're paying for your healthcare you do this automatically because you're a customer, so you expect what you pay for, in the NHS its easy to assume that the system will just guide you through, unfortunately, it generally will not.
p8386
aVFor example, you have abdomen pain, you go to your GP, he prescribes you painkillers and refers you for an ultrasound, it comes back clear, well at that point you could just leave it, and many people do, but actually you need to go back to your GP and be like 'hey!
p8387
aVWTF is with this pain?
p8388
aVYou need to refer me so I can get this shit sorted!'.
p8389
aVIf you do that he'll probably refer you to a specialist, but if you leave it as 'meh, scan was clear, I'm happy' he'll probably just carry on prescribing painkillers.
p8390
aVI think this is how a lot of people slip through the net.
p8391
aVCouple that with the good old British 'stiff-upper-lippedness' that means we don't even go to the doctor until we're doubled over in pain, means things don't get diagnosed and treated as soon as other countries. 
p8392
aVI had a problem like this with my wrist.
p8393
aVIt's been really sore at the joint for about 5-6 years, and every time I saw a GP or went to a clinic I was told to rub some joint cream on it, and try not to move it.
p8394
aVI finally had enough last year and went for a private consultation, and after a single 30 minute session I now knew there was genuinely something wrong with it.
p8395
aVSince *then* the NHS service has been outstanding, but trying to get through to people was the biggest hurdle.
p8396
aVYeah, basically you need to be really brutal with the doctors and just be like..\u000a\u000a'look!
p8397
aVThis has been going on for 5 years, you've given me cream and told me to rest it before, and it hasn't improved.
p8398
aVPlease can you refer me to a specialist now as this is a serious problem for me, and I need for it to be treated!
p8399
aVEverything you've advised me to do, hasn't worked!
p8400
aV'
aVThere's obviously far more to healthcare than cancer treatment.
p8401
aVIt makes me so thankful to live in the UK.
p8402
aVMy husband and I realised the other day as we were watching Breaking Bad that we were less traumatised by the gangs and violence, but more the insane hospital bills.
p8403
aVIn the last year...\u000a\u000a- I was in a car crash, X-rays, A&amp;E, ambulance, everything.
p8404
aVLuckily the insurers paid for physio but my GP also offered it, with a 3 week waiting list on average.
p8405
aV- I've also had to seek psychological help for an issue that was affecting me, went to GP on 10 May, assessment was end of May, first weekly session of cognitive behaviour therapy starts next week.
p8406
aVPretty impressed by that.
p8407
aV- had an issue with putting on weight and a few lady issues.
p8408
aVBlood tests/gynocologist visit and got it sorted.
p8409
aV3 week waiting list to be seen.
p8410
aVIf I'd have had that year in America I reckon I'd be around $40,000 worse off.
p8411
aVYou would be a lot worse off then $40,000.
p8412
aVUK is #1 bitches!
p8413
aVMost efficient and effective healthcare service in the world! 
p8414
aVNow let's not fall prey to arrogance.
p8415
aVGlory To the NHS!
p8416
aVGlory to the Queen!
p8417
aVGlory to our empire!
p8418
aV!
aVBut last in dentistry
p8419
aVThere's absolutely nothing wrong with UK Dentistry or the teeth of the population.
p8420
aVYou're confusing healthy teeth/gums with the vanity of perfectly straight teeth Americans are obsessed with.
p8421
aVAnd oh look how much that costs you, I wonder if the social pressure for it was started by a private dentist!?
p8422
aV&lt;\u005csarcasm&gt;
p8423
aVI'd say there is something wrong with dentistry here; the cost.
p8424
aVI don't have to pay to see my doctor, but yet I do to see my dentist.
p8425
aVThe NHS isn't so good at providing dentistry though.
p8426
aVGetting on the books of an NHS dentist is a lot easier than it used to be (we tried 10 years ago, gave up and went private) but it isn't universal.
p8427
aVSomething to do with crap conditions being imposed on dentists, leading to them deciding to just take private work instead.
p8428
aVThankfully private dentists and insurance aren't totally unaffordable. 
p8429
aVActually Britain is a middle-ranker when it comes to dentistry, and we have good records when it comes to things like tooth cavities and extractions.
p8430
aVIn this respect, the Guinness Book does not constitute as a 'good record'
p8431
aVThe table I saw was published in the Guardian, and wasn't just some random poll but the results of a proper, funded study by a major organisation.
p8432
aVFor example I remember that we had some of the fewest cavities in the EU. 
p8433
aVSome stereotypes we're stuck with :(
p8434
aVI think part of that is due to America being obsessed with completely straight white teeth.
p8435
aVI'm sure it's not actually good for your teeth to be completely white.
p8436
aVSomething about enamel being stripped back too far.
p8437
aVThe amount of whitening strips some of my american friends use is scary, its an obsession. 
p8438
aVThey're going to see the downsides of it in years to come.
p8439
aVWe have the best healthcare system in the world because we have the worst health in the world (nearly).
p8440
aVThat actually makes perfect sense.
p8441
aVPractice makes perfect
p8442
aV/r/britishsuccess
p8443
aVOf all the things to be number one, I'm so glad it's this.
p8444
aVThe NHS is incredible.
p8445
aVI've heard a lot of horror stories about the NHS, and so I dreaded having to go into hospital when I cut my finger open with a bread knife, severing the tendon.
p8446
aVBut yeah, I had surgery done the next day and was out the day after, and I was booked in for physiotherapy the next week.
p8447
aVOnly problem was the godawful hospital food.
p8448
aVFuck yeah!
p8449
aVUK FTW!
p8450
aVWhat does someone have to do to immigrate to the UK?
p8451
aVHave very valuable skills or be offered a highly paid job in the UK by an employer who can't find your skills within the UK population.
p8452
aVOr be an EU citizen.
p8453
aVRight now, if you're not an EU citizen, you're basically screwed.
p8454
aVWe're hardly letting anyone in.
p8455
aVAnd Australia is only going to keep slipping if Abbot keeps cutting the funding. 
p8456
aVThreads like this make me feel like I'm living in a different country.
p8457
aVOr me, my family and friends are doing something awfully wrong.
p8458
aVIt can't just be the area either, I've had treatment from London right up to Edinburgh.
p8459
aVTimes I've had to wait 4 hours(the legal maximum) just to be admitted then discharged so I can wait another two hours.
p8460
aVSome of my friends have lost limbs to botched operations(MRSA).
p8461
aVOthers have had to wait over a year to get things seen.
p8462
aVI have two members of my family that have worked for the NHS all their life(a GP and a surgeon).
p8463
aVOne believes that the NHS should be "humanely euthanized" the other is quitting due to the horrific treatment they get by the NHS as an employer.
p8464
aVI just don't understand why myself and everyone close to me is trapped in some bizzaro world where we get such bad treatment.
p8465
aVReally just how bad is it everywhere else in the world for this to be the best?
p8466
aVThe only way for me to see my GP is to mass dial at 8 in the morning.
p8467
aVAfter about 30-40 minutes I might be lucky and I'll get an appointment for that day only.
p8468
aVIf my doctor isn't in that day or they're full?
p8469
aVTough luck.
p8470
aVTry going through that every day when you've had a stroke.
p8471
aVIt's insane.
p8472
aVThis rings a lot more true to what myself and my family have experienced;\u000a\u000ahttp://news.sky.com/story/1237471/do-not-get-sick-top-doctor-warns-patients\u000a\u000aSorry if this is a bit of a rant but as you can imagine after all the needless suffering reports like this are extremely depressing and confusing.
p8473
aVIt's not just you.
p8474
aVI had to leave the country because of the mistreatment I received from the NHS.
p8475
aVI'm not going to go into details because people start trying to justify it, when I'm the one who suffered and is suffering, and it's not good for my mental health at the moment to discuss it with strangers who don't know me and will insult me for questioning the NHS.
p8476
aVThings are much better for me now in Australia, but I will have to live with the consequences of what was done to me for the rest of my life.
p8477
aVThe "healthy lives" measure in this report, where the UK comes second last, that measures things like death rates from treatable medical conditions and life expectancies.
p8478
aVWhat this report says is that the UK is the most 'efficient' and cheapest, not that it provides the best healthcare.
p8479
aVThe NHS is horrific, for patients, things are better in most other developed countries.
p8480
aVI'm sorry you have to go through this, you are not imagining things.
p8481
aVI will fight for the rest of my life to save the NHS.
p8482
aVI used to coach soccer in the USA during my summers.
p8483
aVGot the flu once and got one IV to rehydrate.
p8484
aVCost me over £1,000.
p8485
aVDestroyed my knees and have multiple surgeries.. Free.
p8486
aVI'm not chained to a life of Debt and I can actually give back to society  \u000a\u000a
p8487
aVYou realise you can have a really good system that has both public and private facets, right?
p8488
aVThe US isn't the norm in private health care.
p8489
aVOF course.
p8490
aVMy family actually use BUPA in the UK which is private.
p8491
aVI just think that healthcare and education are the two founding staples of soceity.
p8492
aVBoth should be free.
p8493
aVThough I'm delighted to see the NHS come out so well, and I am very glad to live in country that has it, I wonder if the changes that made it move from 3rd to 1st were really just changes that allow it to do well in these sorts of surveys.
p8494
aVIt seems to me that the recent NHS changes have been driven by cost/benefit analysis.
p8495
aVInstead of trying to be perfect for everyone (which was the unwritten goal before), treatments are allocated by its cost, the number of people it serves and (I hate to say it) how "important" those people are to society.
p8496
aVI honestly believe there is eg systemic ageism in the NHS, where the elderly who provide less economic benefit, are ranked below younger people who are (or will soon be) employed and tax-paying.
p8497
aVI am sure it isn't deliberate, but is rather emergent behaviour from the way NHS resource decision making is set up.
p8498
aVSo the end result is that more people see cheaper treatment and the cost to GDP is lower (not necessarily a bad thing at all).
p8499
aVErgo we do well in the surveys.
p8500
aVGenuine question.
p8501
aVWhat would be average cost of this set of procedures if they were done in US ?
p8502
aV:   UK- 5 visits to general doctor, x-ray, MRI scan, 2 orthopedist consultations,1 day in hospital, 5 days phsiotherapy, 20 TABLETS CODEINE, Artrhroscopy, 4 weeks off work, fully paid (this actually varies per employer but it usually being refunded by NHS to some point) ?
p8503
aVUK- 0.00£
p8504
aVAmerican here.
p8505
aVHard to answer simply.
p8506
aVIf one had good insurance, was employed by a decent company with good benefits and went to doctors "in network" for the insurer, the out of pocket costs for what you describe might be only a few hundred dollars ($20 per visit co-pay for the consultations and physio sessions, probably full coverage for the hospital and surgery and a small co-pay for the drugs).
p8507
aVAs for sick leave, if you were with an employer with good benefits, you'd probably be placed on short-term disability (covered by separate insurance) and receive 60-80% of your salary.
p8508
aVHowever, if one had shitty or no insurance and worked for a company with no or shoddy benefits, it could *easily* run $25,000 to $50,000 with no paid time off (except perhaps state short-term disability payments--NY provides around $170 per week).

aVOne thing that always concerns me about our great healthcare is whether or not it would be possible to apply it universally.
p8526
aVAs in, if the US adopted an identical service tomorrow, would we all be able to support it or would the medical industry collapse from the strain of selling only to governments at a fair rate?
p8527
aVIs universal healthcare something we can feasibly apply everywhere or can in only exist in a stratified world market where our care comes at the cost of other people on the other side of the world?

aVDo try to keep up.
p8555
aVThis measures peoples opinions, not actual performance of the NHS.
p8556
aVIt further explains possible reasons that opinions might have changed so drastically.
p8557
aVIt even argues against the point you are trying to make:\u000a\u000a"Interestingly, other recent surveys (Care Quality Commission, 2012a, 2012b; Department of Health, 2012b) have not recorded a decline in the public's actual experience of the NHS.
p8558
aVKey performance data collected on waiting times and  health care-related infections have also generally been good (Appleby et al., 2012).
p8559
aV"
aVYes, the nhs is good in spite of the current government, not because of it.
p8560
aVOne day you might take the blinkers off, listen, absorb  and see the world beyond your own mind.\u000a
p8561
aVI wish you could see the irony of your statement.
p8562
aVI did in fact "take my blinkers off" and actually read the source you posted claiming that the figures are not good, only to find out that it was an opinion poll, which is what my comment was pointing out.
p8563
aVI have no idealogical view in regards to how the NHS is run, unlike others who believe that it being fully state run is the only answer.
p8564
aVI just want the best results, if it turns out that private tenders can improve results, then we should use them where appropriate as long as it stays free at the point of use.
p8565
aVThe reality is that the NHS is creaking and will struggle despite what any government is able to do, due to medical  inflation being higher than we can afford to currently spend/ increase spending and a massively ageing population.
p8566
aVIf we are to be realistic and overcome this, we need to admit a few things, firstly the NHS will need to change drastically to cope in the future.
p8567
aVPersonally, my opinion is that technology will be the driving force of efficiencies needed and the private sector generally has a better track record of bringing in technology to drive efficiency and improve results.
p8568
aVThe second is that in the short term at least it will either need more money or people will have to go without.
p8569
aVWe can either continue ploughing money into it like Labour did and continually increase taxes until we are bankrupt and have no NHS or we look to Europe and other developed nations and try and find other solutions that work. 
p8570
aV....anyway, back to the conversation about mismanagement...

aVThey literally used google.

p8627
aVYes, we knew that already.

aVThere are a couple of similar stories; all in all, they don't seem to take you seriously unless your leg is cut off or something.
p8629
aVEDIT: good job downvoting the facts.
p8630
aVPerhaps a little less hive mind and a little more attention to the rediquette would help.

aVIt really makes me sad that it's not only conservatives who are reacting in a hostile way and a knee jerk manner when something they don't like comes up.
p8632
aVI'm not proud of you.
p8633
aVGPs sometimes aren't brilliant with ears, however saying "it's fine from the outside" *is* the correct thing to say in the case of an earache.
p8634
aVYou really can't get inflammation of the inner ear and if there was an infection there it wouldn't hurt - it would send you deaf and the room would be spinning.
p8635
aVIn terms of pain it's usually the middle ear cavity building up with fluid that causes the problem and this will show as a distended eardrum when viewed from the outside.
p8636
aVIf there's an earache coupled with no change in hearing and an outer ear that looks okay, it's sometimes not the ear that's the problem at all.
p8637
aVIt's very often [referred pain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otalgia).

p8654
aVHow did it take 4 months to see a GP?
p8655
aVShe was registered for a GP.
p8656
aVThe first appointment she got was for a nurse -in 2 weeks time.
p8657
aVThen two weeks for the antibiotics, which did not help.
p8658
aVThen another 1 week before allowed to talk to a different nurse, who sent her to the ear specialists -in two months' time.
p8659
aVThen back to GP, another month or so.
p8660
aVThis all in London.
p8661
aVYeah unfortunately London is bad for that sort of thing - they're very under-resourced.
p8662
aVUnless you can make an appointment at short notice or go to a sit and wait clinic it can be difficult.
p8663
aVThough if you try and make clear that she's in significant pain they should have been able to get an appointment sooner, seems pretty bad to me that they wouldn't see her for two weeks if she had bad earache.
p8664
aVYup.
p8665
aVI'm just curious about the furry of downvotes for conveying a story that shows a less-than-stellar performance. \u000a

aVOh this place (and I say that as someone who regards themselves as somewhat centre left) can be a left-wing circlejerk.

aVAnything which even slightly deviates from a pro-NHS point of view is liable to be downvoted by a certain type of redditor.

p8674
aVDo you have a GP or are you registered with a surgery?
p8675
aVBecause if you are then you should go there first.
p8676
aVThen you have to battle to get an appointment but it is usually less than 4 months.
p8677
aVA + E is for big injuries so breaks lacerations that need urgent care.

aVShe went to the emergency because the doctor's appointment was really, really far away and she was in pain.
p8680
aVAh, most GP's are moving to on the day appointments now.
p8681
aVAlthough if you don't want to sit through A+E waits most pharmacists now will deal with stuff like that.
p8682
aVYou mean pharmacists can diagnose and treat inner ear problems?
p8683
aVNext time I guess I'll go to the barber if I need my tooth to be looked at.
p8684
aV(Sorry for the hostile tone; I got a bit pissed off with the reactions here.
p8685
aV)
aVThey can diagnose some things, and supply antibiotics.
p8686
aVThis is so wrong on so many level, I cannot even start addressing it.
p8687
aVWe are talking about an inner ear issue, which needs a specialist DOCTOR (not even a GP, but someone who studied all of his/her life to diagnose ear issues), not a nurse with google or a pharmacist.
p8688
aVNot to mention the issue with antibiotics... they are not vitamin C. They should be only used when needed, and not on the discretion of a nurse of pharmacist.
p8689
aVToo many multidrug resistant bugs are running around already.
p8690
aVAre antibiotics proscription now?
p8691
aVAlso a GP would know what is wrong in a general way and who to refer it to, that's the whole point of them. 
p8692
aVA&amp;E for earache?
p8693
aV!
aVYeah, no wonder they just told her to go away.
p8694
aVThat's what your GP is for.
p8695
aVYou know, perhaps your condescending attitude would go better if you weren't such an ignorant prick.
p8696
aVSince her appointment was in the next month and she was in insane pain, she went to the emergency.
p8697
aVI'm so relieved I have some idiots online telling me things without knowing what happened, though. 
p8698
aVPeople are only going off information that you yourself have provided.
p8699
aV---\u000a\u000aOut of interest, which GP surgery took a month to get an appointment?
p8700
aV(feel free to name &amp; shame them)\u000a\u000a...was it a month?
p8701
aVor was it four months as you'd said previously?
p8702
aVYou also said that prior to seeing a doctor she'd only been seen by nurses and that they'd prescribed antibiotics.
p8703
aVNurses can't prescribe *any* drugs, even asprin.
p8704
aVSo that doesn't make much sense either.
p8705

p8737
aVThe first time I got a GP appointment within less than a week.
p8738
aVMy GP thought it was full of wax, syringed it out then and there, found an ear infection behind the wax, and prescribed me some type of topical antibiotic which cleared it up in no time.
p8739
aVThe second time, I got an appointment with the practice nurse in less than a  week.
p8740
aVWas told to put olive oil in for ten days or so and come back.
p8741
aVEar syringed and a foreign object revealed, which the practice nurse removed with tweezers.
p8742
aVThe only issue is that ear problems aren't usually considered an emergency and so in our practice we need to wait for about a week for an appointment.
p8743
aVThis was a problem for my wife when she developed earache just before we were due to go on holiday.
p8744

aVThis is a fact .. statistics 101.
p8762
aVI have used the NHS extensively and it's been great.
p8763
aVThis means it's the best healthcare system in the world.
p8764
aVNo wait, that's not how how it works in the real world.
p8765
aVYour anecdote means nothing, mine means nothing.
p8766
aVThe data means everything. \u000a
p8767
aVRiiiight.
p8768
aVI know there is google in Norfolk; I lived there, so I'm not sure why you can't do a simple google search.
p8769
aVThe first couple of hits will give you enough statistics which support my experience and not yours.
p8770
aVHow about that?
p8771
aVAnecdotal evidence supported by cold hard statistics?
p8772
aVI should think it's good enough for Norfolk.

aVThere's even a wikipage!

aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_National_Health_Service\u000a\u000aAnyway, I had enough trying to reason with ostentatious trolls.
p8776
aVHave a good day, chum.
p8777
aVYou have moved the goal posts, my original point still stands.
p8778
aVYour anecdote means nothing.
p8779
aVNow your actually making a valid point .
p8780
aVAnd your miss using the word "troll", chum. 
p8781
aVAh yes.
p8782
aVI always wonder about these stats.
p8783
aV2-3 weeks to see a GP, six months to see a specialist, terrible cancer care.. Botched operations left right and centre.
p8784
aVMid staffs, fiddling of stats , 5th biggest employer in the world, hospitals going bust because of PFI with up to 10% if the NHS budget hidden in PFI as well.
p8785
aVI don't get it.
p8786
aVClearly you're all using a different NHS to me.
p8787
aVEdit.
p8788
aVThe NHS is shit.
p8789
aVIt's the laughing stock of Europe. 
p8790
aVOr the media is just cherry picking the horror stories...
p8791
aVClearly I am, I phone up in the morning and get an afternoon appointment.
p8792
aV10 minutes to see a GP, a few weeks to see a specialist, and cancer care that was good enough to save my aunt.
p8793
aVClearly, you must be using a different NHS.
p8794
aVOr perhaps you'll acknowledge that provision is poor in some locations, and that's an issue that should be tackled, while not branding the rest of the NHS as being as poor as them?
p8795
aVThe problem is nobody allows us to talk about being treated badly, so that it can be acknowledged that provision is poor in some locations.
p8796
aVWe're just shouted down for daring the question the NHS.
p8797
aVWhy are you branding the entire NHS to be as good only by the standards of where it provides the best care?
p8798
aVAre the rest of us not important?
p8799
aVWho is waiting 2-3 weeks to see a GP?
p8800
aVAnd 6 months to see a specialist?
p8801
aVI've had to wait 3 months to see a GI specialist but now it's happened the ball is rolling very quickly especially since it's not a urgent issue.
p8802
aVAnd that is why we better privatise it.
p8803
aVWho wants to be the best when you can have average and a bunch of richer rich people.
p8804
aVBeing honest, the NHS won't be here much longer.
p8805
aVThe government simply can't afford to keep putting money in with out anything coming out.
p8806
aVThe amount of people coming to England only for the health care is massive and it's only getting bigger. 
p8807
aVDoesn't our national insurance cover this?
p8808
aVThe only thing we can really take from this is that the UK healthcare is cheap.
p8809
aVHuh?
p8810
aVWe came first on nearly every single criteria.
p8811
aVTake a look at the chart.
p8812
aVThe "healthy lives" criteria is the one that measures life expectancy and death rates from conditions treatable with medical care.
p8813
aVWe come second last.
p8814
aVOnly the US is worse and many people there can't access healthcare at all.
p8815
aVWhat does that say about the quality of healthcare provided?
p8816
aVI know Australia is just as obese, and has equivalent problems with binge drinking, smoking and lack of exercise - yet Australia comes fourth in the "healthy living" criteria.
p8817
aVThe other criteria mostly measure forms of 'efficiency' and cost.
p8818
aVThis report tells us that the NHS is great with costs, but not great with healthcare outcomes.
p8819
aVVery vague criteria though.
p8820
aVHow does one judge "quality of care" in a way that allows comparison between countries?
p8821
aVThe article seems to say that the US suffers because so many people are uninsured or that not every person has their own doctor - but those aren't inherently bad things.
p8822
aVThat's why the only result I trust is the cold hard number for how much it costs.
p8823
aVYou don't believe that a high percentage of the population in the US having no access to healthcare is an inherently bad thing? 
p8824
aVThis is just the headline chart from a [thirty two page report](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2014/jun/1755_davis_mirror_mirror_2014.pdf) (PDF link) with fully referenced methodology.
p8825
aVEach of the indicators is the synthesis of a number of clearly phrased questions or metrics.
p8826
aVYou could argue about the methodology, but the criteria are not especially vague.

aVThose figures are from 2004 - ten years ago.
p8830
aVFrom the Washington Post article\u000a\u000a&gt;In 2004, the U.K. ranked third of the five nations studied.
p8831
aVThe U.K. diagnosed its health care system\u2019s problems and addressed them, Davis said.
p8832
aV\u201cThey really have moved up over time.
p8833
aVA lot of it has been systematic attention to increasing resources in the system,\u201d \u000a\u000aFrom the Daily Mail article:\u000a\u000a&gt;The latest figures are not yet available although Professor  Jarman suspects death rates in England have fallen because care has substantially improved.
p8834
aVSo yeah, looks like we've improved dramatically over the last ten years
p8835
aV10 years is a long time, and the Daily Mail is the worst place for a balanced, non reactionary view. 
p8836
aVAlso the proprietors of the Daily Mail are very keen on seeing the dismantling of the NHS, hence the constant litany of NHS related bullshit it vomits.
p8837

aVMissing step in each one: frequent camera cutaways to privileged uni students gawking at the proles before them.
p8839
aVBeing a typical student, I got front row of the Jezza K show.
p8840
aVHe spoke to me, and said I was a lazy student.
p8841
aVI said he was my inspiration.
p8842
aVHe gave me the finger.
p8843
aVBest moment of my life.
p8844
aVWell worth the £30k student debt.
p8845
aVI also had a decent shot of me behind him gawking at the proles before me.
p8846
aVI so want this to be true
p8847
aVMay actually be true my girlfriend went with a load of mates and he went through a load of questions getting people to sit down if it didn't apply to them the last question was "Who here had sex this morning?
p8848
aV"\u000a\u000aGirlfriend was the only one standing up so he berated her with questions about sexual positions and protection and my proficiency in the bedroom.
p8849
aV[deleted]
p8850
aVAlong with a gambling and drink scandal. 
p8851
aVHe should go on Jeremy Kyle.
p8852
aVProbably is.
p8853
aVMy mates went and they had a chat with him.
p8854
aVIt seems like a recurring theme that he pokes fun at students.
p8855
aV[deleted]
p8856
aVHe does, I believe, have a degree in sociology from the University of Sussex
p8857
aVAh, the more you know. 
p8858
aVdat username
p8859
aVprobably checks out #brokenbritain
p8860
aVI think it is a reference to this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGJxxEr1aCM
p8861
aVGood comeback.
p8862
aVCan confirm.
p8863
aVSource: Privileged Uni student who got offered Jezza tickets but had course work due for 9am next day that I had not finished so had to decline :(.
p8864
aVYou've got a little something just ... there
p8865
aVYeah, I always find it really hypocritical when Jeremy Kyle starts having a go at chavs for drug use in front of an audience of students, most of whom buy and use drugs from chavs almost as frequently.
p8866
aVThe only difference being that the chavs on stage are using 'the tax payers' money' to pay for it, whereas those in the audience are just using their parents' money or their Uni grants - which is actually tax payers' money - to pay for it.
p8867
aVEdit: Am I the only person whose friends received grants?
p8868
aVNo, they aren't from the 1970s, I went to Uni in 2009 and many of my friends were given maintenance GRANTS (completely separate from their loans).
p8869
aVThey're based on how much money your parents make.
p8870
aVHeck, I could even have applied for one, but would have only worked out at about £80 a semester.
p8871
aVSome of my mates got the full 3k, ON TOP of their loans.
p8872
aVSurely I'm not the only person this has happened to?
p8873
aVThat's a little harsh, I'm sure some of the students work to pay for their drugs themselves :P \u000a\u000aSeriously though, the majority of the audience will be younger people (probably university students) who are able to go to a TV recording in the middle of the day for a few hours. 
p8874
aV[deleted]
p8875
aVDid she try to put some deep religious notion behind it, like teaching you to be tolerant or compassionate? \u000a\u000a 
p8876
aVMy RE teacher taught us how he was abused by his father as part of sex ed.
p8877
aVI'm not sure which is worse. 
p8878
aVI wouldn't say "most of", none of my uni friends take drugs.
p8879
aVReally?
p8880
aVI'd probably say at least 1/3 or 1/4 of my friends were frequent users of either weed, MDMA or sometimes coke. 
p8881
aVthey can afford coke?
p8882
aV!
aVCornwall has some of the cheapest drug prices in the country apparently, because it all gets smuggled in through Newlin and Penzance.
p8883
aVBasically they were buying it wholesale haha
p8884
aVit's still coke, even if you got it from costco
p8885
aVWell played
p8886
aVtoplad
p8887
aVFair point.
p8888
aVTalking from my own experiences of being a stoned student and watching Jeremy Kyle every day for three years, and my criticism is directed towards the hypocrisy of the show, not it's student audience
p8889
aVAlso it bothers me that you called them "grants" 
p8890
aVThat's what they're called
p8891
aVAre you redditing from the 80s through a time portal connected to a BBC Micro?
p8892
aVNo just you know... the present day with my laptop
p8893
aVThey are loans, not grants 
p8894
aVSome of us for grants as well as the loan. 
p8895
aVAnd bursaries and scholarships.
p8896
aVPotato, potato.
p8897
aVEverybody is entitled to a grant, which is means tested via your household income.\u000a
p8898
aVA grant doesn't put you in debt
p8899
aVgenerational thing I think.
p8900
aVMy generation (current) had to pay lots for uni so are a bit more careful.
p8901
aVI DJ at a lot of student events and have done for over a decade, and went to uni 96-99; the idea that modern students or more careful than previous generations is laughable.
p8902
aVIf anything, the whole getting shitfaced culture is worse than before because of relaxed licensing rules, when I was at uni clubs all kicked out at 2am.
p8903
aVmaybe I assumed I am typical.
p8904
aVguess not.
p8905
aVProbably depends on the uni.
p8906
aVI know of some where people were pretty reserved and others (like mine) where most people couldn't stand upright.
p8907
aVNot many drugs, though.
p8908
aVIn halls I lived opposite a guy who liked a bit of weed every now and then, but he was the only one I am aware of in a building of more than a hundred students.
p8909
aVAnd this is exactly why people put so much stock in anecdotal evidence despite the fact that it is not useful.
p8910
aVYou are utterly average.
p8911
aVCongrats. 
p8912
aVand you are below average.
p8913
aVI'm top of the bell-curve, bitch. 
p8914
aVsure you are: top of the bell curve of "amount of clothes bought at the toilet store"
p8915
aVYou're above average in the number of penises you've touched. 
p8916
aVEveryone loves Ket up north. 
p8917
aVYeah, from school to uni in Newcastle.
p8918
aVAtleast it isnt meth
p8919
aVWe all know that's complete horse shit don't we.
p8920
aVthanks for the insightful input.
p8921
aVYou don't pay for uni out of your student loan, so you wouldn't have to be careful with the money
p8922
aVYou guys are missing out
p8923
aVI'm sorry.
p8924
aVYou may be surprised.
p8925
aVObviously I don't know your friends but a surprisingly high amount of my friends do and I had no idea.
p8926
aVUnfortunately 'zero' isn't a useful statistical sample size ;)
p8927
aVThe drugs around where I live are crap apparently so I don't think anyone in the uni bothers with much beyond weed. 
p8928
aVI'm meant to be going to Aber for uni in September...might have to change that now
p8929
aVIf your choice of uni is based on drug availability, maybe higher education, and indeed Aberystwyth generally (it is a relatively sedate and peaceful place, and lovely in my opinion) aren't for you.
p8930
aVThat said, surrounded by agriculture as we are, I've heard there are good mycology prospects at the right time of year.
p8931
aVhehehe, **high**er education
p8932
aVDon't worry, I barely even like alcohol, I'm certainly not into drugs of any kind
p8933
aVAnd isn't it great that alcohol isn't a drug?
p8934
aVThat's what you think now, I go to Bangor and I had never been drunk before uni but the first night of freshers week... oh man.
p8935
aVOn Halloween I may have sampled some other exotic burning materials as well.
p8936
aVwow you so cool
p8937
aVI'm just warning people that may never have touched alcohol before that uni may be a different experience to what they thought.
p8938
aVi was alluding to your consumption of 'exotic burning materials'.
p8939
aVyour at least 18 ffs, just call it weed.
p8940
aVI went through 3 years of university without getting drunk, despite several of my new friends claiming that they'd do it.
p8941
aVThey didn't.
p8942
aVSame for two years of college.
p8943
aVStill mostly teetotal.
p8944
aVWhy can I ask?
p8945
aVIt's just beer and wine I don't like.
p8946
aVI mostly stick to fruity ciders or Pimms...god I sound so middle class
p8947
aVWhy do you hate Britain?
p8948
aVhaha big up Bangor University!
p8949
aVFuck off Aber
p8950
aVHey man, I was doing 5 shifts a week when I was at uni.
p8951
aVI paid for those drugs myself
p8952
aVyou're a better man than me, I'll admit that much.
p8953
aV[deleted]
p8954
aVNah just from York.
p8955
aVI was at uni in Newcastle.
p8956
aVI don't really have the hook up in York at all, not since before I went to uni, so 2009.
p8957
aVSorry brah.
p8958
aVJeremy was a gambling addict for a long time, he's hardly in a place to judge. 
p8959
aVYet he does every episode
p8960
aVYes.
p8961
aVYes he does.
p8962
aVI feel like the shame/disgust he feels for how he was comes out as anger and disgust on that stage. 
p8963
aVAnd his show is sponsored by a Bingo Company whose advertisement bumpers kind of seem a bit inappropriate when they follow a segment about a gambling problem\u000a
p8964
aVThat's hilarious.
p8965
aVBingo might not seem like hardcore gambling but if people are spending what little they have on it and wasting their savings it can still be a problem.
p8966
aVI always thought that too...
p8967
aVI love how he talks about his brothers problems quite often.
p8968
aVHis poor brother has worked hard to get through them, yet gets talked about on national TV weekly.
p8969
aV[Jeremy Kyle is not a nice man, he participates in chav bateing which is quite frankly , racist.
p8970
aV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Ni2Rko8BI)
p8971
aVIf I ever get the chance I'm going to go and watch the Jeremy Kyle show while on drugs.
p8972
aVReally stick it to the man.
p8973
aVI'm doing it right now.
p8974
aVWell worth the irony.
p8975
aVI meant actually be in the audience while high, unless that's what you're doing in which case trip on.
p8976
aVCan confirm, I now people whose parents were divorced, and between them would have earned more than the baseline amount to exclude them from getting grants.
p8977
aVBut as they lived apart they had to put the address of one house, so obviously they put the address of the parent earning less money.
p8978
aVThey got a £3k yearly grant, a loan to cover their tuition fees (like everyone else) and a £900 a year bursary on top of that.
p8979
aVThe system needs to change but I can't say that they were complaining.
p8980
aVArguments did break out over who was to get the next round in the pubs a lot though
p8981
aVSame as EMA.
p8982
aVKids got it in my School just because their parents were separated.
p8983
aVOne girl got £35 a week - her divorced dad worked in the Middle East as an oil merchant. 
p8984
aVYeah I know someone who got £30 a week.
p8985
aVSmuggest motherfucker ever
p8986
aVYup, dat shit cray.
p8987
aVI don't think a single person at my school direly needed a whole £35 a week, should've been capped at £20/25.
p8988
aVGrants?
p8989
aVI wish.
p8990
aVI have to pay for those drugs monthly for the next 20 years.
p8991
aVWTF is a "Uni grant"?
p8992
aVDepending on your household income you get a grant in addition to loans that cover the Tuition Fee (paid directly to the University) and the Maintenance loan (for living expenses).
p8993
aVUnlike the others you don't have to pay back the grants. 
p8994
aV[deleted]
p8995
aVIt can be in addition to or in lieu of.
p8996
aVYou can definitely get both, I learnt from living with 3 people who all get the grant AND claim the maintenance loan
p8997
aVAnnoyed the hell out of me.
p8998
aVYou either have the guys whose parents can afford it or you have the guys who get a grant + their loan whereas I wasn't eligible for a grant but my family aren't well off enough to have helped me.
p8999
aVFuck that.
p9000
aVSame position here... lower middle class gets fucked over the most I guess. 
p9001
aV[deleted]
p9002
aVah i see.
p9003
aVcheers for clearing that up
p9004
aVI'm surprised and glad that exists. 
p9005
aVAlso known as a 'Scottish University Education'.
p9006
aV&gt;Uni grants.
p9007
aVWhat is this 'grant' of which you speak?\u000a
p9008
aVGrant/subsidies.
p9009
aVYou get them if your parents earn below a set amount, are divorced or sometimes if you have good grades.
p9010
aVCalled bursaries now though
p9011
aVIsn't that what is handed out directly from the university?
p9012
aVMaybe it has changed with 9k fees but the non-repayable bit that the SLC gave to you was a grant, and the bursary was something the university handled.
p9013
aVThis was only a year or two ago.
p9014
aVYou're right.
p9015
aVMy student finance letter calls the bit that I don't have to pay back the grant, and I get bursaries from the university which I also don't have to pay back.
p9016
aVThe bursaries aren't handed out to everyone though and are dependant on your family/living situation.
p9017
aVGrants are for specific things ie if you're a lone parent and bursaries are household income dependent.
p9018
aVThere are also trusts, endowments and scholarships which are also non repayable.
p9019
aVBarely anyone at my uni did drugs and those that did smoked weed a couple of times a week.
p9020
aVGetting drunk is way cheaper.
p9021
aVHate to break it to you but drugs are definitely a lot cheaper than alcohol.
p9022
aVChav is an oppressive term.
p9023
aVStop using it and fuck off.
p9024
aVEDIT: Check out the bourgeois up in arms.
p9025
aV"Downvote this for me please, Jeffrey.
p9026
aV"
aVFuck off is an oppressive/silencing phrase.
p9027
aVStop using it and people might listen to you.
p9028
aVFuck off.
p9029
aVYou'll note I don't disagree that chav *is* an oppressive term and that demonising the working class is a terrible idea for everyone.
p9030
aVNot all working class people are chavs...
p9031
aV*You* know this.
p9032
aV*I* know this.
p9033
aVPeople whose image of the working class comes mostly or only from TV/newspaper/whatever don't have such a solid grasp on this concept.
p9034
aVThe "chav" idea is a way to make the working class unsympathetic to people "above" working class, that *They* deserve to be poor/have dead-end, shithole jobs, because urgh they dress *wrong* and talk *wrong* and act *wrong*.
p9035
aVSo when one of these Enlightened people get to make a decision about the working class, they imagine the "chav" image, and don't have to feel bad about shitting on them.
p9036
aVCunts are cunts whether they're poor or not.
p9037
aVBeing shit on (worse schools, worse jobs, worse housing) makes you be covered in shit.
p9038
aVAh that makes sense.
p9039
aVHonestly not something ive ever really given much thought.
p9040
aVCheers!
p9041
aVI know.
p9042
aVIt was just a feeble attempt at 'lulz'
p9043
aVIn this context it's descriptive.
p9044
aVFor all you know I might be the biggest chav you've ever seen. 
p9045
aVActually you're getting downvoted because you're obviously a twat, love Jeffrey. 
p9046
aVHave you ever experienced this type of oppression?
p9047
aVI'll retract the "Fuck Off" but I take the term Chav seriously.
p9048
aVIt affected me at college, and its affected many people around me.
p9049
aVIt perpetuates this fucking class shite.
p9050
aVI'm sure Karl Marx and Martin Luther King feel your pain from beyond the grave.
p9051
aVYou're using Chav in a class sense, I'm using it in a descriptive sense.
p9052
aVEg.
p9053
aVA Chav, a grunger, an Emo, a Goth, a Greebo. 
p9054
aVChav isn't simply a descriptive.
p9055
aVIt's got VERY negative connotations.
p9056
aVProbably because the people it is associated with give it a bad name. 
p9057
aVOh god.
p9058
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb8wH_XlLfA

aVArguably the best comment I've seen all day.
p9061
aVUnlucky it's so far down on a thread.
p9062
aVYes.
p9063
aV&gt;Uni grants\u000a\u000aWhat is this, 1973?
p9064
aVThey're student loans now, dear
p9065
aVoh the shire, how goes ye
p9066
aV***SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS INTENSIFIES***
p9067
aVI hate this guy, he's just the unashamed face of everything that's wrong with our culture, dressed up as a "helpful hero" type, all the while pocketing the cash and there's so many people that watch it "BECAUSE HE HELPS PEOPLE ITS REALITY OMGZ!
p9068
aV" No, he doesn't, he's an opportunistic cunt, but just as much shame on the people that go on his show because 5 minutes of looking will find 100 better places to get help than this assholes stage.
p9069
aVHe is the Daily Mail given form, all that is sneering and vile delivered unto us that we may know suffering unending by his glorious hand.
p9070
aVJennifer Saunders [played him so well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVmYLq2kUco)
p9071
aVWow, that's spot on!
p9072
aVHe and everyone in the audience knows that the show is not about helping people.
p9073
aVI've been and it's all one big in joke, and he openly admits it to the crowd.
p9074
aVSo at least he's honest about it.
p9075
aVEveryone knows, [except the subjects of the show](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/07/itv.television), apparently.
p9076
aVGreat article, really interesting.
p9077
aVOriginal artist is Jenni Sparks.
p9078
aVYou can see the rest of here brilliant illustrations [here](http://jennisparks.com/).
p9079
aVCan't understand why someone felt the need to remove the artists name from the image.
p9080
aVI see that a lot on Reddit.
p9081
aVNo idea why people do it.
p9082
aVLove the girl in the Black Magic vest.... Mmmmmmmm
p9083
aVFuck Jeremy Kyle and the whole "LOOK AT THIS LOSER!
p9084
aVAT LEAST YOUR LIFE ISNT AS BAD AS THIS!
p9085
aV" bullshit.
p9086
aVI spend quite a bit of time in my work visiting long term benefit claimants at home.
p9087
aVA large majority of the people I visit have this shit show playing on their TV when I walk in.
p9088
aVIn fact, I actually visited a couple that had been on this show recently.
p9089
aVBoth of them had pretty obvious learning difficulties and were exploited for cheap entertainment in which a paternity test was involved.
p9090
aVI've always thought of Jeremy Kyle as a show that encourages poor people to hate themselves.
p9091
aV^(or is that just ITV in general?
p9092
aV)
aVIt's ITV in a nutshell.
p9093
aVPoor people arguing!
p9094
aVPoor people selling stuff!
p9095
aVAnt and Dec are giving away free tat to their poor audience members!
p9096
aVNow Simon Cowell has pissed on it and told them how utterly miserable their lives will be!
p9097
aVAnd now to cleanse the palette, here's a period drama!
p9098
aVLook at all these rich old people!
p9099
aVYou'll never be as successful or cultured as them!
p9100
aVYou may as well go into Robert Dyas, buy a length of rope, and hang yourself!
p9101
aVWhat's that, your local store has been replaced with an up market coffee shop?
p9102
aVWell of course, fuck you poor people! 
p9103
aVChannel 4 is somewhat similar, though it reminds me more of a zoo.
p9104
aV"Watch Britain's fattest dwarf....*on benefits*". 
p9105
aVChannel 4 doesn't seem to have as clear an agenda though.
p9106
aVOften they try to stir up right wingers as well.
p9107
aVIt's just 'lets be as edgy as possible and see how much attention we get.
p9108
aV'
aVI don't know, "Benefits Street" made me really uncomfortable. 
p9109
aV*First guest walks on*\u000a\u000aJK: "Don't worry about them (The Audience) they should be at work"\u000a\u000aPriviliged Upper Middle Class Audience: *Giggles*\u000a\u000aEvery show ever.
p9110
aV"Use a condom"\u000a\u000a"But I'm a virgin"\u000a\u000a"Then get a job"\u000a\u000a"I'm only 13"\u000a\u000a"You make me sick, get off my show".
p9111
aV&gt; You make me sick\u000a\u000aNeeds more italics for emphasis.
p9112
aVThis guy is an affront to counselling, therapy and humanity in general. 
p9113
aVReminds me of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZb9-7i-ncc
p9114
aVAh, dead ringers... best show of my childhood!
p9115
aVAll the good satire shows seem to be gone, e.g.
p9116
aVBremner Bird and Fortune and Dead Ringers.
p9117
aVJohn Fortune sadly died last year as well so any chance of a return of the show is impossible now.
p9118
aVWonder if Bremner and Bird will ever get together though
p9119
aVThe now show is good, but unfortunately they don't do impressions; I think there was a radio version of dead ringers recently, but tv was better.
p9120
aVThe now show has loads of impressions usually by Jon Culshaw at least once a series. 
p9121
aVHaha, love the bit about Graham (he's a legend, supposedly)
p9122
aVI've always wondered about his qualifications....
p9123
aV[Looks like](http://www.grahamstanier.com/) he's a Psychology graduate with a Masters in psychotherapy and counselling.
p9124
aV.., although it neglects to say from where. 
p9125
aV[deleted]
p9126
aVHmm.
p9127
aVMy theory is he specifically told them not to bring up jk before hand. 
p9128
aVOut of curiosity, who's Graham and how does he resolve family feuds?
p9129
aVI love the pushing the chairs apart.
p9130
aVSo delightfully petty
p9131
aVMost of the people who agree to be on the show are from poor backgrounds and have the IQ of a child of a normally civillised city.
p9132
aVThis is missing the step where you press the off button on your remote.
p9133
aVI think my favourite 'Jeremy Kyle moment' had to be when he got hit in the head with an envelope.
p9134
aVThe look he gave afterwards, like a perturbed ostrich on high alert... it almost made watching it worthwhile.
p9135
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wr-oAL958M#t=49
p9136
aVEnvelope isn't even the best bit, it's the guest calling Jeremy out on his being a bossy coward:\u000a\u000a&gt;(Bouncers leer over guest; Jeremy stands behind them)\u000a\u000a&gt;**Jezza**: It's really mature, being you, isn't it?
p9137
aV&gt;**Guest**: I'll give you mature, mate.
p9138
aVYour big mans all stood next to ya, innit?
p9139
aV&gt;**Jezza**: (awkward pause) Why don't you just concentrate on the truth?
p9140
aVMind, those bouncers probably have to be there for health and safety.
p9141
aVJezza might not even want them (doubtful, but just saying).
p9142
aV"You throw it at me, I throw it at you, your mum"\u000a\u000aREKT
p9143
aVI think he might have said mong and not mum, but I'm not sure.
p9144
aVMan, I want to believe.
p9145
aVThat was an impressive throw.
p9146
aVJeremy looked a bit out of his depth there.
p9147
aVikr!
p9148
aVI feel like if I had tried I would have missed!
p9149
aVFull house!
p9150
aVS/He passed every question!
p9151
aVAlso-\u000a\u000a"Oh, the test's wrong is it?
p9152
aVDon't give me that.
p9153
aVYou passed the first question!
p9154
aV"\u000a\u000a...
p9155
aVI watch this show too often.
p9156
aV(It's good background noise..)
p9157
aVThe Jeremy Kyle Show exists purely so the second lowest common denominator can make fun of the lowest common denominator and feel superior.
p9158
aVI knew there was a reason I watch the show.\u000a
p9159
aVThey should make everyone with depression watch this on repeat.
p9160
aVYou'd have cured depression within 24 hours.
p9161
aVI liked him much better on Jezza's Virgin Confessions on Virgin Radio.
p9162
aVSeemed more real and helpful and less chavvy and trash tv
p9163
aVBefore that he was on a local midlands station called BRMB.
p9164
aVHe called himself 'Jezza' in those days, mind.
p9165
aVJezza's Capital Confessions too when he was in London.
p9166
aVIt's heart breaking to see what he has become.
p9167
aVI'm going to have to listen to those.
p9168
aVI suppose 8 years of dealing with people like this every day takes it's toll.
p9169
aVThat said, one of the reasons I prefer The JKS to other day-time-tv is because there seems to be actual help.
p9170
aVAnd while he's harsh at the start, he's usually more helpful by the end if the guest hasn't been a twat.
p9171
aVHang on.
p9172
aVEdit: found it!
p9173
aVCopied from an earlier comment I made: \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOk.
p9174
aVSo, a couple of years ago my mum, then boyfriend and I used to love TJKS, and I went and got tickets to watch it be filmed in Manchester.
p9175
aVGood times!
p9176
aVOnly it wasn't a lie detector or chavs fighting episode, it was a weepy.
p9177
aVWe were a little disappointed that we wouldn't get to hear the rustle of tracksuits close up, but whatever.
p9178
aVSo a woman comes on stage, she's all upset, I don't remember why.
p9179
aVShe's sat in a chair, head in hands, crying, and JK is sat next to her, patting her back and saying comforting things.
p9180
aVWell, suddenly he stops, presses his earpiece in, listens, then says to the audience, 'there's a technical issue, will just take a couple of minutes to sort.
p9181
aV' Then he *physically picks up his chair, turns it away from the woman and ignores her.
p9182
aV* For a good five - seven minutes while she continues to sob.
p9183
aVAs soon as the technical issue was resolved, he turned back and continued his 'sympathetic tv show host role'.
p9184
aVI was appalled.
p9185
aVYou have any proof that you went?
p9186
aVAll I've got is a blurred pic of my and my mum in the audience that I took when it was aired on the telly.
p9187
aVI can post that if you want?
p9188
aVit was like 15 years ago, not sure you would find any of the old recordings!
p9189
aV&gt; That said, one of the reasons I prefer The JKS to other day-time-tv is because there seems to be actual help.
p9190
aVApparently not very much, and the show is hugely exploitative in general: http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/07/itv.television
p9191
aVThis is awesome, who is the artist?
p9192
aVOriginal artist is Jenni Sparks.
p9193
aVYou can get it on a t-shirt [here](http://jennisparks.com/Chat-Show-Flowchart).
p9194
aVWhat about chasing after them backstage! 
p9195
aVI haven't watched the Jeremy Kyle show enough to judge this, but it is reaffirming some assumptions I already had.
p9196
aV*GET GRAHAM OUT*
p9197
aV[deleted]
p9198
aVStep one: switch off the television.
p9199
aVStep 2: GET A TRADE!

aVPardon?
p9201
aV**STEP 2: GET A TRADE!!
p9202

p9203
aVOh right, thanks.
p9204
aVNo wait, what?
p9205
aV(EDIT: this is fun but I genuinely don't get the original joke and my google fu has failed me.
p9206
aVAnyone?
p9207
aV)
aV**STEP 2: GET YOUR HEARING SORTED!!
p9208
aV**
p9209
aVJeremy Kyle and Nigel Farage show me cunts who are slightly worse cunts than I am, so I'm gonna do whatever they ask.
p9210
aVShit, who remembers when fucking 'Kilroy' was the leader of UKIP? 
p9211
aVKilroy once punched me on the leg to get me to move up when I went and saw his show in college.
p9212
aVScience fact.
p9213
aVSometimes when I was driving late around Birmingham many years ago I used to listen to his show on BRMB.
p9214
aVHe used to get some right weirdos calling his show. 
p9215
aVJeremy Kyle loves himself.
p9216
aVI remember watching racing on channel 4 and they were interviewing Phil Daniels, you could just see his head popping up in the background desperately trying to get a look in, eventually Phil Daniels said "I think Jeremy wants an interview" it was too funny.
p9217
aVSounds like a UK version of Maury Povich or Jerry Springer.
p9218
aVIt does my heart good to know we aren't the only ones. 
p9219
aVNot sure who maury povich is, but Jeremy Kyle's show is similar to jerry springer imo\u000a\u000aJeremy Kyle gets angry at his guests (usually chavs) and there's real fights on the show, and he's generally a dick, shouts at the audience sometimes, and acts so smug and holier-than-thou, etc.
p9220
aVThere are lots of clips from the show on YouTube:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU9l15FgVbg \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1mCkxidPro\u000a\u000aIt's trash TV with weird people chosen intentionally, pls don't think this represents england :D\u000a\u000a
p9221
aVLol well I won't think it represents England if you won't think Springer represents America!
p9222
aVI am a huge British history nerd so I don't think that at all.
p9223
aVStereotypes only scratch the surface most of the time anyway right?
p9224
aVJerry's a jolly old laugh compared to this post-apocalyptic neo-Dickensian nightmare.
p9225
aVWow he got everything in one picture!
p9226
aVAmazing.
p9227
aVAny high quality file of this?
p9228
aVI love it!
p9229
aVBest you'll get is from the artists own website [here](http://jennisparks.com/Chat-Show-Flowchart).
p9230
aVHave you seen Jerry Springer, or Montel, Maury?
p9231
aVDo they just get a bunch of ridiculous personalities on the stage?
p9232
aVIf so, this is the true gold and beauty of reality TV. 
p9233
aVI'm confused, at the artist hasn't mentioned the point where he's a cunt. 
p9234
aVWhat is...?
p9235
aVFucking graham...
p9236
aVAre you indeed?
p9237
aVKeep it in your trousers...
p9238
aVI'm watching it right now.
p9239
aVIt's just awful, mainly because he's so up himself now.
p9240
aVMy ex used to make me watch this show, always hated it.
p9241
aVSo useless. 
p9242
aVThe latest Popbitch newsletter may put the show into further context:\u000a\u000a&gt;       *Nice reception*\u000a&gt;       Doing it for the digs\u000a\u000a&gt;    The producer of a big British daytime\u000a&gt;    talk show surveyed a group of guests\u000a&gt;    about why they had chosen to go on\u000a&gt;    telly to talk about their personal\u000a&gt;    problems.
p9243
aVWhat do you think the most\u000a&gt;    common answer was?
p9244
aV&gt;    To give their issues a wide, public\u000a&gt;    platform?
p9245
aVTo generate debate or help\u000a&gt;    others in the same position?
p9246
aVTo get\u000a&gt;    the sort of expert advice that only\u000a&gt;    TV money can buy?
p9247
aVErm, no.
p9248
aVThe most\u000a&gt;    popular answer given was: "To stay\u000a&gt;    in a nice hotel"\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt;    Which becomes even more poignant\u000a&gt;    when you learn that the producer\u000a&gt;    revealed the 'nice hotel' they\u000a&gt;    book guests into is a Travelodge.
p9249
aVStill find myself watching it though...
p9250
aVJeremy Kyle cheated on his wife more than once http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Did_Jeremy_kyle_cheat_on_his_wife\u000a\u000aAlso, he has OCD and licks his phone to keep it clean, this interview in The Scotsman doesn't paint a portrait of a man who anyone should take moral outrage from.

p9266

p9267
aVAnd coastguards... One of the four emergency services after all...
p9268
aVand mountain and cave rescue
p9269
aV...that's very different.

p9271
aVSomebody's not been to the north.
p9272
aV(I can say that my mum's from Middlesborough you know.
p9273
aV)
aVCan confirm, no jobs.
p9274
aVSource: from Teesside 
p9275
aVThe hypocrisy is sickening.
p9276
aVThe politicians on Question Time are bleating on about free speech and the right to offend while people are being jailed for posting insensitive jokes on Twitter.
p9277
aVI'm writing to my MP to ask them to pass on concerns regarding this to the relevant Minister.
p9278
aVThe Act which tweeters are arrested under is the Communications Act 2003.
p9279
aVIt would be great if you also wrote to your MP so that at least two letters are received regarding this issue.
p9280
aVHere's mine.
p9281
aVDear Nick Raynsford,\u000a\u000aI hope you agreed with Nick Clegg when he said that "People have to be\u000afree to offend each other" and with that in mind I hope you can push to\u000achange Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 Section 4A inserted\u000ainto the Public Order Act 1986 which states\u000a\u000a(1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person\u000aharassment, alarm or distress, he\u2014 (a) uses threatening, abusive or\u000ainsulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or (b) displays\u000aany writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening,\u000aabusive or insulting, thereby causing that or another person\u000aharassment, alarm or distress.
p9282
aVIn accordance with this statue a Glasgow man was arrested for making\u000aoff colour jokes on twitter\u000ahttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-30585301  and many others\u000ahave been investigated for similar comments made in bad taste.
p9283
aVI certainly agree that it should be a crime to threaten or harass but I\u000adraw the line at simple insults and probably abuse too.
p9284
aVYours sincerely,
p9285
aVNot to nitpick, but it wasn't a Glasgow man.
p9286
aVIt was a guy from Sunderland making jokes about something that happened in Glasgow.
p9287
aVNice letter, but you wrote:\u000a\u000a&gt;statue
p9288
aVNo wonder my MP doesn't give a flying shit about my opinion.
p9289
aVI live in Greenwich borough too, and he never responded in previous emails
p9290
aVI usually get a response from his secretary and occasionally an email or letter in reply.
p9291
aVIn this case I got this\u000a\u000a\u000a&gt;Thank you for your email to Nick Raynsford MP.
p9292
aVNick has raised your concerns with the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice.
p9293
aVAs soon as Nick receives a response I shall be in touch.
p9294
aV&gt;Best wishes,\u000a\u000a&gt;Jo\u000a\u000aSo at least that's something.
p9295
aVIts quite sad really, just last month about the Scottish rubbish truck joke it's stupid and a insensitive joke but a guy got got arrested for it.
p9296
aVWhat about Jimmy Carr and his jokes (which I find hilarious some times)...
p9297
aVHe does a 10 minute segment of really offensive jokes that only get worse purposely to see if he can offend someone.
p9298
aVNot seen any police raids on him.
p9299
aVAll goes along the lines of people get offended too easily on social media... Thing is nothing happens to you if you get offended which people seem to forget.
p9300
aVIt's a double standard.
p9301
aVThe guy made a rubbish truck joke, he got a arrested.
p9302
aVKatie hopkins makes a joke, she gets put on big brother.
p9303
aVOne rule for them one rule for us
p9304
aVYou're right, it's unfair she got a much worse punishment.
p9305
aVMaybe they'll let her transfer to a normal prison with good behaviour?
p9306
aVShe got put in a prison of Narcissism though, which most people would find atrocious, but to her its more akin to sticking a fat person in a prison made out of cake
p9307
aVI'll be honest, I have no idea who she is and I was just making a joke.
p9308
aVDon't worry about it, I just wanted to make a similar joke about a fat person in a prison made out of cake!
p9309
aVI like the idea of a prison made out of cake for fat people.
p9310
aVThey can easily eat their way out, but why would they want to leave the precious cake?
p9311
aV?
aVJust put her in solitary confinement for a few years. 
p9312
aV&gt; The guy made a rubbish truck joke\u000a\u000aPersonally I thought it was pretty good.\u000a\u000a
p9313
aVThat woman is the absolute definition of a sour cunt
p9314
aVYou're right, also these kind of jokes have been passed around so much over the years.
p9315
aVAlmost instantly after a tragic event.
p9316
aVSomebody once told me that the vast majority originated in Liverpool and then went viral via verbal/email/text.
p9317
aVI haven't heard of any complaints about these forms of communication before.
p9318
aVI think it's just the gov trying to pass more and more legislation enabling them control over the Internet.
p9319
aVThey're scared about how easily dissent spreads online.
p9320
aVMaybe the politicians are reeling that people are able to insult them online, make fake accounts and satirise them.
p9321
aVThey can't exactly prosecute those people because it wouldn't be the right story.
p9322
aV&gt; Somebody once told me that the vast majority originated in Liverpool\u000a\u000aIntriguing allegation there.
p9323
aVAre the people of Liverpool uniquely skilled in creating offensive jokes?
p9324
aVI was there as a student and can confirm their sense of humour tends to be a little dark, but then perhaps I'm wrong because I'd probably gravitate towards that.
p9325
aVI know somebody that breeds jokes in his mind like microbes in a culture (impossible to tell), he told me about many jokes originating in LP so I kind of took his word for it.
p9326
aVEdit: I've had a look and can't find anything regionally specific.
p9327
aVDidn't hear about the rubbish truck joke, does anyone have a link to an article on it?

aV"freedom of speech if you have the right voice"\u000a\u000aPenny Rimbaud.
p9329
aVYou dont really have freedom of speech in UK, to really have freedom of speech you need to be able to also have the ability to freely offend people...
p9330
aVHowever thats illegal in uk.
p9331
aV"However there is a broad sweep of exceptions including threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior intending or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress or cause a breach of the peace (which has been used to prohibit racist speech targeted at individuals)"\u000a\u000a[From Wikipedia.
p9332
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country#United_Kingdom)\u000a\u000aObviously you dont always know if you are offending someone, and you may not of intended to insult anyone...
p9333
aVSo this is law enforced by feels rather than reels...\u000a\u000a
p9334
aVI wonder if the cartoons published in Paris would have fallen foul of this law if published in the UK.
p9335
aVIf they were deemed to provoke racial hatred then yes.
p9336
aVProbably only if you tweeted them.
p9337
aVYes, or similar.
p9338
aVWhen a number of uk publications wanted to publish the Danish cartoons last time round, they were advised by police that they may break the law, incite public disorder, and the police would not protect the pubkication's safety.
p9339
aV&gt; they were advised by police that they may break the law, incite public disorder, and the police would not protect the pubkication's safety.
p9340
aVReally?
p9341
aVIf so that is vastly overstepping the power police have.
p9342
aVIt is for courts to decide what is illegal.
p9343
aVPolice have to defend murderers from lynch mobs if it comes to it.
p9344
aVI think it's pretty obvious what probably happened.
p9345
aVThe police &amp; presumably the government at the time didn't want trouble, so they had a quiet word with major TV, newspapers and magazines.
p9346
aVA little bit of this subsequently leaked out, as it's obvious some journalists are unhappy about this, as it's been tangentally mentioned in a number of press articles in the last couple of days.
p9347
aVI can't find the story that mentioned it again yesterday - I think it was in the Spectator and Telegraph.
p9348
aVYou may also recall that in 2006 (?
p9349
aV) Channel 4 had a live debate TV program in which vieweers voted whether or not to show images of Mohammed.
p9350
aVThe viewers voted yes, but Channel 4 decided not to show the images anyway.
p9351
aVNevertheless, it is certainly a fact that individuals &amp; organizations who would otherwise be opposed to extremism, regularly do not get involved in this on police advice.
p9352
aVe.g.
p9353
aVhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/10588267/Lib-Dem-candidate-receives-death-threats-for-tweeting-Prophet-Mohammed-cartoon.html\u000a"A spokesman for the Quilliam Foundation said the organisation would not be commenting on the matter, after receiving advice from the police.
p9354
aV"\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the near universal failure by the UK press to show the images now, again has the same underlying reason.
p9355
aVNo, because they aren't directed at a person.
p9356
aVIs there anywhere I can get clarity on what the limits of free speech are in the UK?
p9357
aVI know someone was arrested for saying they wished that a killer had pissed on the corpse of his victim - the teacher - on twitter recently.
p9358
aVDid anything come of that?
p9359
aVI mean while it's not really a nice thing to say, I support someone's right to hold that view.
p9360
aVSo long as they are not hurting anyone.
p9361
aVI can see a situation where I truly despise a certain person and so if bad comes to them, I wouldn't be sad; I mean, say these terrorists in France, I imagine if they end up dead in a police shootout, you would get lots of people holding the view 'great, they're dead.
p9362
aVShould piss on the corpses too'.
p9363
aVWould people be arrested for saying that on twitter?
p9364
aVWhat's the difference between the first and second - it just depends on your opinion on the deceased?
p9365
aVAre people being arrested for opinions they hold?
p9366
aVIs it the fact that they put it on social media - can it be sent in a private message?
p9367
aVSaid to people down the pub?
p9368
aVSerious question rather than trolling here.
p9369
aVSometimes I really don't know what i can say or not.
p9370
aV&gt; Are people being arrested for opinions they hold?
p9371
aVIt's a very fine line at times.
p9372
aVIn general, free speech, like all fundamental rights (including the right to life), is not taken to be absolute.
p9373
aVVery very few can logically argue that it should be, considering that, at the very least, the civil law (e.g.
p9374
aVdefamation) places *some* limits on speech.
p9375
aVThe more intense debate takes place in the context of using the criminal law, and different countries resolve the tensions differently and through different combinations of regulation by law, social/cultural norms, procedures etc.
p9376
aVIn a nutshell, matters of free speech turn immensely on context.
p9377
aVThe context can be cultural, historical, socio-economic, and even just practical, but essentially it's about consideration of the time and the place, both on the macro level as well as the micro level.
p9378
aVAs you might imagine it is very difficult to give absolutely concrete definitions of these concepts in advance, particularly because defining them is an ongoing process.
p9379
aVIn short, in the UK people are *not* technically arrested for the opinions they hold.
p9380
aVThey are arrested for the manner and context of the opinions they are flagrantly expressing.
p9381
aVThe lines can be very blurry though, so it's important for the debate to be continuous and as *open as possible without crossing into violence.
p9382
aV* Unfortunately it is one of those debates that in practice has the propensity to produce collateral damage.
p9383
aVThere's a good comparison of the approaches of the US and UK on this [here.

aVSo you're saying the Prophet Mohammed wasn't a real person?
p9386
aVThat's blasphemy, infidel!
p9387
aVIncitement?
p9388
aVI doubt it, because it isn't encouraging anyone to do anything because of the cartoons.
p9389
aVIn fact, isn't the magazine sold here as well?
p9390
aVYes.
p9391
aVProbably available in South Ken.
p9392
aVVisited south east Kent right on the channel recently, and used to live near there\u000a\u000aThey don't sell the publication, and it wouldn't sell well if they did.
p9393
aVPeople in Dover and many of the surrounding towns are extremely xenophobic, to the point where EDL et al would call it a safe haven
p9394
aVApologies.
p9395
aVBy Ken I meant South Kensington.
p9396
aVThere's a little French area around the embassy and a very good newsagent/bookshop that would stock this.
p9397
aVBit disturbing to hear Dover etc is so far gone that they would freak at the sight of a French publication - especially as they are so close to France and probably gain a lot from continental travel.
p9398
aVAhh I see.
p9399
aVFair enough.
p9400
aVI don't think they'd so much freak at a French publication, they just wouldn't buy it.
p9401
aVIt'd be seen as trying to sell to 'tourists' more than anything.
p9402
aVDover is no land of hopes and dreams; that ferry is about the only worthwhile thing there, and I speak from the experience of having gone to Dover a lot when I lived in the area
p9403
aVYes, because targeting people because of their race or religion is illegal.
p9404
aVThat's why the last round of danish cartoons were only visible here in news stories.
p9405
aVTargeting *a person* because of their race or religion is illegal.
p9406
aVThe cartoons do target people - Muslim people.
p9407
aVIt's not possible to target a religion because a religion cannot see the cartoons, read the paper or hear a comment.
p9408
aVIt cannot reply, change its mind or react to what is said.
p9409
aVThe target is the people who follow that religion because they are the ones who see and hear what is said and they are the ones affected by it.
p9410
aVBut they aren't targeting a specific person, which is the point of the law (well not a live one or one who lives in this country anyway).
p9411
aVIt's the reason that Diane Abbot can go on about 'White People', not a specific white person.
p9412
aVIt's the reason that Steve Bell can draw funny cartoons mocking Christianity and not a specific Christian.
p9413
aVIt's the reason that David Blunkett can talk about Roma, but not a specific Roma person.
p9414
aV&gt; may not of \u000a\u000aThis offends me
p9415
aVI would support this prosecution under the Communications Act.
p9416
aVThis is just the start of the restriction of free speech, the Tory's are already working on banning people with opinions they disagree with from TV, public speaking, protests, social media, and the internet.
p9417
aV&gt; The restrictions are expected to include banning individuals from speaking at public events, protests and meetings, having to inform the police in advance of any public event, protest or meeting that they plan to attend, and banning individuals from particular public locations.
p9418
aV&gt; May also wants to include restrictions on banned individuals from broadcasting, from associating with named people, and restricting their use of social media or the internet by requiring them to submit in advance any proposed publication to the police.

aVIt always amuses me how many people think (from watching American movies presumably) that they have a "right" to free speech - this right has never existed in the UK!
p9422
aVArticle 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights mandates freedom of expression.
p9423
aVObviously that's in conflict with some of the laws that are in place in the UK currently, but that does mean that those laws could potentially be challenged at the European Court of Human Rights.
p9424
aVThere are so many caveats in Article 10 that it's virtually useless:\u000a\u000a&gt;Article 10 is a qualified right and as such the right to freedom of expression may be limited.
p9425
aVArticle 10 provides that the exercise of this freedom \u201csince it carries with it duties and responsibilities\u201d may be limited as long as the limitation:\u000a\u000a&gt;o is prescribed by law;\u000a\u000a&gt;o is necessary and proportionate; and\u000a\u000a&gt;o pursues a legitimate aim, namely:\u000a\u000a&gt;* the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety;\u000a\u000a&gt;* the prevention of disorder or crime;\u000a\u000a&gt;* the protection of health or morals;\u000a\u000a&gt;* the protection of the reputation or rights of others;\u000a\u000a&gt;* preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence; or\u000a\u000a&gt;* maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

aVNone of those seem to say that I couldn't call someone a wanker on Twitter though.
p9428
aVUnless somebody decides that it's immoral.
p9429
aVYou're more than welcome to call someone a wanker on Twitter, it's directly harrassing someone with abuse and threatening them that can land you in trouble, ya know, like in real life.
p9430
aVDo tell me how the guy that was arrested for the glasgow bin lorry joke tweet was directly abusing or threatening anyone.
p9431
aVI hadn't heard about that until now, just looked up on it, and you're right, it isn't directly aimed at anyone.
p9432
aVHowever, it does say he handed himself in after complaints, and police were investigating malicious communications.
p9433
aV[had to find that in a local paper, none of the nationals reported that piece of information](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-bin-lorry-tragedy-teenager-4867286) I can't find anything more recent than the day it happened, but I hazard to guess that it either has, or will be dropped.
p9434
aVIf he hadn't gone to the police station himself, they probably wouldn't have done anything, but because he actually reported that he may have committed a crime, it had to be investigated.
p9435
aVapparently The tweet said: "So a bin lorry has apparently driven in 100 people in Glasgow eh, probably the most trash it's picked up in one day".
p9436
aVits fucking ridiculous he got arrested shame on the UK \u000a\u000a
p9437
aVbecause he went to the police station voluntarily.
p9438
aVHe would have been arrested as a formality whilst they investigated a potential malicious communication, that he himself reported.
p9439
aVI'm sure that will have been dropped after the paper work was filled out and they were satisfied that that's all it was.\u000a
p9440
aV&gt;He would have been arrested as a formality whilst they investigated a potential malicious communication\u000a\u000aUh, so he would've been arrested anyway then.
p9441
aVHow you can defend someone being arrested for a joke on twitter by saying "oh it was just a formality while they were investigating it" is beyond belief. 
p9442
aVI'm not necessarily defending it, but it's not as though they actually went after him.
p9443
aVAnd within the context of investigating malicious communication I can understand why an arrest may have been made, to later be dropped.
p9444
aVThough it is on the face of it is ridiculous.
p9445
aV&gt;within the context of investigating malicious communication I can understand why an arrest may have been made\u000a\u000aYou can understand why someone was arrested for making a joke on twitter.
p9446
aVYou're somehow ok with that, that's what it comes down to.
p9447
aVdo you have a link?, i want to know more about this, i haven't heard about that arrest
p9448
aVnot sure if you have seen the this part of the thread discussing this http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2rst5v/frankie_boyle_on_twitter_im_reading_a_defence_of/cnje1nu
p9449
aVThat isn't true in the slightest.
p9450
aVPeople have been arrested for literally making a joke, aimed at nobody.
p9451
aVIn what context?
p9452
aVAny examples?
p9453
aVhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/man-arrested-as-police-investigate-claims-of-offensive-twitter-message-about-glasgow-bin-lorry-crash-9942347.html\u000a\u000aAnd then a huge amount of people arrested just for being offensive, even when not targetting anybody in particular.
p9454
aVI covered that one further down http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2rst5v/frankie_boyle_on_twitter_im_reading_a_defence_of/cnje1nu\u000a\u000aTL;DR He went to the police himself, formalities were observed, which is probably the case with any others.
p9455
aVNo, TL;DR they were going to arrest him anyway, but somehow that's ok, because you've decided it was "a formality"\u000a\u000ajesus christ just admit when you're wrong.
p9456
aVWhere does it say there were going to arrest him anyway?
p9457
aVThe article says he voluntarily went to the police station.
p9458
aVIt doesn't say they were searching for him, or that an investigation was launched to find him.
p9459
aVHe went of his own accord because of the complaints he had received.\u000a 
p9460
aV&gt;Where does it say there were going to arrest him anyway?
p9461
aVI find it hard believing that this is a serious statement.
p9462
aVThe police will not just arrest you if you show up and hand yourself in.
p9463
aVThey only arrest people when they believe they have commited a crime and a charge could follow.
p9464
aVHe is out on Police bail, and while they find more information.
p9465
aVIf the Police have no intention of doing anything, they don't put people out on bail, they release them without charge.
p9466
aV[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Joke_Trial) is another example, but eventually (after 3 trials) the bloke got off.
p9467
aVI'm wasn't really defending it, just looking at a potential chain of events.
p9468
aVAnd I wasn't implying he was arrested for just turning up, but it is possible he was arrested for a possible breach of the law, for suspicion of sending malicious communication, until it is properly investigated, and then he would later have it dropped without charge.
p9469
aVThat other one you linked though, whilst I appreciate the guy was joking, it's in very bad taste and very dodgy territory.
p9470
aVThe police have to investigate it, and despite the intent it could be taken as a threat.
p9471
aVIf they had let it slide and then a bomb was exploded we'd all be asking why they didn't respond to it.
p9472
aVI know the laws are daft, and I wish that at times they weren't necessary, I really am a proponent of free speech (up to the point that it harmful or abusive etc), but it just highlights that we have a social responsibility to be thoughtful of how we communicate, especially now when so much of what we think and say is posted publicly for the entire world to see.
p9473
aVIn this case so the police don't have to chase after non-serious threats of terrorism.
p9474
aVIf people weren't racist, or abusive or threatening or joking about blowing things up, we wouldn't need to have systems and laws to prevent, to protect people and punish it.
p9475
aVIt has so many exceptions that it's practically useless .

p9478
aVIt sounds nice, but allows governments to decide what speech is acceptable, so it isn't really a freedom.
p9479
aVBut currently in the UK the far right want to sever connections with the European human rights court...

aVFreedom of speech is and always has been somewhere on a spectrum.
p9490
aVThe state and private individuals allow others certain degrees of freedom of expression depending on the time and place and who they are.
p9491
aVThe idea of freedom of expression being black or white is silly.
p9492
aVThe right to free expression is innate, it belongs to the individual.
p9493
aVA government can choose to recognize it or to restrict it - but it is not theirs to give.
p9494
aVFound the American.
p9495
aVScottish.
p9496
aV'Freeeeedom' and all that.
p9497
aVIf you look at it that way anyone has an innate right to do anything that is physically possible.
p9498
aVOr as Assassin's Creed puts it, Everything is Permitted.
p9499
aVEverything is possible, not everything is permitted.
p9500
aVAs has been said many times by many people - freedom to act does not mean freedom from consequences.
p9501
aVMy point was that our right to free speech is not dependent on which government 'allows' us it, it is not theirs to give.
p9502
aVWhere would you say it comes from then?
p9503
aVI agree that it does not come from a government, but where does it come from?
p9504
aVEverything is permitted in this context is extremely similar to everything is possible, except that we know some things are not possible.
p9505
aVIt is almost saying that everything that is possible is permitted by nature.
p9506
aVThere are no other restrictions.
p9507
aVWhilst humans may try and intervene with this, they cannot affect nature itself.
p9508
aVNo human law (such as a restriction on free speech) has any meaning on nature.
p9509
aVThe concept of "having rights" is also subject to the fact of reality that is outlined with "Everything is Permitted".
p9510
aVAs much as nature allows us the "right" or ability to express ideas, it also allows others the ability to attempt to stop us.
p9511
aVNature expresses no preference.
p9512
aVAs such, the view that we have some sort of absolute right to anything that cannot be infringed is purely an agreed upon human construct.
p9513
aVI quite like that it is, but to view it as anything more is silly.
p9514
aV**Tl;dr:** I am just being pedantic and making a silly semantics argument.
p9515
aVYou probably shouldn't have wasted your time reading this and I certainly shouldn't have wasted my time typing it.
p9516
aVI can't quite believe we're having to argue that people have a right to free speech
p9517
aVThat's a ridiculous argument.
p9518
aVPeople have the right to their own opinions.
p9519
aVOf course.
p9520
aVThey also have the right to attempt to inflict suffering upon others, and others have the right to attempt to stop them.
p9521
aVThere aren't any morals embedded in the fabric of the universe; morals are purely an agreed upon social construct, and different groups of people will come to different conclusions on what these should be according to their own moral axioms.
p9522
aV&gt;They also have the right to attempt to inflict suffering upon others\u000a\u000aUh, no they do not.
p9523
aVThat is absolutely nothing like free speech.
p9524
aVI can't believe I'm actually having to argue that a right to free speech shouldn't be suppressed.
p9525
aVYou are completely missing the point of what I am saying.
p9526
aVI am not arguing anything.
p9527
aV&gt;I can't believe I'm actually having to argue that a right to free speech shouldn't be suppressed.
p9528
aVI am not arguing at all about any practical actions that should be taken.

aVWe as human beings do have a right to free speech, a right to our own opinions, and when that right is oppressed we should be annoyed.
p9540
aVYou're making out like people are some sort of entitled idiots for wanting free speech, I can't quite believe what I'm reading in this thread. 
p9541
aVOP was not making out that people are entitled idiots for wanting free speech.
p9542
aVI don't even know how you inferred that from what OP said.
p9543
aVWhat OP said was that an absolute right of free speech has never been enshrined in UK law, but a lot of people mistakenly believe that it was.
p9544
aVYou might be right, I need to stop using reddit on my phone, I always misinterpret things by not reading them properly.
p9545

aVOr so I thought.
p9558
aVStill supports what I said though
p9559
aVThat is correct.
p9560
aVI prefer they way we have it compared to the states.
p9561
aVHere you can get punished if it is reasonable to assume you intend to offend.
p9562
aVI'm not going to pretend it's a perfect system, there will always be exceptions, but I much prefer the idea that if you meant to cause offense you can be punished, but the same system will give you leniency if you unintentionally offend.
p9563
aVIt's almost literally a "don't be a twat" law.

aVFuck that shit.
p9566
aVI'm OK with arresting people who threaten others online but offending people is our sacred right, nay, our duty you stupid cocksucker.
p9567
aVThis is where the problem lies.
p9568
aVI think "offence" too often gets used in place of what the actual reasons are, like harassment, racial or sexual abuse etc.
p9569
aVWhen people cry, oh boo hoo, you're offended, what a shame, it's usually in response to someone calling them out on being an out and out nasty racist fuck.
p9570
aVIn regards to the cartoons, I would say that there isn't an issue in printing them, many Muslims here on reddit have said that of course they are offended by having their religious figure depicted in such a way, but it's the right of the person who drew it to do so, so they just ignore it and move on.
p9571
aVHowever I completely understand the argument that allows the curtailment of anything that is deliberately meant to undermine any demographic, whether it be race, sexual, gender, faith etc because it can lead to, or aid in the complete marginalisation and dehumanisation of that demographic.
p9572
aVWhich is why I believe, laws exist that prevent racial abuse for example.
p9573
aVIf you allow people to to throw racist abuse around and they go unchallenged, it's not long before that escalates to direct harassment, maybe online, then in person, and soon it becomes physical.
p9574
aVBy saying, no you can't say x, y and z, we're making it abundantly clear that everyone is free to live with a feeling of security and that society will protect them.
p9575
aVAnd I think that's fair.
p9576
aVI can't believe the shit I read that goes against free speech in this sub sometimes.
p9577
aVWhat part of what I wrote do you specifically object to?
p9578
aV&gt; Here you can get punished if it is reasonable to assume you intend to offend\u000a\u000awhy should it ever matter if someone's offended by something?
p9579
aVI'm sure Monty Python offends some people, should that be banned, should they be fined or jailed?
p9580
aVpretty much anything can offend somebody, just look at tumblr
p9581
aVMonty python has been banned at local level before though. 
p9582
aVand that was really stupid and pointless\u000a\u000ayou can't go on about how important it is to protect free speech in the face of religious extremism, and then go and ban media in your own country for being edgy\u000a
p9583
aVTorbay council only lifted the ban on Life of Brian in 2008.
p9584
aVWithout attempting to defend the laws themselves as such, but rather to explain them, I think the distinction is between something intended to offend, and something that incidentally offends.
p9585
aVWith satire and comedy, like Monty Python, the object is to make people laugh or make a commentary on society or politics.
p9586
aVSome of the output may offend people, but that is an incidental effect.
p9587
aVThe contrast would be the pictures of Mohammed that have been going up over reddit.
p9588
aVNone of them have any political, satirical, social or artistic value.
p9589
aVThey exist only to be as offensive as possible.
p9590
aVNot saying the latter should be banned.
p9591
aVJust trying to point out the difference, and why it is ok to criticise one, and stupid to criticise the other. 
p9592
aVso if i write a joke that intentionally seeks out to knowingly cause offence amongst  paedophiles am i guilty of an offence?
p9593
aVshould i be arrested because i have deliberately written something to make a group of people "feel bad" \u000a\u000aabsolutely not
p9594
aVI explicitly said that I wasn't defending the law, I'm just pointing out why Monty Python wouldn't fall foul of it. 
p9595
aV&gt; Here you can get punished if it is reasonable to assume you intend to offend.
p9596
aVNo you can get punished if it is deemed that a reasonable person would consider what you posted offensive.
p9597
aVIndeed if I try to offend you in a way that a reasonable person would not deem offensive I wouldn't have even broken any laws.
p9598
aVUhhh, no.
p9599
aVSorry UK, this is one area where the Americans got you beat.
p9600
aVYour laws are ridiculous.
p9601
aVI'd hate to live in the UK, I'd feel as if I'm walking on eggshells each day.
p9602
aVIf you get arrested for tweet, can you claim "it was just for the bantz" ?
p9603
aVWalking on hyperbole. 
p9604
aVIt should be an on the spot £60 fine and a criminal record for using the word "bantz.
p9605
aV"
aVBut if we get beat up because of what we said, at least we get free healthcare to patch us back up, so we've got that going for us which is nice.
p9606
aVI agree that the free speech laws are messed up - but the idea that you are walking on egg shells is a bit silly.
p9607
aVHaving lived in both places the USA feels more oppressive - because the police can be so badly behaved with impunity, overly corporate influenced politics etc etc - the practical realities are more troubling in the states. 
p9608
aVSorry but we definitely have corporate puppet politicians and badly behaved policemen too.
p9609
aVGranted they don't go round shooting teenagers but it's still chocked with institutionalised racism and bigotry.
p9610
aVYes we have that too.
p9611
aVNo it isn't anywhere near as bad as the states.
p9612
aVOn Question Time, they reaffirmed it many times that they talk about 'free speech within the bounds of the law' is what's always meant.
p9613
aVBut the bounds of the law are unclear and interpretable in different ways
p9614
aVActually to be fair, David Davis (an MP who I personally have a lot of time for) did clarify and make clear that they should be referring to Freedom of Speech within the law.
p9615
aVUsing the shouting 'Fire' in a theatre example.
p9616
aVYeah, like it or not our 'freedom of speech' comes with what our lawmakers feel are reasonable restrictions.
p9617
aVAnd since we haven't overthrown anyone recently, we as a country have agreed to obey our laws.
p9618
aVIt's a bit sketchy, however, when those laws are applied like an asbo against idiots acting out, but deferred for professional satirists and comedians who deliberately shoot for 'offensive'.
p9619
aVI like that there's room for context, but dislike that there's room for hypocrisy.
p9620
aVIt must be that they think it's OK to offend Muslims only.
p9621
aVHas anyone ever been pulled up for offending Muslims on Twitter?
p9622
aVNot on twitter, but arrested for offending Muslims:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yorkshirestandard.co.uk/news/19-year-old-released-on-bail-after-alleged-koran-burning-video-9133/\u000a\u000a
p9623
aV[There was also those people who were given a prison sentence for putting bacon on the door handles of mosques - again, not on Twitter though.
p9624
aV](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-27941589)
p9625
aVThat is a little different; a video of you burning an object which you own should certainly be legal.
p9626
aVBacon on mosque door handle should, as it is a direct and physical action should be dealt with in some way.
p9627
aVNot sure it should be much more than whatever the maximum fine for littering is, plus the costs of cleaning the doors though
p9628
aVI wonder if I'd be arrested for burning the violent chapters of the Qur'an only.
p9629
aVWhat would the charge be?
p9630
aVInciting to ethnic and racial hatred by protesting ethnic and racial hatred?   
p9631
aVI agree it's a little different.
p9632
aVBut there are still similarities in that although it was a physical action, it wasn't causing any physical harm - just as an insult causes no physical harm.
p9633
aVThere's no *permanent* physical harm.
p9634
aVIf someone poured a load of sand into my car through an open window there would be no permanent harm, but a physical action has been taken against my property and there should be some, can't think of the right word; retribution is near but not correct, because of the time and effort required to undo what they have done.
p9635
aVSame goes for those people who dumped a pile of shit outside of a ukip office; no permanent physical harm but a definite physical action which will require time and money to resolve.
p9636
aVI think I agree with a lot of what you're saying.
p9637
aVBut in this instance, there wasn't even any temporary or costly physical harm.
p9638
aVWhat you're hinting at is criminal damage.
p9639
aVIf you put water soluble paint on someone's window that washes off in the rain, the police wont get you in trouble for criminal damage, because it costs nothing for the "victim" to clean it up, just as with bacon on a door handle.
p9640
aVIf someone put a pocket full of sand (shout-out to /r/pocketsand ) through your car window, then there should be maybe a verbal warning for anti-social behaviour, because there's no damage done apart from maybe 45 seconds of your time to hoover it up.
p9641
aVIf someone *filled* your car with sand, then that would probably be criminal damage for which more than a verbal caution should be handed out because it's actually costly to you.
p9642
aVI agree there should be some retribution for the bacon folk, at *very* least a verbal caution.
p9643
aVBut the fact that it was done particularly to target Muslims, knowing that they would be particularly offended should mean they get at least a little more than a verbal caution, because it's effectively discrimination or a "hate crime" - targeted harassment almost.
p9644
aVI've forgotten the original point now anyway:/
p9645
aVIs the fact it wasn't causing physical harm really relevant?
p9646
aVSurely it doesn't seem OK to put a sign with a swastika outside a synagogue or a burning cross outside the house of a black family?
p9647
aVIn this instance the crime wasn't causing offense, but for intimidation and threat.
p9648
aV&gt; Is the fact it wasn't causing physical harm really relevant?
p9649
aVYes.
p9650
aVBecause if we start sending people to prison simply because they "hurt someone's feelings once" then pretty much everyone on Reddit should be in prison.
p9651
aVI don't think putting bacon on a door handle is threatening or intimidating.
p9652
aVHad they said something, or left a note, or a threat, then that would be intimidation and threatening, or if they'd done it over and over again, that would be harassment, or if they were trying to get others to attack them, that would be inciting violence etc.
p9653
aVBut none of those things happened.
p9654
aV&gt; Surely it doesn't seem OK to put a sign with a swastika outside a synagogue or a burning cross outside the house of a black family?
p9655
aVNo it's not, because they are both threatening symbol associated with violence and hatred towards a certain group of people.
p9656
aVBacon is bacon - not a symbol of hatred or violence.
p9657
aVOne Muslim redditor once described how Muslims view pigs as how anyone else might view a sewer rat: a dirty horrible little creature.
p9658
aVNot a sign of death or violence like a burning cross or swastika.
p9659
aVDon't get me wrong, I'm not defending the people who put the bacon there - they're clearly unpleasant and hate-filled individuals - but I think a prison sentence was far too harsh in that case.
p9660
aVEven just from the pragmatic point of view: as tax payers, we're now all paying for them to be in prison, and they're not going to be able to provide back to the community, whereas had they been given a community order, it'd be the opposite way round.
p9661
aVAlso, chances are they'll be even more bitter and hate filled when they come out, whereas had they been made to work in or alongside the Muslim community, they might actually change their views on Muslims.
p9662
aVAs I said though, I've kind of forgotten any original points anyway:)
p9663
aVWell was it cooked bacon or raw bacon?
p9664
aVIf the latter it can absolutely be argued that it is kind of low-grade biological warfare.
p9665
aVI'm so paranoid about food safety that even if I wanted to put bacon on mosque property, I'd probably resort to sellotaping crispy bacon strips on instead,and even then remove it after a day. 
p9666
aVOne man's food is another man's biological warfare.
p9667
aVPigs are so versatile.
p9668
aVTerrible example, the door handle girl *was on probation for previous racially-motiviated crimes*.
p9669
aVShe had literally just been released for a racial assault charge following her attacking a shop keeper.
p9670
aVYou can tell a lot about a media outlet depending on whether they mention this detail or not. 
p9671
aVWhat a waste of good bacon.
p9672
aVHaha I've seen that guy.

aVWe have our own stupid religious problems to deal with and people get their doors kicked in at 5am by Alex Salmonds "anti-sectarian" force because they made a joke about the pope.
p9677
aV"joke about the pope"?

p9683
aV'Insensitive jokes' is one way of looking at it.
p9684
aVBeing threatening and abusive is another.
p9685
aVThat's not 'freedom of speech' that's being abusive.
p9686
aVLook up the tweets that got people arrested with regards to the Glasgow bin lorry crash.
p9687
aVOne of them was\u000a\u000a&gt;So a bin lorry has crashed into 100 people in Glasgow eh, probably the most trash it\u2019s ever picked up in one day that,\u000a\u000aThat is not abusive, that is definitely just an insensitive joke and yet the police got involved.
p9688
aVMeanwhile, publications are being harassed and lists are being compiled of "cowards" who refuse to reprint the comics, and Muslim are being called terrorists for refusing to spam \u005c#JeSuisCharlie\u000a\u000a\u005c#TrueFreedom^TM
p9689
aVBut... but... *british values?
p9690
aV*
aV&gt; The hypocrisy is sickening.
p9691
aVIs it - what newspaper article is he referring to?
p9692
aVI've done some quick searching online, and have found articles suggesting it was the Mail, such as [this one](http://www.mailwatch.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=4014&amp;view=previous)\u000a\u000aHowever, I haven't found the call for him to be prosecuted.
p9693
aVOne day, Reddit will learn what context means.
p9694
aVI can only hope.
p9695
aVAnd that a comedian making a joke in the context of a comedy show or a caricaturist drawing a caricature is not the same as threatening to rape / murder / blow up someone on Twitter (or doxx them or whatever).
p9696
aVOne day, I'm sure Reddit will understand.
p9697
aVI mean... One can hope.
p9698
aVThe people charged with making insensitive jokes about the Ibrox disaster and Madeleine McCann where not threatening to to rape / murder / blow up someone on Twitter.
p9699
aVOne day, I'm sure NotThisBenjamin will understand.
p9700
aVI mean... One can hope he can at least refrain from posting irritating-as-fuck messages.
p9701
aVYour point is?
p9702
aVBecause if this is your point, it still shows you have no idea what "context" means.
p9703
aVIf one day you wonder why nobody laughs at your jokes, check back on those comments.
p9704
aV&gt; The hypocrisy is sickening.
p9705
aVliterally?
p9706
aVI wanna see vomit pics!\u000a
p9707
aVA few years ago he started tweeting huge Game of Thrones spoilers at people as he thought everyone was making a fuss over the show, and he didn't think spoilers where worth getting upset over.
p9708
aVI started a hashtag to ensure that whenever his favourite football team is playing people tweet him the scores.
p9709
aVTo this day I remain blocked on Twitter by him.
p9710
aV:) 
p9711
aVI too am blocked by him, because of something I can't remember.
p9712
aVBit sensitive. 
p9713
aVHe's a contradiction, he's a fan of freedom of speech but doesn't like to hear from people who disagree with him. 
p9714
aVThe freedom to speak is not the same as the right to be heard.
p9715
aVOK! 
p9716
aVNot really.
p9717
aVHe's just distancing himself from hearing you, which is the acceptable thing to do.
p9718
aVIf he actively tried to silence your voice to everyone, then it would be a contradiction.
p9719
aVI don't disagree but if a lot of his points are railing against people trying to censor him ignoring others voices, whilst his right, to me, undermines his points a little. 
p9720
aVNot the same thing - freedom of speech is a legal thing and, to be honest, is largely effected by social pressures.
p9721
aVHim blocking you isn't about freedom of speech, it's him exercising his right to ignore what you're saying.
p9722
aVI don't disagree, it does to me undermine some of his points on the subject though.
p9723
aVHe's probably just practising what he preaches, which would be to ignore those who you find offensive or irritating rather than sicing the police on them.
p9724
aVIt seems like the entirely reasonable thing to do and reinforces his point that there's a better way of dealing with it. 
p9725
aVHe was trolling people with spoilers, that's not practising what you think he's preaching. 
p9726
aVJust because he's a hypocrite doesn't undermine his point about freedom of speech.
p9727
aVThough aggressively spoilering people is a dick move and is less about "muh rights" than it is about "I am a colossal cuntwagon"
p9728
aVI haven't once stated that his opinions on free speech are wrong. 
p9729
aVYou just implied that not wanting to hear from someone who disagrees with you is incompatible with supporting free speech.
p9730
aVIt's literally your last post.
p9731
aVIt's not contradictory to want people to have free speech, but block them from free speeching *at* you
p9732
aVI said it was contradictory, not that he didn't have the right to do it. 
p9733
aVYou feel like you won that one?\u000a
p9734
aVNo actually, I miss reading his tweets, he's very funny.
p9735
aVHe was just a total cock about GOT, he targeted the tweets specific people and they where upset.
p9736
aVI know it's hardly that important but if he didn't like having things he enjoyed spoiled be shouldn't take pleasure in doing it to others.
p9737
aVEdit.
p9738
aVI used the word actually three times! 
p9739
aVNot just a cock about GOT, but an all round bad sport. 
p9740
aVHe seems to actual be an areshole, not just an act.
p9741
aVAlthough he exagerates it even more for his standup.
p9742
aVHe is mildly funny and very occasionally says something interesting but always seems pretty arrogant and smug. 
p9743
aVI imagine after a few years of finding fame and fortune from that "act" and being told everyone thinks you're hillarious when acting like that, it would seep into your offstage persona as well.
p9744
aVEven if you weren't an arsehole to begin with.
p9745
aVHe's basically been conditioned to think people will like him for being a twat.
p9746
aVIt might be that he sees going on twitter as going in character, because I've met him in person and besides being a bit of an oddball (He absolutely loves apocalyptic fiction and sci-fi and you can see it in him), he's usually pretty decent.
p9747
aVSame happened to Ricky Gervais
p9748
aVHe donated a tonne of cash to british victims of torture at Guantanamo Bay and went on a hunger strike.
p9749
aVHe certainly does more good than most celebrities. 
p9750
aVIt's just a tv show...
p9751
aVThe same way it's just a bunch of guys kicking a bit of leather around so fatter and unhealthier guys can tell them how shit they are...
p9752
aVYou're ducking shint!
p9753
aVI agree but if it's something people like why intentionally spoil it? 
p9754
aVYou can measure how someone really feels about freedom of expression by observing their reaction to views they _don't_ agree with.
p9755
aVaka britishpolitics :-)
p9756
aVNice we can agree on something.
p9757
aVThat said, the law is the law and whether it is Frankie Boyle, Jyllands Posten or Charlie Hebdo it should be applied equally.
p9758
aVI keep hearing how no-one prints cartoons against jews, as some kind of counter to why we shouldn't mock islamic fundamentalism.
p9759
aVDo jews really get no mockery, is there really no satire about them or just cheap jokes about the holocaust?
p9760
aVFor the record, I think both sides are fair game, as are christians, athiests and anyone I've missed, you weirdos.
p9761
aVJews get ripped on by pretty much everyone who plays FIFA - "jew goals" are a thing.
p9762
aVto be fair, isn't anyone beating someone else on FIFA a gay nigger jew fag  cunt by default over xbox live?
p9763
aVWho apparently has fucked my mum.. while being gay.
p9764
aVReally, tho I'm suggesting every religion gets mocked and satirised to a certain extent, but in the past decade or so Muslim extremism has been very much at the forefront of terrorism, so it's no surprise that it's getting most of the attention, both of satirists and journalists in general.
p9765
aVI imagine there's still anti jewish humour out there, it's just not to the same extent in the West as at least in Europe and the US, they're not blowing shit up or cutting heads off as much.
p9766
aVQuite happy to be corrected however, I admit I'm fairly ignorant of Judaism and the jewish conflicts in general.
p9767
aVAFAIK they don't really affect life in the UK that much tho?
p9768
aV(Not saying we shouldn't give a damn, just explaining that I don't tend to hear about them, we have a very UK-centric news media.
p9769
aV)
aVNever really understood why playing the ball to another player to get it past the keeper is a "Jew goal".
p9770
aVBecause it's a 'cheap' goal and the stereotype of Jew's is that they are cheap and tight fisted with money.
p9771
aVIt's not on really and I don't know why it's so accepted.
p9772
aVPreaching to the choir, if I'm in a position where it's 2 of my players vs. your keeper and I can easily pass from one to the other inside the box to make it an open goal, hate to break it to you, but your defence messed up.
p9773
aVSpot on-they shouldn't put themselves in that position in the first place.
p9774
aV&gt;pretty much everyone who plays FIFA\u000a\u000a&gt;everyone who plays FIFA\u000a\u000aNo, some people have the capability to chose other words...\u000a\u000aAlso, some people aren't such sore losers that upon conceding a goal, they must insist that it's not a true goal.
p9775
aVYeah in my house we call it sweaty goal
p9776
aVmaybe no one prints cartoons....but southpark has been pretty hard on them
p9777
aVI think you've missed the point of south park.
p9778
aVThe racism in south park is making fun of racists.\u000a\u000a
p9779
aVand the point of satire is.......
p9780
aVEh?
p9781
aVDon't understand your question.
p9782
aVYou said south park has been hard on Jews.
p9783
aVI'm saying it hasn't because those times when a casual viewing might lead you to think that Jews are being mocked are actually satire.
p9784
aVThat would make your original claim incorrect.. Jews do not get a hard time on south park, in fact it is anti Semitism that gets a hard time.
p9785
aVHow does you asking me what the point of satire change that?
p9786
aVmy point is that satire is to expose issues and make fun of them.
p9787
aVThe above guy said "do jews really get no mockery".
p9788
aVI pointed out that they do, in southpark.
p9789
aVYes they are also mocking the kid who is mocking the jews.....but thats the point of satire. 
p9790
aV&gt; I pointed out that they do, in southpark.
p9791
aVThat's my point though -- they _aren't_ being mocked.
p9792
aVCartman shouting "you dirty Jew" at Kyle is South Park mocking Cartman not Kyle.
p9793
aVIn fact I can't think of a single episode in which Jews were the actual target (my memory is not encyclopedic of course, so I'd be happy to be corrected).
p9794
aVSince the writers are not targeting Jews _at all_ it wasn't correct to say "southpark has been pretty hard on them".
p9795
aVUnless you think they agree with anything Cartman says or does?
p9796
aVThe only time I can think of off the top of my head is when Cartman refuses to save Kyle unless he gives him his secret bag of Jew gold which apparently every Jew carries.
p9797
aVKyle denies this for a while then eventually reveals he *does* have a bag of secret Jew gold
p9798
aVHa.
p9799
aVGood one.
p9800
aVWell remembered.

p9805
aVCartmanland where Kyle gets a haemorrhoid and questions his faith mocks the book of Job pretty aggressively. 
p9806
aVno.
p9807
aVThe point I'm making is that they are still saying it.
p9808
aVIt is not being not said due to PC etc. 
p9809
aVSeriously?
p9810
aVJews are about the most mocked ethnic group I can think of.
p9811
aVOften by Jewish comedians!
p9812

p9813
aVCharlie Hebdo had plenty of Jew cartoons.

p9816
aVIt's sort of satirical of antisemitism though.
p9817
aVIt's generally only from Cartman, who is made out to be a jackass.
p9818
aVExactly.
p9819
aVThe whole *point* of Cartman is that he is the embodiment of what you *shouldn't* be like.
p9820
aV&gt; cheap jokes\u000a\u000aheh
p9821
aVunintended, I just wish it hadn't been, I'd have taken credit for that one :)
p9822
aVWell you have to make a distinction between followers of Judaism and people of Jewish descent.
p9823
aVThe former is fair game, criticising people's beliefs is fine, but the latter would be racism
p9824
aVWe tend to laugh at ourselves more.
p9825
aVJust watch curb your enthusiasm and south park!
p9826
aVPlus having token Jew in comedies (BBT, American Pie etc) is so common.
p9827
aVIt's part of our heritage to laugh at ourselves.
p9828
aVAnd no one else can really make fun of a religion that already laughs at itself and accepts humour.
p9829
aVThere's just no edge or self righteousness to take the piss out of.
p9830
aVQuote of Stephen Fry on QI: Why do jews have such big noses?
p9831
aVBecause air is free.

p9833
aVIf that's satire, I'd hate to see the hecklers.
p9834
aVWell if we're going by satire, Charlie Hebdo made an awful lot of antisemitic comics as well.
p9835

p9836
aVThat's it, I've seen Muslims tweeting that 'they'll print cartoons about Mohammed but they won't touch anti Semitism' and I was thinking that's probably bullshit.
p9837
aVMost satirists I've experienced the work of tend to attack any target so long as it's 'punching upwards', that is, they're generally not attacking the Government because it's left or right, but because it's the government and it's being some blend of incompetent or evil.
p9838
aVSame goes for religion, countries or any other grouping of power.
p9839
aVPeople think that due to the conspiracies of how the Jews run the world.
p9840
aVYeah, no.
p9841
aVAntisemitic events in the UK have increased exponentially, and antisemitic hate crimes account for 60 percent of U.S religious based hate crimes.

p9843
aVFair enough, news to me as a Brit, I've never personally seen any, but I'm willing to take new info on board.
p9844
aVI'm not quite convinced that 'jew' as slang for mean, tightfisted etc is really a racial slur up there with 'nigger' however.
p9845
aVI wouldn't personally use it, I grew out of that after school, to me it's from the same era as saying something bad is 'gay', it's from another era and people need to leave it behind, but I don't rate it as high on the scale as nigger or faggot.
p9846
aV'Kike' isn't used much, but I'd put that up there however, and wouldn't use it.
p9847
aVWhen I was like eight tho, and we'd be out on the fields at lunchtime at school, often someone would throw a 2 pence coin at someone, yell 'jew bundle' and everyone in vocal range would pile on them to retrieve the coin.
p9848
aVYou'd be hard to pushed to find any of them able to explain why 'jews' were so desperate for 2p, or even what a jew was.
p9849
aVSure it's irresponsible and not right, but there's 'levels' of racism and offence.
p9850
aVWell because 'jew' isn't always offensive, as in "There are two Jews in here.
p9851
aV" It's mostly in the tone you use it.
p9852
aVBut yeah, just avoid 'kike', thanks.
p9853
aVI don't really think these cartoons in Charlie Hebdo were punching upwards though.
p9854
aVThey're more punching downwards - racist and offensive cartoons aimed at a minority that is already having a difficult enough time in France. 
p9855
aVFrom what I've seen they've mainly having a pop at extremists tho, maybe there's stuff I've not seen that's been just at muslims in general.
p9856
aVI've got no problem with people ripping on Islam, but I don't think it's so clear cut to take the piss of muslims personally or individually.
p9857
aV(copy paste that to any religion.
p9858
aV)  Extremists tho, they've already decided to be batshit crazy, so they're fair game imo.
p9859
aVCould you explain how a cartoon of Muhammed posing for a porno, or a cartoon of Muhammed's naked arse from behind with a star to obscure his arsehole, is 'punching upwards'?
p9860
aVThat's just lazy and offensive to all Muslims.
p9861
aVAlso, the cartoons are full of grotesque hook nosed Muslim figures, honestly some of them look like Nazi era cartoons of Jews.
p9862
aVObviously I think the murders of the journalists were completely wrong but that doesn't mean I have to support what they were doing.
p9863
aVI think they were being dicks, to be honest. 
p9864
aVAh well those I didn't see, and I can side with you on that.
p9865
aVTho, there is the argument to be made about responses to threats about depicting him vs freedom of speech.  
p9866
aVThe argument in most places, especially on reddit, seems to be pathetically childish.
p9867
aV"These cartoons offend Muslims, the murderers were Muslims, let's reprint the cartoons.
p9868
aVOh, and where are all the moderate Muslims to condemn this?
p9869
aV" These cartoons are offensive to almost all Muslims, not just the extremists.
p9870
aVHow is it helpful to then cast being anti-terrorist murders as being pro-offensive cartoons?
p9871
aVAnd being in favour of free speech doesn't mean being in favour of people using that free speech to be absolute arseholes, or that you should show your support for free speech by being as offensive as possible to a minority group which is already widely vilified. 
p9872
aVIndeed, turns out I'd only seen cartoons in response to the attack, which tended to be thought out pieces of satire based on the killings.
p9873
aVAnything that's just lazy muslim bashing however, they're free to print them, and sure as hell shouldn't die for it, but, they should be criticised for it, not get a free pass just because muslims are an unpopular, easy target.
p9874
aVI've seen one or two of them, and yes...
p9875
aVWhile I'm not religious, if they portrayed someone I care about, I would be grievously offended.
p9876
aVFreedom of speech aside, there are context-dependent lines you just shouldn't cross.
p9877
aVContext-dependent, because if it's a stand-up show or otherwise overtly 'supposed to be comedy' setting, I think the lines are/should be relaxed.
p9878
aVJust randomly portraying Muhammad as a stereotypical curtain wearer getting arse raped...
p9879
aVI think it goes beyond the realm of 'begging for trouble' and back out the other side.
p9880
aVTrouble doesn't mean machine guns and bombs though.
p9881
aVThat's just the worst possible response to such a thing.
p9882
aVA decently-sized 'fuck you' would cover it, seriously.
p9883
aVImagine how it would go down if I went round putting Hitler 'taches on all pictures of David Cameron, or drew a comic strip portraying Nigel Farage as a male prostitute.
p9884
aVPeople would be offended, and those guys aren't even religious figures.

p9886
aVSatire on Jews is not antisemitism.
p9887
aVJust as much as satire on Islam is not Islamophobic.
p9888
aVNo I'm allowed to burn that building your honour.
p9889
aVIt is satire and thus protected speech.
p9890
aVThis is such a _beautiful_ tweet
p9891
aV139 characters too.
p9892
aVI think this tweet is 1 character away from being the single greatest possible tweet.
p9893
aVYeah, a full stop.
p9894
aVThat would have been it.
p9895
aVHad he put the .
p9896
aVthere, I think the twitter would be all done now.
p9897
aVIs this The Sun he's referring to?
p9898
aVI could have sworn Frankie Boyle wrote for The Sun at some point. 
p9899
aVThe funniest thing I read today was a snippet in The Times about The Sun making a complaint to the Met about their use of RIPA powers to obtain a Sun editor phone records.
p9900
aV[Not The Times because paywall](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/court-set-decide-whether-met-police-broke-law-secretly-grabbing-sun-phone-records) \u000a\u000a[This is the same paper that wrote a defence of RIPA not two days ago.
p9901
aV](http://i.imgur.com/aZCH6B1.png)\u000a\u000aThe hypocrisy is incredible. \u000a
p9902
aV"We must slay the Grim RIPA!".
p9903
aV"RIPA is our best defence against terror!
p9904
aV"\u000a\u000aQuite.
p9905
aVPretty sure it's The Daily Mail.
p9906
aVThey're the most likely to passionately defend the Queen, and this article is dated today:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2902756/Fanatics-fear-cartoonists-NEVER-silenced-Mac-Mail-reveals-stance-Paris-massacre-says-stand-defend-freedom-speech.html
p9907
aV[deleted]
p9908
aVWhat's irrelevant about it?
p9909
aVI genuinely don't know.
p9910
aVI would guess The Mail.
p9911
aVI think the person above you thought they were being facetious and trying to throw some dirt at Boyle.
p9912
aV[deleted]
p9913
aVNo, the original commenter is legitimately asking if Frankie Boyle is referring to the sun.
p9914
aVAll he did was ask if it was the Sun he used to work for because Frankie put "I used to work for", that is all. 
p9915
aV[deleted]
p9916
aVHe's not, and I misread.
p9917
aVHe did used to work for them, though, I'm pretty sure. 
p9918
aVYes he did.
p9919
aVHe wrote a column for the The Sun AFTER talking about the queen having a haunted pussy.
p9920
aVSo I guess it's not The Sun he's referring to.
p9921
aVProbably the Daily Fail. 
p9922
aVQuestion for the group : *did* a paper ever try to have Frankie arrested and charged with obscenity for a joke?
p9923
aVI remember the joke being reported on, and some Ofcom investigation, but not this?
p9924
aVDespite the multitude of replies, I can't see any actual evidence that they did.
p9925
aVHmm.
p9926
aVGood old Reddit.
p9927
aVThis is going a while back now.
p9928
aVThe funny thing was that when the joke was first broadcast there was no complaints what so ever.
p9929
aVIt was only after the ross/brand thing kicked off that people complained on a rerun of the show.
p9930
aVThough frankie has been in court over one of his jokes, IIRC he sued the mirror for libel.
p9931
aVCalled him a racist comedian or something. 
p9932
aVAnd the Katie Price thing got him in hot water too
p9933
aVEven if they did they weren't succesful. 
p9934
aVWouldn't be surprised if the Sun talked to one of their lawyers to decide if it was breaking any laws, just to fill out a double page spread that they could fill with Boyle's name and a huge photo of his big beardy face.
p9935
aVmaybe they just don't like you Frankie
p9936
aVSo true, Frankie Boyle annoyed me a little over the whole Scotland referendum (I'm a unionist) but he does make some good points and can be genuinely funny.
p9937
aVAnd to be fair the referendum was a pillar of free speech and democracy in this country - plenty people made their views known, that's for sure.
p9938
aVFrankie Boyle is from Pollokshaws, a suburb of Glasgow you could probably power off of the burning hatred of the English.
p9939
aVHe was never in a million years going to be a unionist...\u000a\u000a
p9940
aV"you are now approaching, Pollockshaws West.
p9941
aVPlease mind the gap when alighting from this train.
p9942
aV"
aV&gt;  you could probably power off of the burning hatred of the English\u000a\u000aWhat?
p9943
aVDo you have any examples of widespread anti-English sentiment in Pollokshaws?
p9944
aVOr is "hatred of the English" code for left wing independence supporting?
p9945
aV&gt; Pollokshaws, a suburb of Glasgow you could probably power off of the burning hatred of the English\u000a\u000awat
p9946
aVIt's funny really how everyone just accepts the widespread racism against the English.
p9947
aVAll of this stuff goes both ways.
p9948
aVThere are plenty of English and Scots who love each other, and plenty who are always spouting rubbish about each other. 
p9949
aVCome off it.
p9950
aVYou're in Scotland and you're from Essex, are you telling me you don't experience any anti-English comments?
p9951
aVI get it all the time.
p9952
aV&gt; plenty who are always spouting rubbish about each other\u000a\u000aI actually don't get as many bad comments as one might think.
p9953
aVI do have to try and right some misinformation about how easy they think we all have it down south, I suppose.
p9954
aVGood-nature ribbing abounds, though!
p9955
aVMy experience is when there is a pot hole in the road, a nationalist will always be nearby to tell me it's because of the English.
p9956
aVHah, really?
p9957
aVMaybe it's because most of the people I know up here have a lot of English blood in their families, and I work at a small company which generally leans towards pro-union.
p9958
aVMost people don't care, most people just want to get on with their lives.
p9959
aVHowever, there are a few people I know with a deep hate for English people, even though they have literally nothing to complain about in their lives.
p9960
aVNever seen this.
p9961
aVEver think, maybe yer just a cunt?
p9962
aVracism against the english?
p9963
aVwhat?
p9964
aVGo spend some time in Scotland. 
p9965
aVyou can't be racist against a country\u000a\u000aI appreciate they might not like the english in parts of scotland, but that's not racist, 'english' isn't a race\u000a\u000aedit: go ahead and 'downvote', doesn't change the definition of words\u000a\u000a
p9966
aVSo you're saying England has no significant cultural identity?
p9967
aVYou can be racist against the Welsh, the Scottish and the Irish, but not the English?
p9968
aVthat's not at all what I'm saying\u000a\u000anationality does not equal race - you can be white &amp; english, and black &amp; english etc\u000a\u000athe word you're looking for is bigoted or discriminatory, not racist
p9969
aVIn law it is racist btw.
p9970
aVWas redefined by the tories.
p9971
aVSorry to disagree but racism doesn't have to be tied to a race.
p9972
aVIn fact, there's not really any such thing as race in any strict sense.
p9973
aVe.g.
p9974
aV[What race is this person?
p9975
aV](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Corazon_Aquino_1986.jpg)\u000a\u000aMoreover, "Jewish" is *absolutely not* a race, but we can all agree that the holocaust had definite elements of racial motivation.
p9976
aVso, in our view, what are the human races?
p9977
aVIs there an accepted list?
p9978
aVIs it based skin colour, or some sort of genetic pedigree?
p9979
aVQuite a few at the Olympics.
p9980
aVUsain Bolt is famously a racist - makes fun of swimming races, for instance. 
p9981
aVoh you!
p9982
aV:)
p9983
aVExactly!
p9984
aVIt baffles me why the understanding of racism is so poor a lot of the time.
p9985
aVWhy the fuck do people obsess over the definition of racism?
p9986
aVIt's like you want to legitimise your illogical hatred towards people.
p9987
aVAnd now the goalposts are shifting.
p9988
aVThis is why definitions and agreed meanings are important.
p9989
aV"When I said racism, I meant *my* definition of racism!
p9990
aV"\u000a
p9991
aVEnglish is a race?
p9992
aVBiologically speaking humanity doesn't have "races".
p9993
aVSo it is commonly applied to nationality as well as ethnicity and sometimes religion. 
p9994
aVWell if we accept that you can be racist against Chinese or Indians, or the people of any other country, then yes.
p9995
aVChina and India are in Asia, so are we talking about racism against Asian people?
p9996
aVHating another country would be xenophobia.
p9997
aVAre you saying that racial abuse for Chinese and Indian people would be the same?
p9998
aVThat you would see a racist insulting an Indian by slanting their eyes, showing their top teeth and saying "Sore finger?
p9999
aV"
aVSorry if I misunderstand you but "Asian" is not a "race".
p10000
aVIf you're interested, here's a [map of human migration](http://www.musicearth.name/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Geno-Project-Human-Migration-Map_print-590x421.jpg).
p10001
aVBy law, it counts as racism.
p10002
aVHaters going to hate.
p10003
aVAre you trying to stifle free speech! 
p10004
aVFound the UKIP voter, guys \u000a\u000aEdit: people in a position of privilege can't play the victim.
p10005
aVWhat widespread anti-english 'racism' are you talking about?
p10006
aVI've never seen it.
p10007
aVI'm English and old enough to have seen any - if it existed. 
p10008
aVSpend enough time in Scotland and you'll find it. 
p10009
aVAnd that's widespread, is it?
p10010
aVJust Scotland?
p10011
aVScotland's population is more than 5 million.
p10012
aVedit: not saying they're all xenophobes/racists, but that population size is nothing to be sniffed at, even if just one per cent had anti-English views that's 50,000.
p10013
aV5 million is half a Greater Manchester.
p10014
aVC'mon.
p10015
aVYou're not a repressed victim of anti English hate.
p10016
aVGet some perspective.
p10017
aVEdit: I'm wrong.
p10018
aVIt's 2 Greater Manchesters.
p10019
aVThe 'widespread racism against the English' is still a silly statement to make.
p10020
aVDon't bring us into this.
p10021
aVI used it for comparison.
p10022
aVI'm a Mancunian. 
p10023
aVYou again?
p10024
aVYou really are a thick fuck aren't you?
p10025
aVGreater Manchester, 5 million?
p10026
aVTry half that, not 10 million.
p10027
aVOr do you often lie to support your points, then claim "it's just a joke" when you get pulled on it?
p10028
aVApologies, you're right.
p10029
aVScotland's entire population is double Greater Manchester.
p10030
aVYou need to get over your potty mouth, though.
p10031
aVThere's really no need for it.
p10032
aVStill not seeing this widespread racism against the english, though.
p10033
aVI'm from Manchester myself.
p10034
aVI've been in Scotland for the past 3 years.
p10035
aVMost people don't care and just get on with their lives, but with the build up to the referendum there was a lot of anti-English sentiment I experienced from the nationalists.
p10036
aVA lot of people would blame the English for a lot of things, some of them would blame the English for anything, literally anything.
p10037
aVI sat there watching TV with one such person during the Somerset floods, she was foaming at the mouth in anger that English news was on her TV.
p10038
aVThere are a lot of people up here who do hate the English but are never really able to have a proper debate, because as soon as you argue with them logically they can't really justify it.
p10039
aVI love Scotland, I want to stay, most people are absolutely great.
p10040
aVBut to think there's nobody here that hate English people is just wrong.
p10041
aVIt's exactly the same as a racist, they might have coworkers that are black or Asian, they might work and get along with them every day, yet will generalise and blame them for things in the world.
p10042
aVSo forgive me for being angry at your totally ignorant comments, I highly doubt you have any experience of it at all.
p10043
aVBut you just hit me as another UK Redditor who knows all about the world from the comfort of their bedroom, while banging on about UKIP.
p10044
aVThanks for engaging at a more reasonable level.
p10045
aVThere's a real difference between hating people over a fairly arbitrary border and racism.
p10046
aVThere's always people who hate other people for any petty (or real) reason, but unless you're talking about systemic discrimination (and not just 'no blacks no irish' signs, but the subtler things) it's not one of the discriminatory -isms.
p10047
aVI will bang on about UKIP, because they're a dangerous band of delusional lunatics, and I find it disturbing when people who are otherwise rational buy into their slippery narratives.
p10048
aVThe comment I originally made was actually much longer, but while typing on a phone the invocation of 'UKIP' became a much better shorthand for what I was saying.
p10049
aVAre you fucking serious?
p10050
aVYou called him a UKIP voter because he said there's racism against English people?
p10051
aVYou dumb fucker.
p10052
aVThis subreddit is like every self-hating leftie nutter grouped together.
p10053
aVWidespread racism against the English.
p10054
aVNot seen any evidence yet, but keep up the sweary language, it's a Real Alternative to facts. 
p10055
aVYou just called him a UKIP voter because his opinion was everyone accepts widespread racism against the English.
p10056
aVThis is probably the most moronic statement I've seen this year so far and is the reason I often leave this shitty sub for weeks on end.
p10057
aVHow the hell can you say people in a position of privilege can't play the victim?
p10058
aVAre you saying everyone in England is in a position of privilege, other countries in the UK are not, so it's ok for people to hate English people but not the others?
p10059
aVHmmm, it was a bit of an odd comment but that is exactly the sort of thing "those people" say sometimes.
p10060
aVProbably a bit more EDL than UKIP tho.
p10061
aVKeep overreacting though, how's that blood pressure?
p10062
aVIt's the double standards that is annoying.
p10063
aVThough I should take it lightly, /r/unitedkingdom is mostly lefties that have never had any real life experience, and sit on the internet moaning about UKIP or some other make-believe fascists they desperately wish existed.
p10064
aV&gt; And to be fair the referendum was a pillar of free speech and democracy in this country - plenty people made their views known, that's for sure.
p10065
aVWhen people say things you agree with, or mildly disagree with, and that's okay by you, that is free speech, but does not strike at the heart of what free speech really is.
p10066
aVThe tenet of free speech is to protect what is offensive, and outrageous, and what people don't think belongs in society, and is inflammatory.
p10067
aVNo I got plenty of vitriol from some unionist quarters.
p10068
aVI still defend their right to say it.
p10069
aVThe point of free speech is being able to speak the truth to power, racists offending people is a misuse of free speech.
p10070
aVI'm not so sure, they should be allowed to say racist things, so long as they're not being actually inflammatory, and urging negative acts against people or groups.
p10071
aVThere's a difference between 'All darkies are shit at dressage' and 'all darkies need a good kicking, remember that if you see one'.
p10072
aVOf course, it's then in decent people's rights to call them fuckwits for being racist and not evolving past the neanderthal,tribal roots of their brain.
p10073
aVIn what way are racist things not inflammatory?
p10074
aVYou be ignorantly racist without calling for hatred and violence against a race, such as stupid comments about the eyes of asians or lips of black people.
p10075
aVI think it's actually quite useful to have people come out with stuff like that so people know that they're in need of a little education about how to treat your fellow man.
p10076
aVI think as a society we can let people like that know that it's not the 70s any more and they need to grow up and learn that they're sharing a planet with more than their direct family now.
p10077
aVWhen it's 'fuckin muzzies, we should go fuck up a mosque to pay em back' that's over the line, and inciting violence.
p10078
aVWhat about racist stereotypes such as "Asian people are good at maths" is that not just as offensive despite not being an incitement to violence?
p10079
aVYeah, personally I think you should be able to say that kind of thing, even negative ones about asians and women being terrible drivers, or whatever, so long as you're accepting that you might get called a stupid twat for saying it.
p10080
aVStupid twat!
p10081
aV...and I stand by your right to say that, you total git.
p10082
aVSeriously?
p10083
aVThat's all you think free speech is for?
p10084
aVWho gets to define 'proper use' of free speech?
p10085
aVAs soon as you start talking about misuse, you allow those with power to shut their critics down.
p10086
aVEven assuming this is the only point of free speech (I disagree): \u000a\u000aYou won't be able to speak the truth to power if we accept carve outs for whatever isn't politically correct, unless you assume that what is offensive at one point in time can never be the truth.
p10087
aVWhat is offensive to the mainstream has historically *often* been the truth.
p10088
aVE.g.
p10089
aVthe idea that black people deserved equal treatment was long seen as offensive.
p10090
aVAnd criticising various uses of religion to oppress has many places throughout history been seen as blasphemy.
p10091
aVAnd many things we see as harmless, others see, or have seen as deeply offensive and "misuse of free speech".
p10092
aVTo give an example of what your line of thinking can lead to: In Norway, when Monthy Python's Life of Brian was released, it was seen as a misuse of free speech on the basis of similar arguments to the one you are putting forth: It wasn't "worthy" of free speech protections, because it didn't serve a political purpose, so it was ok to ban it under anti-blasphemy legislation because it was considered a misuse of free speech to offend christians (it was the last ever use of that law).
p10093
aVClearly what is offensive is fluid.
p10094
aVBut a lot of that fluidity is contingent on people being able to say unpopular things so that unpopular viewpoints can also get heard, and possibly gain popularity (Yes, that means vile viewpoints may also gain popularity; but what you and I find vile may very well be in conflict)\u000a\u000aProtecting even *just* (and I would argue this is just a small part of what freedom of speech is about) the ability to "speak the truth to power" thus requires being vigilant about protecting speech that we find offensive *first and foremost* for the simple reason that speech that those in power don't find offensive is much less at risk of getting attacked by the state in the first place.\u000a
p10095
aVI agree they should have the right to say it, I'm just pointing out that allowing racists to speak their bile is a negative consequence of free speech rather than the point.
p10096
aVAbsolutely, whilst I'm a unionist I think the debates overall were a good thing and I would always defend a person's right (including Frankie Boyles) to make their views known.
p10097
aVI wish he was on the unionist side though.
p10098
aVAnd any separatist would get shouted down.
p10099
aVI liked the bit where people tried to get Nick Robinson fired for asking Alex Salmond a difficult question.
p10100
aVWhich he answered in his entirety, on camera, but Robinson then claimed he didn't.
p10101
aVI dreamt the part where people tried to have him fired.
p10102
aVMy mistake.
p10103
aVOh, some did call for it, never denied that.
p10104
aVNor did I agree with their sentiment, but it was all part of a greater protest against perceived BBC bias, but that's a whole other thread's debate.
p10105
aVYes it really proved that in the UK you can say you will do anything, and never have to follow up on it. 
p10106
aVDid you watch his "dissection" show of the referendum?
p10107
aVIt's the only thing Frankie Boyle has ever done where I didn't laugh once.
p10108
aVAll it showed was just how much of a poor sport and sore loser he is.
p10109
aVWhat did he do that was annoying?
p10110
aVI didn't hear any of his stuff.
p10111
aVI didn't know that happened.
p10112
aVI know there was a bit of hostility after ha made the haunted joke - which wasn't that bad anyway.
p10113
aVWhich paper tried to have him arrested and charged?
p10114
aVYeah it's OK to do it on TV but God forbid you tweet it.
p10115
aVI cant stand Frankie Boyle and find his comedy just offensive a lot of the time.
p10116
aVBut he is 100% right, it has been a bit of the joke the crap politicians and papers are coming out with. 
p10117
aVRather ironically I can't favourite this because he blocked me after finding we didn't share the same opinion.
p10118
aV*e*: yes irony isn't the right word, it was late when I posted this.
p10119
aVI don't need more than one person to tell me that, thanks anyway. 
p10120
aVSupporting freedom of speech in no way implies a duty to listen to what anyone actually says.
p10121
aVNot in any particular case, but it's generally a good idea to listen (at least sometimes) to those you disagree with most strongly to check that you haven't missed something.
p10122
aVYes but that implies no legal obligation.
p10123
aVYou have the right to speak but it's at my discretion to whether I listen.
p10124
aVExactly, people should have absolutely no obligation to listen.
p10125
aVIt's just wise policy to sometimes do so.
p10126
aVThat isn't the same thing at all.
p10127
aVYou don't have a right for people to listen to you.
p10128
aVHe isn't making up other people's minds for them.
p10129
aVWhat is the irony?
p10130
aVAll he wanted a thousand spoons but instead he got blocked on twitter by Frankie Boyle.
p10131
aVThe only irony is the fact the commenter doesn't understand what irony is.
p10132
aVNot really ironic, its the difference between him blocking you and him banning you from Twitter.
p10133
aVYeah, Frankie's a fucking hypocrite.
p10134
aVHe sued a paper because they claimed that he was racist -- after he made racist jokes.
p10135
aVGuy's full of shit.
p10136
aVBut he is mildly funny.
p10137
aVWell he did donate the money to charity.
p10138
aVIsn't that the correct response though?
p10139
aVA civil response rather than a state one.  
p10140
aVI don't like the man but since when does free speech include the right to defame people?
p10141
aVI think there are far too many restrictions on expression in the UK, it's absurd that bad jokes on twitter are seen as a criminal offence.
p10142
aVHowever this doesn't mean that people should have no recourse if national newspapers make false and damaging claims about them. 
p10143
aVYou can make a racist joke without actually being a racist, you know. 
p10144
aVIn fairness, he was directly quoting what an ex-Prime Minister had once said, which was the route of the joke: http://youtu.be/9w1-gFvDyAM
p10145
aVyou have the freedom to send letters to Chelsea Manning in prison - oh wait you don't.
p10146
aVWhy is she in prison?
p10147
aVFor telling us what our own governments are doing to us.
p10148
aVReveal how little freedom we have, get imprisoned.
p10149
aV1984 **wasn't** aimed as the USSR, it was aimed as a critique and warning to the UK/west.
p10150
aVAnd just to be ironic the UK government censored the introduction to 1984 in the original editions.
p10151
aVI'm all for for freedom of speech and pro-Snowden, but didn't Manning go to jail for indiscriminately releasing military intelligence &amp; records, including details regarding ongoing operations that could legitimately have endangered the lives of US personnel?
p10152
aVAll while she was a paid member of the military, having signed all sorts of official secrets documentation?
p10153
aVSnowden has his stuff publicised by a vetted journalist after they painstakingly ensured nothing was released that could directly endanger US lives.
p10154
aVManning just flashed a hard copy and uploaded the whole lot.
p10155
aVI don't consider leaking top secret government documents by one of it's employees to be *freedom of speech/expression* but what you posted about [Manning isn't correct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning#Publication_of_leaked_material)\u000a\u000aManning gave all of the data to Wikileaks, which in turn published the leaks through the New York Times, Guardian and Der Spiegel.
p10156
aVThese news papers and journalists have not been prosecuted (that i'm aware of) for publishing this information, as it is the defacto freedom of the press that allows them to do this.
p10157
aVManning went to prison for espionage and theft, not for exercising their right to freedom of speech.\u000a
p10158
aVManning is a hero in the true sense of the word, in the future she may be acknowledged as such.
p10159
aVOk, why?
p10160
aVIs any of what I said not correct? 
p10161
aVHer revelations have amply demonstrated how many lives are at risk when whistleblowers keep their mouths shut.
p10162
aVThe evidence she's been responsible for placing in to the public domain shows American (and allied) involvement and/or complicity in hundreds if not thousands of murders, tortures, and rapes (including of countless civilians, and including executions of the elderly and children, and the operation of death squads), rampant corruption between corporations and the US government over GMO, arms/weapons, etc., and acts of coercion, espionage and sabotage against allied countries in Europe.
p10163
aVNone of which we would know without Manning, and she's paying a huge price for it.
p10164
aVIn fact, arguably, her revelations brought an end to the Iraq occupation (at least until now).
p10165
aVI broadly agree with you.
p10166
aVHowever, one thing I've been thinking about more and more recently is what's possibly the elephant in the room.
p10167
aVManning acquired the information in a manner that's often presented as the NSA's wet dream: an extremely broad, unrefined search where all information's laid bare in the hope of confirming/finding actual crimes against Humanity.
p10168
aVNo discretion, simply a blanket method of surveillance.
p10169
aVWhilst I believe Manning did a great deal to highlight just what's been hidden under the guise of National Security, I also think she could have done things a lot, lot better.
p10170
aVThere are legitimate secrets that can influence the dynamic between countries, that do need to be kept under wraps.
p10171
aVAnd the left and right are both at it.
p10172
aVManning is not British and was not prosecuted under English law. 
p10173
aV&gt; Why is she in prison?
p10174
aVFor violating a contract that she willingly signed as well as putting members of the military in danger.
p10175
aVCall me old fashioned, but if you join the army with a specific name, you should be called by that name unless you have gained another name from your sisters and brother in arms (even if its "Assange Beatch") \u000a
p10176
aVTo me 1984 revealed more about left-wing thought in modern day Britain.
p10177
aVThe hatred of anyone who doesn't think like them.
p10178
aVI mean, look at what people say about anyone that supports UKIP.
p10179
aVOrwell was a socialist. 
p10180
aVSo what?
p10181
aVWhy do people go on about that like it sways from what he was trying to say?
p10182
aVHe was a socialist, but he understood the possible corruption.
p10183
aVHave you even read the damn book, what do you think was going on in that?
p10184
aVObviously he wouldn't attack only leftists like you do.
p10185
aVMost right-wing thought is just as close-minded as most left wing thought, don't act superior.
p10186
aVI'm against extreme left or right equally.
p10187
aVWhat annoys me is all the thick fuck lefties out there who don't think the lessons from 1984 apply to them because "Orwell socialist hurr hurr".
p10188
aVWhere in actual fact, in today's world it's the left who use the double-think to validate their hypocritical views, changing them to suit what's trending on Twitter, or what will gain them points in their social circles.
p10189
aVI don't get why free speech *in it's fullest form* is so impoprtant.
p10190
aVAs long as you are allowed to criticise those who are in power then I don't think we need to be able to verbally abuse one another.
p10191
aVBecause what's the point of life if I can't call everybody a cunt?
p10192
aVWhat is the definition of verbal abuse though?
p10193
aVClaiming offence is now seen by many as the ultimate trump card.
p10194
aVThe moment you claim it the person expressing an opinion, an idea, or now even facts must stop.
p10195
aVTo the offended or those acting on behalf of those that might be would say that everything they don't like is abusive.\u000a
p10196
aVIt isn't something you can define in one go.
p10197
aVThere are many examples.
p10198
aVOne would be newspapers making things up about people and ruining their lives.
p10199
aVYou shouldn't be allowed (in my opinion) to say someone murdered somebody if they didn't.
p10200
aVYou also shouldn't be able to say that yoru wonder pilcures cancer if it doesn't.
p10201
aVYou shouldn't be able to go up to the old lady down the road every morning and get in her face and say you are going to rape her.
p10202
aVThose examples are lies,libel, or threats.
p10203
aVThey aren't subjective.
p10204
aVThis is my whole point - loads of people *say* they want unconditional free speech, but they don't actually.
p10205
aVThey don't want libel, threats, etc to be allowed.
p10206
aVYou are getting confused.
p10207
aVFree speech doesn't mean shouting in fire in a crowded theatre, and libel and threats of violence are rarely considered free speech.
p10208
aVOffensive remarks about beliefs, racist opinions and stuff not on the BBC are usually the grey areas ripe for the debating society.
p10209
aVThere would be a two tier justice system if we were allowed to criticise some but not others.
p10210
aVThat isn't free speech at all.
p10211
aVYou either have free speech or you don't.
p10212
aVAny intermediate option requires audit by some arbitrator, who may well decide that your criticism of the government amounts to a personal insult to an individual, and that you should therefore be persecuted.
p10213
aVRestrictions on free speech in any form set a dangerous precedent. 
p10214
aV&gt;You either have free speech or you don't.
p10215
aVIn which case: we don't have freedom of speech, nor does any country in the world, present or past. 
p10216
aVI doubt that HM would really care, honestly.
p10217
aVAs unpleasant as this is - the same could be said about France.
p10218
aV1985 France engaged in deliberate terrorism against Greenpeace sinking the Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand waters, resulting in the death of an innocent photographer who was on board.
p10219
aVOr worse do we forget what France did to Algeria, the scale of the murder, torture, lies, destruction of a country?
p10220
aVOur society is as consistent with its principles and values as an airtight colander.
p10221
aVThis in no way compromises the tragedy that has unfolded.
p10222
aVYet our society cries in pain for itself but is happy to inflict that selfsame pain on others. 
p10223
aVBut the Queen isn't a Muslim.

p10230
aVI also love the jokes about them, even the most vulgar ones.
p10231
aVPeople need to stop being so bloody soft and get on with their lives.
p10232
aVThere are much worse things than insensitive jokes to moan about.
p10233
aVFrankie Boyle is still a cunt though - however the hypocrisy in this case is bullshit.
p10234
aVWhy would you buy a paper that tried to have you arrested?
p10235
aVHave you *seen* their crossword?
p10236
aVThere is a stunning amount of hypocrisy, freedom of speech doesn't end where peoples feelings begin.
p10237
aVAlso, if this is about the 'my pussy is haunted' joke, sign me up on the royal payroll and you can make jokes about the supernatural tendencies of my genitals all day long.
p10238
aVFuck, I'll pose for a close up and you can put it on the back of the 5p coin, it'll be big enough.

p10543
aVI moved to the USA 8 years ago.

p10731
aVWeirdly (although it's confirmation bias I suppose) I was only just this morning thinking about a set of stories he read/performed that I used to have on cassette: [Grim Tales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRi-v_7cJ_U).
p10732
aVI've never actually *seen* them, though.
p10733

p10745
aVHe was without a doubt my favourite comedian, especially when he was with Ade Edmondson.
p10746

p10891
aV?\u000a\u000a
p10892
aVIf you were to compare his fame and recognition to Rowan Atkinson, Fry and Laurie or Elton and Curtis while doing practically as much as them I feel he didn't become as big as he deserved.
p10893
aVI think he took the choice in the mid 90s to get off the celebrity and media merry-go-round (yes I know he continued to do stuff).
p10894
aVHowever in the 80s he was, arguably, the leading alternative comedian of his day bringing about the mass cake and circuses you see today.
p10895
aVHe passed the baton over earlier than most of his contemporaries.

aVWhat do you think you're doing, pig?
p11030
aVDo you really give a fig, pig?

aVAnd what's your favourite sort of gig, pig?
p11032
aVBarry Manilow\u000a\u000aOr the black and white minstrel show?\u000a
p11033
aVI remember going to see Bottom Live when I was 16 with my dad..
p11034
aVI was in hysterics.
p11035
aVI still quote Bottom to this day.
p11036
aVGodspeed you magnificent b'stard! 
p11037
aVIn the early to mid 80's there were two comedies that got me into uncontrollable fits of giggles.
p11038
aVAnd those shows were The Young Ones and Blackadder.
p11039
aVThere were other comedies we watched as a family back then such as Hi-De-Hi, Allo Allo, The Good Life.
p11040
aVBut none of these made me laugh like these two comedies did.
p11041
aVAnd of course Rik Mayall was a big part of this.
p11042
aVThe Young Ones had a big impression on a 6 year old me.
p11043
aVIt had plenty of adult humour that at the time I did not understand.
p11044
aVBut at the same time a lot of childish slapstick humour which would have me laughing all the way through.
p11045
aVRik's performance in this was outstanding.
p11046
aVAnd though he repeated similar comedy later in the likes of Bottom, it never quite captured the pure anarchy humour the Young Ones had for me.
p11047
aVLikewise Blackadder, still my joint favourite (with Red Dwarf) comedy of all time.
p11048
aVHad some very good adult humour, but also much that a young child could appreciate.
p11049
aVAnd though Rik was in it very little.
p11050
aVWhen he showed up as Flashheart he stole the show.
p11051
aVWhich is no mean feat considering the many great talented actors and comedians there.
p11052
aVAt the time he was by far my favourite character on the show.
p11053
aVSo I am very sad to hear of Rik Mayall's death.
p11054
aVA man who helped form my early sense of humour and thus will always have a special place for me.
p11055
aVHow shit.

p11062
aVOne of his last roles was playing the unhinged, harrassing father in [Man Down](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3063454/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1) with Greg Davies.
p11063
aVThe running gag consisted of him tormenting his son (Davies) and then feigning innocence around the mother.
p11064
aVIt was usually a highlight of the show.

aVI've just gone on his twitter and it now says his last post was today and he has only 300 followers.
p11069
aVWhereas earlier he had 20k followers and the tweet was a year old.
p11070
aVWhy would that be?

p11088
aVSeems no-one's mentioned his most recent role, playing, in a genius piece of casting, Greg Davies' dad in 'Man Down'...but, as ever, he's really just playing a complete bastard.
p11089
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf-2abP8fgY\u000a\u000aIt's a damned loss to the world of comedy, for sure.

p11093
aVVery sad.

aVGod damn it I can't believe he's gone.
p11097
aVSpent my life watching his work.

aV~~Dear Sir or Madam~~\u000a\u000a~~Recently it has come to my attention that PC World and Curry's are using some very dodgy, possibly verging on illegal, tactics in order to milk more money out of their consumers, for a service that they do not need.~~\u000a\u000a~~Three to four weeks ago, I visited the Hove branch of PC World/Curry's in order to collect a reservation that my housemate had made the same day.
p11271
aVUpon arriving, we were told that whilst the laptop that we had reserved for £449 was in stock (the Lenovo Flex 14), the only ones they had available had had a "set-up" service that came with the laptop.
p11272
aVThis "set-up" service includes a USB stick with a backup of the PC's files and nothing more - yet, a new laptop comes with a backup partition pre-installed for free.~~\u000a \u000a~~We refused this price as it was not the price that we had reserved the laptop for.
p11273
aVWe were then informed by the sales assistant immediately that he would be able to drop the price down to £25.
p11274
aVWe refused again, and he countered with the offer of dropping the price down again, to £10.
p11275
aVAt that point we had had enough and just wanted to purchase the laptop, so we bit the bullet and cut our losses of £10.~~\u000a\u000a~~This had obviously raised red flags, but not as much as it has today.~~\u000a\u000a~~Today me and my father visited the Derby branch of PC World/Curry's, after reserving an ASUS 2-in-1 laptop for £500.
p11276
aVSure enough, when we arrived, we were informed that they did not have the laptop in stock without the set up service.
p11277
aVAfter we refused, and I had told the sales assistant what had happened in Hove a few weeks prior, the price was again brought back down to £25.
p11278
aVThis is when we decided to leave the store.~~\u000a\u000a~~These events show that this is a tactic that is being used nationwide, and it is likely that hundreds, if not thousands, have been subjected to this absolutely useless £35 charge, without knowing the inherent value (or lack of) of this backup - which as I stated before, comes on the recovery partition on the laptop.~~\u000a\u000aRevised letter:\u000a  \u000aRecently it has come to light that Curry's PC World are falsely advertising the availability and prices of their laptops, using a \u2018bait-and-switch\u2019 strategy, meaning that the price the customer pays is often £35 more than the price that they had reserved the laptop at, or had seen the laptop for on the shop floor.
p11279
aVThree to four weeks ago, myself and my housemate reserved a Lenovo Flex 14 laptop for £449 on the Curry\u2019s PC World website for collection in Hove.
p11280
aVHowever, when we arrived at the store we were told that they were out of the \u2018regular\u2019 laptops for £449, and only had laptops that had been \u201cset-up\u201d \u2013 the definition of this being the inclusion of a USB recovery stick.
p11281
aVWe were then informed that this would cost an extra £35 on top of the RRP, making the price £484 instead of the £449 price we had reserved the laptop for.
p11282
aVAfter refusing to pay this price, the shop assistant made a counter offer of £25.
p11283
aVWe again refused this, and he offered it again to us for £10, rather than the original £35.
p11284
aVAt this point we decided to cut our losses after driving especially to the store to pick up the reservation, and paid £459 rather than the £449 the laptop was reserved at.
p11285
aVNow, a few weeks later, my father had also reserved a laptop for collection at Curry\u2019s PC World in Derby.
p11286
aVThe price of this laptop was £499.
p11287
aVYet, again, as we went to pick up the collection, we were informed that there were no \u2018regular\u2019 versions of these laptops left either, only those bundled with the 'KNOWHOW' recovery USB, and we were told yet again that we would have to pay £35 extra if we wished to purchase the laptop.
p11288
aVWe declined, and he offered to give us the laptop for only £25 extra, which would have made the price £524 \u2013 not the £499 price that was advertised and reserved at.
p11289
aVWe then decided to leave the store.
p11290
aVThese tactics are being employed by Curry\u2019s PC World nationwide, with an increasing number of people starting to complain about this \u2013 especially as they had not realised exactly why they were paying more money than the RRP.
p11291
aVThis poses a risk especially to the elderly and less technologically inclined.\u000a
p11292
aVPatrick from Which?
p11293
aVhere.
p11294
aVThanks for getting in touch, I'll raise this with our research teams as it's something we could look into.
p11295
aVWe recently did an undercover investigation of electrical retailers on returning faulty goods to see if they knew the customer's legal rights [under the Sale of Goods Act](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/sale-of-goods-act-faulty-products-investigation/).
p11296
aVAlthough we've seen improvement from last year, many still push you to the manufacturer (under SOGA your rights are actually with the retailer).
p11297
aVAnd this is why I subscribe to Which?
p11298
aV:)
p11299
aV/u/halk &lt;-- love this guy
p11300
aVThey're a great organisation, I'd actually be interested in working for them after completing my degree.
p11301
aVKeep in touch :)
p11302
aVSubtle of you.
p11303
aV:P
p11304
aV[deleted]
p11305
aVUsed to work there myself and it definitely had the feel-good factor! 
p11306
aVSubscribe on where?
p11307
aVI'd post a link, but that'd be a bit cheeky. 
p11308
aVMe too!
p11309
aVYou're the best :)
p11310
aVI subscribe because of the web reviews.
p11311
aVWant a product?
p11312
aVGo look at the reviews and pick the one you can afford, and know the bad points ahead of time.
p11313
aVThe "Which Local" site is also great.
p11314
aVI recently got some building work done.
p11315
aVAs per the review, the builder turned up *on the right day*, he was *on time* (08:30, before I left for work), and his bill matched the quote.
p11316
aVMany, many moons ago, I used to run the UK Philips DAP consumer care line, and it was amazing the amount of people who would contact us as the first port of call when trying to return faulty items.
p11317
aVPeople just don't know.
p11318
aVWhat's even worse is that even more were being directed to us by the retailers, who would refuse to be of any help at all.
p11319
aVWe would help regardless in some instances, but informed them for the next time. 
p11320
aVI had to complain til I was blue in the face about a Philips digisender which promised rgb scart support on the box but didn't actually support it.
p11321
aVEventually got an upgrade.
p11322
aVAh, that would be my pals in CE (consumer electronics).
p11323
aVI was in DAP (domestic appliances &amp; personal care).
p11324
aVI'd be surprised if that wasn't picked up quickly and changed.
p11325
aVIn DAP we regularly changed the text on the DFUs (directions for use) due to stupid people.
p11326
aVLike adding "Do not iron clothes whilst wearing them".
p11327
aVThat was one of my favourites. 
p11328
aVI always read stuff like that in instructions and wonder exactly how dumb you have to be to press red hot metal against your clothes whilst your precious skin is underneath it, then only go on to blame the manufacturer for not saying you can't in the instructions.
p11329
aVSome people are born and then raised to have no common sense and it makes me sad.
p11330
aVThank you very much for the response!
p11331
aVNo worries.
p11332
aVI've added you as a friend so I can remember to get in touch if I have any news :)
p11333
aVCan't thank you enough, I look forward to seeing if anything comes of this!
p11334
aVYou Sir have made me a new Which convert and have now purchased my first which book.
p11335
aVGood to know you guys are out there helping us.
p11336
aVWelcome to the family
p11337
aVWhat a dude. 
p11338
aV"Which?
p11339
aV" are doing what trading standards should be doing.. (or they should be subcontracted!
p11340
aV)
aVPlenty of people who work for Which?
p11341
aVare TSOs\u000a\u000aHow else do you think they interpret the law to protect consumers?
p11342
aVTSOs do a fantastic job on a shoestring budget, with encroachment from private companies like Capita increasingly muscling in on their territory.
p11343
aVDon't go down the lazy-thinking route that Trading Standards = lazy bureaucrats
p11344
aVabsolutely not!
p11345
aVthe bureaucracy and caveats that might be associated with such a contract could hinder them from what they are doing.
p11346
aVI'm not sure how they are funded at the moment aside from paid publications (but I would be interested to know if /u/paddysteen is able to answer that) but it doesn't seem to be stopping them staying impartial and generally doing right by the consumer.
p11347
aVWe're mainly paid for by our members, which includes our magazines and online access to our full reviews etc.
p11348
aVWe have more magazine subscribers than any other subscription mag in the country :)\u000a\u000aWe do have other services too, including consumer legal advice, an energy switching service, a service to find trusted traders in your area, money advice, mortgage advisors etc.
p11349
aVSome of these are included in the normal subscription price.
p11350
aVThese all help with our ongoing commercial success, and we've diversified our business with new services so that we can continue to work for consumers for the next 60 years and beyond.
p11351
aVYou're right that the power we have is based on the fact that we're completely independent - we have no owners, shareholders or Government departments on our back and you'll never see an advert in our mags or on our websites.
p11352
aVAnd we're a not-for-profit charitable organisation - all the money we make is invested back into the business, which also funds all the campaigns we run to change things for the better.
p11353
aVThe more you know... :)
p11354
aVYou guys ever done any looking into the Infinity stuff PC World does?
p11355
aVBasically they say you pay x monthly then after 2 years you pay y and get to keep the laptop \u000a\u000aAs it turns out it was 3 years and there's no buyout option at the end.
p11356
aVYou were renting it - rent a new one or lose the laptop.
p11357
aVOf course we should have read the fine print in the written part of the sale and completely ignored what the sales person was promising but yeah.. Just curious I guess
p11358
aVWhile I don't work for Which?
p11359
aVI do work in a highly regulated industry handling consumer complaints.
p11360
aVI've had a brief look, and it seems as though Infinity is provided through a company called RentSmart, who are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
p11361
aVThis is great news for you as a consumer, because it makes them answerable to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and the burden of proof is on RentSmart if you complain.
p11362
aVIf you genuinely believe you were mis-sold, then you need to register a complaint with RentSmart.
p11363
aVMake it clear to them that you were misadvised at point of sale, and that you either want the service they provide to perform as you were led to expect that it would, or you expect a full refund with redress.
p11364
aVMake it clear that you will take your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you are unable to reach a resolution with them.
p11365
aVBe aware that when the Ombudsman looks at your case, it costs RentSmart £550 regardless of the outcome, and they know that.
p11366
aVI presume you signed an agreement in store and that document contains the terms and conditions in question.
p11367
aVYou should be aware that this is not necessarily a reason to dismiss your complaint, as long as you genuinely believe that you would not have signed it without being misled by an agent acting on behalf of RentSmart.
p11368
aVTake 'em down Patrick, take 'em down.
p11369
aVHaving used to work at Currys/PC World for some time, I can tell you they have to do a lot of strange things in an effort to 'make more money' on these products.
p11370
aVThe principle issue is the margin on high end electricals is vanishingly low.
p11371
aVWe're sometimes talking maybe £20-50 profit on a TV or a laptop, if that.
p11372
aVIt's too competitive for them to raise the price any higher, so they are forced to sell all these services and other crap to make up the difference.
p11373
aVThe situation in the store was very much one of punishing poor performance instead of rewarding good.
p11374
aVI hear it's got better now but it used to be the case that every salesperson, and the store overall, was tracked on various performance metrics with which there were enforced minimum performance criteria to meet.
p11375
aVIt was a flawed system.
p11376
aVThe way it worked, it actually caused stores to TURN AWAY BUSINESS because losing the sale was less of a problem than not getting these arbitrary performance numbers.
p11377
aVIf they hadn't sold many TVs with extras that week, they would rather tell you a TV was out of stock than let you buy it without the HDMI cables, the Blu-Ray player, and their insurance/protection plan, because to do the latter would get them in trouble.
p11378
aVThat's right.
p11379
aVThey will often try NOT to sell you something if you won't take the extras they want to sell with it.
p11380
aVUsually by claiming it's out of stock.
p11381
aVIn an area where there were multiple stores, we'd regularly get customers coming in saying "Currys up the road said you have X of this in stock" and we know they'd sent them our way in order to avoid selling them product that would hurt their numbers.
p11382
aVWe'd also be forced to do the same, if our numbers were bad at the time.
p11383
aVEveryone in the store, managers and all, thought it sucked and didn't like it, but the system didn't really give them a choice.
p11384
aVIt was that, or face repercussions for underperforming.
p11385
aVSo to hear that they're now doing this...
p11386
aVI'm not surprised, but just know it's not the fault of the people in the store, they hate it as much as you do.
p11387
aVBut they will probably try hard not to let their product go without these bogus 'services' because they're in trouble if they don't.
p11388
aVOP saying they were dropping the price will have been the managers trying to make the sale while being able to claim they also sold the set-up service, because the numbers will only show a +1 sold for that service, not that they sold one at a discount so large it nearly erased any profit it was there to make up.
p11389
aVHi Patrick -- I finally got round to resubscribing to Which today.
p11390
aVYou give a brilliant service!
p11391
aVThanks again.
p11392
aV[deleted]
p11393
aVThe warranty is separate.
p11394
aVYou are free to deal with the manufacturer directly during the warranty period if you want to.
p11395
aVBut you've always got the Sale of Goods Act.
p11396
aVThere is something about six months, which you may be getting mixed up about.
p11397
aVAfter six months of ownership the onus is on you to prove that the fault was not due to any fault of your own (ie.
p11398
aVthat it is inherent).
p11399
aVWe have all the details for free on our consumer rights site: http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/sale-of-goods-act
p11400
aVAs a subscriber to Which and Which legal I hope you will be covering this illegal practice.
p11401
aVIt needs national exposure to prevent those without knowledge of their rights or technical expertise being exploited. 
p11402
aVThe thing is, modern laptops don't require this unless you are going to install another operating system onto it.
p11403
aVEven then, laptops these days have large recovery partitions that can re-install the complete copy of the OS ( these days usually Windows 8.1 ) without the user having to do much apart from hold down a key to boot into recovery mode.
p11404
aVHi Patrick, if it helps I had an identical experience (sales rep saying we could not buy at the standard price, that we could only buy if we accepted the setup fee) back in April.
p11405
aVI complained and Curry's response was that this was 'necessary' because a lot of customers don't know how to setup their laptops.
p11406
aVFor reference, actually setting up the laptop is no more complex than turning on a new mobile.
p11407
aVThanks for sharing.
p11408
aVThe more examples of this happening helps us.
p11409
aV*Sorry to be a pain, I rewrote the letter of complaint as the part about partitions isn't necessarily relevant, and I'd been awake for over 2 days at the time of writing the original.
p11410
aVHope the edited versions helps everybody get a clearer understanding:*\u000a\u000aRecently it has come to light that Curry's PC World are falsely advertising the availability and prices of their laptops, using a \u2018bait-and-switch\u2019 strategy, meaning that the price the customer pays is often £35 more than the price that they had reserved the laptop at, or had seen the laptop for on the shop floor.
p11411
aVThree to four weeks ago, myself and my housemate reserved a Lenovo Flex 14 laptop for £449 on the Curry\u2019s PC World website for collection in Hove.
p11412
aVHowever, when we arrived at the store we were told that they were out of the \u2018regular\u2019 laptops for £449, and only had laptops that had been \u201cset-up\u201d \u2013 the definition of this being the inclusion of a USB recovery stick.
p11413
aVWe were then informed that this would cost an extra £35 on top of the RRP, making the price £484 instead of the £449 price we had reserved the laptop for.
p11414
aVAfter refusing to pay this price, the shop assistant made a counter offer of £25.
p11415
aVWe again refused this, and he offered it again to us for £10, rather than the original £35.
p11416
aVAt this point we decided to cut our losses after driving especially to the store to pick up the reservation, and paid £459 rather than the £449 the laptop was reserved at.
p11417
aVNow, a few weeks later, my father had also reserved a laptop for collection at Curry\u2019s PC World in Derby.
p11418
aVThe price of this laptop was £499.
p11419
aVYet, again, as we went to pick up the collection, we were informed that there were no \u2018regular\u2019 versions of these laptops left either, only those bundled with the 'KNOWHOW' recovery USB, and we were told yet again that we would have to pay £35 extra if we wished to purchase the laptop.
p11420
aVWe declined, and he offered to give us the laptop for only £25 extra, which would have made the price £524 \u2013 not the £499 price that was advertised and reserved at.
p11421
aVWe then decided to leave the store.
p11422
aVThese tactics are being employed by Curry\u2019s PC World nationwide, with an increasing number of people starting to complain about this \u2013 especially as they had not realised exactly why they were paying more money than the RRP.
p11423
aVThis poses a risk especially to the elderly and less technologically inclined.\u000a
p11424
aVHow does that work with catalogue sales,  if you don't mind me asking?
p11425
aVVery.co.uk are my least favorite people,  I work phone support for &lt;game console manufacturer&gt; 	 And they just tell EVERYONE "not our problem, contact the manufacturer". 
p11426
aV[deleted]
p11427
aVIts not me they are fobbing off, I just want to be able to say to my customers "Very are giving you the run around, go back to them and say &lt;x&gt;"
p11428
aV[deleted]
p11429
aVOur procedure is "tell them to go back to the retailer".
p11430
aVI would just like to go the extra mile and give them some ammunition to go back WITH.
p11431
aVAnd to watchdog?
p11432
aVYep, I did that shortly afterwards.
p11433
aVYou should make this much more formal.
p11434
aVTerms like "dodgy" and "milking" won't lend you any credibility. 
p11435
aVDoesn't make the claim any less true.
p11436
aVIt's not a cover letter.
p11437
aVThe problem is the character limit, so I've had to use shorter terms like that in order to adhere to it.
p11438
aVThe character limit is 1500 on Which?, and 1600 for Trading Standards.
p11439
aVHopefully it'll get the point across, and if enough people complain, the vocabulary I've used shouldn't matter too much.
p11440
aVBesides, it's probably better than 90% of the complaints that they receive.\u000a
p11441
aVPesky character limits!
p11442
aVFYI you can always email us on our community site: http://conversation.which.co.uk/contact-us/ Or ping me a PM.
p11443
aVWe use this site to get evidence of emerging issues, which we then use to inspire new investigations or launch new campaigns.
p11444
aVAnd it's free for everyone to use.
p11445
aVIt's a bit like Reddit but just consumer issues (and not quite as busy :P).
p11446
aVAnd I browse Reddit too.
p11447
aVHad to cut the email down a little bit, but I think most of what's been said in the email has been covered here too.
p11448
aVThe testimonials of people who used to work there posted here provide an even deeper insight as to what is really going on behind the scenes.

(lp12658
Vappreciate the links.
p12659
aVit is pretty clear the u. s.  has been allowing/aiding isis to develop as it has now become the new rallying cry for security and safety.
p12660
aVthe danger of al qaeda  is a bit satiated at this point, so we show a few supposed beheadings of journalists and pump up the fear in order for the public to get behind another invasion (Syria and Iraq)... although Syria is more crucial given they are in the midst of a civil war and are a sovereign state. 
p12661
aVI'm also in California and I have not had issues with the DMV currently.
p12662
aVWe just had an upgrade and it's very nice. 
p12663
aVno, you wont get killed..
p12664
aVWhere are you planning on traveling?
p12665
aVAs far as I know, there are no areas in the United States where you would face violence of any kind on the basis of race, especially not Asian.
p12666
aVLike the comment before me, unless it is a random act of violence or accident, you have nothing to fear.
p12667
aVLet me know if you have any other questions about travel to the US, I am a fellow traveler and love to help out!
p12668
aVWell, you might... by a random murderer, or a car, or a rouge flying ice cream truck, or a mugger, or a tornado, or street explosions, or by the fat people on electric wheelchairs.
p12669
aVBut so far as i know you won't be killed because you are Asian in most of the US.
p12670
aVMaybe somewhere in the deep south?
p12671
aVI still doubt it somewhat.
p12672
aVSorry you were for the pipeline, and it didn't go through.
p12673
aVGet over it.
p12674
aVhttp://youtu.be/5hfYJsQAhl0
p12675
aVWhat part of my post in incorrect?
p12676
aVThe whole thing.
p12677
aVMembers of the electoral college *represent*  the people that live in their districts, regardless of whether or not they can vote, including felons and minors.
p12678
aVThat's the whole idea behind representative government and proportional allotment.
p12679
aVYour claim that the "electoral college assumes that the state's entire population can vote" is not true.
p12680
aVThey do not make that assumption.
p12681
aVFurther, your point about babies is bizarre.
p12682
aVDo children not have a right to be counted in the population?
p12683
aVDo they not have a right to be represented?
p12684
aVChildren are in the care of adults, who make decisions every day regarding their welfare and well-being.
p12685
aVVoting is no exception.
p12686
aVPlus, the census is conducted only every 10 years.
p12687
aVIt doesn't matter if a child is 9 years old or 9 days old, they are presumably in the care of an adult that is voting in the best interest of their family.
p12688
aVNo voting system is perfect.
p12689
aVIf you want to argue for popular vote or some other method, that would be perfectly valid.
p12690
aVBut let's not rise to the level of absurdity.
p12691
aVWall Street Journal Hacked, Reported AF1 Crashing in Russia 
p12692
aVThen we would be just like Canada.
p12693
aVNo, it is not illegal.
p12694
aVThank you.
p12695
aVI've found this: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20131204014742AAirvOr\u000a\u000aApparently this claim was some kind of hoax
p12696
aVIt depends on where you live.State and counties all have different rules on that...Here is a page to read,   http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/rainwater-harvesting.aspx
p12697
aVvaries by location
p12698
aVHow about we remain neutral.
p12699
aVNo wayyyy!
p12700
aVamerica, you dunno the troubles you've seen
p12701
aVCanada.
p12702
aVPueto rico? 
p12703
aVNorth Dakota,\u000aDelaware,\u000aVermont\u000a\u000aIn that order...
p12704
aVIdaho.
p12705
aVWhen was the last time you heard of anything happening in Idaho?
p12706
aVAlso Kansas Iowa and New Mexico don't seem to get talked about a lot 
p12707
aVThanks Chillhardy!
p12708
aVWhat about Maryland?
p12709
aVA little bit, and no problem ;)
p12710
aVYep this about sums up everything flatlanders do in VT.
