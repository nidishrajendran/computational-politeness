p5
aS'Thanks whoever you are &lt;3\n\nEdit:\nMagnet and torrent file can be found here: https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/'
p6
aS'What seedbox do you use?'
p7
aS'How much space do you have there and how much do you pay?'
p8
aS'https://www.feralhosting.com/pricing'
p9
aS'How anonymous is that?'
p10
aS'do they support payment with crypto?'
p11
aS'Very anonymous if you want, they do support bitcoin and are based in the Netherlands. '
p12
aS'&gt; are based in the Netherlands.'
p13
aS'This is not a good sign, our Dutch security agencies are *deep* in bed with the Americans, English and all the other usual suspects.'
p14
aS'They do all the dirty stuff you know and are active in the pipes and hosting centers.'
p15
aS'With the Dutch being so unsafe for anonymity and data, what State and/or company can you recommend as a better alternative?'
p16
aS"A lot of the NorEU countries have, relatively strong pirate parties and a good number of cryptarchists even if their governments and security agencies aren't too happy about it."
p17
aS'Most the laws on the books are better than the Americas.'
p18
aS'Other places, ie Asia and the Middle East, might be less inclined to work with western intellegence and security forces, but usually have their own problems and a smaller target pool of crypto and privacy activists.'
p19
aS'There is a lot of nuance to the way this stuff works, if you are really concerned about it you need to think of more than just the security of the data, physically, technically, and legally, but also things like traffic analysis.'
p20
aS"It doesn't matter how secure your data is in Tehran or Moscow if your local snoops are watching you send a ton of unusual traffic back and forth between unfriendly countries."
p21
aS'What is most inmportant is how the services is set up and how much you can find out about who is running it, then deciding how acceptable those different risks are to you.'
p22
aS'Even if it is in a place where it is protected by the law that wont stop anyone from going after your stuff if they really want it.'
p23
aS'Specially if you are dealing with international private security firms.'
p24
aS'Avoid sweden AT all cost!'
p25
aS'Goverment is so deep in nsa etc its not even funny .... '
p26
aS'I wish I knew.'
p27
aS'Something not anglo/euro oriented.'
p28
aS"I heard good stuff about Iceland's position on these things but I'm not really qualified to speak authoritatively on this matter."
p29
aS"All I know I've seen many reports and tech news about how Dutch agencies are in bed with the anglo/euro clique (it was even mentioned in some Snowden leaks)."
p30
aS"Also the agencies are notorious for not playing fair with attempts from parliamentary oversight committees and are playing the 'can't tell, for reasons of national securirty' card a lot."
p31
aS"But as per always the general population doesn't care ('nothing to hide bleh blah') and the agencies haven't fucked up badly enough for the shitstorm needed to reign them in."
p32
aS'There was a nice row one few weeks ago about how they have to follow strict EU laws on data collection (good) but are still allowed to use data passed from their external partners like NSA &amp; co. (bad).'
p33
aS"So basically they have incentive to collaborate with the foreign entities they're supposed to protect their own citizens against, to get the data they want to monitor us."
p34
aS'It is pretty fucked up.'
p35
aS'Check out the crypto project /r/storj .'
p36
aS"It's essentially an open source distributed dropbox alternative."
p37
aS"It's still in development, but the team looks to be very motivated and moving ahead quickly."
p38
aS"I'm pretty excited for it."
p39
aS"If anybody has any questions for us, we'd be glad to answer them!"
p40
aS'Cheers!'
p41
aS':)'
p42
aS'Is this the platform that uses P2P for backup?'
p43
aS'I saw a presentation on this a year ago in my office.'
p44
aS'I am excited as well.'
p45
aS'Thanks for the heads up!'
p46
aS'probably!'
p47
aS"The way I've understood it to work is that instead of having your stuff backed up to dropbox, google drive, etc's servers you pay other people to store your data."
p48
aS'So as a user you can pay to have people store your encrypted data, or as someone with extra hard drive space you can get paid to host other peoples data.'
p49
aS'Hong Kong.'
p50
aS'Not only are there no copyright laws there, but they have some of the biggest, most secure severs ever.'
p51
aS'A Google search will show you how deep you have to dig into your pockets for those hosts though... '
p52
aS'Russia.'
p53
aS'They actively want to piss off the American government'
p54
aS'well...this might be a bit late and not really what you were looking for but I wanna say this: Freifunk uses Mulvad.'
p55
aS'No traffic caps, unlimited clients etc.'
p56
aS'(i know what their webpage says,again: NO client limits).'
p57
aS'the experienced customer could use ANY remote-Server, start an IPSec VPN to Mulvad and run torrent that way.'
p58
aS"...and still use the same account for your phone, pc, mom etc..\n\ndon#t tell me about assange,nsa or how much of a whore sweden is to the US....mulvad has proven to be one of the most trustworthy vpn providers that is so great indeed that you don't need to search for anonymous seedboxes,proxies,tor exitnodes etc..."
p59
aS'This is the answer I was looking for.'
p60
aS'Thank you for giving a real, useful answer.'
p61
aS'I appreciate it, mate.'
p62
aS'Thanks again.'
p63
aS'Then only access the site/box while under a VPN, and pay with Bitcoin.'
p64
aS"Doesn't really matter where the box is being hosted at that point, unless you're worried about them ratting on your box's peers."
p65
aS"I didn't really understand the hosting offer."
p66
aS'What kind of hosting is it?'
p67
aS'Is it managed hosting or VPS?'
p68
aS'Do I get shell access?'
p69
aS'What can I run in there?'
p70
aS'How much RAM do I get, what CPU?'
p71
aS'Found this: https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/'
p72
aS"Didn't see anything about ram and cpu, also they keep the number of users per server secret."
p73
aS'Any information on those statistics?'
p74
aS"I can screenshot top of you want, or something else, my Linux isn't so good."
p75
aS'Could you run "cat /proc/meminfo" to check memory details, and "cat /proc/cpuinfo" to check cpu detail? '
p76
aS'http://pastebin.com/az89gT8E\n\n94 named users and 52 "number" users appear in ps aux.'
p77
aS"I'm on a Helium Server."
p78
aS'Yep, feralhosting is amazing.'
p79
aS'Super nice support and good seedboxes.'
p80
aS'Funny, I remember a few years back they had the absolute shittiest plans.'
p81
aS'Like 50-100% more expensive than the boxes I was finding elsewhere.'
p82
aS'Ended up going with whatbox.ca, which is now ironically 50-100% more expensive, all specs considered =P'
p83
aS'I can only recommend seedroots.com Ive had a 1TB unlimited traffic with 100 mbit line for 13 usd a month the past 5 months now.'
p84
aS'No complaints at all.'
p85
aS'Can you set up plex or something similar on it? '
p86
aS'Not that I know of, but contact them, their CS is friendly and fast.'
p87
aS"I don't need such big box, 50GB would be enough for me, but thanks for the info."
p88
aS'Holy fuck these prices are amazing!'
p89
aS"What's the catch?"
p90
aS'Is this some sketchy dude setting up [lackracks](https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/LackRack) in a storage unit or something?'
p91
aS"Nope, they are a pretty small company that just doesn't have a lot of customers."
p92
aS'(Their servers are usually sold out).'
p93
aS'I found out about them on that webhostingtalk website I believe, thought Id give them a try and Ive never looked back.'
p94
aS'Just felt like mentioning them here since I personally had a bad experience with Feralhosting.'
p95
aS"I was comparing them to the VPS market and I realized with a seedbox  you don't get root access unless you get a dedicated."
p96
aS"That makes more sense now since you couldn't use it for much else but that's fair since seedboxing is what it's meant for."
p97
aS'Exactly.'
p98
aS'It ends up being just that, a seedbox, and nothing else :P'
p99
aS'What is seedboxing?'
p100
aS'A machine dedicated to sending files to others over the torrent protocol.'
p101
aS'The term for uploading to others is called seeding.'
p102
aS'Hence seedbox.'
p103
aS"I guess it's more of a virtual server than a dedicated machine, right?"
p104
aS"It's cheaper to get dedi's when dealing with the requirements for seedboxes (High bandwidth, High disk space, Low disk latency)\n\nIt tends not to be virtualised when it comes to shared machines, you can isolate users easily enough :) But there are some VPS's in the wild yes I suppose."
p105
aS'http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+seedbox'
p106
aS"I'm a bit newer to seedboxing."
p107
aS'Can you or someone else walk me through how to upload this .torrent file and get it seeding?'
p108
aS'I use Filezilla to connect to my seedbox.'
p109
aS"I've only used magnet links in the past."
p110
aS'Do you not have a GUI for accessing your box?'
p111
aS'How do you normally add magnet links?'
p112
aS'Thanks, that is exactly what I use.'
p113
aS"I chose a file instead of a URL this time, and it's uploading."
p114
aS"the link is down:\nError (509)\nThis account's public links are generating too much traffic and have been temporarily disabled!"
p115
aS'https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/'
p116
aS'Hey, can you provide another link for the torrent?'
p117
aS"OP's link is dead, and I would like to seed myself."
p118
aS'https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/'
p119
aS'Hey, can you please send me a copy of the torrent file or a magnet URI? '
p120
aS'https://netzpolitik.org/2014/gamma-finfisher-hacked-40-gb-of-internal-documents-and-source-code-of-government-malware-published/'
p121
aS'You could take it to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, they might know who to turn the evidence over and their name would help give it credence.'
p122
aS'To help you in getting it out, and possibly some legal protection if you need it.'
p123
aS"https://www.eff.org/about/contact\n\nSurprisng stuff from a new user, you don't have to answer this question but have you done stuff like this before?"
p124
aS"It sounds like you haven't released confidential corporate information before but I'd be interested to know cause mayb we can help you with that too. "
p125
aS'What rechelon said about the EFF.'
p126
aS"They're reformist lawyers that do some good work, but are terrified of anything too radical or illegal."
p127
aS"There's no way they'd touch this, they aren't wikileaks."
p128
aS"In the unlikely event that I ended up on trial for this, EFF probably wouldn't even help with the legal defense."
p129
aS"They help with some hacking related cases like weev's or DeCSS, because those cases were on the edge of the law and legal precedent was being set."
p130
aS"The EFF does not defend computer hackers if it's not setting legal precedent and aligning with their reformist goals."
p131
aS'Send it to The Intercept.'
p132
aS'They have all sorts of secure drop methods.'
p133
aS'Also, this is basically what they write about already.\n'
p134
aS'The Intercept wrote a piece based on the documents\n\nhttps://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/07/leaked-files-german-spy-company-helped-bahrain-track-arab-spring-protesters/'
p135
aS'Did you send it to wikileaks?'
p136
aS'Dude for real why not wiki leaks '
p137
aS'Also - you can send it to the Guardian.'
p138
aS'Being in Europe they have a fairly direct interest, and they now have an anonymous dropbox to encourage these sorts of leaks.'
p139
aS'40GB is a lot, if you send it on a USB or HDD, remember that all mail is photographed.'
p140
aS"Computer print on a generic envelope that you pay for with cash, and send from somewhere that you don't live, preferably without cameras around, remember they also monitor license plates, and don't take your cell with you."
p141
aS"After writing that all out just so you can send a package anonymously, it's obvious that our surveillance state is completely out of control."
p142
aS':(\n\nIf you have info showing that the company sold to regimes where the program could be used to hunt down activists, they could have broken European laws. '
p143
aS"IIRC, modern printers leave behind a unique signature as an anti-counterfeiting measure, so that's one more consideration."
p144
aS'Edit: [Printer steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_steganography)'
p145
aS'Just pay a homeless person to write on the envelope'
p146
aS"AFAIK that's only laser printers, I don't think that inkjets have the DPI for something like that."
p147
aS'But inkjet tends to have a higher DPI than laser '
p148
aS"I've never seen that mentioned but iirc micoprinting isn't possible with inkjet due to diffusion."
p149
aS"But I'm not sure how many injets have really been tested to better to be safe than sorry."
p150
aS'Print it at a local office supply shop, corner shop or local library; most of them will not keep extensive CCTV or records. '
p151
aS"The Guardian betrayed wikileaks &amp; gave away wikileaks' private data for their own gain."
p152
aS"They can't be trusted."
p153
aS'Cryptome would also be a good shout.'
p154
aS'Manning personally confided in Adrian Lamo, who later ratted him out.'
p155
aS'It had nothing to do with Assange/Wikileaks.'
p156
aS'Hrm.'
p157
aS"The EFF is mostly great, and there are some really good (A) friends of mine who work there, but they don't usually solicit this kind of thing and ultimately they're a legal outfit filled with liberal lawyers who make really conservative decisions when it comes to taking risks themselves."
p158
aS"If you put them in a position where they didn't feel like they had legal defence against the state (ie you hadn't officially gotten client-lawyer privilege), I could very well see them feel forced to cooperate."
p159
aS"I got into a shitfaced screaming match with one of their lawyers late one evening in Hamburg when she declared that anything besides passive protest was unethical and she'd help the cops arrest anyone who say threw rotten tomatoes at a protest."
p160
aS"She then declared that fascism was preferable to anarchism and if a revolution came where it was us or the nazis she'd join the nazis."
p161
aS'...So you know.'
p162
aS"That's just one person and I hear she's not super officially on staff and there are amazing dreamboat solid anarchists on staff, but watch your back around the EFF."
p163
aS"They're lawyers and policy advocates, not the be all and end all one-stop-shop for net liberation struggle."
p164
aS'EDIT:\n\nSo an anarchist in some power at the EFF got a hold of me to find out what lawyer said these things and made it explicitly clear that whatever she claimed, the liberal fascist is not on staff at the EFF, and was just a volunteer lawyer with some troubling views they in no way support.'
p165
aS'Which is a distinction I can appreciate.'
p166
aS'I was arguing with Richard Stallman last week over "but without government, who would take care of the poor?'
p167
aS'" He just couldn\'t get over the fact that before Social Security there were destitute seniors.'
p168
aS"I tried to point out that people give $316 billion to charity every year, enough to feed every poor person, and that the country is 10 times richer than it was back then, but he wouldn't have it."
p169
aS'Could you tell me how you got that number?'
p170
aS'I don\'t know enough to say "You\'re wrong", but there\'s charity and there\'s " charity".'
p171
aS'Many of those donations could be going to foundations or nonprofit with specific missions that have little or nothing to do with helping the poor.'
p172
aS"I don't think this was the site that I found it but it was similar."
p173
aS'I think my number was from an earlier year.'
p174
aS"And you're right that not all of it goes towards food, some of that might go towards the environment."
p175
aS'Only a fraction of that is needed for food.'
p176
aS'https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=42\n\nHere it goes: http://m.philanthropy.com/article/The-Stubborn-2-Giving-Rate/139811'
p177
aS"There are some caveats but it's what came to mind first, do you have other suggestions for people to pass along the info to? "
p178
aS'Obvious answer: Cryptome.org\n\nThey publish anything that looks interesting and remotely credible.'
p179
aS'They are apolitical, their only stance being anti-secrecy.'
p180
aS'Yes, Cryptome is the place for this.'
p181
aS'But how many people kniw about cryptome?'
p182
aS'Everyone that should know. '
p183
aS'"Everyone that should know" that is a somewhat narrow view, directly in opposition to that of the op, who brought us this data, don\'t ya think?'
p184
aS'You asked who knows about Cryptome and got your answer. '
p185
aS'Fair.'
p186
aS"In an interview John Young said that, while he doesn't keep logs, they/he gets around 100,000 page views a day"
p187
aS"So you can leak it to the major newspapers but they tend to ignore as spam anything that isn't exclusive to them."
p188
aS"This could be sent to Morgan (famous anarchist reverse engineer of malware), but I've already let him know on twitter."
p189
aS'Wikileaks has gotten stingy about accepting things.'
p190
aS'My inclination in terms of advice would just be to spread as far and as widely as you can in 15-30 minutes on Tails.'
p191
aS'Or do some research and find those folks who were heavily involved in investigating FinFisher.'
p192
aS"Hmm.. can't say I'd disagree too much."
p193
aS"Anarchism isn't a stable form of governance and will only devolve into something much worse anyway."
p194

p306
aS'What this means in reality is, whenever the agency is seen as stepping outside these guidelines they get publicly admonished by the government in order to rectify public opinion about decisions that were made, then new executives get appointed, then the charter gets renewed anyway.'
p307
aS'For the specific section of the full charter open the .pdf "the agreement" and scroll down to page *i*:\n\n&gt;Treasury Minute\n\n&gt;Given that the New Charter will, if granted, provide that:\n\n&gt;The BBC exists to serve the public interest and its main object is the promotion of its public purposes\n\n&gt; stimulating creativity and cultural excellence; representing the UK, its\nnations, regions and communities;\n\nThe BBC exists, explicitly, to serve the public interest, as determined by the trust, as appointed by the queen-in-council.'

p451
aS'If this analysis by Citizen Labs is correct:\n\nhttps://citizenlab.org/2012/07/from-bahrain-with-love-finfishers-spy-kit-exposed/\n\nThen it seems very much that FinSpy uses GNU libGMP on its source code, right?'
p452
aS"If that's the case, aren't they obligated by law and license to release the relevant source code of their system to the public under GNU v3 or GNU v2 licenses?"
p453
aS'Nope.'
p454
aS'GPL has two major requirements:\n\n - That you make the source available to anyone who you give a binary to.'
p455
aS'- That you cannot prevent them making the source available to others.'
p456
aS"It does not require:\n\n - That you make the source available for anyone who's interested."
p457
aS'- That you make the source available to the upstream project you took the code from.'
p458
aS"Given the nature of their customer base, it's vanishingly unlikely that any of their customers would fork the product and make a version available to the general public - and even if they did, there are all sorts of clever ways you can use GPL'd code to ensure that it does not require you to open source your entire product."
p459
aS"GPLv3 eliminates some of those ways, but I'm sure I could think of a few that it doesn't. "
p460
aS"They wouldn't need to fork it, just buy the product and release the code."
p461
aS'Be that as it may - I imagine if you drew a venn diagram of "people who would release the code" and "people who would be interested in buying a copy of the product and hence obtain a copy of the source code", you would find little or no intersection.'
p462
aS'Sure, but there could be wealthy individuals who could afford to do it.'
p463
aS'The problem would be getting the company to sell.'
p464
aS"No, the LGPL doesn't require that."

aS'Who is going to enforce that?'

aS"But yes, after I finish posting what I've found analyzing the data so far, and after there's people besides my seedboxes seeding the torrent, I'm deleting the encrypted VM this was all done from and not coming back."
p473
aS'why dont you upload this to TPB and KAT?'
p474
aS"you'll get way more seeders and the link won't be taken down.... Its shocking you would even consider using something like dropbox."

p480
aS'Aye, similar applies to virtually all other crimes up to and especially murder.'
p481
aS"It's incredibly easy to get way with murder as statistics show - and even if you are caught, chances of being convicted are slim, and chances of serving any real time are even slimmer so on and so forth."
p482
aS'As David Simon wrote, there is most definitely such a thing as a perfect crime (or murder not sure which but the idea is the same).'

aS'More in there than just ping.'

aS'None of which are used in MitM attacks.'
p503
aS'All of which have legitimate diagnostic uses or could be a precursor to a targeted attack.'

p505
aS"You clearly don't know what you're talking about... \nhttp://www.cymru.com/gillsr/documents/icmp-redirects-are-bad.pdf\n\n&gt; Finally, redirects could be used by an attacker that has some knowledge\n&gt; of the network topology to inject malicious routes into a host\xe2\x80\x99s routing\n&gt; table."
p506
aS'This could case a denial of service against the host, or specific\n&gt; destinations it is trying to reach.'
p507
aS'One example of such a program is \xe2\x80\x98icgen\xe2\x80\x99\n&gt; [3], a utility developed by the author simply for research that is capable of\n&gt; sending any type of ICMP unreachable message.'
p508
aS'Older Microsoft\n&gt; variants are much more susceptible to this form of attack since less\n&gt; security precautions are put in place.'

aS'Newer operating systems make this\n&gt; more difficult to spoof, but not altogether impossible.'
p510
aS'Just read the rest of your posts, thank you for the new information.'
p511
aS'The paper you just linked is from 2002, and discusses an attack that is almost NEVER seen anymore.'
p512
aS'Why?'
p513
aS"Because it's simply ineffective."
p514
aS"While it's possible what you're seeing is an attempt at such an attack let me propose an alternative:\n\nYou're downloading a large amount of data, possibly through UDP, likely from a peer in Deutsche Telekom's network."
p515
aS'Deutsche telekom, likely has filtering rules in place to redirect high volume UDP traffic to alternative routes.'
p516
aS'ICMP redirect requests are one way to accomplish this.'
p517
aS'Even IF said ICMP redirects were an attack they would only affect the packets you were sending to the redirected hop.'
p518
aS'From your Link:\n&gt;This could case a denial of service against the host, or **specific destinations** it is trying to reach.'
p519
aS'ICMP redirects just are not effective as a MitM attack.'

aS'&gt; ICMP is the "ping" protocol.'
p522
aS'Could be a precursor to an attack, could just be verifying you\'re "live".'
p523
aS'In that case it was trying to send a redirect request to alter the router iptables.'
p524
aS'Ofcourse it was denied by the firewall.'
p525
aS'It isn\'t just a "ping".'
p526
aS"A ping can be a type of ICMP request, but it isn't the only one."

p581
aS'I cant downvote your comment enough.'
p582
aS'This isnt about "stickin it to" big companies.'

aS'This is about governmental lies and deceit covered up by powerful allies.'
p584
aS'Is there a difference? '
p585
aS"I can't downvote your comment enough either, what a coincidence."
p586
aS'You can use I2P to spread it much more safely.'
p587
aS"Freenet is the tool for something like this, because you don't only need anonymity, but also censorship resistance."
p588
aS'You can use bittorrent over i2p, can you do that over Freenet ?'
p589
aS"It will take longer then spreading it through clearnet but it won't expose those who download it."
p590
aS"You don't need a torrent over Freenet."
p591
aS'You are comparing two very different systems here.'
p592
aS'In Freenet you insert the data into the network, and then the data "exists", so you can actually go offline, change your political ideology, get arrested, killed, arrested and then killed... but the data will still be there for as long as it is popular enough.'
p593
aS'So it is completely impossible to do torrent over Freenet, but you would never want to.'
p594
aS"Read how it's working, cool."
p595
aS"There is a but, for the Freenet option to be viable the information need to be arranged into web-pages, or small files, it can't be place as one big file."
p596
aS'Due to high latency many people are afraid to download large files on Freenet; that part is correct.'
p597
aS'But actually from the technical point freenet is designed to transfer "blocks", and as such is more useful to transfer just files.'
p598
aS'That is why when you go to a freesite, what it does is actually downloading of an archive with all the files on this freesite.\n'

aS'I mean, Brand was on mainstream TV saying these ideas.'

aS'In my mind THAT, and not Brand himself, is why he got (and *should* get attention).'
p699
aS"The hypothetical 30-year activist is not being overshadowed in my mind because he's not a celebrity, but because he's not disseminating the message to a bunch of people who may have never heard the ideas expressed through the mainstream media."
p700
aS"Brand is certainly no leader of leftism, and with respect to politics and ideas of what should be done, I don't give him more credibility than the 30-year activist."
p701
aS"I'm just happy to see the ideas in the open."
p702
aS'&gt;That said, I do believe you are right about many die hard leftists using language and stringent adherence to philosphy as barriers to make ideaology as social clubs.'
p703
aS'This is terrible, because it has systematicly shut out the people who benefit most.'
p704
aS'I also think that stringent adherence to certain sub-philosophies itself it counter to the true spirit of anarchism of open inquiry and open mindedness.'

aS'My belief is that there is insufficient evidence in the real world to conclusively decide as to the proper mode of organization within a community (under what external conditions?'

aS"And celebrities saying vaguely leftist things isn't novel at all - there are plenty of vocal liberals and a few conservatives who have a much higher profile."
p826
aS"So Patrick Stuart says something about feminism - many people who already agree with him circulate that statement - and then it winks out of the social sphere except for people who've become attached to this idea of Patrick Stuart as iconic feminist, or Russell Brand as the brand of anti-capitalist (though not anti-state) celebrity."
p827
aS"I'm just not sure why you're assuming in him a sort of importance based on celebrity alone, or any sort of novelty in this."
p828
aS"What he's said isn't different from what anyone who follows social media heard or news outlets heard when Occupy was a thing - and with about as much substance."

aS'No, I was making a point that punk rockers are not considered hipsters yet fit the criteria that you lay out.'
p890
aS'It was a pretty easy point to understand.'
p891
aS'the point is, directly comparing punk rockers to hipsters is a false dicotomy, and a deflection set up by the latter.'
p892
aS"Punk Rocker is a somewhat insular scene that couln't care less what mainstream society thinks so long as they are left alone."
p893
aS'Hipsters need constant attention from mainstream society of which they are part.'
p894
aS'So, a hipster will listen to an obscure punk band because they are obscure.'
p895
aS'A punk rocker will listen to a band considered "obscure" by the mainstream, but extremely popular in their little scene.'
p896
aS'Punk is a sub culture dedicated to seeing original acts play live music.'
p897
aS'So some "obscure" band you trashed some punk rocker for loving might be his friends he shows up every saturday to support.'
p898
aS'Hipsters by definition do things that look cool, from a superficial standpoint, and they generally have no real relation to any of the ever changing trinkets and other bits of material they seem to obses over.'

aS'They act the way they do because they want some recognition from mainstream society.'

p908
aS'If Time Warner gets a couple pennies on each mask, so what?'
p909
aS'Should we not Tweet during protests too because Twitter is a publicly traded company and tweets boost their stock price?'
p910
aS'Fair point.'
p911
aS'But to keep perspective: Twitter is a single company that provides a free online service.'
p912
aS"Time Warner Inc. is one of the biggest media companies in the world and those masks aren't free."
p913
aS"I could understand why people wouldn't want to support such a company by using their maks in protests."
p914
aS"It's a bit like paying the company to protest against the system they represent."
p915
aS"I can also understand why people wouldn't want to support such a company by using those masks in protest, and for those that feel this way, I support and understand them not using them."
p916

p1009
aS"Maybe he has empathy towards those less fortunate because that's kind of where he came from?"
p1010
aS"It's cool that some rich and famous guy gets 'cred' for having a rough childhood, but I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about people who keep posting and upvoting things about him here."
p1011
aS'provide proof or GTFO'
p1012
aS"I get that Brand is topical at the moment, because of the interview and his article in the New Statesman, but I am a smidgen concerned that he's being glorified a little too much."
p1013
aS'As if no one has ever said anything like this before?'
p1014
aS"It seems like we're shooting ourselves in the foot by advocating equality, and admonishing of status, class, and illegitimate authority, and then post vapid quotes from a rich white male celebrity..."
p1015
aS"If he had said something legitimately new and profound, I'd be okay with it, but nothing he has said is new or particularly profound; it's just not commonly seen in mainstream media."
p1016
aS"So, please, I know we're all excited to have some of our crazy leftist ideas out in the open, but let's not go crazy with Brand worship."
p1017
aS'the point isn\'t that he is saying something new, but that he is someone of mainstream "importance".'
p1018
aS'He has the power to spread the message to the masses.'
p1019
aS'Are we screwing ourselves by accepting his status?'
p1020
aS"If other people want to fellate Brand, I guess that's cool, but it seems like a weird thing for anarchists to do from my perspective."
p1021
aS"I guess I don't want to accept Brand as the new mouth piece for the Left."
p1022
aS'I would prefer the Left get its shit together and empower ourselves to be mouth pieces, instead of accepting the ones the mainstream media gives us.'
p1023
aS"It's not that no one has said anything before(you kidding, who thinks that, who the fuck hasn't heard of a revolution) it's that he said it on national television where anyone who would say these things can't within 10 miles of a camera that broadcast to such a wide number of people."
p1024
aS"And yet, it's being posted to this subreddit where I would hope there is a higher standard of thinking about inequality."
p1025
aS"I don't give a fuck about Brand because there's nothing to learn from him."
p1026
aS'Post up a Kropotkin quote if you must post a quote.'
p1027
aS'At least those ideas were more original then, and better thought out.'
p1028
aS"I'm just saying, if people wanna circle-jerk about Russell Brand, /r/anarchism seems like a really strange place to do it, being that even those who are new here can ask and find way better resources for thinking along these lines."
p1029
aS"I'm really afraid that he's only getting posted around because of residual celebrity worship."
p1030
aS"Just because he was able to say these things in front of a camera doesn't make it more legitimate or true."
p1031
aS'I care significantly less about what Brand says, and far more about what my comrades are actually doing to fight inequality and privilege.'
p1032
aS"Admittedly, I wouldn't be making this much of a stink if this weren't the 10th Russell Brand thing I've seen in this subreddit in 2 weeks."
p1033
aS"This is the first time I've said anything negative about it."
p1034
aS'reddit being reddit.'
p1035
aS'I think the fact that /r/anarchism is more open than say /r/communism is part of it. '
p1036
aS'Hahaha, you must be new here.'
p1037
aS"That's just reddit being reddit."
p1038
aS"I know, that's why I'm saying something."
p1039
aS"Assuming his point of view is more or less the same as when he was neither famous or wealthy, which from all I can see probably is, I don't understand the general hate."
p1040
aS'The quote up top (if it is a quote) pretty much sums up the double standards there.'
p1041
aS'Does it apply to every other white male that ends up not being poor while continuing to be pro-anarchy?'
p1042
aS"I didn't think it automatically ruled you out of political opinion, being successful."
p1043
aS"I think you're missing the point as to why I don't like him being paraded around like this."
p1044
aS"I'm not calling him a hypocrite for being rich, now."
p1045
aS"I'm calling for anarchists to remember that the only reason he is able to say the things he said is because he's in a position of privilege, a concept anarchists vehemently criticize."
p1046
aS"So, being that he's not said anything particularly profound, I fail to see why he should be paraded around, unless people are giddy with excitement that a celebrity said something leftist that went viral."
p1047
aS"But again, he's a celebrity."
p1048
aS'He gets to say this stuff, and I worry that parading him around just fortifies the concept of privilege.'
p1049
aS"If he said something new and profound, I think that would make it okay to parade his new ideas around, but they're not new or profound, so I don't see why we should feed his celebrity status."
p1050
aS'we should bring back feudalism just to allow him to be our king!'
p1051
aS'Whats up with the sudden fascination with Brand?'
p1052
aS"There's a new thread every other day."
p1053
aS"He's said some quotable stuff lately."
p1054
aS"People want to write him off as a pompous douchebag (because he sort of is one), but that doesn't make what he says worthless."
p1055
aS'This quote is actually really good. '
p1056
aS'Yeah this is quite a good quote, as much as I lament the Brand worshipping here lately.'
p1057
aS"As much as it pains me to admit it, when a person has been skint and then becomes rich, if their opinions don't change, it does strengthen perception that ideas aligned with those opinions are more likely to ring true."
p1058
aS"That's actually quite important."
p1059
aS"The only way to resolve the class struggle peacefully is to convince the ruling classes that they have to abandon their ways, and that's helped by this sort of thing."
p1060
aS'Me without you is like a nerd without braces, a shoe with out laces, asentencewithoutspaces.\n'
p1061
aS"What's that from originally?"
p1062
aS'personally I think it is because he is a pop culture icon who has begun to spout what the lowly proles have been saying for years.'
p1063
aS"I doubt that he'll be taken much more seriously, but he will at least get widespread attention, just because of who he is."
p1064
aS"People are paying attention to this, rather than any of a number of other public figures saying similar stuff over the years, because it's in the air at the moment."
p1065
aS'It seems no coincidence that a poll was published yesterday in Britain saying that [most people are further left than the Labour party](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/519684/20131105/left-wing-price-controls-nationalisation-yougov-poll.htm).'
p1066
aS"Brand is in the ascendant, despite his previous sillinesses, because he's saying what ~~most~~ many people are thinking."
p1067
aS'Because as uncomfortable as it is to accept, the good guys are swayed by glitter just as much as the bad guys.'
p1068
aS"He's British, so all the mindless liberals idolize the words that come out of his mouth."
p1069
aS'Put on any European accent and you have liberals sucking your cock and foaming at the mouth.'
p1070
aS'I watched his video with no preconceptions that was supposed to be so great and revolutionary, all it made me want to do is kill myself for seeing how fucking brainwashed people are here.'
p1071
aS'I get it, everyone hates their job and thinks life is not fair.'
p1072
aS"It's really just the wussification of the world."
p1073
aS'What is even happening here?'
p1074
aS"We're witness to a brain digesting itself from starvation. "
p1075
aS"Couldn't possibly be that you're the brainwashed one, right?"
p1076
aS'Unless your Nigel Farage. '
p1077
aS'When is Brand going to talk about inequality in hollywood?'
p1078
aS"We're allowed to like rich people now?"
p1079
aS'Finally! '
p1080
aS"Well, as long as he didn't exploit anyone to get to where he is, and isn't using what he has against anyone unprovoked, I don't see why not.  "
p1081
aS"It's an interesting question."
p1082
aS"It is hypocritical for him to complain about inequality, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong."
p1083
aS"In our society, the wealthiest and the most powerful have the loudest voices as individuals, so it's good to have someone in the upperclass making criticisms of the system as well."
p1084
aS"Inequality can't really be solved by him giving all his money to poor people."
p1085
aS"It's probably more complicated than that."
p1086
aS"There's issues in how that wealth is distributed and such."
p1087
aS'He may be doing more good for the cause by maintaining his wealth and using that as an asset to raise awareness about inequality.'
p1088
aS"Someone smarter than me who's put more thought into this should join the discussion. "

aS'"Money isn\'t a problem when you have it; it is when you don\'t.'
p1090
aS'" -The Chase'
p1091
aS'By that logic only those starving in the third world are entitled to complain about inequality.\n\n'
p1092
aS'What an absolutely huge misunderstanding.'
p1093
aS"First of all, you don't know anything about how he spends his money, you are flying on total assumption."
p1094
aS'Even if he were a total scrooge, it means nothing.'
p1095
aS'You think the way to solve the massive inequality is by convincing all rich people to give their money away?'
p1096
aS'Come back to reality.'
p1097
aS'If that is not the case that means that the "exploitation" isn\'t that high.'
p1098
aS'If he got rid of all of his money, how would that help the cause?'
p1099
aS"The truth is, if he gave all that money to a hundred people, and they spent it, it is just as bad in societal terms as if he'd spent it himself."
p1100
aS'The money can only be spent purchasing wage labour, which only strengthens the capitalist system.'
p1101
aS"Well... that's not necessarily true."
p1102
aS"The money can be spent on destabalising the system, and deciding how this could be done is achieved better by a group than an individual, but it doesn't change the fact that the actual possessor of money can't purchase a change in the system, they can only attenuate it to serve one interest over another."
p1103
aS'In fact, having money and not spending it, and instead engaging in direct action is a pretty good idea.'
p1104
aS'The thing is that once money is spent, it still exists somewhere, and is being used to reinforce the hierarchical structure...'
p1105
aS"But then, if you don't spend it, you're losing an opportunity to force someone to work towards freeing themself."
p1106
aS'Fucking capitalism.'
p1107
aS'It shits on everything.'
p1108
aS'Whatever you do, it fucks someone over.'
p1109
aS'Depends on who he gives it to..'
p1110
aS'I bet he could afford a lot of guns...'
p1111
aS"We don't need guns, we need to disenfranchise the working class, you could have hundreds of warehouses stockpiled with guns and they'd be worthless to your cause if the people are against you, yet they even they, with all their weapons armies and nukes, will not be able to last a month if the people turn against them."
p1112
aS'To this ends the pen is indeed mightier than the sword.'
p1113
aS'Have you ever heard of torture and slavery?'
p1114
aS'Perpetrated by repressive state aperatus which can not possibly function without popular support.'
p1115
aS"I'm not taking a passifist position here by the way, there very well may be times we must defend ourselves from represion using violent force, but the idea of spending money to stockpile weapons is just absurd, especially when it can be used to spread our message."
p1116
aS'If the Revolution requires weapons, weapons will be found, until then it is waking the sleeping giant which matters.'
p1117
aS'It doesn\'t matter if you call it a "state" or not.'
p1118
aS"It's still reality."
p1119
aS"I don't understand what you mean?"
p1120
aS'The economics behind violence are interesting.'
p1121
aS'I find that labeling them is missing the point.'
p1122
aS'Labels?'
p1123
aS'In what regards?'
p1124
aS'If you mean when I referred to "repressive state apparatus" being that it is simply all means by which the state directly confers oppressive force on the people (armies, police, courts, prisons etc.'
p1125
aS"), I'd hardly call it abstracting the issue to use such a materialist term."
p1126
aS'My point was "why hasn\'t this happened already?".'
p1127
aS'People have been kept in slavery, prisons etc.'
p1128
aS'for centuries.'
p1129
aS'Claiming that guns are not necessary to fight against such oppression is pretty far fetched, without some sort of economic theory to back it up.'
p1130
aS'The problem though is not that we are being overpowered by the Capitalist class but simply that the majority of people even recognize their need to fight against exploitation to begin with, their entire system rests on us not only being controlled but also in the production and consumption of their products.'
p1131
aS'It hence falls apart very quickly when the people rise up, and when they do the lot of their abilities makes it far more easy to acquire weapons if they are needed in a revolutionary state than you could ever hope to gather in a pre-revolutionary system, for instance the storming of the Bastille at the beginning of the French Revolution.'
p1132
aS"Majority of people don't agree with marxist social theory in the first place and do not experience themselves as being exploited."
p1133
aS"Just like people don't think taxation is exploitation, like the ancaps think."
p1134
aS'Revolutions are no joke and just "standing up" with unorganized masses is hard.'
p1135
aS'For every Bastille there are 10 other revolutions where people were simply beat to submission and exterminated.'
p1136
aS'And this is exactly the issue, lack of class consciousness is fundemental to the condition of continued relations of production.'
p1137
aS"I also disagree with your second assessment, for every revolution in history the foundation of it's failure resided in a portion of the working class being directed against the other, no revolution has ever failed on the basis of being outgunned alone."
p1138
aS"if you don't think the working class is disenfranchised, you're either a student or you're simple."
p1139
aS'Well excuse me.'
p1140
aS"You know what I mean when I talk about disenfranchisement, most people still don't recognize there is even an alternative even if they are completely fed up of current capital relations, acknowledge the fundamental faults of the system the fact is people have no hope of getting out of it because there is a clear repression of alternative voices throughout society."
p1141
aS'Yeah a lot of those anti-drone, anti-tank, anti-jet, anti-navy seals guns huh?'
p1142
aS'Cause you can totally overthrow an industrial killing machine with AR15s.'
p1143
aS"I'd be more refreshed to see my neighbors and community members speaking up about it."
p1144
aS"I don't know exactly what would be solved if he gave away all his money."
p1145
aS"Personally, I'm just glad someone in the media is talking about it."
p1146
aS'As Zizek says "Charity degrades and demoralizes". '
p1147
aS'And solidarity is horizontal, not vertical :)'
p1148
aS"Him giving away his money wouldn't advance any sort of leftist cause."
p1149
aS"It might help feed or clothe a few people here and there but it's not going to start a revolution, help tear down existing hierarchical structures, etc, etc. "
p1150
aS"It's not okay that he holds such wealth, and that's something that can be used to judge him personally."
p1151
aS"But, that aside, he makes for useful propaganda, and his ideas can still be decent, even if he doesn't fully commit to them."
p1152
aS'what kind of fucking question is that?'
p1153
aS"why can't the wealthy talk about inequality?"
p1154
aS"Wasn't there an article posted earlier this week about how this dudes sexist or something?"
p1155
aS'That would be pretty hypocritical of him. '
p1156
aS"Oh for goodness' sake, isn't it possible to agree with an idea without bringing in other personal attributes of the person who expresses it?"
p1157
aS"You're never going to find someone who you agree with 100%, or is even 100% consistent."
p1158
aS"Doesn't mean you can't support him in this particular instance."
p1159
aS'I think that would require one to be open minded. '
p1160
aS"While I think it's important to encourage people on the left to challenge their own forms of privilege and oppression, I agree with this sentiment."
p1161
aS'Russel Brand even said in his article that the "right seeks converts and the left seeks traitors.'
p1162
aS'"\n\nPerhaps it is my own privilege causing me to overlook things, but I often feel there needs to be a better way for people on the left to communicate to each other about privilege and oppression.'
p1163
aS'I often see people refusing to be part of a movement because they feel it is exclusive, rather than assuming best intentions and opening up a dialogue about how people can better check their privileges and make the space more inclusive.'
p1164
aS"there's also a LOT of sectarianism within the left, which to me seems mostly like ego-stroking, considering how far back the left is."
p1165
aS"I've never found him to be so, I mean of course as a comedian you could sift through his large history of work and point out certain things he said that could be viewed as Sexist or Racist or whatever but the same can be said for all of us."
p1166
aS'I do not think his political philosophy or personality is at all particularly sexist.'
p1167
aS'There were a bunch of people going on about him forcing his wardrobe assistant to flash her breasts, but it turned out to be an unfounded rumour started by The Sun that Jezebel mindlessly repeated because it suits their agenda.'

aS"Don't see how that is be hypocritical though?"
p1171

p1172
aS'From the interviews I saw he seems genuinely sexist to me.'
p1173
aS"Nah, I've never got that impression."
p1174

aS"Of course, the answer is always that we've been set on this path from the beginning and the social structure we live in (along with relative maturity in general) doesn't provide much of any of the kind of personal growth required to start really seeing and asking real questions about it all, unless you've been a determined delinquent since a young age or had exceptionally cool parents or some other avenue to seeing beyond the schoolyard."

aS"I don't know what that means."
p2429
aS'Cherry picking is when, in business, one simply engages in the particularly good business interaction, at the expense of other business which is not so high-profit.'
p2430
aS"In situations of thought and argumentation, it would be, by analogy, to use those arguments, examples, etc., which forward one's point while ignoring others, or too many of the others."
p2431
aS'Republicans do this all the time, of course; it is their chief MO, in my opinion.'
p2432
aS'A simplest, extreme example of this would be to say, when defending the tobacco industry, that one knows someone who smoked their whole lives and never got cancer, lived to 95, etc.'
p2433
aS'In this case, when you say that the capitalists are the scum, I view this as a conclusion that is based on omitting any and all circumstance in which the idea of "scum" is applied in a manner that could be considered egregious.'
p2434
aS'Of course, it almost goes without saying that some capitalists treat the lower classes as scum, effectively speaking, in some of their practices.'
p2435
aS'If I were to cherry pick the conditions for use of the idea of "scum" here, I might simply think of preferred bad guys, which in this context is not especially hard to leave assumed.'
p2436
aS'But since I am given to consider other matters in which the term "scum" is often applied in a questionable way, and some of these may well bear on the setting here, I am inclined to offer a counter to the easy flow of the quote\'s issuance and message.'
p2437
aS"I'm not sure how this would tie into Christian matters."
p2438
aS'It is worth noting, however, that cherry picking is *essentially* a kind of capitalism, since it bases itself on underlying maneuvers that provide the necessary footing for the leg-up of the action that involves the cherry picking.'
p2439
aS'Thus, one may be inclined to view at least some anti-capitalists as capitalists themselves, which is a view I do often take.'
p2440
aS'Yet I do this not in a bland equanimity or thoroughness; I am fully in line with the basic concerns of anti-capitalism.'
p2441
aS'But the capitalism of various rebellious philosophies are, in my estimation, indeed forms of capitalism, helping to form stable, impotent, self-defeating and polemical formations rife with caricature (whose brush, so to speak, is made of the fibers precisely of cherry picking).'
p2442
aS'Ultimately, these lead in turn to the major, as of yet largely hidden formations that truly fuel the capitalist economy and mentality.'
p2443
aS"The cherry doesn't fall far from the tree..."
p2444
aS"THere's a big difference between acting poorly when you have to choose between that and starvation, and acting poorly when you have the power to do otherwise."
p2445
aS'Yes, that is a very good point indeed.'
p2446
aS"It is wrong to bring to bear much of a philosophical issue at the brink of the man's facing starvation, loss of family, one can think of any number of conditions, the Holocaust, skeletal, staggering, dysentery ridden people who might have the audacity to lift a finger against those obviously strangling them to death."
p2447
aS"So you're right, in a way."
p2448
aS'But this becomes a critical moment, what I\'ll call "lynchpunching" (lynchpin + punch), in which a given philosophy is forced in to place precisely through crisis in the immediacy of some punch which serves as a lynchpin for a given ethos, mentality.'
p2449
aS'"Look, the bullets are flyin\' now, so we can\'t get into all that".'
p2450
aS'It is no small matter.'
p2451
aS'And this is exactly why I made this point exactly here, in spite (but no real spite intended) of your point.'
p2452
aS'Lynchpunching is the rivets of the architecture of the status quo, plain and simple.'
p2453
aS'This can be seen again and again.'
p2454
aS'If you want to deconstruct war and oppression, the prisons, and what not, you *have* to identify and target precisely lynchpunching (or whatever you want to call it).'
p2455
aS"It's not an aside."
p2456
aS"It's the *criticial juncture* and it lies right at the heart of crisis, the crisis mentality, the supposed *non plus ultras* that people cite, use, enact, even incite, in order to enforce the dominant sensibility of violence and oppression."
p2457
aS'And one has to bear in mind that what is at issue is potentially vastly lower death counts.'
p2458
aS"That's no small matter. \n"
p2459
aS'Perfectly describes the posts on this subreddit.'
p2460
aS'What is the difference between 9/11 and a cow?'
p2461
aS'You stop milking a cow after 10 years.\n\n'
p2462
aS'That is a fact about cows that I did not know.'
p2463
aS'I would add the number of soldiers in all those coalition of the willing countries who mistakenly volunteered and subsequently lost their lives thinking it was for some kind of greater good.'
p2464
aS"I'd also add the freedoms we lost along the way since then.\n"
p2465
aS"..and either you're hopelessly naive or you are not."
p2466
aS"I could be wrong but isn't that [black and white thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma)?"
p2467
aS"We shouldn't have the freedoms to infringe on others' freedoms, but we still should have freedoms."
p2468
aS'Anarchy is the elimination of state/*most* hierarchy(excluding relationships like parent-child teacher-student, etc.'
p2469
aS'), and with that the leaders/legislators.'
p2470
aS'No one can rule over anyone else without their consent.'
p2471
aS'Instead, the masses create the laws.'
p2472
aS'Communism is a stateless, classless, society without money, where everyone is equal.'
p2473
aS'The ends of the anarchism and communism ideals are actually very similar if not exact replicas of each other.'
p2474
aS'Both look to create an equal society free from oppression and coercion. '
p2475
aS'Anarchism is the elimination of the state(not the government)/*most* hierarchy(excluding relationships like parent-child, student-teacher).'
p2476
aS'The political power of the government is redistributed among the masses instead of giving a select few the power.'
p2477
aS'Communism is a stateless, classless society without money.'
p2478
aS'With this the people within a communism become equal.'
p2479
aS'The ends of the anarchist and communist ideals are very similar if not exactly alike.'
p2480
aS'They both aim to create an equal society free of oppression and coercion.'
p2481
aS'If you want to know more about anarchism, try going to [r/anarchy101](http://www.reddit.com/r/anarchy101).  '
p2482
aS'the only way communism works is if the government mandates work for everybody, anarchism would mean that no one would have to do anything.'
p2483
aS'There cant be a system without money, that everyone does not have to pitch in for.'
p2484
aS'Also just curious, what country do you live in?'
p2485
aS'When I said money I meant wage labor.'
p2486
aS'People work for a set number of hours a week to earn something like coupons, that are not like the money that we know today.'
p2487
aS'They have a set expiration date, which would be set by the people, so they cannot be saved and used in a greater amount on a later date.'
p2488
aS'It would be something like [Twin Oaks](http://www.twinoaks.org/) in Virginia.'
p2489
aS'United States.'
p2490
aS'yeah but the difference with that is that people can choose to live there, its a small community, not a country.'
p2491
aS'And coupons?'
p2492
aS'seriously currency is currency you might as well call it money.'
p2493
aS"An anarchist communism will probably never appear within my, or quite possibly, my child's lifetime."
p2494
aS'It can only happen through a gradual change by the people understanding,  accepting the philosophy.'
p2495
aS'If I can remember, Marxian theory says that this will take generations to acheive.'
p2496
aS'Even after that, it will be a constant struggle to keep people from taking their freedoms.'
p2497
aS'I was just making a reference to how coupons have expiration dates on them, not calling them coupons.'
p2498
aS'Now, back to the original reason of this conversation.'
p2499
aS'You do understand the relationship between communism and anarchism, right?'
p2500
aS'If I take a while to answer you after this it is because I am asleep.'
p2501
aS'I do not see the relationship, as far as I have understood they are opposites, communism is when the government controls everything/no private sector, and anarchism is no government at all.'
p2502
aS"At least this is what I've always thought"
p2503
aS"Anarchism is where the governments' legislative power is redistributed among the masses and hierarchy is taken out of the government."
p2504
aS'There is still going to be a government.'
p2505
aS'The laws are created by the masses, and the government would be decentralized, allowing people to have more power over their individual government.'
p2506
aS'Without a legislative median that can become corrupt, the mass are free to choose the laws that best fit their region.'
p2507
aS'Anarchism in it self is a socialist philosophy.'
p2508
aS'Communism is a mode of production that is used to create equality among the masses.'
p2509
aS'The means of production are owned by everyone, rather than a single person, like in capitalism.'
p2510
aS'This eliminates the hierarchical structure, and instead gives workers control over their working conditions.  '
p2511
aS'how do these choosing of laws work?'
p2512
aS'a vote or something?'
p2513
aS'they kind of do have that.'
p2514
aS'Yes, they vote directly on the laws rather than on representatives to choose the laws for them.'
p2515
aS'It is a [direct democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy).'
p2516
aS"Do you really think it's smart for major decisions on global warming, and the economy to be made by tea party'ers."
p2517
aS"Your thing sounds good in theory but it wouldn't work. "
p2518
aS'An educated collective is a prerequisite to this kind of society.'
p2519
aS"I think it can be done, but given the way our schools' educational system has been lobbied to be geared toward creating obedient workers just competent enough for their jobs, it's going to take a few generations to actually work."
p2520
aS'Poverty and ignorance push you to do stupid and cruel things.'
p2521
aS"Firstly, soldiers don't get to pick their cause once they sign up and further often they can't get out once they've signed up out of youthful vigor or misguided patriotism."
p2522
aS'Secondly, when your army consists of people from the poorest, least educated, sectors of your society with the fewest job opportunities, do you blame them or the system?'
p2523
aS"Just because you and I have the education and facilities to discuss, consider and philosophize ourselves into a positions where we recognize the hypocritical nature of the system doesn't mean we need to condemn people who haven't gotten where we are yet."
p2524
aS'And nothing changes the fact that they too are dead.'
p2525
aS'Thirdly, what is the message of the picture?'
p2526
aS'Do you mourn the thousands of people who died in 9/11 that were arguably your direct philosophical enemy as an anarchist or some variety?'
p2527
aS'The bankers, government workers, corporate fat cats, etc.'
p2528
aS'Do you mourn the Muslim Afghans, Palestinians and Iraqis as an anti-theist?'
p2529
aS'The Afghani and Iraqi soldiers, Taliban adherents or secret police members?'
p2530
aS'There are many innocent people on all sides.'
p2531
aS'I consider the poor, black or hispanic American who joined the army for lack of a better option and who died from a suicide bomber blast and the young Afghani Taliban member who was indoctrinated as a child to strap that bomb to their chest as equally deserving of an "RIP".'
p2532
aS'Both are victims of the same twisted system. '
p2533
aS"Just wanting to point out that Blacks are overly represented as Officers in the military,which means they hold at least one 4-year degree.I can't speak for Hispanics."
p2534
aS'I wish I could give you more than one upvote!'
p2535
aS'mistakenly volunteered?'
p2536
aS"I'm I going to mistakenly volunteer when I enlist in the Army in the near future when I put 2 years of thought behind my decision."
p2537
aS'i sincerely doubt the antitheists were the first to make this quote.'
p2538
aS'ive seen 10 different versions of this pic with the same exact quote.'
p2539
aS"That's a lot of people throwing around bullshit numbers."
p2540
aS"Your 9/11 is palestinian's 24/7"
p2541
aS'Tens of thousands of Palestinians are being killed every day?'
p2542
aS'No, just tens of them, daily, every day, for decades.'
p2543
aS"I'd say 1 person a day for a thousand days has a worse effect on a society than 1000 people in 1 day."
p2544
aS"9/11 sucked, but it doesn't even show up on a population graph of NY city it killed so little people."
p2545
aS'Compare that to decades of systematic cultural repression and destruction.'
p2546
aS"I'd rather be dead dead than the living dead like people in an occupied country.\n\n"
p2547
aS'Not tens of them, not daily, nor everyday, not for decades.'
p2548
aS'Life in Palestine sucks, but they are not just brutally murdered at random every day.'
p2549
aS'Nor have there been many mass murders in Palestine, compared to other reigons.'
p2550
aS"Fuck it, I'll just say it, downvote away, you people pay waaaaaaaay too much attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict."
p2551
aS"It's a tiny reigon with a small population, many people lead normal and happy lives there, it is not some sort of hell hole or perpetual war zone, and out of all the countries in the world Israel should not be your main concern."
p2552
aS"Well you can tell the occupied people their life isn't really that bad."
p2553
aS'Being occupied is kind of bad enough on its own. '
p2554
aS'But why just Israel?'
p2555
aS'Who cares about Israel?!'
p2556
aS'There are so many people suffering all over the world, there are genocides and theocracies and police states and militairy-run states and racist states - yet people focus on this relatively moderate conflict.'
p2557
aS'I mean, why pick on the one Mid-Eastern country with LGBT rights, a real democracy, freedom of speech and a relatively moral army?'
p2558
aS'It makes no sense!'
p2559
aS'Is it just because it\'s part of the "evil west"?'
p2560
aS'REAL DEMOCRACY hahahhahahhaha yeah.'
p2561
aS'Like South Africa.'
p2562
aS"And from my queer comrade, stop pinkwashing israel's crimes."
p2563
aS"Yeah, it's great that Israel treats its Settler queers fairly nice."
p2564
aS'Too bad they are starving any queer people in palestine to death.'
p2565
aS'No, not like South Africa at all.'
p2566
aS"Unlike South Africa in the '90s, all our citizens are equal by law and are treated as such."
p2567
aS"I'm not pinkwashing our warcrimes."
p2568
aS"Yes, warcrimes have happend and that's a shame."
p2569
aS"However, they're illegal here too, and the perpetrators are punished."
p2570
aS"Every country commits warcrimes, R/Anarchism should know that, it's unlike you to single out one government and one army."
p2571
aS'Nobody in Palestine is starving.'
p2572
aS'Where did you get that idea?'
p2573
aS'Anyway, why the disproportionate attention to a reigon with 7 million people, with pretty unremarkable warcrimes and a country with pretty liberal domestic policies?'
p2574
aS"Is it because we have free press, so newspapers like Ha'aretz (which I respect, though not always agree with) can express their views to hundreds of thousands of readers about the negative things that Israel, like any country, suffers from?"
p2575
aS'There are countries where women are being beheaded and gays are being stoned to death, and anybody who tries to stand up against it gets the same treatment.'
p2576
aS'Why not go pick on them some?'
p2577
aS'See, when I see someone ready to shotgun apologetic statements for Zionism and Apartheid, I like to check their post history.'
p2578
aS'You have zionist posts all up in this website lol.'
p2579
aS'Go spread your false nationalism somewhere else.'
p2580
aS'Anarchists and socialists tend to think false nationalism is, well, false.'
p2581
aS"Lowkey's gonna tell it to ya http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO5Cay6GUkM"
p2582
aS'Well fucking done, Sherlock.'
p2583
aS"I'm a Zionist, couldn't you tell that from the two posts in this thread?"
p2584
aS'You call me the nationalist, yet you are the one that is singling out one nation.'
p2585
aS'I call on you to look at this nation in the context of humanity as a whole, and then tell me we are somehow below average and deserve all the negative attention here.'
p2586
aS"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xPo6HzJ9Q\n\nHere's another one for ya!"
p2587
aS"I'm a Settler too Goodguy1066, only problem is that I'm also a revolutionary socialist hoping to tear down (or at least get out of the way of the people tearing down) my colonial privilege."
p2588
aS"Use *your* words, not someone else's videos."
p2589
aS'Anyway, just focus on Anarchism, not Israel bashing.'
p2590
aS"Condemning settler colonialism, especially as supported economic and morally by my country [spit] Canada, is pretty high on any good anticapitalist's to do list."
p2591
aS'Why?'
p2592
aS'At least we *allow* anarchists, as well as anti-Zionists, liberals, capitalists, socialists, communists and everybody, to have his opinion, speak it out, vote and run for government.'
p2593
aS"There are millions of poor people who don't have that privilige, those should be such a subreddit's first priority."
p2594
aS"No one is impressed by Israel's policies of allowing Setters some bourgeois free speech protections."
p2595
aS"Not all of Israel are settlers, and yeah, I don't like the settlements as much as you don't, but that's no reason to dismiss all the positive things about Israel."
p2596
aS"Arab Israelis have the same rights as Jewish Israelis and Settlers, that's already quite a feat in the Middle East."
p2597
aS'I\'m not talking about "settlements" after 1967, I\'m talking about 1947.'
p2598
aS'I guess the real "occupation" begins in 1922.'
p2599
aS'Dude, what.'
p2600
aS'Fuck everything about Israel.'
p2601
aS'SO BRAVE!'
p2602
aS"Yeah, we don't do that here."
p2603
aS'I met a stupid remark with a stupid remark.'
p2604
aS"If you'd care to explain yourself I'd go through that effort as well."
p2605
aS"There's no accounting for accounting here."
p2606
aS'I agree, wat?'
p2607
aS"Here's a list of ongoing conflicts: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_conflicts They aren't really topping the list in these last couple years. "
p2608
aS'Yeah.'
p2609
aS'The sentiment is well-intended, but the execution leaves something to be desired.'
p2610
aS'I also question the 1,690,903 number.'
p2611
aS'It seems very high and strangely precise.'
p2612
aS'This is generally considered a low estimate, but fairly statistically sound.'
p2613
aS'http://www.iraqbodycount.org/'
p2614
aS'Not to mention that the website only analyzes people directly killed.'
p2615
aS"It doesn't factor in the people who died of starvation due to the mass uprooting and forced eviction by U.S. soldiers, as well as the destruction of homes, businesses, and farms."
p2616
aS'While 1,690,903 might be a pretty high estimate; the actual numbers are a lot higher than most people would think.'
p2617
aS"Also, it's important to note that most of the reports of casualties come from American or European studies, often done by the countries themselves, who have reasons for giving low estimates over the amount of people affected or killed."
p2618
aS"In the same light, it wouldn't surprise me that Iraqi or Afghan media would also try to low-ball it so as to maintain order and prevent any widespread actions against U.S. occupation."
p2619
aS"Holy shit, so that doesn't even count the million plus killed in the nineties by Clinton."
p2620
aS'That site only charts deaths that have been reported in the media and it readily notes that the real number may be orders of magnitude higher.'
p2621
aS"The Lancet study was demographically sound (they confirmed the vast majority of the death reports with actual death certificates and undertook the methods that are taken when there's an outbreak of disease to evaluate its lethality) and extrapolating its results to the end of the war would probably give you something like 1.5 million."
p2622
aS'Sorry I thought the one I linked was the one where they went around random points of Iraq and asked about people who had died from the war.'
p2623
aS'I remember hearing about it ages ago and thought that was the one.'
p2624
aS'I used to think this before my cousin came home from Iraq.'
p2625
aS'He claimed that they only count the casualties that were direct orders from the upper chain of command, in other words, they will only count it if there is an order to shoot a civilian.'
p2626
aS"That doesn't include the estimated 350,000 dead from the endless American bombings in Baghdad, nor the amount of deaths that soldiers decided never to report."
p2627
aS'He claimed that the majority of soldiers there would shoot civilians without reporting it.'
p2628
aS'For the most part, it is too much paperwork to report dead civilians when in one attack there are dozens of bodies.'
p2629
aS'They would leave the body counting for the Iraqi government and army, yet once the civil war turned into pure chaos by 2006, most of the bodies were already gone and there was little to no government to be found to count the bodies.'
p2630
aS'The starvation part is right too, as well as the disease part.'
p2631
aS'The Invasion left the Iraqi waters practically poisonous, and my cousin said that he found more dead bodies that died of starvation than fighting, almost all children. '
p2632
aS"It's more about suffering from terrorism in general. \n\n"
p2633
aS'What about terrorism in general?'
p2634
aS'Are we just throwing random words together now?'
p2635
aS"It's about suffering from terrorism in general on a daily basis."

aS'Did you even click on it?'
p2641
aS"It's an article that talks about different sources, their methods, and the numbers."
p2642
aS'This is my source, versus no source. '

p2659
aS'They sign that name, or just "Antitheists" for short, on all their OC.'
p2660
aS'It ruins an otherwise good picture, by essentially saying "If you agree, you support anti-theism".'

aS'That just tells me that a group of antitheists wrote something and then signed it "-Antitheists".'
p2676

p3265
aS"Iceland's economy is comparable to a typical American city."
p3266
aS'They were able to default on their debt ONLY because it happened in the context of a much larger world economy that could afford to absorbed that loss.'

p3273
aS'In 2008 a euro bought 90 krona.'

p3279
aS'Why would this not be the case elsewhere?'
p3280
aS'"Better"?'
p3281
aS"They've experienced terrible inflation, which has harmed their economy and the buying power of their currency, which has a negative effect on the buying power of everyday Icelanders."

p3284
aS'They are an exception, even if a notable and possibly even noble one.'
p3285
aS'&gt;Why would this not be the case elsewhere?'

aS"Pacific north west nations had one of the rare cases of formative society without agriculture (although it's possible they had elementary pisciculture anyway), the potlatch was a way to demonstrate the wealth and power of your group, and they formed chiefdoms."
p3536
aS'The Mississippians had urbanized chiefdoms.'
p3537
aS'So did the ancient Pueblo; these two societies alone cover about a third to half of the mainland US.'

aS'Many of the resulting groups retained the hierarchy even after the overall society collapsed.'

aS"The mesoamerican and andean peoples go without saying and they collectively had as much as half of america's pre-colombian population."
p3541
aS'What Colombus saw in Kiskeya was not some pristine eden, it was a civilization which happened to have gold and to not be christian (although Genoese slave traders never really gave a damn about the religion, sex or race of their merchandise; when the pope had christian slavery abolished they just moved that part of the business to their trading factories in North Africa).'
p3542
aS'EDIT - The Amazonians also had that, although it collapsed with the introduction of yellow fever by portuguese sailors before they were even aware of it and their cities are seemingly concentrated in Para so seemingly distant from the main trading routes between the Andes and the Mesoamerica.'
p3543
aS'The term *agriculture* is problematic because it emphasizes annual plant cultivation and overlooks perennial &amp; forest based plant nurturing.'
p3544
aS'Franz Boas had good intentions but he was wrong about there being no plant cultivation in the coastal PNW.'
p3545
aS'There was.'
p3546
aS"However it didn't take a form recognizable to European explorers and colonizers, who were looking for row-crops and cleared ground (which they did find, but only for tobacco)."
p3547
aS'Instead plant cultivation was perennial and forest based, which the bioregion is of course very well suited for.'
p3548
aS'Cultivated crops include numerous berry bushes and brambles, saskatoon, white oak, hazelnut, silverweed, camas, nettle, wapato, a rhizome-forming variety of clover, and more.'

aS'That refers to a much wider region than the coastal &amp; major river areas (predominantly Coast Salish &amp; Chinook "cultural groups") where the anthropology you are referring to took place.'
p3551

p3552
aS'&gt; the potlatch was a way to demonstrate the wealth and power of your group\n\nThe sense I get from my readings is that a potlatch was, among many other things, a time where the more powerful and/or well-off members of the group or region were put on the spot and expected to demonstrate their generosity.'

p3554
aS"Some did but you're still generalizing."
p3555

p3556
aS"Not specifically replying to any one person in this thread, but I think it's racist and shameful how indigenous people are always judged by the generalizations that colonizers and scholars make about their society."
p3557
aS'Besides the unavoidable observer biases, this ignores individual people, their lives and their opinions, and it vastly over-simplifies the complex and ever-changing nature of social groups.'

p3579
aS'Primitive communism is somewhat more debatable and does fit a number of non-hierarchic societies.'

aS'The Guarani, however, do not fit, and it can certainly not be seen with the modern day guarani considering most of them form 95% of the population of the republic of Paraguay (and if you give me any of this blood quota bullshit you get an automatic downvote: the main language of Paraguay is Guarani, they are descended from the Guarani reductions: they are Guarani: cultures are not static).'

p3597
aS'The evolution from hunter/gather to settlement and agricultural, as well as industry of ceramic and tools need organisation (collective or not) and a certain number of people for it to be sustainable.'

aS'I think it has less to do with size and more to do with complexity.'
p3599
aS'Of course, size almost always leads to complexity.'
p3600
aS"I've always imagined that post revolution, we'd see cities be supplanted by a vast network of towns.... sort of like native America before the Europeans arrived..."
p3601
aS'The whole world was like that before industrialization.'

aS'Cities reaching a population over a few tens of thousand were massive trade hubs, clocking in at a million like Rome, Bagdad or Nanjing usually meant you were the seat of power of some mega empire.'

p4409
aS'In fact, Marxism is kinda based on the idea that they exist in inderdependent relationships.'

p4411
aS'Since dependent entities like social structures require other, independent entities (dependency defined as the ability to exist without reliance on other entities, the definition of entiteis being an entire othe discussion entirely) in order to exist, I think it is apt to claim that they are less "real" than independent entities.'

aS'This ignoring the dependence that, say, humans have on food production in order to say alive, since my definition of dependency in this context is meant only to imply the ability to exist at any one moment.'

aS"I'm not sure where you got the figure 3039 for deaths since 2000, but if we assume they all happened outside of 2001, and average the death toll for the other 10.5 since 2000, it comes out to a little less than 21 per year."

aS'An informed, capitalist society would be vigilant of the necessity of decentralized banking because of the horrors going on today between the impermeable good old boys club between bankers and politicians, which of course is an alliance between those who determine the subjective value of our money (since its fiat, not objective) and those who possess the monopoly upon the initiation of force (the state).'

p6126
aS'OTOH, by that logic, you could argue that an anarchist should always vote for the *worst* candidate.'

p6179
aS"I know it doesn't look that way, but that's the point with him; he is, in actuality, worse than Romney."
p6180
aS'Both candidates work for the same cause; Obama appeals to a wider audience, an audience that is actually capable of critical thought but allows that capacity to be overridden because he appeals to their emotions.'

aS"My vote is worthless either way (I live in NJ), but I'm not going to symbolically support either man."
p6183
aS'For the sake of an additional number, I might actually vote, and vote for one of the two aforementioned candidates, because I too am a, for the most part, "long-term" anarchist, and would like to see there at least be a viable 3rd/4th/5th party, etc., but there is definitely no reason to cast my vote for either of the two shill candidates we\'ve been served.'

p6188
aS'This is an excellent point.'
p6189
aS'What about Obamacare though?'
p6190
aS"Am I wrong to assume that millions of people will enjoy the benefit of health insurance once it's implemented?"
p6191
aS'I recognize that health insurance and health care are different, and that Obamacare is not the end all be all.'
p6192
aS"But isn't having Obamacare better than not having it?"
p6193
aS"So you wouldn't even vote for a candidate that isn't a member of the two major parties in the US?"
p6194
aS'One that is more palatable, or even closer to your own position? '
p6195
aS'I would.'
p6196
aS'But that tends to be ineffective. '
p6197
aS'Is [this](http://rt.com/usa/news/obama-lohier-ndaa-stay-414/) your definition of effective?'

aS"I'm sure he can use your vote in November, as it may be a close one."

p6202
aS'Or a bad person, for that matter.'
p6203
aS'I know all that.'
p6204
aS'&gt;I contend that no matter who wins, people in general will lose.'
p6205
aS'I agree with you 100%.'
p6206
aS"But the fact remains that Obamacare gives millions of people access to healthcare who didn't already have access."
p6207
aS"I think that is something that's worth protecting."
p6208
aS'And the easiest way of protecting that is by voting Democrat in the next elections.'
p6209
aS'Now, of course I recognize that Obamacare is not the end all be all of getting people healthcare.'
p6210
aS"It's far from that."
p6211
aS"But I can't justify not doing something that takes only about an hour or two that could very well mean healthcare access for millions who need it."
p6212
aS'I will always continue fighting for a decentralized, mutualist society in which everybody has access to healthcare.'
p6213
aS'And I absolutely recognize that Obama/Romney will make that fight harder.'
p6214
aS"But there's nothing I can do to prevent Obama or Romney from taking office."
p6215
aS"Given the available choices, we're ethically obligated to do what helps the biggest number of people."
p6216
aS'And in the choice between voting Obama and not voting, I think more people will be helped by voting Obama and Dem in the Congressional elections.'
p6217
aS'Nobody is helped by not voting.\n\n'
p6218
aS'Obamacare?'
p6219
aS"That idea came from Romney before it ever came from Obama, as I am sure you're aware."
p6220
aS'Romney had to disown his own plan to get the nomination, and he got away with it.'
p6221
aS"Flip a coin, and vote for one of 'em."
p6222
aS"Romney isn't as right-wing as most of the other GOP candidates were, so maybe you could stomach casting a vote for the man who inspired Obamacare.\n\n\n\n\n"
p6223
aS"It doesn't matter where it came from though."
p6224
aS"Romney will likely repeal it, and Obama won't."
p6225
aS'Are we in agreement that Obamacare is preferable to no Obamacare?'
p6226
aS"No, we're not in agreement."
p6227
aS"Then again, I don't live in the US, so my opinion is that of an outsider."
p6228
aS"I won't hold it against anyone who decided that my opinion counted for less, since I'm not affected."
p6229
aS"Also, I'd put money on Romney *not* repealing it."
p6230
aS'There are some Republicans who would love to get rid of Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security, etc.'
p6231
aS"They've had time to do it, including periods where they controlled Congress and the White House at the same time, but they didn't."
p6232
aS'In fact, during the Bush years they even managed to add a prescription drug plan to Medicare.'
p6233
aS"&gt;No, we're not in agreement."
p6234
aS'Why?'
p6235
aS"Well if I were an insurance company, I'd generally be happy about this."
p6236
aS"The government didn't take over the industry, but decided to require coverage in the same way that many jurisdictions require auto insurance."
p6237
aS'There are a few bitter pills for these companies to swallow, but they can pass some costs along to everyone, and still come out on top.'
p6238
aS"But I don't own an insurance company."
p6239
aS"If I were forced to participate in that kind of system, I'd balk."
p6240
aS'Perhaps I should have been more specific.'
p6241
aS'Are we in agreement that Obamacare is generally preferable to no Obamacare, especially considering many of us lack the privileges of health and monetary wealth?'
p6242
aS'My previous post was made with that question in mind.'
p6243
aS"In short, no, I don't think Obamacare is preferable to no Obamacare."
p6244
aS"I don't mean to be dense, but could you elaborate?"
p6245
aS"It seems like somebody who's been denied health insurance due to lack of employment, lack of money, or a pre-existing condition is in a much better position with Obamacare than without."
p6246
aS'And tens of thousands of people, if not more, are in that position.'
p6247
aS"Well I think we have different goals, and that's fine."
p6248
aS"I'm interested in reducing dependency on the State, as my end-goal would be for the State to evaporate entirely."
p6249
aS"So I'd rather see groups and individuals pursuing their own ways of handling these problems."
p6250
aS'Unfortunately, Obamacare is another compulsory program (as almost all government programs are), where you can opt-out only by paying a not-insignificant tax/fine.'
p6251
aS"It isn't voluntary, which I think is a key characteristic."
p6252
aS'Again, I think private insurance companies are happy to see government stepping in and mandating that people purchase their product.'
p6253
aS'That sort of State-corporate partnership is pure poison every time it happens.'
p6254
aS"That's my goal as well."
p6255
aS"But the fact of the matter is that there doesn't yet exist an anarchic alternative that could replace Obamacare."
p6256
aS'Working towards creating one should be priority number one, without a doubt.'
p6257
aS"But I'm unwilling to sacrifice the wellbeing of other people in the meantime before we can create alternatives."
p6258
aS"If you're for reducing dependency on the State (as I am), then reduce your dependency on the State."
p6259
aS"I'm extremely uncomfortable, though, with making that decision for other people, and especially for other people who, much to their own chagrin, must depend on the State to survive at the moment."
p6260
aS'Actually, it sounds very much like you *do* want to make decisions for other people.'
p6261
aS"The State does nearly everything by force and coercion, and frankly, Obamacare isn't any different."
p6262
aS"Suppose you wanted to opt-out of Obamacare, and also didn't want to pay the fine?"
p6263
aS'It would simply be removed from you by force.'
p6264
aS'Hmm.'
p6265
aS'My understanding is that people who fall under a specific income level are exempted from the tax.'
p6266
aS"These are the people most likely to benefit a lot from Obamacare and suffer a lot if it's repealed."
p6267
aS"But that's a valid point."
p6268
aS"I'll have to do some thinking between now and November."
p6269
aS'Good luck, whatever you decide to do.'
p6270
aS"I've had this topic come up a lot lately, and I think my fuse is getting short, and it is causing me to get curt and abrasive."
p6271
aS'Maybe I need a break from it!'
p6272
aS'Thanks for your input, comrade.'
p6273
aS'So, if a president makes the lives of some people in this country better, but ends the lives of countless others in another, we should support him?'
p6274
aS'Fuck you.'
p6275
aS"If you've come up with a way of preventing Obama or Romney or any other imperialist from taking the office of the presidency, then please let's have it."
p6276
aS"But I can't think of anything anywhere near practical."
p6277
aS"Given that Romney *will* end the lives of countless people (in the USA and abroad), given that Obama *will also* end the lives of countless people in the USA and abroad, and given that if one isn't elected, then the other will be, pragmatism dictates that we do what we can to get the lesser of the two evils into office."
p6278
aS'Again, I do not support Obama, Romney, or imperialism.'
p6279
aS'I actively do what I can to stop them.'
p6280
aS'But if the Republicans get control of Congress and the White House, then Obamacare will likely be repealed, and millions will, again, be without healthcare.'
p6281
aS"So I'm going to vote Democrat for the sole purpose of protecting Obamacare."
p6282
aS"I don't support Obama."
p6283
aS"But I want people to have access to healthcare, and in the immediate future, the best way of ensuring a lot of people's access to healthcare is to vote Democrat."
p6284
aS'The question, as I see it, is are you loyal to "anarchism" or loyal to helping people.'
p6285
aS"I'm loyal to helping people, and I see this as a way of doing that."
p6286
aS"What's the alternative?"
p6287
aS'The fact is that the only other electable candidate is Mitt Romney, and we all know what his presidency would mean.'
p6288
aS'The problem we are faced with is the fact that Occupy is pretty much dead, and there is currently no real alternative or likelihood of resurgence.'
p6289
aS'An Obama presidency would at least give a little more breathing room in order to recover and rethink an alternate and more effective strategy.'
p6290
aS'While he may not even be a reformist, he is certainly not as extremely reactionary as Romney.'
p6291
aS"Even with Romney's horrendous positions, it is possible that he may get elected thanks to Voter ID."
p6292
aS"I think we're kidding ourselves if we think we are going to have any chance of agitating for revolution when our society is brazenly and enthusiastically sold off to unaccountable totalitarian entities that only care about your existence insofar as they are able to profit off it."
p6293
aS"Middle-class people in desperate situations in prosperous societies tend to vote for fascists in order to reassert the standard of living they're accustomed to."
p6294
aS"They're not revolutionaries, and they may never will be."
p6295
aS'It is important that we are able to convince them that libertarian and socialist principles are ultimately more appealing and sustainable than statism and capitalism, and to do that kind of dedicated agitation requires a standard of living higher than that of barely surviving.'
p6296
aS'We all saw how voting for Bush did for the whole "it needs to get worse before it gets better" argument.'
p6297
aS'And with Bush out, and Obama in, how has that been going?'
p6298
aS"You've seen how voting for Obama hasn't brought about peace, or the end of crony capitalism."
p6299
aS'The worst laws of the Bush era have been extended by Obama, and even more have been added (like the detention provision of NDAA, which Obama has been fighting to keep, in the courts).'
p6300
aS'More wars have been started or escalated, and covert drone attacks are becoming commonplace.'
p6301
aS'Occupy was born during the Obama days, and died during the same.'
p6302
aS"That wasn't even a Bush-era phenomenon."
p6303
aS"Bush may have been the Oil President, but Obama has very much been Wall Street's man.\n\n "
p6304
aS"Again, what's the alternative?"
p6305
aS'If you honestly think we stand a chance of revitalizing Occupy or creating an alternative in less than 2 months, you are kidding yourself.'
p6306
aS'There is no present alternative whatsoever.'
p6307
aS"&gt;You've seen how voting for Obama hasn't brought about peace, or the end of crony capitalism\n\nAside from some passionate and irrational liberals, nobody seriously expected Obama to do either of those."
p6308
aS"That's some pie in the sky bullshit."
p6309
aS'&gt;The worst laws of the Bush era have been extended by Obama, and even more have been added (like the detention provision of NDAA, which Obama has been fighting to keep, in the courts)\n\nYes, and Obama is also responsible for PPACA (Obamacare).'
p6310
aS'Which, while not being single payer, is significantly better than not having anything at all, and is the most significant overhaul of the healthcare system since medicare and medicaid.'
p6311
aS'Obama is also responsible for ARRA, which while vastly inadequate and certainly no WPA, is better than the right-wing prescription of no stimulus at all.'
p6312
aS'Obama also signed the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, which sets aside two millions acres of wilderness for federal protection against development.'
p6313
aS'Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which delivers real benefits to students and workers by penalizing employers for not offering insurance and directly administering loans through the DoE instead of subsidized through banks, as well as increasing Pell Grant awards.'
p6314
aS'Obama also signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which effectively lifts the 180-day statute of limitations on equal-pay discrimination lawsuits.'
p6315
aS'Obama signed the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act which extends unemployment benefits for 20 weeks for states with an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent or higher.'
p6316
aS'All of this legislation delivers real benefits to real people.'
p6317
aS'My dad was one.'
p6318
aS'He would have been homeless had his unemployment insurance ran out.'
p6319
aS"I don't mean to excuse his criminal foreign policy actions, but this is not something specific to Obama."
p6320
aS'Almost every liberal president in history has simply continued the foreign policy of their predecessor, while sometimes diverging on domestic policy.'
p6321
aS"We have a choice between the following:\n\nObama: Aggressive militarist foreign policy, mildly liberal domestic policy\nRomney: Extremely aggressive militarist foreign policy, extremely reactionary domestic policy\n\nI'm not one to be persuaded by the liberal argument that Obama will do more for progressive causes once he is re-elected."
p6322
aS"I'm more inclined to say he will do less."
p6323
aS'However, it is better that he does less than Romney signing extremely reactionary legislation or vetoing every piece of even remotely progressive legislation, which will eliminate real benefits to working class people.'
p6324
aS'Again, you offer no alternative whatsoever.'
p6325
aS'The fact is that people are desperate, and we cannot afford the ideological puritanism associated with not voting.'
p6326
aS"It's highly irrational, considering how we have seen in the past our justice system subvert elections in Bush v Gore."

p9069
aS'To repeat: a search engine is not an "answer machine.'
p9070
aS'" Assuming that all a search engine does is answer questions is a false assumption.'
p9071
aS'We can prove this because when you type a question like "Why am I happy" we do not get an answer, but an aggregate of of search results sorted by an algorithm based on multiple factors, such as relevancy and popularity, which may or may not contain the information you are looking for, and each result may not come to a consensus on the information.'

aS"It's something that provides answers to problems."

aS'Eg, it provides an "answer" to "dog breeds" in that it then gives resources related to dog breeds.'

aS'Or it provides an "answer" to "rental cars" in that it provides resources related to rental cars.'
p9078
aS'Or it provides an "answer" to "why does my job make me unhappy" in that it provides resources for people who are unhappy at their jobs.'
p9079
aS'Since people are happy at their jobs have no "question" to "find an answer to", they are much less likely to search it.'

aS"Possibly, but that's not always the case and it isn't the function of a search engine."

aS'"results to queries" is a fancy way of saying "answers to questions", and questions is a way of phrasing "problems".'

aS"The price of goods/services therefor can't dip below these operational costs."
p9195
aS'Profit is merely any surplus value that comes in when the goods/services are selling above market price.'
p9196

p9197
aS"After all, if a capitalist wants to drive down costs (which is just saying driving down wages) yet try to sell the goods or services at the current market price in order to extract more surplus, what's to stop them?"

aS'That would be pretty baffling.'
p9218
aS"Urbanization and industrialization as they developed are key components of Capitalism, so it's a rather safe assumption."
p9219
aS"This isn't to say that urbanization and industrialization are impossible without Capitalism; rather, they likely would have developed differently."
p9220
aS"I also don't think urbanization has as much of an impact on alienation as the mode of production which became of industrial Capitalism."
p9221
aS'&gt;Urbanization and industrialization as they developed are key components of Capitalism\n\nThey happened under the Soviet Union as well, which was not capitalist when it was industrializing.'
p9222
aS'Read the rest of my comment where I indicate that neither urbanization nor industrialization are inherently capitalist.'
p9223
aS"The way they formed in the modern world (that is, today's world) is through the capitalist mode of production."
p9224
aS"You'll note that I never said industrialization and urbanization can only happen under Capitalism."

aS'Government and at the root of the problem--money--keeps the invisible hand in the work force, the slave driver that forces you to work or seems you unfit and forces you to live on the street.'

p9233
aS"Work isn't exclusive to capitalism."
p9234
aS"sure it isn't but all (ok, maybe not all but a very vast majority) of work in todays society takes place in a capitalist mode of production"
p9235
aS"Would it change that much if it wasn't?"
p9236
aS'Serious question.'
p9237
aS"If it doesn't then what the fuck are we fighting for?"
p9238
aS'Well in theory we could raise wages or require less work at the same wages.'
p9239
aS'But no political system can change whether or not the work itself sucks.'
p9240
aS'Though maybe with technology we can automate a lot of jobs.'
p9241
aS'Sure the political system could change how much work sucks.'
p9242
aS"By eliminating almost all jobs based on the manipulation of money, that could free up most time for people to do their own stuff, making people's 10 hour straight, 8 hour straight jobs suck less."
p9243
aS"And, when workplaces are democratically controlled, rather than enforcing orders from above, where workers are given control and a say over what they do, even if that stuff can suck, they're generally happier and more satisfied with their lives."
p9244
aS'But of course, people will bitch about any and everything, haha.'
p9245
aS'Some form of accounting would be necessary to keep track of where resources are going, and surely you would have some form of currency anyways?'
p9246
aS'Besides most of the menial stuff is or at least can be automated.'
p9247
aS"I don't know if democratic workplaces would improve things, but I assume there is a reason why they aren't common as it is."
p9248
aS"The difference would be that under capitalism you're told what to do whether you want to or not, and under socialism/communism workers would collectively come to a decision of what they want to do in a democratic fashion."
p9249
aS'Hopefully you can see the difference there.'
p9250
aS'Well nothing is stopping such a system from existing under capitalism.'
p9251
aS"I don't know why it isn't done."

p9254
aS'The people I know who work outside of capitalism (academics, specifically) are pretty hapoy with their work.'
p9255
aS'They do like to complain about the organizational aspects of it, though.'
p9256
aS'yeah, that kind of evidence further supports the premise that the capitalist mode of production and its associated alienation creates misery for workers.'
p9257
aS"Its hard to find a control, but that's definitely a good one."
p9258
aS'And its true, a lot of acedemic folks I know are much happier with their jobs than the average proleterian I know.'
p9259
aS"Without the continued production though, wouldn't we lose all the comforts and even, possibly, the very basics?"
p9260
aS"I don't think that would make us very happy."
p9261
aS'Academics are outside of capitalism?'
p9262
aS"I don't necessarily disagree but could you elaborate?"
p9263
aS"It's not outside of capitalism but it is more removed than labor."
p9264
aS"It's not selling products or producing anything as much as acquiring knowledge and making conclusions, of course Academia is being more and more capitalized and bureaucratic now than it ever has so it won't be different for much longer."
p9265
aS'They generally are not operating in for-profit enterprises.'

aS"I don't think this is technically the alienation found in Marxist theory."
p9283
aS'The alienation there is of the product of labor.'
p9284

p9314

p10030
aS"Haha, I didn't even think of that."
p10031
aS"There's another hole in your plan."
p10032
aS'&gt;Fingerprints are fairly easy to identify, yes, but not everyone is going to consent to being fingerprinted to help solve a murder case.'
p10033
aS"Yeah, that's my point."
p10034
aS'&gt;Nor are fingerprints alone enough evidence to close a case.'
p10035
aS'Who gets to decide when the case is "closed"?'
p10036
aS'And if you proved that someone murdered someone, what would you do to that person?'
p10037
aS"If I'm the husband of the woman who was murdered, is it okay for me to kill the murderer when you find out who it was?"
p10038
aS"&gt;The bullets can then be compared to known weapons and their owners with 'liberated' equipment we took from the cops."

aS"There's less murder in our current society because there are consequences."
p10045
aS'If we let everyone out of jail right now, crime would increase.'
p10046

p10047
aS"So you're saying there wouldn't be any murder?"
p10048
aS"Also, if your hypothesis is true, why don't we observe that today?"
p10049
aS'Don\'t communities already get "very angry" at murderers?'
p10050
aS'&gt;Maybe my plan is to plant evidence on the murder scene to make it look like I did it, then make the killer angry enough to say "that wasn\'t there!".'
p10051
aS'Maybe by destroying evidence the killer creates more evidence; maybe someone sees them doing it and follows them to their next crime and catches them.'
p10052
aS'This is infantile.'
p10053
aS"Jesus fucking Christ I'm glad people like you aren't in charge."
p10054
aS'&gt;All the holes in my plan can be plugged if we discuss it forever.'
p10055
aS'You can go right ahead and plug them.'
p10056
aS"So far you're just making more of them."
p10057
aS"&gt;Yes but with no laws we don't have to go about following any privacy laws; perhaps more forensic evidence could be used in proving the killer did it without lawyers asking for it to be thrown out because x technicality."
p10058
aS'Having no laws works both ways, our volunteer investigators might be able to ask a black-bloc hacktivist to get inside a suspects computer and find a journal about their deeds, \n\nIn the sidebar, anarchism is defined as "a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control.'

aS'obviously, the ideal way for that to happen is for workers (provided they do not abuse their authority) to control the means of production - the absence of hierarchy and state then gives you anarchist "socialism".'

aS'Meanwhile, workers add massive value to the company and are rewarded next to nothing for it.'
p11449
aS'Good point, yet how many small businesses have shareholders? '
p11450
aS'Shareholders were just one example out of the many different exploitative business models.'
p11451
aS'Really, the big distinction here is management vs. ownership.'
p11452
aS'Anyone who owns without managing (like the above-mentioned shareholders or other high-level executives) is more than likely "stealing" value from the workers.'
p11453
aS'On the other hand, anyone who does both or manages without owning is more than likely earning a fair or less-than-fair share(in a capitalist system at least).'
p11454
aS'Many small business owners are both managers and owners(like yourself), while some others are just owners.'
p11455
aS'As the size of the company increases, so does the surplus value created by workers, so more business owners transition from manager-owners to just owners.'
p11456
aS'So to respond to your original point, it is somewhat hyperbolic to say that *every single* business owner exploits their employees, but it is absolutely not hyperbolic to say that the capitalist system highly rewards those who choose to use (or rather, have the opportunity to use) an exploitative business model.'
p11457
aS'Completely agree, and that was essentially what I was saying in my first post.'
p11458
aS"Still don't understand why I got down voted so hard though, lol. "
p11459
aS"Yeah, I don't get it either, as your model is what others here would advocate."
p11460
aS'resentful wage slaves, resentful wage slaves everywhere\n\nlol'
p11461
aS'An owner of a business IS the same thing as a shareholder in a large corporation.'
p11462
aS'The small &gt;20 employee company I work for has three owners, all who have invested money to buy in to the company, and all who expect a return on their investment through extracting profits, just like dividends on a stock.'
p11463
aS'It may not be a well defined financial instrument like a stock on a market, but it is owning a share, even if there is only one owner.'
p11464
aS'In that case, that owner owns 100% share in a company while their workers own nothing.'
p11465
aS'Sure, but you do more of the work and take on more risk by your own design.'
p11466
aS"Furthermore, your position doesn't cover most businesses.  "
p11467
aS"It's best not to talk about small businesses in this sub, most folks on here are pretty dogmatic and refuse to believe that anyone who owns a business is anything less than a blood-sucking capitalist who sits on their bum all day while their poor exploited minions bring big sacks of money to them."
p11468
aS"For example, I'm the manager of 21 rental townhomes and my family has owned the property for about two years now."
p11469
aS"All of our revenue goes towards labor and materials, as we're in the process of actively improving the condition of every unit."
p11470
aS"We've actually taken on a lot of debt by putting on new roofs, AC units, tile and hardwood flooring, bringing in new appliances, etc."
p11471
aS"The owner hasn't seen a dollar of profit during the entire time she's owned the property, we're basically acting as coordinators to better the lives of our tenants and help them have better housing to raise their families in."
p11472
aS"But that's too much for the typical /r/anarchist's brain to handle, because ALL LANDLORDS ARE BASTARDS!!!"
p11473
aS'lol'
p11474
aS"You don't seem to have a thorough understanding of the anarchist critique against absentee ownership; to put it concisely, it boils down to the fact that anarchism is a philosophy that analyzes and evaluates power structures and seeks to abolish them if found illegitimate."
p11475
aS'In the relationship between a landlord and a renter, the landlord holds most of the power, and is, in essence, a "micro ruler" - and in your case, taken at face value (which I have some difficulty believing - where is the money coming from to hire a management group if the owner sees no profits?'
p11476
aS'), a benevolent ruler is still a ruler. '
p11477
aS"It's not a management group, it's the owner's son (who is my partner's father) and me who manage the property."
p11478
aS'And you clearly don\'t know the difference between revenue and profit if you\'re asking me "how do you have expenditures if you have no profit?!!?'
p11479
aS'"'
aS'&gt; And you clearly don\'t know the difference between revenue and profit if you\'re asking me "how do you have expenditures if you have no profit?!!?'
p11480
aS'"\n\nI specifically addressed profit because you brought it up in your prior comment as if it were the only criteria important to anarchism, which is very much not the case.'
p11481
aS"And whether I know the difference between revenue and profit is irrelevant to the point I was making, but it appears that doesn't matter because you clearly aren't looking to understand (because you really don't), but to argue."
p11482
aS"So I'm not going to waste my time any further."
p11483
aS"lol yeah\n\nit is I who does not understand, not the person who doesn't know the difference between revenue and profit\n\nhahah"
p11484
aS"You're being evasive and combative, clearly are ignorant of the philosophy, and are simply looking to denigrate and argue."
p11485
aS'This is evident by the fact that you continue to harp on minutiae that has nothing to do with the point I was making.'
p11486
aS"And in your eagerness to employ ad hominem arguments you've amusingly revealed your own ignorance: *revenue* comes from *sales*."
p11487
aS'The money your landlord grandmother (or whomever it is) gets before opex is actually her *gross income*.'
p11488
aS'So no, you do not understand anarchist theory, as shown by your comments here.'
p11489
aS"And now it's become clear that you don't understand what you've accused me of not knowing (even though I explained why I addressed profit)."
p11490
aS"Frankly, I don't know why I bothered even writing this out, because your intent and character are made clear by your reply to me."
p11491
aS"ugh dude you tried to correct me and you were still wrong\n\nquit pretending that you know anything about running a business or even the terminology involved\n\n&gt;In business, revenue or turnover is income that a company receives from its normal business activities\n\nyou're so fucking dumb oh my gawwwwwd haha, that's so embarrassing for you"
p11492
aS'Quoting the Wikipedia page for "Revenue" does not make you an authority on business.'
p11493
aS'If anything, it shows your desperation -- you see, earlier you said that it was *not a business*.'
p11494
aS'If your grandmother has not incorporated then she has no revenue, she has income.'
p11495
aS"But I've clearly been sucked into your trap, because you have successfully diverted the discussion away from the point you made that I was *actually* addressing:\n\n&gt; But that's too much for the typical /r/anarchist's brain to handle, because ALL LANDLORDS ARE BASTARDS!!!"
p11496
aS'lol\n\nWhich, of course, is what I was responding to when I wrote this:\n\n&gt; [...] anarchism is a philosophy that analyzes and evaluates power structures and seeks to abolish them if found illegitimate.'
p11497
aS'In the relationship between a landlord and a renter, the landlord holds most of the power, and is, in essence, a "micro ruler" - and in your case ... a benevolent ruler is still a ruler.'
p11498
aS'I should have known by the tone of your comments that you had no intention of having a constructive or production interaction.'
p11499
aS"So yes, you've made a fool of me -- just not in the way you'd like to think you have."
p11500
aS"I never said it's not a business, I said it was a family-operated business."
p11501
aS"God, you're so dumb and you're just exposing your ignorance with every word haha."
p11502
aS'Let me break this down for you.'
p11503
aS'Most property owners who own a lot of rental units will pay a professional property management company to manage their properties for them.'
p11504
aS"That's not what we do, we run the business ourselves, within the family."
p11505
aS'The owner and management staff are all part of one family, not two separate companies.'
p11506
aS'Do you understand the difference?'
p11507
aS'&gt; a benevolent ruler is still a ruler.'
p11508

aS'For every one good comment chain I see on the front page of reddit, there are at least 20 other misogynistic, racist and xenophobic comment chains that overshadow it.  '
p11511
aS'One word comrade, /r/anarchism .'
p11512
aS'Why did I think that was a different subreddit and that this sub was called r/anarchirsm?'
p11513
aS'This is progress, consider where we were 100 years ago.'
p11514
aS"Demanding higher standards is necessary but we should still give ourselves credit for the progress we've made."
p11515
aS"We are still a very primitive species, mere infants in the evolution of self aware intelligence, in that context we're doing alright."
p11516
aS"There's still some very important shit we need to figure out but we are moving in the right direction."
p11517
aS"Evolution isn't teleological."
p11518
aS'No but it does have a trajectory and necessary conditions.'
p11519
aS'Any civilization that makes it to type 1 has to accomplish certain things, one of which is balance with the natural environment.'
p11520
aS"That's a relatively simple problem technically speaking, humans are the problem."
p11521
aS'To achieve balance with our environment we need to evolve.'
p11522
aS'The fuck are you talking about? '
p11523
aS'Not quite sure either, but a "type 1" civilization refers to one which is able to utilize all available energy impinging on its planet.'
p11524
aS'Type 2 its solar system, and Type 3 its galaxy.'
p11525
aS'The above commenter might be referring to the fact that in order to avoid killing itself and its planet off, a type 1 civilization must remain in perfect balance with its environment to remain sustainable as a type 1.'
p11526
aS'I for one disagree, in that I think a type 1 civilization will by nature have modified or destroyed its original natural environment to be able to use every watt of energy available.'
p11527
aS'Like a type 2 dismantling planets and building a Dyson sphere around its sun.'
p11528
aS'I said balance with its environment, which only means that the civilization is not undermining the planetary conditions necessary for its own survival.'
p11529
aS'That can mean radically altering the environment but it still requires balance with whatever the environment has become.'
p11530
aS"But we aren't a type one civilization?"
p11531
aS'And probably never will be.'
p11532
aS"Right now I'd say no, we derive the vast majority of our energy from millions of years old petroleum deposits."
p11533
aS'Once that disappears, we have no means of utilizing every single watt of solar energy available to us to feed our huge population.'
p11534
aS"There's unfortunately going to be a major population decline in the future in my opinion, possibly even disastrous, and we will have to start over without depending on oil if some of us make it through that."
p11535
aS"I don't see us preparing now for the inevitable, so my hopes aren't that high."
p11536
aS'I say bring it on, already got my RV, shotgun, and saving for my solar panels and heavy oil fueled generator that I can run off peanut and vegetable oil ;).'
p11537
aS"If Mad Max is our future, then let's do this."
p11538
aS'Someone get started on that thunderdome. '
p11539
aS"The word 'trajectory' connotes foresight, planning and inevitability--none of which are relevant to evolution."
p11540
aS'Things are getting better, though.'
p11541
aS'That much is true.'
p11542
aS"Comets have a trajectory but that doesn't mean they have foresight or are planning anything."
p11543
aS'Yes, and the clean, predictable path of a comet is also a poor metaphor for how evolution works.'
p11544
aS"I didnt say it was a metaphor for evolution, it's an example of how the word trajectory does not necessarily imply forsight or planning."
p11545
aS'But that example does imply inevitability.'
p11546
aS'And other uses of trajectory *do* suggest planning which is part of the words *connotation* (which is different from its definition).'
p11547
aS'If you want to describe the path of a comet a better word is *orbit*.  '
p11548
aS'Uh, no.'
p11549
aS"It's the same shit, with an updated look and a bigger audience due to the Internet."
p11550
aS"I'd say it's even worse because there are literally reactionaries actively propagandizing. "
p11551
aS'Look at the slums of today vs those at the turn of the 19th century.'
p11552
aS"There's progress."
p11553
aS"It's just slow and painful."
p11554
aS'no, extreme poverty has just been exported to other countries\n\nlook at the slums in india or africa, where people still have no access to clean water, no plumbing or waste disposal, etc.'
p11555
aS"and tell me it's any better than the slums of the 1800s"
p11556
aS"Agreed, the hypocrisy of labor laws that only apply to one's own nation's people is how multinational corps get their massive profits."
p11557
aS"But we like cheap products so we don't want other people's minimum wages to be as high as ours."
p11558
aS'But I still see progress.'
p11559
aS'The widening use of science makes it pretty inevitable.'
p11560
aS"People love control so they're trying to slow / profit off of that progress by owning the IP behind every new invention, but the improvement in our ability to meet our needs due to the increase in human knowledge is hard to stop."
p11561
aS"That ain't a century ago"
p11562
aS'And the worst offenders are small- and medium-business employers.'
p11563
aS"So it's the *petit* bourgeois robbing the proletariat."
p11564
aS'Of course, any surplus value kept by one person or party is robbery, but, even by capitalist terms, robbery occurs.'
p11565
aS'One more piece of evidence showing that it isn\'t "corporations" that are the problem, but capitalist business in general.'
p11566
aS'While this issue is real and sickening, you do realize that surplus value is rarely found in small businesses, right?'
p11567
aS"Of the few SB's that become profitable, even fewer are making anything that could be considered note-worthy in terms of surplus."
p11568
aS'And of those, again, not all (even most) have an owner that is just stuffing the extras in his/her pocket without distributing it though bonuses, raises or extra vacation time.'
p11569
aS'Most profit/"surplus" is reinvested into the business, which isn\'t always noticed by employees.'
p11570
aS'As an anarchist who has owned small businesses and worked for/with many medium and large companies, I am always concerned with vertical structures and always push for more horizontality.'
p11571
aS'Of course, from the bottom-up, the view almost always looks unfair and exploitative.'
p11572
aS"From the top-down, however, it's often not so black/white though."
p11573
aS"In fact, the few times I've noticed truly exploitative practices happening inside of small-to-medium sized businesses was from failing businesses that were run by idiots who were a) on the verge or were freshly divorced b) had clear substance abuse problems, and c) were clearly engaged in fraudulent activity."
p11574
aS'Once you introduce executive levels to the structure (ie.'
p11575
aS'large corporations), however, that is a whole other story.'
p11576
aS'Massive exploitation is really the norm.'
p11577
aS'So in short...\n\nTLDR; I agree that capitalism is the problem, but I disagree with you that "small-to-medium sized businesses are more pernicious and insidious than large corporations". '
p11578
aS"I understand that larger, more capital-intensive firms have more surplus value; that's specifically why I made the distinction in my comment between *extraction of surplus value* and *wage theft*."
p11579
aS'It doesn\'t matter how little surplus can be found in the average small/medium business or the average small/medium structure - I shall repeat my contention - if there are so many small-time capitalists willing to steal from their workers (both on Marxist/socialist and on capitalist terms), then clearly it isn\'t just the ethereal "corporation" that is problematic; indeed, the role of the capitalist *at any scale* is problematic.'
p11580
aS'Agreed.'
p11581
aS'Again though, I just think the idea that "all SB\'s are exploitative" is  hyperbolic, hyper-reactionary and just factually incorrect. '

aS'The shop owners have a vested interest in preventing a repeat so they must help find solutions because their self-interest is involved.'
p11677
aS'A ton of this disagreement has to do with the question: why are people poor and why do they stay poor from generation to generation?'
p11678
aS'If you believe people are poor by choice you fall on one side.'
p11679
aS'If you believe poor people are poor because of systematic oppression, you fall on the other side.'
p11680
aS'If there is one solution, the shop-keepers and the rioters, will want it, without the need for sympathy or agreement on anything other than preventing this from happening again. '

p11685
aS'The equation and the solution are both dehumanized, even if the events themselves are tragic in one or another way for everyone involved.'
p11686
aS'The conflict of interests acting out in such a violent way within a wider context is what makes the news, the threat for those in power that this might happen in their front yard, in their own neighborhood is the complex action that will motivate shit to be fucking done already.'

p11691
aS'And in that regard, the criminals and the victims are no different, just actors of torrents greater than they can conceive.'
p11692
aS'This is a real question, not a smart-ass hypothetical: How many times would you need to be searched by the police for no reason, before you were outraged and felt your human rights were being violated?'
p11693
aS'Once.'
p11694
aS"What's your point?"
p11695
aS"I'm just saying that I would be outraged and might even get violent."
p11696
aS'To have it happen over and over, I would want to burn down my city as well.'
p11697
aS"yeah, but if you get what you want because you rioted, then that's just rewarding bad behavior."
p11698
aS"and so, the next time you want something, you'll riot again."
p11699
aS'This is not good behavior to be rewarded.'
p11700
aS"it is to be punished so you don't keep doing destructive shit."
p11701
aS"They'll likely think that the way to fix the problem is less privacy and a stronger police force."
p11702
aS'This wont fix the root of the problem, but the general populace will be fine with arresting most dissidents.'

p11711
aS"I'd barely even call it rioting."
p11712

aS'There are many different people on the street, and they have different reasons.'
p11714
aS'To characterize them all as looters is dishonest.'

p11716
aS'what other reasons do you think these people have?'
p11717
aS'no not every single one is a looter.'
p11718

aS"Let's turn this question around, why do you think that's NOT the case?"
p11724
aS"That's not an argument, asking to prove a negative is foolish."

p11736
aS'No wonder people are rioting.'
p11737
aS'Favorite quote from the article:  "The looting and rioting had nothing at all to do with the killing of Mark Duggan.'
p11738
aS'That was the spark.'
p11739
aS'The bonfire had been prepared by years of neglect, fueled by the anger of young men with no stake in the system, angry at everybody and quick to exploit fury at the killing of a local man, even if he did allegedly fire at the police officer first.'
p11740
aS'"\n\nJust because they don\'t know or care who Mark Duggan is doesn\'t mean they are not **legitimately** pissed off.'
p11741
aS'Most people fail to see the bigger problem and play right into the hand of the media that fails or chooses not to address the root causes behind these riots.'
p11742
aS'Britain is hypocritical as fuck as they piss away public money on a royal wedding and cut the shit out of social programs and increase the cost of education beyond the reach of the poorest they are creating an even bigger wealth gap and can expect more of these in the future.'
p11743
aS"Just because the rioters weren't organised and didn't have an explicit political agenda doesn't mean there aren't factors at play that aren't worth investigating."
p11744
aS"Gainfully employed and educated people don't just go to the streets and set shit on fire for no reason."
p11745
aS'So true... Pissed off and angry at the small business owners who fucking keep them down! '
p11746
aS'Small businesses are a lot more numerous and easy to break into than large businesses.'
p11747
aS"Plus people who riot often aren't being logical- they're releasing their anger in a pretty primal way that usually doesn't have much direction."
p11748
aS"Yeah, I'm pretty sure you still overestimate the level of logic these gangs have."
p11749
aS"It's an opportunity for a massive hit and run - the difference is that Tesco and Spar can afford to protect themselves, while mom and pop can't."

p11755
aS'Almost always from a Cincy cop killing an unarmed black kid (or at least that is the way it seems).'
p11756
aS'In other words, rioting because of inequality.'
p11757
aS'The thing is- while all of us that don\'t riot sit back and say, "These people are fools and criminals and terrible.'
p11758
aS'They are destroying their own neighborhood- what good is that going to do?'
p11759
aS'"\n\nThen a few months after we have riots we have the PD, city council, and everyone else working together to try and solve the issues with police relations with the public, especially in poorer neighborhoods with large minority populations.'

aS'After the last big riots we had- things seriously changed around here.'
p11761
aS"While people rioting over sports games seems pointless, rioting over inequality and other bullshit- it may not be THE BEST way to handle a situation, but you can't say it isn't sometimes/in some ways effective."
p11762

p11785

p11786
aS"That isn't to say that the rioters have nothing to say."
p11787
aS"It's just that many of them are so disenfranchised that they have given up on political statements and social change."
p11788
aS'The system has fucked them and they know it and they\'ve decided "nothing\'s going to change, might as well have a nice flat screen TV.'

p11803
aS"I am just curious to hear someone else's solution. "
p11804
aS"I'm not an Anarchist."
p11805
aS'Rather, I fancy myself an amateur strategist and desktop philosopher.'
p11806
aS'My approach would be to form Black-Flag civilian defense militia, like the Sikhs in Birmingham to VISIBLY do two things:\n\n* Obviously represent Anarchist elements who are opposed to wanton looting and are working for the innocent.'

aS'Aaron Biber?'

aS'" and call that someone a hero?'
p11812
aS'How much greater would it have been if it was a group of obviously Anarchist civilians working to defend people like Aaron Biber from the assholes?'
p11813
aS'Not only would people like Aaron Biber be safe from senseless assholery, but the Anarchists would win a PR victory, if not with the Media, then with all of the local people who would otherwise have been fucked.'
p11814
aS'Word of Mouth is a good thing, no?'
p11815
aS'I like your approach except those that are defending should not go looking for a reward, such as, heroism.'
p11816
aS"They should do it because that is what they think is right and if a reward should present itself i guess it is perks of the 'job'."
p11817
aS'My approach is to go to work, receive a pay check and then purchase that new game/bike/pants/candy with that the money from the pay check.'
p11818
aS"I know this is not the typical approach for anarchism but it's worked pretty well for me so far."
p11819
aS"For what I can tell many if not most of these people aren't doing this to make a political point, but because they see an opportunity for free stuff, or to engage in activities like setting cars on fire that normally they cannot do."
p11820
aS"According to the Guardian some people are just passer-byes who didn't even plan to go looting but decided to when they saw the chance."
p11821
aS"If they wanted to send a political message other things like obstructing traffic, or political graffiti could get similar attention, but don't provide a personal gain for the individual."
p11822
aS'This also makes the message stronger because it is clear that you are doing this not for your self but for society as a whole.'
p11823
aS'well i do not subscribe to anarchism, i think i was surfing all and it looked like an interesting view point to read about.'

p11826
aS'Are you from England?'
p11827
aS'The only reason I ask is if you are not then you may be getting a skewed view from the media who want you to think that it is for individual gain and not a political protest.'
p11828
aS'If you are then you probably have much more insight than I ever could.'
p11829
aS'While the rioters may not be doing it for political reasons I think it can be linked to politics and by extension a down turn in the economy.'
p11830
aS"If these people were employed they would be going to work and wouldn't have time to riot."
p11831
aS'Civil unrest is in-part based on the massive unemployment in all developed countries right now.'

aS'Thats reasonable.'

aS'My comment was implying that these people were trying to obtain goods, not make a political point.'
p11835
aS'I did this by giving my approach to obtaining goods, not political change.'

p11883
aS'You garnered media attention for the injustice you caused.'
p11884
aS"Actually, I'm hearing about the issues behind the rioting and I'm in the U.S. From what I've seen, people are talking about unemployment, austerity, poverty, racism, police brutality, etc."
p11885
aS"Now, there are a lot of denials of those things being the cause, but it's being talked about nonetheless."

aS'There was an interesting part about when Sweden got Scania from Denmark, at which point they were speaking East Danish.'

aS'Scania was completely neglected in Swedish politics and many people died because of starvation or forced recruitment into the army, as well as (of course) violations by the Swedish army.'
p13098
aS'Years later when the Swedish king visited Scania he disliked the negative attitude the scanian people had for him and issued an order to deport all scanians to balticum in order to replace them with "real swedes".'

p13118
aS'A "state" is the organizational apparatus of a nation: the judiciary, banking system, police, and so on.'
p13119
aS'One of the reasons we have "nation-states" is because prior to their existence we had city-states (like Venice) that were sovereign self contained states with their own distinct culture, customs, laws, rulers, and so on -- Vatican City and Singapore are modern examples of this.'
p13120
aS'As time went on, these city-states merged together politically to create nation-states, which are made up of multiple cities, as are countries. '
p13121
aS"Not all nationstates come from city-states and that wasn't necessarily the precursor to all nationstates."
p13122
aS"Nationalism and the creation of nationstates was deeply linked to liberalism, instead of the government ruling by God's grace, the government was supposed to rule *for the people*."
p13123
aS'The people were, of course, the people of the country or nation.'
p13124
aS'If you happened to live in a country where the government was from another people/nation than yours, like if you happened to be a Slav in the Ottoman Empire, then nationalism would tell you that the Turks in Constantinople have nothing to do with you and that you would need your own state if you want your government to care about, since the Sultan of Constantinople will never give a shit about you.'
p13125
aS'Usually nationalism was based on language and culture, like Germany and Russia, but not always.'
p13126
aS'Sometimes it is based on religion, like Belgium.'
p13127
aS'Sometimes it is based on a common history or common values, like Switzerland.'

p13146
aS'I always saw states as this artificial construct that has emerged over centuries, in spite of different nations.'

p14318

S"Of course, the answer is always that we've been set on this path from the beginning and the social structure we live in (along with relative maturity in general) doesn't provide much of any of the kind of personal growth required to start really seeing and asking real questions about it all, unless you've been a determined delinquent since a young age or had exceptionally cool parents or some other avenue to seeing beyond the schoolyard. So most of us unfortunate enough to have learned how to get by and put on a good show and garner reward or some amount of personal satisfaction within the system we find ourselves in are left to catch ourselves looking around one day halfway through our undergrad and wonder, where am I, and how the fuck did I get here?"
