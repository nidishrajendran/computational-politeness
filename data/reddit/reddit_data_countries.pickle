aS'Given that, if chosing randomly, 20% would have gotten it right if nobody knew, that means about 12% actually knew.'
p66
aS'If 12% knew and the remaining 88% guessed randomly, the percentage correct would be `12 + 88/5 = 29.6`\n\nWhat we want is the value of x in `x + (100-x)/5 = 32` which results in 15% knowing the answer and 17 of the remaining 85 guessing correctly.'

p75
aS"More people did not vote last election than voted for any political party\n\nThe level of representation in the Scottish referendum has given fresh impetus to what was a very moribund sector of politics even if I don't agree with its direction sometimes."
p76
aS'The adoption of politics amongst young voters was heartening.'
p77
aS'I hope it is replicated across the majority of the uk'
p78
aS"It won't be, because the difference with the scottish referendum was that there was only two choices, so regardless of where you voted or what you voted for, your vote had a proportional impact."
p79
aS'The total number of 18-24 year olds ("young voters") is relatively low compared to other age brackets, which means even with an equivalent turn-out, they have less of an impact.'
p80
aS"However, you're also guaranteed to get less of a turn-out for various reasons, which means at the end of the day, even getting every young person who might conceivably vote to vote won't give young voters enough sway to make politicians care about their vote."
p81
aS'I worked it out at one point and something like a 70% turn-out would equate to less than a 1% increase in votes for any one party.'
p82
aS"Is it really surprising they're not enthralled?"
p83
aS"This is the first election my partner (28) has voted in and it's really only the fact I'm interested in politics that's made her think about it."

p85
aS'The level of disinterest in politics is something all of Westminster needs to be ashamed of - it should be a mandatory subject in schools for starters just so people can get their head around some of the more mind boggling aspects of the system. '

p89
aS"I guess that's fair, but what do you mean?"
p90
aS"What issue(s) do you think I'd be unaware of?"
p91
aS"Well, there's tons of stuff that the general public seem very unaware of and people who say they've studied politics seem as unaware as anyone else."
p92
aS'So, for example, do you think that the general public has a say in how society is run in the UK? \n\n'
p93
aS'Some of a say, yeah.'
p94
aS'Not as much as it should, in my opinion PMQ/the MP-constituency link is pretty much a joke.'
p95
aS'And the part of the general public that vote for minor parties essentially get no say at all.'
p96
aS'But I think those involved in some pressure groups can have an impact (though of course pressure groups have that problem of their power very much being linked to their wealth) and the use of referendums on some issues to me is a way for the general public to have a say (+ politicians absolving themselves of backlash for whatever the decision is).'

aS"Some people find that impact incredibly important so that even if it does very little relativile to the grand scheme of things it's still more worth it than anything else they could do in 20 minutes."

aS'Everyone, that is, except the end consumer American citizen, a large number of whom are conned into believing there is no better way.'
p399
aS"Because the NHS doesn't operate to make money, the entire healthcare business in the UK is a completely different animal."
p400
aS'So every proposal you hear that involves "modernising" the NHS, every suggestion that includes "input" from US companies, is an attempt to turn UK healthcare into a little clone of the US, and the money grubbers can\'t wait.'

aS"As for flexibility and comfort in not needing to worry about the property - that's counterbalanced by the fact that you have to worry about your landlord ignoring you when the heating breaks or the shower stops working or there's damp coming in from the roof - it means that when your yearly contract is up you have to worry yourself over whether they're going to put the rent up or decide to sell... and if they do decide to sell (which 2 of my landlords have done) then you have to worry about trying to get your security deposit back and trying to find a new place."

aS'I then asked him to respond to the motions proposed in the 2010 manifesto (which has strangely been deleted from their webpage and no longer widely available) which, amongst others, advocated it to make it legal to discriminate against gender in the workplace, abolished maternity leave and removed the European employment right to paid holidays and breaks in the working day.'

p1259
aS'Lets say 80% of men earn more than 18k, and 75% of women earn over 18k.'
p1260
aS'This means that our immigration rules ban 20% of men from bringing their foreign wife into the country and 25% of women from bringing their foreign husband into the country.'

p1262

aS'they would not automatically be required to leave.'

aS'That said, the parties that would see us leave the EU would also so see us leave the ECHR and, therefore, there would be very little to prevent the British government of the day altering the immigrations status of those EU citizens here.'
p1275
aS'Gradually, I would imagine the way EU citizens were treated would become more like how those from out with the EU were treated, in terms of access to benefits, healthcare, education, etc.'
p1276
aS'Depending on the political mood of the country, or the relative influence of different parties, the situation could be better or worse.'
p1277
aS'In terms of how British citizens are treated in the EU, for example those in Spain, the situation would likely be quite similar, except that their rights would likely be better protected as a result of Spain staying in the ECHR etc.'
p1278
aS"Their rights to access healthcare, via the multilateral framework that is in place at the moment that ensure equal access, would probably be rescinded (if the UK left the arrangement, which I'd imagine was likely), and there'd probably be other consequences, but it wouldn't be more inconvenient than anything else."
p1279
aS'For those who wished to go and make their life in the EU afterwards, that would be a different, much harder, matter.'

aS'UKIP cannot give assurances on how the rest of the EU would react.'
p1282
aS"The fact that those Brits in Spain are self-supporting is besides the point as immigration status doesn't really work on that basis."
p1283
aS"The legal rights of rEU citizens in the UK would be a bit precarious, legally speaking, but I can't envisage a political environment where it was OK for them to be unfairly treated (after all, we'd still be seeking FTA's with the rEU and scewing their citizens over would not go down well)."
p1284
aS"TL;DR That's not UKIP's immigration policy."
p1285
aS"The system they'd put in place would make it much harder for people to move here."
p1286
aS'The situation of those left behind post-Brexit would be a political, not legal, matter.'
p1287
aS"Likely, with the interplay of having to maintain good relations with the rEU, it would be ok. Their situation would likely be worse off in terms of entitlements and rights, and the same would be likely of UK citizens in rEU, but it wouldn't be any worse than legal migrants from outwith the EU. "

p1308
aS'We need to move people away from using cars and so having the capacity to do this is important.'
p1309
aS"At the moment it's too London-centric, effectively it turns Birmingham into another London suburb."
p1310
aS"By using it to link the cities of the North instead, it'll help economic activity up there."
p1311
aS'Arguably London is the most important city in Europe linking the rest of the UK to it is extremely important.'
p1312
aS'Exactly - you can look at it as an attempt to draw investment, jobs and people *to* London, or to drive investment and jobs in the Midlands and the North by making them more connected and more accessible.'
p1313
aS'Either way, the WCML is absolutely crammed (the busiest railway line in Europe in terms of passengers and freight IIRC) and we need more capacity between the big cities.'
p1314
aS"If we're going to construct a new railway line to take the strain off, it may as well be high speed so that it's fit for the 21st Century. "

aS"It'll be doing well in ten years whether it gets HS2 or not."

p1320
aS'HS2 is bad because it will do nothing to get people out of cars.'
p1321
aS'The vast majority (and I mean over 50%) of car journeys are under 5km.'
p1322
aS'A high speed train between London and Birmingham will have no effect on that.'
p1323
aS"So it's bad because it doesn't improve one point?"
p1324
aS"(Even if we accept your premise that it will do nothing to get people out of cars, which I don't)."
p1325
aS"That's pretty poor reasoning."
p1326
aS"To critically evaluate your claim, where's your evidence that it encourages no modal shift?"
p1327
aS'One of the large benefits of HS2 is a step-change in capacity south of Rugby, and the freeing up of train paths on the WCML more generally.'
p1328
aS'That extra capacity is to be redirected, in part, to improving the commuter-rail systems in, and around, our major conurbations.'
p1329
aS'Such improvements *will* encourage modal shift from cars to rail.'
p1330
aS'On the subject modal shift, have you considered the modal shift from air to rail as HS2 extends northwards to Scotland.'
p1331
aS'Millions of passengers per year fly between the central belt of Scotland and London/English cities.'
p1332
aS'As the journey times move towards three hours, which phase 2 and then subsequent improvements in Scotland will lead to, precedent would suggest about 80% of them will shift to rail.'
p1333
aS"For the most part, you'd expect only people who were making connecting flights in London to continue using planes."

p1341
aS'In reality, the scheme is far larger than that and likely to be less expensive (the price given has a huge contingency fund and are P95 figures). '
p1342
aS'It was marketed badly and NIMBYs are a serious issue'
p1343
aS'Speaking about yourself?'
p1344
aS'You made the connection between an intercity rail connection while saying we need to get people out of cars, yet, as I said, the vast majority of journeys people make in private vehicles are under 5km.'
p1345
aS'Exactly how is spending \xc2\xa350bn on a London centric rail link going to effect that, while at the same time spending on walking and cycling options have been falling?'
p1346
aS'And labelling anyone who has an opposing opinion on HS2 as "NIMBY" shows you dont have a fucking clue.'

aS"Again, you've spouted off but have shown no evidence for any claim you've made, nor from your inference that you're any kind of 'expert'\n\nYou're just appearing to be a bit of a dick really that makes adhominem attacks on people."
p1353
aS'No substance at all.'

p1368
aS"I might be wrong (as I don't really follow US politics much) but that's what the tea party seems like to me."
p1369
aS"They might seem like mad right wing nutters but there's a point to their madness and it isn't to get the nonsense they say into actual policy, it's just to shift the whole political landscape a bit further right. "
p1370
aS'How are they mad right wing nutters?'
p1371
aS'Are you referring to one or two councilors who fall into this category or are you putting the entire party under this entire heading?'

p1373
aS'Aye, I was wildly generalising.'

p1417
aS'This one seems like the lawyers were being overly cautious.'
p1418
aS"If you know someone who thinks Scientology is harmless, it would be worth them watching it, but for anyone that's already got that it's a corrupt cult from watching that South Park episode or visiting operation clambake or whatever this documentary is just a curiosity, it's not going to present you with any major surprises. "
p1419
aS"HBO knew that if they even alluded to anything that wasn't 100% verifiable, the Scientology lawyers would come down on them like a tonne of bricks."
p1420
aS'I remember reading HBO hired an extra 120 or something just to deal with the legal stuff around the documentary.'
p1421
aS'While it meant the documentary may have been a little tame compared to what you can find on the internet, it is what allowed it to be broadcast in the first place. '
p1422
aS'I think they played it safe to make it harder for Scientology to sue them.'
p1423
aS'They seem to have stuck to stuff they can 100% prove'
p1424
aS"Most people haven't been reading stuff online."

aS"It's for a more general audience."
p1426
aS'The simple way for Sky to broadcast it would be to make it available on their On Demand service and then region-lock it to customers not in N.I.'
p1427
aS'I get the feeling this is only going to cause people to get curious about this documentary and will end up seeing it as a result.'
p1428
aS'Better than it being buried on Sky Atlantic where only subscribers who already know about it will see it. '
p1429
aS'Downloaded it and watched it weeks ago.'

aS'Presumably there are scientologists in Northern Ireland, and an audience for scientology, so the Los Angeles church can rock up and claim it might harm their sales of pamphlets. '

p1441
aS'&gt;  Sky is unable to differentiate its signal between region\n\nIs that really the case?'
p1442
aS'I thought Sky TV customers have channel region differentiation based on the postcode to that their viewing card is registered.'
p1443
aS'I think what they mean is unlike the BBC who can broadcast different things to different regions based on there being  BBC One NI and BBC One Scotland, Sky only has one channel which broadcasts to the whole of the UK so if they show it on Sky One there is no way to only show in England, Wales, and Scotland '
p1444
aS'Its definitely worth a watch but as stereotypical as it sounds, the book is better at going into a lot more detail.'

aS"The thing is the law is the law and it's the Police's job to uphold it."
p1522
aS'Whether or not you agree with that law and how conductive it is to creating a safer community to combat it does not change the fact that possession of cannabis is illegal.'
p1523
aS"You can't just let people very openly undertake organised illegal activity on a large scale like this."

p1531
aS'The 71mph argument is very different to this.'
p1532
aS'One is something that anyone can accidentally do due to sensitivities of the instruments in cars, the other is an organised protest against a law, during which people are breaking said law openly, on a large scale.'

aS'One person in a park late at night calls for discretion, 100s of people in the middle of the day does not.'

p1543

p1544
aS'That the police are justified in arresting them?'
p1545
aS'Yes, I would.'
p1546
aS'Are you saying that cannabis should remain illegal *because* "the law is the law", or are these two separate statements that have been confusingly conflated by your run-on sentence?'

aS'You clicked through to the EU referendum article I suspect.'
p1554

p1560
aS"I don't know.."
p1561
aS'Almost all decisions can be evidence based.'
p1562
aS'What does the best evidence available to us say about whether this policy will achieve what we want it to or not?'
p1563
aS'Also: what experiments can be done to prove the efficacy of this policy measure?'
p1564
aS'There are too many differing opinions on the governments role and what it should seek to do.'
p1565
aS'For example, what is evidence that economic policy is working?'
p1566
aS"Lowering unemployment and gdp growth as we're currently seeing would probably be a couple of indicators."
p1567
aS'Yet there are still people on this sub who argue that there is no current growth in wages so we are not in recovery.'
p1568
aS'Also, how do we balance these differet indicators?'
p1569
aS"Economics isn't an exact science."
p1570
aS'Also, there are no facts on social policy,there are only beliefs on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, immigration etc.'
p1571
aS'Disagree strongly.'
p1572
aS'Politicians are always saying things like "this is more fair", "this policy will provide the incentive" and "if we punish criminals they won\'t do it again".'
p1573
aS'I guess you &amp; I could argue whether fairness is measurable (personally I believe very strongly in dismantling hereditary wealth inequality), but incentive based stuff absolutely can be tested.'
p1574
aS'Things like recidivism rates of criminals can be measured, comparing the results of prison sentences with those of various kinds of rehabilitation.'
p1575
aS'There was a great study done which drew conclusions on the deterrent effect of prison sentences on old lags, following a prison overcrowding pardon in Italy.'
p1576
aS'One of the great things about the current move to teaching "academies" is that allowing schools to operate as they wish will allow the results of various methodologies to be tested and measured.'
p1577
aS'If a head teacher sees that the school down the road is getting better results by sending all the kids home with a study pack, then he can adopt it for himself and improve his own yield. '
p1578
aS'How can you seriously qualify whether certain social policies are objectively good or bad?'
p1579
aS'There are no facts on social policy,there are only beliefs on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, etc.'
p1580
aS"Obviously some statistics can be found on things like re offending rates in criminals, but some people would argue that prison isn't only about reforming prisoners, but also about punishment for their actions, contrary to the systems often cited in Scandinavia which have some of the lowest re-offending rates in the world."
p1581
aS"On the issue of fairness, different people have different views again on what qualifies as 'fair'."
p1582
aS'On issues such as gender, race and class some people believe in equality of opportunity for example, while others believe in equality of outcome (eg enforcing company boards to be 40% female).'
p1583
aS'Economically, some people believe in an equal distribution of wealth, while others favour individual financial freedom.'
p1584
aS'Some believe in nationalisation and some in privatisation.'
p1585
aS"I don't believe there is an objective solution to these problems, no matter how much evidence you can gather, different people will always have different ideologies that will influence their decisions on these matters."
p1586
aS"&gt; I don't believe there is an objective solution to these problems, no matter how much evidence you can gather, \n\nThat's your problem right there, mate."
p1587
aS'Nothing I can say is going to change your mind.\n\n'
p1588
aS"You're right: you probably not going to change my mind on this subject, but I think you calling my view a 'problem' shows clearly the difference in our beliefs."
p1589
aS"I don't see other people's views as a problem, but a different take on things, rather than your belief that every other view contrary to yours is completely and absolutely wrong."
p1590
aS'If your opinions are pulled out of your arse, and you can ignore facts when "forming" them, then it certainly is a problem that your vote affects me.'
p1591

aS"They're walking a tightrope between supporting their voters views by saying the EU is bad, but also supporting the party's views by trying to stay in the EU."
p1599
aS"They're attempting to achieve this by saying the party wants to reform the EU."
p1600
aS"This means it's in their interests to suppress reports like this, because if the EU doesn't need reform, it undermines the Tory position."
p1601
aS'Personally, I think this policy seems extremely short sighted.'
p1602
aS"The reforms the Tories are suggesting simply won't happen, and if they do get elected on a platform of implementing these reforms to the EU, only for them inevitably to fail, they'll lose more votes to UKIP than if they simply came out with a pro-EU position. "

aS'Osbourne is far too smart to leave the EU.'
p1610
aS"Most tories in government are pro-EU, but they also have some anti-EU supporters (members of the party in the counties and amongst the wider electorate) and they don't want them defecting to the UKIPs."
p1611
aS"That's why Cameron has promised a referendum on the EU - he doesn't want it to pass, but he wants to placate that element."
p1612
aS"You're right, it stinks."
p1613
aS"Government got so used to telling lies and covering up it doesn't know why it does it anymore."
p1614
aS"Seriously, what's the benefit of consealing facts about a key issue, if not just to keep the answer uncertain."
p1615
aS'Just like how Teresa May shelved the immigration study when it went against her "immigration is evil" narrative.'
p1616
aS'Or how David Nutt got sacked when he presented the evidence that drug legalisation would be a beneficial move.'

aS'Governments have a narrative and will twist the facts until they fit it.'

p1644
aS"They claim that they're never coming back, but they're British citizens, and the whole point of citizenship is the right to enter your own country."
p1645
aS"The reason people care is that revoking someone's citizenship is a really big deal - no country is allowed to revoke its citizens' citizenship willy-nilly, and we've already gotten a bad rap for doing it in the few cases in which we can get away with it (holders of dual citizenship)."
p1646
aS"Personally, I think that crimes committed outside Britain's jurisdiction are none of Britain's business, but that's not the popular opinion. "

aS'Its about managing risk, not about avoiding it completely.'
p1659
aS"Whether these people end up coming back to the UK or not, we shouldn't let our own fear and the spin and corruption of the government and security services get out of hand."
p1660
aS'There comes a point where you just have to accept some degree of risk.'
p1661
aS"Personally I'm not too bothered about revoking citizenship for people who go to join IS, but allowing that power to be used at all means it could be used against anybody, and we have to think very carefully about whether we are willing to accept that."

p1888
aS"You're really exaggerating how destitute the average foodbank user is."
p1889
aS"A healthy amount of 'walked up hill both ways' happens when discussing the poor in this country, and it helps no one."
p1890
aS"If even 60% (lowball) of foodbank users can turn on a hob and have a pot to ~~piss~~ cook in then it's worth getting them off their reliance on foodbanks by educating them. "
p1891
aS'I said majority :?.'
p1892
aS"So your plan is teach them to cook which is not the problem anyway and they'll magic more food and electric money out of their arse so we can get rid of food banks? "
p1893
aS'My plan is to teach people to cook so the food banks can do more good with less resources.'
p1894
aS"The Trussell trust seems to agree, since they just started cooking classes..\n\n&gt;Eat Well, Spend Less courses\n\n&gt;The Trussell Trust has piloted, and is currently looking to roll out, 'Eat Well, Spend Less' courses that teach people how to cook when on a low budget."
p1895
aS'The course includes basic cookery lessons as well as providing advice on food budgeting, hygiene and nutrition.\n\n'
p1896
aS'Going down that route to solve the problem while helpful for individuals just sounds like a modern day take on soup kitchens, you just do it at home instead, none of it solves the problem of food banks in 2015 when we can feed the planet, do more with less seems to be the mantra of those with a lot. '
p1897

aS"They're literally thousands of years old. "
p1903
aS'Avoiding the main point,  good job!'
p1904
aS'The point is teaching someone to cook does not solve the fact we have food banks in 2015 because people cannot afford food, a resource we regularly waste on an astronomical scale!'

aS'Aslong as we can dish out a bowl of rice and tell them how to boil it its all good right. '

p1913
aS"You're clearly got yourself all worked up into a tizzy. "
p1914
aS'Do you not think food banks maybe know what people need and request?'
p1915
aS"What they request isn't relevant."
p1916
aS"I'm sure they'd request steak if they thought the could get it."
p1917

p1921
aS"Do you have any background whatsoever in how food banks operate, or are you just assuming it's all tinned food?"
p1922
aS"When you talk about helping people transition to helping themselves I think you're missing the point that they're going to food banks largely because they have no money to buy basic food, not because they aren't cooking properly."
p1923
aS"Helping people make the most of basics is a good idea, but it's not going to replace food bank usage.  "
p1924
aS"Well, just looked through the Trussell Trust website and came across this:\n\n&gt;Eat Well, Spend Less courses\n\n\n&gt;The Trussell Trust has piloted, and is currently looking to roll out, 'Eat Well, Spend Less' courses that teach people how to cook when on a low budget."
p1925
aS'The course includes basic cookery lessons as well as providing advice on food budgeting, hygiene and nutrition.'
p1926
aS"So looks like they've realised it too."
p1927
aS'So looks like I was right. '
p1928
aS"I don't see anything there that suggests it'll replace food bank usage."
p1929
aS"I suspect you're of the mindset that people who use food banks just aren't budgeting properly etc."
p1930
aS"Whilst it's a great thing to help those on low budgets or borderline food bank users, those who use food banks typically aren't able to buy the rice and beans to begin with."
p1931
aS'Early stages, clearly.'
p1932
aS"They've identified the same problem I have, though. "
p1933
aS'Not really, they\'ve realised a need to support people on low budgets make that budget serve them best, you\'re suggesting budgeting and cooking properly will *replace* food banks as if those who use them are failing in some way to do that - and your comment about "people would request steak if they could get away with it" when I really meant things like grains and toilet roll all seems to add up to an attitude that doesn\'t understand that many food bank users cannot afford basic ingredients like rice and beans in the first place. \n\n\n'
p1934
aS"&gt;you're suggesting budgeting and cooking properly will replace food banks\n\nNo I'm not?"
p1935
aS'Quote me.'
p1936
aS'Quote me where I said that. '
p1937
aS'&gt; Giving people tins of food is like giving a man a fish, whereas teaching someone to cook nutritious meals using dirt cheap ingredients is like giving them a net.'
p1938
aS"&gt;It's charity, and as such we should be looking at getting the best cost:help ratio and this includes helping reduce the reliance on food banks any way we can."
p1939
aS'Teaching people to cook cheap nutritious meals can be one of those methods.'
p1940
aS"Canned foods no doubt would still have a place in the packages, as veg isn't particularly easy to store in anything other than a can."
p1941
aS'But we should still be transitioning to teaching them to help themselves.'
p1942
aS'As if people who use food banks are just not "helping themselves" because they don\'t know how to cook or budget.'
p1943
aS'You say helping them do that will cut down reliance on food banks. \n'
p1944
aS"As you can see, in what you've quoted I say: \n\n&gt;Canned foods no doubt would still have **a place in the packages**, as veg isn't particularly easy to store in anything other than a can."
p1945
aS'But we should still be transitioning to teaching them to help themselves.'
p1946
aS'So I clearly recognise the need for foodbanks to exist.'
p1947
aS"I'm talking about reform, not replacement."
p1948
aS'Learn to fucking read.'
p1949
aS'You are literally saying teaching people to budget and cook will "reduce reliance" on food banks, you are saying food banks should teach people to "help themselves" like they\'re not trying all they can already, seemingly missing the point that those who use food banks cannot afford basics like rice and beans in the first place and it seems to be news to you that some food bank users cannot even afford electricity to cook anything at all.'
p1950
aS'You are clearly completely misinformed about food banks and the arrogance of saying food banks are getting it wrong, here are my opinions on how they should operate, is laughable.  '
p1951
aS'&gt;You are literally saying teaching people to budget and cook will "reduce reliance" on food banks\n\nIt will.'
p1952
aS'&gt;you are saying food banks should teach people to "help themselves" like they\'re not trying all they can already\n\nThey\'re almost certainly not.'
p1953
aS"They might be trying everything they know, but that's why it's helpful to teach them stuff they don't know and the Trussell Trust clearly agrees with me on that point."
p1954
aS'The Trussell Trust, the biggest foodbank network in the country, agrees with me in concept.'
p1955
aS'Fuck off.'

p1959
aS"&gt;They're almost certainly not."
p1960
aS"Wow, you really are of the school of thought that food bank users just aren't handling themselves properly, aren't you."
p1961
aS'Thought as much.'
p1962
aS"The Trussell Trust don't say anywhere that the scheme is designed to replace food bank usage."
p1963
aS"You making out that they're agreeing with you after your first comment was that food banks are getting it wrong is ridiculous."
p1964
aS'Why do you keep swearing at me?'
p1965
aS'Why are you so upset? \n'
p1966
aS"&gt;The Trussell Trust don't say anywhere that the scheme is designed to reduce food bank usage."
p1967
aS"They're a food bank."
p1968
aS"Why would they be doing it if it didn't benefit their cause? "
p1969
aS"They're not just a food bank."
p1970
aS'They have various schemes working with those suffering from hunger and poverty - food banks are just one of those schemes. \n\n'
p1971

p1972
aS'&gt;This is what we work towards.'
p1973
aS'We know it is improbable we can end ALL hunger and poverty, but this is our goal.'
p1974
aS'It is bold.'
p1975
aS"We felt it was important to prioritise 'hunger' before 'poverty' in the sentence and it is given geographical context with the 'UK'\n\nThey clearly believe that teaching people to cook on a budget can further either both, or one of those aims."
p1976
aS"I'm afraid I've said all I needed to say, and we're getting nowhere here."
p1977
aS'Have a nice day. '

aS'From their site:\n\n"Why do people need emergency food?'

aS'Today people across the UK will struggle to feed themselves and their families.'

p1981
aS'Almost 40% of foodbank clients last year experienced benefit delay.'

p1983
aS"It's central to their overall mission of helping people in poverty and who are hungry."
p1984
aS'But nowhere on their site do they say it is a replacement for food bank usage.'
p1985

aS'This is a classic problem with public sector outsourcing to private firms.'
p1995
aS'Private businesses are primarily concerned with maximizing profit, they get \xc2\xa3x to provide the service so their job is to minimize costs as much as possible without losing the contract.'
p1996
aS'The bureaucrats who are put in charge of monitoring the performance of the outsourcing company and making sure contractual obligations are being kept to, are often completely out of touch with how things are actually going on the ground.'
p1997
aS"The bureaucrats sit in their office on the opposite side of the building (or 100's of miles away in some cases) and ultimately the only information they are going to get about how the outsourcing is going is from the outsourcing company themselves.. Site inspections?"
p1998
aS"The bureaucrats wouldn't even know what to look for, and would probably give a weeks notice to the private company in any case."
p1999
aS'Moreover, the bureaucrats job security depends on the continued existence of these outsourcing contracts.'
p2000
aS"If they start cancelling contracts or scaring the outsourcing companies off with heavy re-negotiations, the bureaucrat is quite literally redundant because they will then have no outsourcing to oversee.. At a time of austerity they can't rely on being given a new job role if their current role disintegrates."
p2001
aS"I don't know what the public expects to happen."
p2002
aS'Every individual/company in this scenario is acting in a completely rational way, this is merely the end result.'

aS"I don't delete anything because I might need to refer back to it at some point and I am nowhere near max inbox."
p2017
aS"Although taking the example of gmail in particular, I think there are real issues about whether you want google to be storing your MP's email."
p2018
aS"That said, there's simply no question that MPs should have big email mailboxes, ideally hosted in this country.\n\n"
p2019
aS'Actually that is a good point.'
p2020
aS'My point really was that it is technically possible to have a large inbox capacity and if reaching inbox max is a big issue for MPs then it would be worth taxpayers money investing in a better system.'
p2021
aS"I don't really know what the limiting factor for inbox size is but I suspect that it is a hardware issue over a software one i.e."
p2022
aS'not enough hard drive space.'
p2023
aS'So fixing it should be relatively easy assuming that the government manages its own web servers.'
p2024
aS"Don't forget that there's also a difference between an MP and a candidate - I'm absolutely fine with using public money to put a system in place (I'm sure there must be already) for decent email for MPs, but until a candidate is elected, they're on their own (or with their party)"
p2025
aS'Well, mailbox size *is* a software setting.'
p2026

aS'This is a slightly different issue.'
p2040
aS'The "problem" here is the candidate isn\'t *deleting* emails, which I actually struggle to see as a problem given I don\'t really want candidates for public office to be deleting emails very much, rather than *reading* emails.'
p2041
aS'Basically they need more storage space.'
p2042
aS"There's no way to tell from the message whether or not the emails they have received are getting read but they can't receive any more until they get more space."

aS'Do you actually require a response to your response though? \n'
p2044
aS"It's just an email."

p2141
aS"But when it's a candidate for a government, oh well then their terrible at micro-management, shouldn't be trusted with government and are absolutely ridiculous."
p2142
aS"They do you know, have other lives and families, unless you're completely devoid of a social life and took no time for leisure activities then you too would end up behind on your emails, unless you was rich enough to hire somebody to do it for you."
p2143
aS'This is exactly what is wrong with politics, people will take any bit of information on a candidate or MP they can and unfairly turn that into an attack on their person or ability, this is why they constantly lie and dodge questions.'
p2144
aS'Or you would expect them to be know enough about something like the internet to not have such a thing as a full inbox?'
p2145
aS"Christ, my Hotmail has over three thousand unread emails sitting in there and it's still growing."
p2146
aS"There's no need to have a full inbox these days and it should be expected that people who are going to vote on laws for the internet etc to know this very basic fact, surely?"
p2147
aS"But, if he has 3000 emails then he's never going to reply to you anyway, so the problem remains the same."
p2148
aS"Maybe he prefers a small inventory so that he'll always have enough to get through and won't be overburden with a massive amount of emails."
p2149
aS"Well, of course they wouldn't reply with that many emails, but being told that someone's inbox is full is actually a reply, whereas if the e-mail had just sent and got lost in the abyss of the bulging inbox they'd probably have got what they wanted to off their chest and gone on their way thinking at least they tried."
p2150
aS"Being told that the inbox is full is essentially being told 'nope!"
p2151
aS"' and no one would like that."
p2152
aS"Preferring a small inbox doesn't hold much weight when you're representing, or trying to represent, thousands of people."

aS'Still reflective of their stupidity.'
p2165
aS'How is not getting round to your emails reflective of a persons intelligence?'
p2166
aS"It's not even clear they're not getting round to them."
p2167
aS"It's quite possible they're reading the emails and just leaving them on the server which now says they've run out of room."
p2168
aS"It's a bit of a silly problem and if your job involves getting tons of email from the public, other organisations and so on you really need to have a quality email service that will keep receiving emails but it's not even a sign that they're not reading them."

aS'So what can be done in your opinion?'
p2172
aS'Admitting that admin staff are needed would be a start.'
p2173
aS"When political parties talk about 'cutting red tape' that's often code for firing admin staff and instead having doctors do the admin."
p2174
aS"That means you're paying a doctors wage for simple admin tasks and giving them less time to spend with patients. "
p2175
aS'The MoD and the police face similar problems.'
p2176
aS'Cutting bureaucracy is a populist pursuit and like you say, all it ends up doing is forcing somebody on \xc2\xa320 an hour to do the job of somebody on \xc2\xa39 an hour, and less time to do their own jobs.'
p2177
aS'To be fair the opposite was done in the police and it worked well, they took cops out of desk jobs and hired civilian staff.'
p2178
aS'This is one thing that annoys me about getting rid of the bureaucrats.'
p2179
aS'Admin staff do admin well, managers (should) manage well, and doctors/nurses treat well.'
p2180
aS'While I agree the clinical staff should be involved in the management, it should be in more of an advisory role that takes little time.'
p2181
aS'I have no inside knowledge of the working of the NHS but the idea that there are legions of office bods bumbling around with clipboards doing fuck all that could be easily fired with no repercussions always seemed idiotic to me.'
p2182
aS"I'd suggest the media's partly to blame, no politician will get time to explain that, as below, we need admin staff, or we're paying doctors, and overloading them with work, to do simple paperwork."
p2183
aS"Instead they have to come out with snappy soundbites that sound like they're doing something."
p2184
aS'More doctors, better system of centralised patient notes (one of the reasons the shifts are so long is that people die when changeovers happen).'
p2185
aS'Better management, probably. '

aS'Have my other half (Also a doc) in tears from the abusiveness of others.'
p2191
aS'Other than the threat of litigation, if you made it a little less specific to medicine it could be practically any public sector job at the moment.'
p2192
aS"Slips don't kill people in most jobs; I imagine the stress is amplified considerably with that hanging over your head."
p2193
aS"There's nothing you can do to change that about medicine."
p2194
aS'Its the nature of the job.'

aS'A doctor is pretty certain to screw up sometimes.'
p2200
aS'But, putting them under unnecessary pressure and working them to the point of fatigue is certain to make it worse.'
p2201
aS'I would imagine that the psychological horror of knowing you killed someone is no less, even if you know you were pushed past your ability to do the job to the best of your ability.'
p2202
aS'This.'
p2203
aS'I\'m happy dealing with the risks that are inherent and can\'t be mitigated within Medicine but it\'s ridiculous and dangerous to simply hand wave away entirely avoidable risks with the old "That\'s just medicine chaps" excuse.'
p2204
aS'Is this really specific to the NHS though?'
p2205
aS"I'm sure you'll find shitty work conditions in many places and you'll find people in the same places who enjoy it."
p2206
aS"No of course its not specific to the NHS but its a major flaw in the whole organisation when you're propagating brain drain because of lack of care of staff"
p2207
aS'True - but American medical residencies are pretty grim as well.'
p2208
aS"I've no intention of heading to the US."
p2209
aS'Well I have a lot of American doctor friends from an exchange programme I did at uni.'
p2210
aS"I guess that it's still tough in other countries too though - I mean it's a tough career and although the pay is good I've often heard it said that it's not worth the money - you have to feel like medicine is your calling to really be able to put up with it."

aS'Long, burnout shifts, stunning bureaucracy from middle management, a scarcity of doctors, an abundance of professional arrogance, the "hazing" of residency... it\'s absolutely insane.'

p2217
aS"True - but it's the same in lots of careers."

aS'Investment banking famously so but to be honest I think most professions have a sort of hazing.'
p2219
aS'I agree that it should change though.'
p2220
aS"The scarcity of doctors is largely due to the medical school admission quotas which are total BS - they could admit _only_ people with straight A's (these aren't stupid people) and there'd still be far more than they currently admit."
p2221
aS"It's run like a medieval guild artificially reducing labour supply to increase their negotiating power."

aS"NB:  That's **extremely** abridged and there's scope to suggest I have some bias."
p2229
aS'&gt; Maybe doctors should stand up for themselves and not put up with this 19th-century work environment bullshit any longer?'

p2233
aS"I'm considering accountancy, but I'm slightly concerned my leftie guilt will get the better of me if I have to start shuffling money off to the Cayman Islands... however, I think you have to get pretty high up the  ranks for all that, and I just want to be vaguely comfortable."

aS'You can earn a perfectly good living without getting into it.'
p2239
aS'That said, obviously the big money is there.'
p2240
aS'All that said, before you commit yourself to it, you should consider the very real possibility that accountancy *(and especially the non-bespoke end of it)* is one of the areas likely to be under threat from automation sooner rather than later.'
p2241
aS'On top of the normal drivers to this, the government announced in the last budget that the requirement for most people who submit tax returns will be phased out within five years.'

aS"When really it's just that medicine is a tough career choice."
p2250
aS"Isn't a lot of this a common problem in the medical profession?"
p2251
aS"Not that I'm saying none of it is NHS specific but I've heard very similar complaints (mainly the incredibly over-worked, stressed out stuff) from doctors and hospital staff in various different countries. "
p2252

aS"http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/30yref/antitory_graffiti_in_hoylake/cpxtvss\n\nReally though if they don't treat you like a human being?"

p2262
aS'The NHS is shit.'
p2263
aS'You get paid less and work more, and generally the working culture and conditions are worse. '
p2264
aS'When is working in public ever better than private?'
p2265
aS'Contract hospital cleaners.'
p2266
aS'My mom is housekeeping supervisor in an NHS hospital and she gets paid a good wage.'
p2267
aS"Every so often contract cleaners are brought in who are being paid minimum wage and quite frankly do a shit job - she had to stop a contract cleaner about to go into a theatre who wasn't wearing scrubs and had a 'filthy mop and bucket'."
p2268
aS'So yeah, private is not always better!'
p2269
aS'In my local hospital you have to go through the scrubs changing rooms before you can even acess ICU or theatres.'
p2270
aS'Even visitors.'
p2271
aS'To prevent that exact thing from happening.'
p2272
aS"That's a strange way to frame it."
p2273
aS"Of course there are fucked-up organisations everywhere, and many will be worse, but that doesn't excuse it."
p2274
aS'A better question would be, how much of this is necessary vs. unnecessary; and how much of the necessary aggro could be mitigated/streamlined?'
p2275
aS'You can ask that question to every organisation too..'
p2276
aS"The NHS has over 1.5m employees, its not quite as easy as asking how can it be streamlined, I can't even begin to imagine how their systems might work."
p2277
aS"So we shouldn't even try?"
p2278
aS"The cynic in me can't help but wonder if that's intentional."
p2279
aS'Gradually reduce its effectiveness, then use the complaints against it to kill it off and replace it with a privatised system.'
p2280
aS"This would make more sense if it hadn't been happening under the previous labour government too"
p2281
aS"That's assuming Labour hasn't changed in decades, of course."
p2282
aS"And didn't become neoliberal with Blair."
p2283
aS'Even if you make that assumption the brutality of training to be a doctor has been around for as long as I can remember.'
p2284
aS"From what I can tell it's much like the concept of hazing in various societies and sports clubs."
p2285
aS"Everyone hates it when it's happening to them, but once they reach the higher levels they look back through rose-tinted glasses and convince themselves that it's necessary character building."
p2286
aS'The Tory way.'
p2287
aS"Sounds all too familiar, 12 hour shifts are mental especially when you're moving around and not getting decent breaks."
p2288
aS'I know of someone who had a complete mental breakdown because of the stresses of the job.'
p2289
aS'No one backed them up when they tried to stand up for themselves, because they were too scared of losing their own jobs over it.'
p2290
aS"Employers have a duty of care that's often completely absent in the NHS. "
p2291
aS"Which is even more insane, because if you're letting people destroy themselves, you're actually causing the NHS more work too."
p2292
aS'There is an interesting flipside to these crazy long shifts though.'
p2293
aS"My wife, who's a doctor, will actually defend them because when you are training in a speciality you need to get the 'patient hours' in in order to get exposure to the rare/ interesting cases."
p2294
aS'Its a simple case of longer shifts = more patient hours in a shorter period of time. '
p2295
aS'That is interesting.'
p2296
aS'I think the point is that 12 hours is enough as it is.'
p2297
aS'Without proper breaks, and all of the things that have happened to OP the 12 hours will probably take much more out of them than it should. '
p2298
aS'Oh they used to do 12 hours, then you were on call for the next 12.'
p2299
aS"It's savage."
p2300
aS'I think my wife would say whilst youre training and still relatively young you can take it and build the experience.'
p2301
aS'Expecting someone to do those hours in perpetuity though is asking for burnout. '

p2305
aS"It's clearly not the working conditions that keep people there."
p2306
aS"It's horrific how hard people are worked who are making life-and-death decisions on a daily basis."
p2307
aS"I do a easy desk job working with computers in the private sector and I know for a fact that nothing I ever do will be affect people's lives or quality of life &amp;mdash; and I get paid for 9-5 five days a week and then I go home."
p2308
aS"Meanwhile my partner is on wards at 8am, doing twelve hour shifts, for 12 consecutive days and managing people's health directly."
p2309
aS"Did I mention that I'm the higher earner of the two of us?"
p2310
aS'Like I said, **survives on staff good will alone**.'
p2311
aS'&gt; The NHS survives on staff good will.'
p2312
aS'yep.'
p2313
aS"I work in the eRostering team in a Trust and we've asked ward managers to log all the time that their staff are staying extra."
p2314
aS'Scarily some staff are now owed +100 hours from the last couple months or so because theyre always staying late.\n\n'
p2315
aS"Basically all down to politicians knowing that the public want a great NHS, but don't want higher taxes, and somehow can't link those two things."
p2316
aS'Except surveys show they do want higher taxes to pay for it.'
p2317
aS"That they don't is a myth put about by politicians who don't want to raise taxes. "
p2318
aS"Thanks, yeah, I didn't phrase it very well, that's kind of what I meant to put, that they don't want higher taxes because they're being lied to by politicians and the media."
p2319
aS"However, if they knew a new tax was going to fund the NHS alone and not end up just going to getting third homes for MPs, it'd probably pass with little grumbling."
p2320
aS'the answer is to cut spending elsewhere for the NHS, defence or foreign aid would be my first choice.'
p2321
aS'At least compare apples to apples.'
p2322
aS'One is a cost over the 25-30 year lifespan of trident, the other is the yearly spending deficit of the NHS.'
p2323
aS'So Trident is predicted to cost \xc2\xa370bn (that \xc2\xa3100bn figure is from a source with an extremely vested interest).'
p2324
aS'The NHS needs \xc2\xa3240bn.. '
p2325
aS'Er, no the NHS is ~\xc2\xa3100bn per year.'
p2326
aS'Trident is something like ~\xc2\xa32.5bn per year.'
p2327
aS"Foreign aid is always used to buy influence, and it's always conditional upon, or linked to, British jobs."
p2328
aS'Don\'t think of it as charity, more like "discretional international bribery".'
p2329
aS'EG.'
p2330
aS'we give some developing country \xc2\xa31m, conditional on them buying \xc2\xa31.5m of Land Rovers.'
p2331
aS'That country now spends millions more over the next 20 years buying Land Rover spares.'
p2332
aS'Foreign aid is a complete red herring, comparing it to money that could otherwise be spent in the UK is completely wrong.'
p2333
aS"And I'm a right lefty, who would love to see more money spend on low-income Brits."
p2334
aS'yea you are probably right on that issue, and i believe that is fairly common in Africa and India.'
p2335
aS'Still the defence budget is an area we could trim back, even only slightly and we could sort out the nhs.'
p2336
aS"I honestly believe the NHS is fucked and that we're currently about halfway down a decades-long slide into significantly deeper wealth inequality (i.e."
p2337
aS'poverty for most of us).'
p2338
aS"There just isn't the political will to deal with the downsides of globalism, and the rich are reaping most of the benefits."
p2339
aS"The rich simply don't need to pay taxes anymore - they can just stash their wealth offshore and live in homes that are owned by their own holding companies. "
p2340
aS"I love working in the NHS (radiologist), but I think a large part of that is because I'm not directly dealing with the general public, because let's face it, a lot of them aren't nice to deal with."

p2343
aS'One of my colleagues in A&amp;E had to take a time out today, when a patient called her a slimey bitch - for sensibly starting with the chest when the presenting complaint was shortness of breath - and not the leg ulcer - which is what the patient demanded that we sort out there and now.'
p2344
aS'Thank you for not giving in to the pressure to make the lives of managers easier by short-changing your patients.'

aS'Even the part about having to deal with abuse from drunks. '
p2355
aS'You have my sympathy, but surely you knew all of this when you applied for medicine?'
p2356
aS'The interview process is normally quite exacting on the "experience of a medical environment" stuff and they try very hard to only accept candidates who display awareness that they\'re sacrificing their entire social lives.'
p2357
aS'These are mostly symptoms of lack of funding and intentional hamstringing by people who want the NHS to fail (so they can sell it off).'

p2362
aS'I know being a doctor or a nurse is a tough and important job but I cant help but feel our general love for the NHS has lead to slightly over the top deification of them.'

aS'Being a trainee doctor is and always has been an absolutely savage few years.'
p2364
aS"But guess what, pretty much every well paid career is going to be really fucking hard while you're learning the ropes."

aS"And what they don't tell you is when they get to consultant level they get paid very well for a lot less hours than you'd think."
p2366
aS'And the current generation of nurses can retire on full pension in their early 50s and go back to work on flexi-time for a few years to keep themselves busy.'

p2374
aS'That is not acceptable, not only does it mean the training being provided is inadequate, it means that you could die.'
p2375
aS"If a trainee doctor is overwhelmed that means they aren't coping and will almost certainly make mistakes, any one of which could be deadly."
p2376

p2735
aS"Shoesmith was the Director for Childrens' Services at Haringay Council, at the time of the Baby P case."
p2736
aS"Now, when I say he 'publicly sacked' her, what I mean is he held a press conference and told the world she'd be put out of her job **without anyone having even told her in advance of it**."

aS"It's straightforward to demonstrate that you worked at the bar, it then follows that you're entitled to pay."
p3727
aS"&gt;Wouldn't more firms just use trials as it's a win-win for them?"
p3728
aS"No, because people working on trial shifts won't know the system particular to the pub they're working at."
p3729
aS"Pubs typically don't pay trials because they know a) they can get away with it and b) most people can't be arsed to take them to task over a few quid, i.e."
p3730
aS"it's not worth quibbling whether or not you get the job."
p3731
aS"I already found out I don't have the job and a lot of the work I was doing was dishes and what not which isn't skilled labour."
p3732
aS'They certainly benefited from a free employee being there doing menial tasks, I was just being given mundane jobs by all the other employees.'
p3733
aS'My point is though that they could stagger trials like this and probably get a few hundred hours of free labour every year.'
p3734
aS"It doesn't take a 3h shift to figure out if you can wash up or not."
p3735
aS"They're taking the piss."
p3736
aS"It's more 'can you keep up with the kitchen'."
p3737
aS'3hrs unpaid is ridiculous.'
p3738
aS"Yeah, you're probably broadly right. "
p3739
aS"There's been a lot of good advice posted, and although I don't believe they regularly try to get free-shifts from people (as someone who's worked in a bar, I can most definitely say that would be counter intuitive), they certainly seem to have taken the piss."
p3740
aS"I know friends who have had trail shifts at places which are owned by big corporations (McDonald's, Salisbury's etc), have been payed for it, and not necessarily got the job; whether this is done because of law I couldn't say."
p3741
aS"In fact, we don't regularly hire, but I'm fairly certain my boss has payed people for trail shifts and we're just a small golf club bar."
p3742
aS"So it does seem to be a thing (paying someone for trail shifts); whether it's done out of curtsy or because of law is another thing."
p3743
aS"The only obstacle you may encounter is if they pretensed the shift, telling you that it's just a trail and you weren't going to be paid for it."
p3744
aS"Either way, in the interest of fairness you definitely are due some sort recompense; so long as you put the effort in and didn't bum around."
p3745
aS"Yeah it's common in minimum wage industries (care and hospitality)."
p3746
aS"Don't know if it's legal, certainly isn't fair."
p3747
aS'Especially the amount they do it.'
p3748
aS"I agree with you - it's very immoral."
p3749
aS"But in hospitality it's just all too common because (it seems to me) it's a grey area legally."
p3750
aS"On the one hand, I accept the need for short try-outs in an interview/shadowing style are necessary, and in other industries I have done multiple whole day assessments in other cities with no expectation I'd be paid or even reimbursed for expenses."
p3751
aS"On the other, as you say, there's companies taking advantage of people who need jobs and asking them to do whole shifts for free."
p3752
aS"Which shouldn't be okay, and probably technically isn't, they're just hoping people won't do anything."
p3753
aS'I Googled  it out of interest and found loads of people talking about the same thing, and I personally know people who have done the same thing and never been paid.'
p3754
aS'I think if you made a fuss/went to the papers then they would probably do something.'

p3770
aS'That said if you do contact them and ask for them to pay you (which you should at least try) and they choose to be rude about it then maybe you could look at contacting a journalist if you have some sort of paper trail... worker exploitation is a hot topic atm so it might make a good story for the newspaper and potentially force them to change their policy.'

aS"they'd soon get the message that it doesn't pay to use speculative slave labour if everything the slaves did was counter-productive."
p3874
aS'I had the same problem a few years ago.'
p3875
aS"They didn't tell me it was an unpaid trial, so I kept phoning them up about it asking when I'd be paid for it, and they kept putting me off until I demanded to speak to the owner."
p3876
aS"She then confirmed it was an unpaid trial, which I quibbled on the basis that (a) I worked the damn shift, I wasn't shadowing anyone or anything, I was working just as much as everyone else there and (b) if it's unpaid, you say so upfront and don't string me along hoping I'll go away."
p3877
aS'I then dropped the old "legal action" thing (if I\'m not paid by X date, I will be investigating my legal options).'
p3878
aS'I was promptly paid.'
p3879
aS'Then I had a great big fight with the Job Centre over it, because I did the shift before I signed on, but got paid afterwards, so they tried to dock my JSA for it.'
p3880
aS'I worked in a independent UK bike shop and they would get people to do non paid trials especially mechanics just to see if they can do what they say. '

aS"I'm here if you need me.  "
p3890
aS"I'm with you, it may not be 'theft' in law terms, but they've taken his labour and not paid him for it, it's as close to theft as you can get."
p3891
aS'Sadly, we seem to be in a race to the bottom where anyone who needs employment deserves to be treated like crap to prove they deserve the job.'
p3892
aS"It's not theft, but I'm certain it's obtaining services dishonestly, contrary to [section 11](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/crossheading/obtaining-services-dishonestly) of the Fraud Act 2006."
p3893
aS'See, I think there is a middle ground.'
p3894
aS"In my work, it's technical and you have to interact with all sorts of people."
p3895
aS'Whenever we hire someone, they go through the usual interview and are told ahead of time they may need to role play or demonstrate their work ethos by interacting with people in the job.'
p3896
aS"So they have the interview from the manager, and then they're sent over to the staff they would be working under/with and are supervised by the experienced staff who have been here decades and we evaluate their technical skills, how they talk to other people and interaction with clients."
p3897
aS'We also ask informal questions about their background and hobbies, do the more personal side such as interests.'
p3898
aS"Then they're taken away for a followup interview, and the interviewer asks us how they did, what you thought of them, would they be a fit, Most people are guarded when talking to managers and HR and relax when given a chance to talk to those they may be working with."
p3899
aS"They don't get paid for what they do, but they're only here for 15 to 30 minutes and don't really do any work, they're essentially hanging out while the interviewer interviews the next person."
p3900
aS'So yes, I think there is a place for trials, but it has to be reasonable.'
p3901
aS'A hour or two seems excessive, in most cases you can tell within the first half hour if a potential employee is suitable and would be a good fit.'
p3902
aS'Great post.'
p3903
aS'A lot of that makes perfect sense, but my experience was quite different.'
p3904
aS'There was no interview before or after, it was just straight up a 3 hour work shift when I got there.'
p3905
aS'It started with a bit of shadowing of another employee and an induction which was fair enough, but then I was just being switched between employees and doing pretty menial tasks.'
p3906
aS'Cleaning, waiting, moving glasses and ice between floors, etc.'
p3907
aS'I felt like I was there for differing employees to ask me to do simple tasks they needed done.'
p3908
aS"I didn't fit but I don't think I needed to be there for three hours doing mundane tasks, if I wasn't the right person for the job I'm sure they knew much earlier, or at least before the 3 hours was up."
p3909
aS'Like I said, I think 3 hours during the most busy time of the week was excessive, it was a hard 3 hour shift after working my other job since 8 in the morning.'
p3910
aS"It'd be interesting to know how many other people have had a similar experience with this place to see if it was a pattern."
p3911
aS'I think you were used, none of what you posted makes any sense if they were serious about hiring someone.'
p3912
aS'I feel used but I feel conflicted in that maybe if I was absolutely awesome they would have considered me for a job?'
p3913
aS"I feel there was a job available somewhere but they weren't too fussed if that makes sense?"
p3914
aS'They had plenty of good employees.'
p3915
aS'From a business point of view this a very cost effective way of finding the best employee while also getting free hours in the process.'
p3916
aS'I used to manage a bar and we did unpaid trial shifts (if they were subsequently taken on then they would be paid for the time).'
p3917
aS"It's maybe not universally the standard but it is very, very common."
p3918
aS'I worked in a bunch of bars and did a trial shift (as far as I can remember) every time.'
p3919
aS"As most people have said, it's a legally grey area, and to be honest with you I really don't think it's worth pursuing, in reality."
p3920
aS'How long did you spend shadowing versus performing actual tasks?'
p3921
aS"Say you spend 2 of the 3 hours doing work of a regular employee, so that's about 14 quid in London?"
p3922
aS'We always very deliberately and specifically made it clear that "this is a trial shift, in the event that you are not offered a position it is unpaid as part of the interview process".'
p3923
aS"Where they've fucked you a bit is making you do it on a Saturday night."
p3924
aS'We would always have trial shifts mon-thurs, pair you with an experienced staff member, etc.'
p3925
aS"The part that I don't agree with is that it's a deliberate ploy to get free labour from a series of interviewees, 3 hours at a time."
p3926
aS"Bar restaurant work is pretty straightforward, we hired most of the people who got to the trial shift stage, we didn't offer some a position because they clearly were unsuited for it."
p3927
aS"You said that you decided at the time you weren't right for it - I can almost 100% guarantee if you didn't fuck anything up massively and seemed keen on the job they would have offered it to you."
p3928
aS"It's definitely not worth the effort to process CVs, book in interviews, have someone spend the first hour being shown the ropes and then scam them for 2 free hours of potwashing."
p3929
aS'In conclusion:  All work should be paid, but in practice unpaid trial shifts are very, very common.'
p3930
aS"They shouldn't have made you do it on a busy night."
p3931
aS"They weren't deliberately scamming you."
p3932
aS"You're not wrong from a legal standpoint and sometimes you have to take a stand against these things, but how much more of your time is this actually worth to you?"
p3933
aS'edit: I googled it:\nhttp://www.justanswer.com/uk-law/3lgh8-18-went-work-trial-shift-local-pub-restaurant.html\n\nI was rolling my eyes at people\'s talk of "small claims court" and "taking legal advice" because it would have been a massive waste of your time and probably would have got you nowhere.'

p3940
aS'Do your best to put them out of business. '
p3941
aS'Sorry to jump on your thread but is it illegal to do an hour of unpaid cleaning up the shop and shutting up after we close?'
p3942
aS'I believe this is only illegal if it brings your total pay under minimum wage?'
p3943
aS"But don't take that as gospel."
p3944
aS'It is if your overall pay for that day falls below the minimum wage.'
p3945
aS'Not sure about legality, I get where you are coming from though.'
p3946
aS"An interview costs both the candidate and the company time but they've taken advantage of that by using your time to benefit them."
p3947
aS"One place I went to I had an 9 hour interview for a basic job (and didn't get it)."
p3948
aS"It didn't benefit them as in provide free man hours, but wish I could have had that paid for."
p3949
aS"Some places do pay though, turned up for one interview, wasn't really an interview you were just put to a desk and did the tasks, went home and got paid for it."
p3950
aS'My old employer used to do it, but they made it clear before hand you were doing an unpaid trial; you had the choice of doing it or not.'
p3951
aS'I think with jobs like that, seeing how you work is more useful than an interview so I can see the benefit.'
p3952
aS'It seems dodgy they told you afterwards and not before though.'

aS'My first job (...many years ago, now) was at a Tesco express at the end of my road; I was given a 12-week trial period before I could get a full-time contract.'

aS'In other words the exact same people tory policies always benefit. '

aS'Well anyone with \xc2\xa3250 can benefit from this, its firmly aimed at the middle classes, not the super wealthy, since the cap is \xc2\xa310,000 and priority is being given to those asking for less than \xc2\xa31000.'

aS"The max investment in this is \xc2\xa310,000, with priority going to people asking for &lt;\xc2\xa31000, trust me that's not going to get any bankers excited, this really isn't going to do anything for them."
p4136
aS'Also I don\'t understand when you say this is a "massive cash injection" for the bankers, what do you actually think is happening here?'

p4171

aS"They don't want to hear about colaterized debt obligations or credit default swaps, they want to be able to point at someone they can blame."
p4175
aS"The high salaries and subsequent (fairly unrelated to the GFC) scandals have made 'bankers' an easy target (admittidly deserving so)."
p4176
aS'This problem is compounded by the fact that politicians are quite happy to sit back and let banks take all the blame since it hides their role in the whole thing and the general public do the same to avoid the truth that irresponsible mortgage lending goes hand in hand with irresponsible mortgage borrowing.'
p4177
aS"The short answer is that new Basel limits are incredibly tough, one of the reasons so many banks have stopped lending in the last few years (the 'credit crunch') is to build up enough reserves to meet them."
p4178
aS'That combined with the plan to ring fence high street from commercial banks should mean that will banks may still make loses we should never need to bail them out again to protect the savings of the general public.'
p4179

p4209
aS"Their share prices aren't that volatile and you don't buy and sell much, so you don't make may gains in the shares themselves you just hold them and pocket the cash."
p4210
aS'The thing about dividends is that unlike capital gains you can reinvest them, so you get a compounding effect over time.'
p4211
aS'So when people buy and sell shares, they are doing it in order to enjoy the proceeds of dividend payments by and large?'
p4212
aS'Speculation on the price of the shares is secondary? '
p4213
aS'It completely depends on the investor and what their circumstances are, their goals, their situation, their attitude to risk, a whole heap of factors.'
p4214
aS"So it's not clear cut if speculation or dividends are the more significant sources of income in the world of shares?"
p4215
aS'Well no, the right portfolio depends on the investor.'
p4216
aS'Some may want higher returns and be willing to take a higher level of risk, others may just want to beat inflation, or generate a steady income.'

aS'What about a car?'
p5011
aS'I meant more I wish people had a bit more of an interest in doing that activity.'
p5012
aS'I think how we hand out guns currently works fine, you need a reason to have one, and joining a shooting club is enough to get one.'

p5014
aS"I'd much rather you had access to a car to get to those ranges than lunatics had more access to guns "
p5015
aS'Particularly the notion that everyone carrying a loaded firearm at all times and in all societal and civil situations leads to some form of utopian paradise.'
p5016
aS"That only depends on how you see it, although we don't have the same kind of gun loving culture as the U.S, if someone tried to ban hunting with guns for example, or make it much more difficult, people would be livid. "

aS'No.'
p5019
aS'Just no.'
p5020
aS"I've spent today dealing with the aftermath of a fatal stabbing so no, knife laws do not need to be relaxed at all."
p5021
aS'Quite the opposite needs to happen.'
p5022
aS'I wouldn\'t say relaxed, but I would argue for change - a lethal stabbing implement is relatively easy to get hold of (Kitchen knife, belt sander and cutlery or rebar, hell, even sharpened wood; changing restrictions so that locking bladed knives are legal as an everyday item, even at the cost of ID checks or permits, would prove to be safer - I legally carried a swiss army knife for a number of years, it failed on me (slipped in wet and the "lock" failed), and the blade severed the tendons in my right little finger - hand was in a cast or immobilised for two weeks, couldn\'t write for six.'
p5023
aS"It wouldn't have happened with a locking blade."
p5024
aS'Add to that the fact that in more "knife aware" countries, a lock is considered a basic safety feature?'
p5025
aS"It's a case of practical safety vs the balance of  "

aS'Was the fatal stabber carrying a legal 3" folding penknife?'
p5027
aS"Stabbings will happen regardless of laws, they don't discourage the type of people who do it when they can go get a kitchen knife out of the drawer and easily hide it on their person."
p5028
aS'Why do you say that?'
p5029
aS"I feel our knife laws are extremely fair - no hidden blades or anything of that sort, no large knives in public without good reason etc (and if you do have a good reason you'll be let go no problem)"
p5030
aS'I\'m not saying I want to be able to carry around an 8" fixed blade knife but being able to carry a proper locking folder would be nice.'
p5031
aS'Also I think the blanket ban on buying things like balisongs and spring loaded knives is dumb.'
p5032
aS"They're basically folding knives with a fancier opening mechanism and less comfortable handles."
p5033
aS'More dangerous than a regular knife?'
p5034
aS'Nah.'
p5035
aS'Just my opinion :)'
p5036
aS'Why do you want to be able to carry around a knife in the first place though?'
p5037

p5038

p5039
aS"They're a very versatile tool."
p5040
aS"Sure you could use different tools for the jobs but I don't think there's any single item that could perform all the functions a good knife can and still fit nicely into my pocket."
p5041
aS'As I said, no need to be EDCing an 8" but a folder is always useful.'
p5042
aS"Sure, but when do you need all that stuff when you're walking about?"
p5043
aS'Most laws cover either carrying in public outlawed knives without good reason (carrying it home or to work if you use it at work is good reason), and selling certain knives such as those with hidden blades, or samurai swords.'
p5044
aS'You most likely can have whatever knife you\'d like as long as you\'re keeping it at home if it\'s just cutting vegetation, food, packaging etc\n\nEDIT: http://www.heinnie.com/opinel-giant-no-13 here is a folding knife with a larger than 8" blade, this is completely legal here if you\'re not carrying it about outside\n\nI totally understand wanting a knife to use at home for everyday tasks and such, but I don\'t see a need to walk the street with a large knife (which most of the laws are preventing, almost none prevent you from having a large knife at home)'
p5045
aS'Yeah I do do a lot of that stuff away from home.'
p5046
aS'I have a better knife for around the house tasks.'
p5047
aS"Well as I say, if it's for work then it's perfectly allowed to carry it there."
p5048

aS"I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it."
p5050
aS'As to uses?'
p5051
aS'pencil sharpening springs to mind, opening packages, cutting paper more precisely than scissors... just stuff that a knife is useful for.'

aS"It's perfectly legal to have a swiss army knife, but with use those fail, and i'd rather not suffer tendon damage to my hands again."
p5053
aS'A locking blade prevents that happening, and by the same note, carries the same charge if used to threaten somebody or as a weapon.'

p5055
aS"If you're using a knife bigger than 3 inches for sharpening pencils, then you're just being strange."

aS"&gt;cutting paper more precisely than scissors\n\nYeah, I'm doing graphic design at uni so I routinely carry my craft knives with me."
p5057
aS'Paper cutting blades on knives are generally an inch, which is again no problem.'

aS"I'd be very surprised if profit is the main cost of the current setup \xe2\x80\x94 I suspect it's mostly in organisational overheads."
p5294
aS"This isn't even getting started on the idea of allowing the public sector to bid for franchises \xe2\x80\x94 we'd have paying taxpayers' money on the (really expensive) bids, and we'd have the public sector able to undercut the private sector because they don't require a profit."

p5425
aS'No doubt that Tommy Flowers is an unsung (or insufficiently sung) hero, but to my mind he didn\'t really invent the "computer", for two reasons.'
p5426
aS"Firstly, Colossus wasn't a Stored Program Computer."

aS"It was, instead, an electronic version of the preceding mechanical calculators: you couldn't load a program on it, if you wanted it to do something different you had to rewire it."

aS"I would compare Flowers' computers to Newcomen's work on the steam engine - not the final form, but significant because they were the first practical versions."
p5433
aS'And unlike Baby, the Mk 1, or ENIAC, Colossus was produced as a series of computers, not a one-off.'
p5434
aS'I suppose where we differ is that I don\'t really consider Colossus a "computer", but an electronic calculating machine, and so I don\'t think of Flowers as having created a computer at all, let alone the first practical one.'
p5435
aS"To me, a computer is something that can run a program - I think that's the big leap that gives computers their power and usefulness."

aS'A constitution deals with the powers of a government, a charter deals with the rights and responsibilities of entitities external to a government, whether that be a town, a person or a public service.'

aS'The UK is on par with the other anglosphere nations, but with its own unique issues.'
p5725
aS'Government seems incredibly distant from the people and subject to a lot of inherited, Victorian-feeling classism.'

aS'For example, the European Court of Human Rights was not forced upon the British Government, the British Government chose to sign up to it.'
p5735
aS'Not only that, but various UK governments, both Labour and Conservative, have enacted the decisions of the ECHR  with significantly greater regularity than many other member nations.'
p5736
aS'In fact, to the best of my recollection, the UK has enacted into law every single decision of the ECHR with the exception recently of the prisoner voting rights issue.'
p5737
aS'A decision that in itself was ambiguous.'
p5738
aS'Ironically, one of the major issues with the ECHR is that it itself is causing major constitutional issues with regard to an unelected body effectively having sovereignty over our democratically elected government.'

aS'Have you ever heard of Common Law?'
p5742
aS"It's very good."
p5743
aS"And it's a significant part of our constitution."
p5744
aS'For example, nowhere in the US constitution is the right to privacy guaranteed, or even mentioned.'
p5745
aS'It can however be regarded as a right on the basis of precedent in legal cases that have found in favour of the the right to privacy.'
p5746
aS'The same is true in the UK.'
p5747
aS'The idea that a single, codified constitution can cover everything, accurately and without ambiguity, is naive.'
p5748
aS"EDIT: To further elaborate on the difficulties of constitutional matters, let's look at the right to privacy."
p5749
aS'First you have to define privacy and what its limits might be.'
p5750
aS'Then you have to factor in changes such as the creation of the World Wide Web.'
p5751
aS"The founding fathers of the U.S. couldn't have foreseen that when writing their constitution."
p5752
aS'So flexibility is necessary.'
p5753
aS"And constitutions themselves don't guarantee that you'll get all the things you like."

aS"The U.S. Constitution didn't liberate black people from slavery, and in fact valued black slaves as being worth three fifths that of a free white man."
p5755
aS'The U.S. Constitution did not enfranchise women with the vote.'
p5756
aS'Constitutions can be as oppressive as they can be liberating.'
p5757
aS'And if illiberal ideas are carved into a constitution, they can be much harder to repeal at a later date.'
p5758
aS'Common law can be overturned by normal legislation.'
p5759
aS"It's not a substitute for a proper Bill of Rights or a proper constitution. "
p5760
aS'It is a proper constitution.'
p5761
aS'The US constitution can be amended by congress.'
p5762
aS'And we do have a bill of rights in the UK.'
p5763
aS'It was enacted in 1688 if a I remember correctly.'
p5764
aS'It was the inspiration for the US Bill of Rights.'
p5765
aS'And guess what?'
p5766
aS'Much of that Bill of Rights has been superseded by other legislation.'
p5767
aS"And that other legislation was actually more liberal and less oppressive, especially if you're a Catholic."
p5768
aS'All of this is part of the UK constitution.'
p5769
aS"Which is very much a 'proper' constitution."
p5770
aS'EDIT: I do apologise, the Bill of Rights I referred to was enacted in 1689 (using the modern calendar) not 1688 as I previously said.'
p5771
aS"Constitutions don't usually deal with human rights."
p5772
aS"That's a modern idea."
p5773
aS'The primary purpose is to set out the governance for the country  (or city state for the early ones).'
p5774
aS'Although there can be advantages in putting human rights into the constitution, it can also fossilise abuse.'
p5775
aS'On a separate matter, the US constitution fossilises some other things - for instance the "states\' rights" make it impossible to have a uniform code of driving laws there.'
p5776
aS'As an example, it would be impossible for the federal govt to pass a law saying "you cannot pass a red traffic light even when turning right".'
p5777
aS"They only got a 55mph speed limit through nationally in the 70's by threatening to withhold  funding for roads, since they could not legislate for it."
p5778
aS'The US constitution includes the Bill of Rights.'

aS'Which deals with the rights of the citizenry.'
p5780
aS'Something the UK lacks.'
p5781
aS'They could pass a driving laws amendment to the US constitution.'
p5782
aS"it's not impossible to make those changes."
p5783
aS"It's just not important enough. "
p5784
aS'I said "don\'t *usually* deal with human rights".'
p5785
aS'There have been many hundreds if not thousands of constitutions through history, most of which do not address the subject.'

aS'I think for most people that the constitution they are most familiar with is the U.S. Constitution and that when we say we want a constitution we mean we want something similar to what they have. '

aS'Britain came back and ousted an Argentinian settlement.'
p6902
aS"It was a mutinous anarchic penal colony, of which the Argentinian governor had been murdered within months of them arriving, and which shouldn't have been there in the first place and was in such dire straits that they surrendered as soon as the British arrived without a shot ever having been fired."

p6913
aS'Do they even have that self awareness? '
p6914
aS"I think its worth noting that a lot of Argentineans think the Falklands war was stupid and that many of them don't think another war would be very smart at all."

aS'There are still people alive who lived under their rule though I think all those of Portuguese descent left back then.'
p7133
aS"Their influence is still around though, since half of Goa is Christian and have surnames like D'Souza and Lobo and also in the architecture and names of places."
p7134
aS'We  found the island before Argentina even existed. '
p7135
aS'Because we have been there a fuck of a long time.'
p7136
aS"It's a bunch of islands that only European countries have ever taken possession of."
p7137
aS'Argentina has, other than the short lived invasion, been there precisely never.'
p7138
aS'Argentina itself is basically a creation of the Spanish taking over the country.'

aS'I see what you are saying, but it is not really like that.'
p7149
aS'Many of the families on the islands have been there for generations. '
p7150
aS'That just had a money pit discovered within the property line. '
p7151
aS'Because the inhabitants voted to say they want to be part of the UK - and the inhabitants are the only permanent inhabitants on the island.'
p7152
aS"That's ultimately all that matters. "
p7153
aS"It's amazing that even British people don't get this at times."
p7154
aS'Goa was populated almost solely by Indians who were largely either indifferent to or against Portuguese rule, was held on to by the Estado Novo regime against the will of many Portuguese at home and Indians in the colony, and despite the UK and France giving up their Indian territories willingly.'
p7155
aS'The Falklands are populated by British-descended people who wish to keep their ties to the UK, and who have been there for almost two centuries now.'
p7156
aS"Unlike Goa, which was part of many Indian states prior to being ceded to the Portuguese in the 16th century, Argentina's formal claim to the Falklands is not derived from any historical settlement but inherited from Spain's signature to the Treaty of Tordesillas which ceded most of the New World to Spain and the African and Asian trade to Portugal."
p7157
aS'That\'s pretty flimsy, given that the treaty was always ignored entirely by Britain and France, who both originally and separately settled the Falklands/Malouines as well as most of North America and the Caribbean despite all of that territory being "legally" Spanish.'
p7158
aS"It hasn't even been relevant to Spain and Portugal since perhaps the 18th century during disputes over the exact border between Spain's colony on the River Plate and Portuguese Brazil."
p7159
aS"Spain never incorporated the Falklands into it's Empire, so all Argentina inherits really is a claim authorised by a long-dead Pope, and if it's going to use the Tordesillas angle then it should really assert it's claims to the rest of the Americas "
p7160
aS"argentina did owned the malvinas in the time between the expulsion of the english by spain and the reoccupation after argentina's independence war..."

aS'Settled not owned.'
p7163
aS'It was for 8 years.'
p7164
aS"It also really wasn't Argentinean."
p7165
aS'A German merchant ran the Islands and a mutiny by a Scotsman ended it'
p7166
aS'Argentina had a trade company mostly staffed by French settlers and governed by a Franco-German merchant, who was expelled from the islands by the US Navy for seizing several American sealers.'
p7167
aS'Describing it as a reoccupation is ludicrous.'
p7168
aS'Argentinians have never settled the Falklands.'
p7169
aS'They exercised claimed sovereignty over existing colonies and installed an administration in lieu of British interest in our claimed territory, but never settled people on the islands.'
p7170
aS"Spain never expelled the British, we'd left but left a plaque iterating our claim behind."
p7171
aS'Spain tried to say the islands were theirs and tried to give them to Argentina, we went back and *re*iterated our claim, kicked them out, and remained unchallenged for 150 years or so.'
p7172
aS'Alaska is closer to Canada, therefore, Canada should invade /s'

p7175
aS"It's a fact."
p7176
aS"Distance doesn't matter especially in this day and age. "
p7177
aS'A lot of people point out the hypocrisy that the french and dutch claim islands similar to the Falklands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\xc3\xa7ao are Dutch, off the coast of Venezuela, French colonies along Caribbean coast), yet are never attacked in the same way British occupation of the Falklands has been.'
p7178
aS'The UN has been accused of being bias towards Argentina for this reason.'
p7179
aS'Regardless, this island was claimed before Argentina was a country, the British fended off an invasion and the inhabitants of the island want to remain British.'
p7180
aS'There are no natives, Argentinians or descendants of Spanish colonisers that Argentina can claim as their own people.'
p7181
aS"Whilst European colonisation can be heavily critiqued, the fact of the matter is many countries didn't want independence from their colonisers (Hong Kong is a prime example of this)."

aS'More oil has been found an Argentina want to push it.'
p7183
aS'Again.'

aS"i know that you are british and really don't care about your colonies,but alaska wasn't part of canada but russia,also he didn't say that."
p7187
aS'Falklands wasnt part of Argentina, but France, so the analogy  works out'
p7188
aS'That was the point.'
p7189
aS"I never said that /u/punjab94 said that either, I just wanted to point out the absurdity of Argentina's claims with the analogy."
p7190
aS'If proximity mattered for claims then surely countries would be claiming their neighbours territory all the time.'
p7191
aS'In my opinion the right to self-determination trumps the argument from proximity.'
p7192
aS"If the people of the Falkland Islands voted to become Argentinian i'm sure most people, including myself, would be more than happy to let them."
p7193
aS'However, as /u/spiz has said, there was a referendum and 99.8% voted to stay British.'
p7194
aS"Now the Argentine government would dispute this referendum by pointing out that the islanders are not native and are the descendants of British colonists and so their opinion doesn't matter."
p7195
aS'Obviously ignoring the fact that all Argentines, including their president, are descended from Spanish colonists and that they, after declaring independence from Spain in 1853  [declared war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Desert) on the native inhabitants of Patagonia, killing many indians and displacing many more from their own land.'
p7196
aS'Furthermore the Falkland Islands were first claimed by the British in 1765 by John Byron who named them.'
p7197
aS'The Falklands were owned for a time by the Spanish, British and French, the Falklands came under full British rule in 1816, 40 years before Argentina became independent from Spain.'
p7198
aS'So they have no right to claim, as they do, that the British invaded the Falkland Islands and took them by force.'
p7199
aS'There was no native population on the islands and the British did not take the islands from Spain or France by force.'
p7200
aS'The Argentine leader also frequently states that her people have always been a victim of colonialists, whether it be the Spanish or the British.'
p7201
aS'Conveniently forgetting that almost all Argentines are Spanish descendants and speak Spanish.'

aS'Hopkins whole brand is her shock factor.'

p7886
aS"It isn't an article of faith, it's a fact."
p7887
aS"That's often precisely *why* they want to come to the UK, because the UK does offer rights that other countries don't have."
p7888
aS"&gt; It'd be interesting to see a UK without immigration, like Hopkins probably wants."
p7889
aS'Like UKIP, I doubt very much that Hopkins wants zero immigration, far more likely that she wants immigration controlled so that only people that will benefit the UK can immigrate.'
p7890
aS'&gt; Does anyone agree with Katie Hopkins?'
p7891
aS'That people trying to enter the country illegal should be sent back?'

p7905
aS"No, illegal immigrants aren't cockroaches that ought to have the boats that they are being shipped away in, burnt."
p7906
aS'We just have a problem with legal immigration as it is, let alone the illegal ones.'
p7907
aS'NOTE: Not the immigrants themselves, but the sheer increase in population that they add to.'
p7908
aS'If you feel that the 271,000 legal foreign workers that came to the country in 2013 alone, can be sustained by an under funded NHS and live in the 87,000 additional houses that are built each year, you are wrong.'

aS"I don't think she's actually serious."
p7920
aS'She just likes to be as controversial and offensive as possible to get a reaction out of people. '

aS"They're promising construction companies that they'll get rid of all the red tape  so they can build as much as they want on brown field land."

aS"Then the actual drugs, they aren't taxed, they aren't regulated, they fund criminals, who cause further crime in lower income neighbourhoods, they also provide a incentive for crime, if you can make more money selling drugs than you can in another job, why wouldn't you, that is the Tory entrepreneurial spirit right there, the irony."
p9225
aS'All while you have criminalised a lot of working, tax paying, voting individuals.'
p9226
aS'Then you have the irrational "but drugs are bad" argument, firstly research shows there really is no relationship between "badness" and drug class, secondly, they are freely available to all anyway, in an unregulated manner, no one has stopped anyone from getting anything...the restriction doesn\'t work.'
p9227
aS'So how do you change it?'
p9228
aS'You legalise the drug usage, people are using them anyway, so what difference does it make?'
p9229
aS"No one is going to take up heroin for a laugh, just like 100% of the population doesn't smoke, a perfectly legal and available activity, that is far more dangerous than some illegal drugs all while being addictive."
p9230
aS"Even so, just because you base drug laws on rational evidence doesn't mean you have to legalise all of them, addictive drugs aren't good, carcinogenic drugs aren't good, age limits should be enforced, but as you will see from this statement cigarettes fit all the prerequisites of the worst type of drugs, yet are legal."
p9231
aS'What making the illegal ones that are better for you and smoking achieves is you can now have anti-drug campaigns, with the real risks, with the real effects, inform people and let them make a decision, most will come out doing exactly the same they do now, especially if you put barriers to entry in place, such as medical from a doctor to check that it is actually safe for you to take them.'
p9232
aS"If you make a lot of other drugs legal, to be sold in a regulated manner (so amateur drug dealing is still illegal), like alcohol and cigarettes and then restrict the locations of their use, just like smoking, then you have a system that doesn't support them, but doesn't restrict them, and what business is it what you do in your own home, if it doesn't hurt others.But at the same time, drunk and disorderly is a crime, it would be no different for drugs, if you can act like a civilised human being why shouldn't you be allowed to go around your day, and just like alcohol, if you are noticeably drunk at work, that isn't acceptable."
p9233
aS"I don't even take any of these drugs, I just believe that I would rather the people who did could do it in a safe manner, on a regulated dose, with the money going to the government and regulated businesses contributing the the UK economy, rather than amateur crime causing drug dealers who do serious damage to low income communities through gang violence."
p9234
aS'What other problems are there, tax evasion, especially big business tax evasion, and even more so companies like Starbucks who have to be here to sell their product, if a company can just move abroad and are only here due to the low tax rates, that is one thing, if they are a retailer selling to the UK population and have to be active in the UK to do so, that is another thing.'
p9235
aS"Housing and rent, this is a serious issue especially in the South East, there isn't enough housing for the populous, the right to buy is a problem, it is sucking up the social housing pool, and why should people in social housing have the right to buy, when your average person can no longer afford to buy, people who work harder with better jobs, should be mildly better off, this situation does not make that so, and also is of detriment to the poorer generations in the future."
p9236
aS'Rent needs to stop being an income and a business for people and go back to being a reasonable way to have a stable life, taxation should increase on each property you own, so if you have 1-2 properties that is fine, if you have 100, after the first 10 they are no longer profitable.'
p9237
aS'Houses should be places to live and an income supplement for the better off, not profit gouging business.'
p9238
aS"The rent and housing problem is also exacerbated by over reliance in London, the UK needs diversification, a lot of northern cities have been disregarded, there is no reason to live there as there are no jobs, places like Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool all have successes, and should be take as models of what a lot of northern cities should become, then the people working in these cities no longer need to rent in London as they don't have a job there, Germany is a far better model for this."
p9239
aS"Then you have the economy, the UK should be investing in high skilled industries for the high skilled graduates it has, this includes banking and finance, just like was done in the 90's, as well as science, engineering and technology, much like Japan does."
p9240
aS'Investments by the government, which of course include spending money (not austerity), brings back massive returns to your country in the long term, in both business, intellectual property, and high skilled industries.'
p9241
aS"There is no money in making clothing or coal mining, the money is in design, research and development, and if the UK doesn't invest in them the it will fall, China is coming, India is coming, Eastern Europe is coming, they can all manufacture cheaper than us, in the future they will produce quality graduates with all the design skills need, if our graduates and companies aren't a step above their offering we will be replaced by the cheaper option, just like coding is being outsourced right now."
p9242
aS'The you have the UK itself, its culture, its history, its people, these need to be protected and not destroyed, why, because of tourism, the English countryside is world renowned through literature and through history.'
p9243
aS'The traditions and history, like the Queen, the churches, the castles, the stately homes, should be protected, because they make this country money through tourism, we have thousands of years of history and the countryside to put it in, it should be protected and this can work synergistically with the environmental legislation.'
p9244
aS'Anyway...I have rambled on for long enough.'
p9245
aS'Re rail, it is indeed an issue.'
p9246
aS'For the actual South East (Kent, etc.'
p9247
aS'), more effective use of HS1 would be a great start.'
p9248
aS"No more differential fares, get everyone needing longer distance services onto HS1 to use the capacity that's there and free up capacity on the congested slower lines."
p9249
aS"If HS2 ends up with differential fares I will be rather angry \xe2\x80\x94 it will be a sign that they've completely missed the point."
p9250
aS'There are a few bottlenecks that can probably be cleared up around the place.'
p9251
aS'This is of course already being done at places like London Bridge and (less South-east-y but still worth mentioning) Reading.'
p9252
aS'Doing work like this in more places would be good.'
p9253
aS'Also of interest is building flyovers on flat junctions.'
p9254
aS"It's amazing how much this affects capacity."
p9255
aS'This is being done on the South Western Main Line \xe2\x80\x94 there are rough plans for new flyovers at Woking and Basingstoke (for the Reading line), eliminating the biggest bottlenecks on that route.'
p9256
aS"I know there are plenty of these bottlenecks in the rest of the south east; I don't know of any plans but that's only because I don't live on those lines!"
p9257
aS"I think though that there is or will be a plan to clear up East Croydon's massive bottleneck, correct me if I'm wrong?"
p9258
aS'Platform and train lengthening is a quick win, of course, but it is either already done or currently in progress on most lines where it would have an effect.'
p9259
aS'Further extensions will probably require major work on London Termini, which would not be easy to say the least.'
p9260
aS"What's a differential fare?"
p9261
aS"Apologies if I've used a term that doesn't actually exist \xe2\x80\x94 I mean where fares cost much more for the same journey on the high-speed line than not."
p9262
aS"I've no idea, I know very little about pricing!"
p9263
aS'You sounded more knowledgeable haha. '
p9264
aS"Well, it's possible, actually thinking about the term I'm not sure if I've heard anyone else use it... or I might just have it slightly wrong!"
p9265
aS"But yeah, the main problem with them, whatever they're called, is that it leads to people going on the slower services because they're cheaper, therefore filling the trains up where there is still loads of space on the high speed ones."
p9266
aS'Is that the same how sometimes it\'s cheaper to go the "long way round" to Inverness from Dundee via Aberdeen rather than via Perth?'
p9267
aS'Or is that something different?'
p9268
aS"I still don't quite understand how/why split ticketing is cheaper either..."
p9269
aS'To be fair, the line between Dundee and Invernees via Aberdeen is (as far as I know) significantly quieter than the main route, so the lower price is probably justified.'
p9270
aS'The main issue is that the slower lines around HS1 also double as significant commuter lines for the local stations on that route \xe2\x80\x94 those people have no choice but to go on those trains, whereas the people making longer distance journeys could pay more and go on HS1.'
p9271
aS'So loading longer distance, would-be HS1 passengers onto the already-busy commuter routes is just stupid.'
p9272
aS'Split ticketing is basically an artefact of the franchising system.'
p9273
aS"It's basically just a fact nowadays that some operators are more expensive than others."
p9274
aS'On top of that, some operators have generally stupid pricing policies.'
p9275
aS"Here's an example that I'm familiar with."
p9276
aS"Say you're going on a CrossCountry train from Southampton to Banbury."
p9277
aS"CrossCountry are quite an expensive operator, and they're the primary method of getting from Southampton to Banbury, so they price those fares."
p9278
aS'So you end up at \xc2\xa344.50 for an off-peak day return.'
p9279
aS'But if you can find a split where the primary operators, the ones who "own" those fares, are less expensive, then you can make a significant saving.'
p9280
aS"So in this case, let's split at Basingstoke \xe2\x80\x94 Southampton to Basingstoke is priced by South West Trains at \xc2\xa313.20, and Basingstoke to Banbury is priced by First Great Western at \xc2\xa315.80, which adds up to \xc2\xa329 \xe2\x80\x94 a VERY significant saving."
p9281
aS"The same principle applies even if there's just one operator, if you can find an anomaly in the fares policy of that operator (for example, I believe another CrossCountry example is that sometimes longer distance fares are more expensive per mile than shorter distance fares, which means that you can sometimes still get savings by splitting (though not as big as this) even if both fares are still priced by CrossCountry)"
p9282
aS"I didn't realise that about different operators 'cause we've just got one for the majority of the routes in Scotland - ScotRail (although there's the Caledonian Sleeper, Virgin's East/West Coast and some CrossCountry)."
p9283
aS"But aye, I still don't quite understand how I'm cheaper with separate tickets Dundee - Perth, Perth - Glasgow on the same train than Dundee - Glasgow..."
p9284
aS"That'll just be a messed up pricing structure on their part, I suspect."
p9285
aS"Unless there's something in particular about Dundee to Glasgow that makes it a more valuable route \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps it's valid via routes other than Perth or something?"
p9286
aS"I don't know, I don't have time to check right now."
p9287
aS'Where it costs more to use a fast service than a slow one.'
p9288
aS"It makes sense at first, but when the slow train is packed and the fast one has plenty of extra capacity clearly the fares aren't being set properly."
p9289
aS"The problem is the whole London to Brighton line is a bottleneck during commuter times, essentially it doesn't have enough capacity on that line for any redundancy as all, it is a system where nothing can go wrong or everything gets delayed."
p9290
aS"Even with this at capacity system, there isn't enough capacity for people at rush hour."
p9291
aS'While flyovers would help, they are going to solve the problem, and there really is very little room to add further lines, all while doing this would include ploughing through the green belt, that line was built 150 years ago.'
p9292
aS'One solution, if it even is one, is to use double decker trains, however, I have no idea if they run on the same gauge as current models and you would still have to modify all the tunnels and some stations so they fit. '
p9293
aS'Ah, yes.'
p9294
aS"The London to Brighton line, a good way of improving that would be to persuade Gatwicik Airport that they don't really need Gatwick Express ;)"
p9295
aS'Imperial units need to be full scraped they are pointless, annoying and adds nothing positive to the culture.'
p9296
aS'It can easily be fixed first by the dft changing the signs into km and metres.'

p9304
aS'It winds me up so it does.'
p9305
aS'The "cup" measurement is actually determined by the ingredient itself.'
p9306
aS"For example, one cup tomatoes and one cup garlic aren't the same thing and if you crunch the numbers in terms of metric weight you get something wildly different each time."
p9307
aS'Not strictly true.'
p9308
aS'1 cup is 237ml in metric units.'
p9309
aS"It doesn't have a metric weight equivalent since the densities of foods varies."
p9310
aS"That's not to say it's not horrendously stupid to measure sugar in ml.  "
p9311
aS"I would say measuring sugar in ml isn't that bad."

p9313
aS'Things with a load of space between the parts. '
p9314

aS'The worse thing is with herbs.'

aS'1 tablespoon of fresh mint...'

aS"It doesn't matter how big the cup is, if I tell you 2 cups of sugar, 4 cups of butter and 6 cups of flour to make some biscuits you could use a tea cup or a giant mug and the biscuits will come out exactly the same regardless, you'll just have more or less of them."
p9319
aS"Metric precision really isn't necessary in everyday kitchen recipes, I don't even have scales in my kitchen and my food comes out just fine."
p9320
aS'Proportions would be the same true but surely that would throw off cooking times?'
p9321
aS"And also the relationship to ingredients that aren't measured in cups."
p9322
aS'Different size of cup = different number or size of eggs, for example. '
p9323
aS"In case you haven't found it before, [this site](http://www.traditionaloven.com/conversions_of_measures/flour_volume_weight.html) is brilliant for converting American cooking measurements to metric."

p9336
aS'And how is changing road signs from miles in to km is going to be a positive contribution to our culture?'
p9337
aS"It's not (and that's not what he was implying either), but it's a positive step forward because it means we can have consistency within units &amp; totally ditch yards/inches as well."
p9338
aS"At the moment in school &amp; science we measure stuff in cm/m yet for some ridiculous reason we still use miles &amp; yards for the roads it's stupid. "

aS'Re rail fares.'
p9458
aS'I agree, the existing fares structure is ridiculously complicated.'
p9459
aS'But I have not yet seen a convincing alternative.'
p9460
aS'The current fares structure has been around for a long time and has matured into quite a comprehensive system filling every niche of travel requirements quite well.'
p9461
aS"Unfortunately, it's been the advertising that's lacking \xe2\x80\x94 without a single body to advertise all of rail travel (why don't ATOC do this under their National Rail brand?"
p9462
aS') the strong advertising of the choices we had under BR has been lost.'
p9463
aS"I'm reminded of an old British Rail poster I saw recently in the National Rail Museum."
p9464
aS"Unfortunately, the photo I took of it didn't come out, so here's one I found scouring the internet, from an ad from an old magazine on Google Books: http://tim32.org/~muzer/fares.png ."
p9465
aS'But bear in mind that (with the notable exception of advance tickets, which were a later invention) the fares structure back then was quite similar to what it is today.'
p9466
aS"So the main issues with the fares structure are the variety of routes and what you can and can't do with them, and the peak time restrictions."
p9467
aS"This is basically what accounts for the majority of variation and confusion (there is also advance tickets, but correct me if I'm wrong, I believe they're generally quite well-understood \xe2\x80\x94 the ones you buy online that come with a compulsory reservation and require you to travel on that one train)."
p9468
aS'The time restrictions at the moment is a ridiculous situation, where the conditions of carriage require that the train operator advertises the peak restrictions to you, yet rarely in a ticket office or at a ticket machine will you be told (correct) information regarding these!'
p9469
aS'Fixing this would be a good start, and I believe some steps have finally been taken recently towards doing so.'
p9470
aS'The routeing is a bit more complicated \xe2\x80\x94 basically post-privatisation the old British Rail vague rule of "any reasonable route" was actually specified \xe2\x80\x94 so you can now look in a set of documents called the Routeing [sic] Guide and manually determine all possible reasonable routes, definitively (with some caveats and edge cases that aren\'t quite as well-defined).'
p9471
aS'Unfortunately, that set of documents is ridiculously complicated and, again, not well-advertised even to staff.'
p9472
aS'So realistically, this is mostly an issue of staff training.'
p9473
aS"I think creating some electronic system to use the SAME DATA as the publicly-available version of the routeing guide, and tell you which routes you can and can't take, would be an excellent solution, and I'm surprised one hasn't come about yet."
p9474
aS'One issue wrt routeing that came to mind recently was the general obscurity of many of the locations used.'
p9475
aS'For example, on a recent journey I made from Southampton to Bletchley, the routes available were KEN OLYMPIA and +ANY PERMITTED.'
p9476
aS"The latter is relatively self-explanatory (I do say relatively... but most people's idea of a reasonable route usually correlates with the Routeing Guide's, so there's no issue there)."
p9477
aS'But "KEN OLYMPIA"?'
p9478
aS'Most people would have no idea if the train they want to get goes via Kensington Olympia or not, even if they know what it stands for!'
p9479
aS'For the record, this requires you to change at Clapham Junction onto a Southern service to Bletchley directly*.'
p9480
aS"I'm not quite sure how you'd fix this issue, though, aside from the method above \xe2\x80\x94 but who's to say a thing showing you all the routes you can travel on would even be useful?"
p9481
aS'Hrm...'
p9482
aS'I agree with the rest of the rail-related points, though.'
p9483
aS"Though I'm not entirely sure of the fare reductions one \xe2\x80\x94 I think a better way would be for the franchise to specify fare reductions, then for the private operators to acheive that through whatever means they see fit."
p9484
aS'Having effectively a tax on profits for rail operators only would be a bit odd, to say the least.'
p9485
aS'* Technically you could go on London Overground first, but the route you travel is actually the same, and I believe the only real logical solution is to go on the Southern services straight from Clapham.'

aS'Ideally, you should talk to your neighbours first and let them know that their noise is causing a nuisance.'

aS'You should also start keeping a noise log.'

aS'Failing that, contact your EHD to make a complaint.'

p9734
aS"You've already tried to approach the neighbour a few times (we did three times before we made a complaint) so if it does keep happening you might need to consider going on to the council/etc."
p9735
aS"And if you're worried that might make things worse, well...we got told that if the warning was met with them making more noise in revenge, and we complained again, they'd actually be served a noise abatement order, which if ignored will mean more legal action."

p9845
aS"It's a touchy subject so you'll always find strong reactions even to honest questions."
p9846
aS'I think the people saying that are either trying to convince others of something (peoples intent and such) or have never attempted to make use of a food bank.'
p9847
aS'It often seems that the people saying this are attempting to maintain the spin that the majority of people using a food bank are at best scroungers and at worst vile scum.'
p9848
aS"You can't just walk in and get free stuff."

aS'You have to be refereed and usually by a GP, social worker or similar person before the food bank will actually give you stuff. \n'

aS'It\'s the old "My Abortion Is The Only Moral Abortion" bullshit)'
p9855
aS'I think that the increased usage of food banks is undeniably a result of the huge increase in their numbers, so in that sense the increase in their use does not correlate with an increase in poverty.'
p9856
aS"However, that does not mean that people who don't need them are using them, but rather a large number of people who needed them in the past did not have access to them. "
p9857

p9865
aS'Although I cannot guarantee that everyone who visits foodbanks really deserve to be served there, all I can do is tell you that the most memorable experience I had working there was when a mother, with her 3 kids, broke down quite visibly and audibly while I was handing her a bag of food.'
p9866
aS'Her kids went quiet in a way that seemed to me that it was not an unusual sight for them.'

p9868
aS"Your predilection for associating foodbank users as a bit stingy is yours to hold, but my own opinion resonates more with (and I know she is a bit of a laughing stock in this sub) Natalie Bennett's view that we should not forsake those in deepest need for a GDP, percentage or figure."
p9869
aS"That's the problem, these people are portrayed as giggling, evil leeches, doing anything to steal from the 'hardworking taxpayer', when in reality, they've come to a food bank as a last resort, because they've gone days without food in the hope something would come up, and finally HAVE to rely on charity, which shames them as it would most people."
p9870
aS"Of course there's always a minority of people who can and will 'play the system', but in all honesty, you'd have to be a Tory to think it's worth cracking down on the rules for everyone to try to stop a minority of cheats."

p9878
aS'!'
aS'!'
aS"Exactly the point, we KNOW there's people who will play the system and take what's needed far more by others."
p9879
aS"However, you have to weigh up more stringent means testing against the risk of locking people out of help who really need it, just in case someone gets 3 days' worth of food they might not have needed."
p9880
aS'Were they refused?'
p9881
aS"Some were if we weren't sure we would allow them and try and do some checks."
p9882
aS'That was 2 years ago'

aS"Let's not pretend there aren't opportunistic and just plain horrible people around."
p9884

p9886

p9887
aS'What, no!'
p9888

p9889
aS"Fuck me, it's not what I believe."
p9890
aS"I was asking his opinion, since it's relevant, as he works there."

aS'It must also be said that some people are on prepayment meters to cover existing debts with the energy supplier.'
p9946

p9979
aS'It is often painted as the fault of the government, and maybe it is.'
p9980
aS"However is there any proof that this food poverty hasn't always existed and it's only just because these food banks have expanded their operations that the supply is now being met?"
p9981
aS'Or that their increased media profile has meant that people who have always struggled to put food on the table now know about them and start using them?'
p9982

p9988
aS"It is however fairly clear that if you're on benefits, you're not able to save up 'for rainy days' and when your benefits are delayed, either because the DWP has screwed up, or because you've been sanctioned because they don't like your new haircut, having no money means you can't buy food."
p9989
aS"That's pretty much an unavoidable fact in this, and supported by the food banks themselves."
p9990
aS'That may be true, but then a lot of people are returning week after week to return to the foodbank?'
p9991
aS"So I accept that benefit delays are probably leaving some people hungry and that is unacceptable, but there still seems to be issues with people who may be living on benefits who can't afford to eat."
p9992
aS"I don't think that the majority of people on benefits cannot afford to eat."

p9997
aS"Needing a second or third visit to the food bank isn't so surprising, and in fact my local one has just double it's allowable visits per year in response to demand."
p9998
aS'On the sanctions, yeah I understand that you can get sanctioned for 3-4 weeks, 3 months or even longer.'

aS'OP, while false, at least looked into it first.\n\n'
p10158
aS'Well you apologized and made them more visible.'

p10163
aS"I don't know if it does."
p10164
aS'I think it\'s important to be right and consistent when you accuse people of running scams because otherwise you start to generate this sort of fog of doubt where you might be able to go "oh no, it\'s like Outdoor Cinema, it\'s just people on the internet jumping to conclusions".'

aS'the company in question is guilty of disorientation by blowing their own smoke prematurely.'
p10166

p10172
aS"I'm not really convinced it's *not* a scam, or at least a project that's more optimistic than competent, but if you are calling something a scam get it right and be consistent."
p10173
aS'Presumably he was contacted shortly after publicly calling it a scam, after repeatedly attempting to contact the people behind the operation.'
p10174
aS'Presumably, it was that public exposure that prompted the organisers to actually get off their arses.'
p10175
aS"So how do you suggest he should have 'got it right' in this case?"
p10176
aS'Sat and said nothing?'
p10177

p10194
aS"At least you've apologised though. "
p10195
aS'In my defense, at the time of posting - there was no company to defame!'
p10196
aS'That was kind of the point, thousands of people were submitting data to an unknown entity.'
p10197
aS'They only incorporated after I posted.'
p10198
aS'It was really just a matter of unfortunate timing.'
p10199
aS'Wait a minute, so they only incorporated AFTER you started posting about them not being a limited company?'
p10200
aS'This sounds more like "Fuck, we\'ve been rumbled!'
p10201
aS'better make this look legit!'
p10202

aS'"'
aS'They incorporated afterwards, but talking to them, the team has put on events before.'
p10204
aS'They also showed me a denied incorporation document that pre-dated the post.'
p10205
aS'Experience would have told them to sort their shit out before going viral.'
p10206
aS'Exactly.'
p10207
aS'Their operation was (and still is) so amateurish many people genuinely believed it was a scam.  '
p10208
aS"You don't have to incorporate your company for it to be legit, none of you remotely understand business you're just wannabe internet detectives"
p10209
aS'Did I say that?'
p10210
aS"I'm referring to the lack of ANY details, whatsoever, about anything, before today."
p10211
aS'It was literally just a bunch of Facebook pages and two shoddily made (i.e., misspelt and poorly worded) Google Forms pages, one of which required a tick to not "share your information with partners".'
p10212
aS'No venues, no films, no prices, no tickets, no information about the company, no information about the organisers... nothing!'
p10213
aS'Do I trust a group of individuals who thought going viral with a company in this state was a good idea?'
p10214
aS'Not in the slightest.'
p10215
aS'Amateurish by definition.'
p10216
aS"&gt; You don't have to incorporate your company for it to be legit\n\nVery true, but considering it takes just a few hours, and the protection offered by a limited company is vital for most things in todays world, unless you have insurance, which often has a higher upfront cost than companies house agents fees."
p10217
aS'I would certainly recommend anyone in that line of work do so.'
p10218
aS'And then in line with companies act, included their incorporation location and number on all documents, website etc.'
p10219
aS'What do you mean by that?'
p10220
aS'Are you UK based?'
p10221
aS'He means exactly that?'
p10222
aS"It's true in the UK."
p10223
aS"&gt; You don't have to incorporate your company for it to be legit, none of you remotely understand business you're just wannabe internet detectives\n\nThis is true, but incorporation offers legal protection, which most businesses should have."
p10224
aS'However, it is somewhat complex to set up.'
p10225
aS'This is why many forego it.'
p10226
aS"At the most basic level it's an online form and a \xc2\xa315 fee."
p10227
aS"It's only complex if you want to customise things."
p10228
aS"I posted the link saying it was a scam, and one of the organisers got in touch, he happened to be friend who I've booked to DJ at a night of mine before."
p10229
aS'They were basically checking what sort of interest there would be, and had no idea it would go viral like it did.'
p10230
aS"Right, that's what I assumed had happened."
p10231
aS'But what was their response?'
p10232
aS'Milking the virility, asking for favoured venues (via a form whereby you had to explicit reject the sharing of your personal info with third parties), and absolutely zero further information.  '
p10233
aS'Fuck knows tbh, not my circus, not my monkeys '
p10234
aS'&gt; Milking the virility\n\nEww... perhaps you meant vir**a**lity?'
p10235
aS'...and why was it denied?'
p10236
aS'According to the post it was "an administrative error on their part".'
p10237
aS"It doesn't create an impression of an organisation that knows what it's doing, really."
p10238
aS'I have worked for several companies.'
p10239
aS'Rarely can it be said that any of them knew what they were doing.'
p10240
aS'Yeah but, to give them *some* credit, they had at least managed to set themselves up.'
p10241
aS"It doesn't create an impression of anything, you're all just wannabe internet detectives who know nothing about business.  "
p10242
aS'I own 2 businesses that are profitable.'
p10243
aS'Congrats on the paper rounds.'
p10244
aS'How is that even an insult?'
p10245
aS'Yeah mate they still sound shady as all fuck.'
p10246
aS'&gt; They also showed me a denied incorporation document that pre-dated the post.'
p10247
aS"Wait a minute that doesn't sound good..."
p10248
aS'I once incorporated.'
p10249
aS'ME!\n'
p10250
aS'You and *millions* of other people. '
p10251
aS'Its costs \xc2\xa325 to found an LTD.'
p10252
aS"It isn't a requirement to be a limited company."
p10253
aS"It isn't."
p10254
aS'But where is this potential money going to be heading?'
p10255
aS'And also liability for anything?'
p10256
aS'Companies are a means of *limiting liability* not providing more.'
p10257
aS'Who other runs the business as a matter of fact (and however many) would have full liability for all of their assets.'
p10258
aS'Entirely up to them as long as they deliver the event?'
p10259
aS'I run events and ticket money just goes into my personal bank account.'
p10260
aS'As you are a sole trader, if you were in their position, what would have been your response to questions about the business organisation?'
p10261
aS'"there is no requirement for the business to be a limited company, if I do not deliver the event I am personally liable for any money (which is not the case with a limited company, which can just go into liquidation)"'
p10262
aS"I dunno what the current threshold is, but you don't need to register a self-employment/freelance business for taxes until you're making over a certain amount a year."
p10263
aS'Last time I checked it was \xc2\xa36000.'
p10264
aS'Generally with events organising the costs are high and the profit margins are very narrow, you have to be a *really* big player to be making any serious money.'
p10265
aS"For everyone else it's just about breaking even at the end of the night."
p10266
aS"I have various record labels and music promotions outfits I've freelanced for on my CV and people assume they must be these really slick, formidable organisations, when in reality you can get a heck of a lot done with one laptop and a bit of creativity."
p10267
aS"There's one such outfit I helped set up with a few friends and we went from putting on gigs in the local pub because our friends in bands wanted somewhere to play, to being reviewed in national newspapers, to having fairly big acts from abroad contact us wanting to be involved and festivals wanting to talent scout for new acts."
p10268
aS"People write to us as if we're Virgin or EMI or Glastonbury festival, but we're not."
p10269
aS'We all have day jobs and we do everything - from the poster art to the sound checks - ourselves.'
p10270
aS'------------------\n\nHaving said that, even if an event is being organised by one person using carrier pigeons.'
p10271
aS'They should be able to show that they booked a venue.'
p10272
aS"You'd book a venue for a child's birthday party let alone an event thousands are meant to be attending. "
p10273
aS'You must register for NI (type 2?'
p10274
aS') though.'
p10275
aS"You can really lose out that way if you don't."
p10276
aS'Also, I am not sure about the threshold.'
p10277
aS"Can you actually provide a link for this, as I can't find anything and my own experience is that you must register immediately."
p10278
aS'If you are running a business then good on you, but you ought to consider some sort of limited liability because if things go really wrong you want to protect yourself.'
p10279
aS'Taking money straight into your personal bank account makes it harder to work out what is business turnover or not.'
p10280
aS'The tax people hate this.'
p10281
aS'Then again the tax people are clueless and lazy so you may not get too much hassle.'
p10282
aS'But if they got bored and picked on you then they could cause you lots of hassle.'
p10283
aS'Is it a requirement to make some sort of registration with the ICO (like as a data controller or something)?'
p10284
aS"Yes, that's one thing they're doing wrong (but so few businesses, even pretty large ones actually do)."
p10285
aS'Unlikely to get into any trouble for it unless they had a breach.'
p10286
aS'It is if you claim to be one on your whois record.'
p10287
aS"Nah shhh we're in a circlejerk here, OP is a brave Internet warrior who fights these scammers!"
p10288
aS"Or he's just someone with too much time on his hands who doesn't really understand business and thinks any company he can't find with an internet check is a scam."
p10289
aS'I run two companies of my own.'
p10290
aS'My point is if you are handing over information that is being stored, you should know where or who it is going to.'
p10291
aS'Are you UK based?'
p10292
aS"It sounds like you don't know how UK companies operate."
p10293
aS"You don't have to incorporate your company to be legit you moron."
p10294
aS'Good god you lot really are clueless internet detectives.'
p10295
aS'What do you mean by that?'
p10296
aS"Unless you're a sole trader, you have to register your business in the UK."
p10297
aS'*Have to* register the business?'
p10298
aS"You get unregistered partnerships, unincorporated associations, things that aren't companies etc etc."
p10299
aS"It's just that practically speaking you usually want a limited liability vehicle so your house is safer and that's probably an ltd."
p10300
aS'You have to register an unlimited company, certainly.'
p10301
aS"The difference to Ltd bring you don't file accounts."
p10302
aS'To be fair, "unlimited company" probably doesn\'t belong in a list of "things that aren\'t companies etc etc"'
p10303
aS"I wasn't trying to, for the record"
p10304
aS'No, you dont - but the protections offered by being a limited company (a large part that you can largely just walk away without being liable for debts if it all goes tits up) are too good to ignore in the Events business.'
p10305
aS"Don't feel bad."
p10306
aS'I thought they were a scam, or a joke, or a weird social experiment, just after pressing send on their horrendously amateurish "Pre-registration" form.'
p10307
aS"If they didn't want all of the scrutiny and accusations, they should have had everything in place before going viral and milking it for all it was worth."
p10308
aS"Perhaps I'm being overly cynical, but if they put on even one event they've promised I'll be surprised.  "
p10309
aS'To be honest it kind of feels like a just enough knowledge to be dangerous thing, it seems like the logic went "I HAVE CHECKED!'
p10310
aS'THERE IS NO COMPANY!'
p10311
aS'IT MUST BE DODGY!'
p10312
aS'" and just snowballed from there.'
p10313
aS'The thing that put me over was the local councils I contacted saying they had never heard of the event and specifically saying it should be treated as a scam.'
p10314
aS'Secondly, when I specifically asked what the company was, I got no answer.'
p10315
aS'Hey ho, just trying to help people be safe on the internet and they were just trying to organise events.'
p10316
aS'Neither of us were the best in the world at it.'
p10317
aS"Your detective work did help prove that, while they say they aren't a scam (apparently, but lets see how many events they put on...), they are completely useless at everything apart from making Facebook events.  "
p10318
aS'Is it defaming?'
p10319
aS"He aired his doubts, didn't necessarily say it's definitely a scam."
p10320
aS'I think its important people bring stuff like this up.'
p10321
aS'Except he did; this was my issue with the blog post.'
p10322
aS'If it\'d been "this might be dodgy, these are the facts..." I\'d have been fine with it but he literally said "Outdoor Cinema is a scam", which was then reported by "news" sites and repeated by their potential customers on Facebook.'
p10323
aS'the post was titled \'Have you seen "The Outdoor Cinema" on Facebook?'
p10324
aS"It's the biggest data collection scam out there right now'"
p10325
aS"The post itself wouldn't be but tweets and the reddit posts about it saying 'this is a scam' rather than this 'could be a scam' are close to the line when it comes to defamy."
p10326
aS'Yea, I learned a lesson there.'
p10327
aS'I wrote the title before the post without a lot of thought.'
p10328
aS'The first paragraph was "I believe this, here are my facts".'
p10329
aS'I never really reviewed the title/tweet.'
p10330
aS'It was a bit of a rush job on my part.'
p10331
aS"And what happens if, as a result of your jumping to conclusions, they can't make this into a viable business?"
p10332
aS'They will.'
p10333
aS"Most people won't hear of this and those that do will get the update."
p10334
aS'An assumption, but probably a reasonable one.'
p10335
aS'Awesome username btw!'
p10336
aS'Hmm yeah.'
p10337
aS"Can't blame people being a bit skeptical though."
p10338
aS'It looks like the business have been a bit of a victim of their own success.'
p10339
aS"Yeah, if nothing else, it's a terrible sign if people are confusing your business with a scam."
p10340
aS"You're doing something horribly wrong if that happens."
p10341
aS'No one ever thinks *Asda* is just a scam to get your email address, for example.'
p10342
aS"Lol because some internet detectives randomly called it a scam it's their fault?"
p10343
aS"Aye - I can't lay claim to ever thinking OP was definitively wrong, but I did think it premature that he and other Redditors were accepting that it so definitively *was* a scam."
p10344
aS'Did you post KONY2012 on Facebook too.'

p10514
aS"On top of all this we're being told that in order to have a functioning economy, we're more likely to die before we'll be able to retire, the ladder onto the housing market is being pulled up by the preceding generation and the government policy of sending everybody to university means that in some areas there is a sizeable graduate job market saturation; I know too many people who got good degrees (first class marks from the top end of the Russell Group) in the wrong subjects (English literature, History) and are trying to scrape together the beginning of the rest of their lives on a salary of \xc2\xa320k with a job based in central London."

p10523
aS'However it is worth checking as you may have won something.'

aS'I thought the minimum to be entered into the draws was \xc2\xa350, though?'
p10525
aS'The Currency was only decimalised in 1971.'
p10526
aS'So that 1956 \xc2\xa31 is worth quite a bit more than you think it was worth.'
p10527
aS'I think you are confusing decimalisation with inflation.'
p10528
aS"It is inflation which means that \xc2\xa31 was quite a lot to invest in 1956 but it won't even buy you a cup of tea any more."
p10529
aS'However if you cash in the premium bond you will only get back the \xc2\xa31 you started with.'
p10530
aS'Yeah but this might not automatically be subject to inflation.'
p10531
aS'For example; If you put \xc2\xa31 in a bank savings account then most current accounts will apply some form of interest to that account.'
p10532
aS"If you take \xc2\xa31 and load it onto the Steam platform to buy games (as an example) it doesn't accumulate interest."
p10533
aS"If you withdraw that \xc2\xa31 a year later, it's still worth only \xc2\xa31 (in 2016 money) even if it *should* have been worth \xc2\xa31.02 with interest."
p10534
aS"My point is that money doesn't automatically accumulate interest wherever it is kept."
p10535
aS'It would depend on the terms and conditions of when this was taken out - but I suspect it **is not** subject to interest because the way this system worked was more like an early form of lottery or pools.'
p10536
aS'Having said that, it would be worth investigating it as \xc2\xa31 in an account for 54 years could have something worthwhile in it... but I would go into it with fairly limited expectations.'
p10537
aS"The most likely outcome is you'll get either \xc2\xa30 or \xc2\xa31.  "
p10538
aS'It is a bond where the interest it would have earned is paid as prizes instead.'
p10539
aS"So you keep the original 'principal' and you are free to withdraw it at any time."
p10540
aS'So you will get back the \xc2\xa31.'
p10541
aS'The prizes you can win will *on average* amount to whatever the interest rate is from the bonds.'
p10542
aS'But for a single \xc2\xa31 bond, even over 50+ years, there is a quite a good chance you will win nothing at all.'
p10543
aS'It is equivalent of a \xc2\xa322.50 premium bond now and it is rather likely it has increased by more than its original pound, increased at less than the rate of inflation most probably, it is most like worth \xc2\xa310 or something, of course they could have lucked out and therefore it could be worth any amount of money. '
p10544
aS"I'm not sure if people were actually able to win the prizes with just \xc2\xa31 entry."
p10545
aS'I think there was a minimum deposit for that. '
p10546
aS'Nope , nowadays you have to invest \xc2\xa3100 at a time (\xc2\xa350 by Standing Order) to actually make the purchase.'
p10547
aS'but every \xc2\xa31 is a valid number for the prize draw.'
p10548
aS'This person has \xc2\xa31 in bonds: \xc2\xa31 will be returned '
p10549
aS"\xc2\xa31 in 1956 was the equivalent of \xc2\xa322.29 in today's money, according to the Bank of England's inflation calculator."
p10550
aS"Yup it may be but the bonds cash in value doesn't change at all."
p10551
aS'But is it still, or does it still count as \xc2\xa31?'
p10552
aS'Would they have done the conversion automatically?'
p10553
aS'...No idea...'
p10554
aS"The value of a pound didn't change with decimalisation."
p10555
aS'They just replaced the shilling with 5p, and adjusted the other coins around it.'
p10556
aS'A pound used to be 20 shillings, then it became 20 x 5p.'
p10557
aS'And for the younger readers, 5p pieces used to be considerably larger than they are today.'
p10558
aS'About the size of a 2p piece.'
p10559
aS'They were chosen to be that size because that was the size of the shilling.'
p10560
aS"One shilling coins were used interchangeably with 5p coins right up until the size was changed in the early 1990's."
p10561
aS'It is now but back in the sixties you could buy in units of \xc2\xa31.'
p10562
aS'You still can subject to the minimum'

aS'TB vaccination causes currently used TB tests to come back as positive - as the cheapest ones on the market (and generally widely used ones) use Tuberculin (a protein found in TB) to stimulate an immune reaction by the host.'
p10644
aS'The vaccine contains this, thus causing immunity, but also an immune response\n\nThe other option is doing a TB PCR, but this is both more expensive and less sensitive than simple Tuberculin testing.'
p10645
aS'Ultimately however, TB has been much more effectively controlled in countries that limit cattle mixing - e.g New Zealand; and there is actually very little concrete evidence badger culling is particularly effective in comparison (not to mention expensive and of questionable ethics) '

p10734
aS"There's a persistent and widespread misapplied analogy, comparing macroeconomics to a single household's budget... whereupon it becomes all-important to keep debt to a minimum and 'live within your means'."
p10735
aS"Back in reality, managing the finances of a nation is vastly different from that of a household - you've got a virtually infinite horizon to pay debt off over, you have control over issuing currency (whilst printing money to service debt is Not Advised in large quantities, it's technically possible, which makes a full blown default immensely unlikely) and, more importantly, your debt is an significant part of everyone else's savings, and your spending is a significant part of demand in the wider economy."
p10736
aS'Whilst spending profligately isn\'t a great idea, the intense focus on the deficit doesn\'t seem to mirror the concerns of *actual economists*... but it seems to be an easy thing to paint a target on to score some political points for "making tough decisions", which just so happen to also further certain ideological goals when it comes to shrinking the welfare budget and the role of the state in public services.'

p10744
aS"What return did that generate, or does that continue to generate, in terms of increased economic activity (and thereby increased tax receipts, as well as the wider benefits to everyone involved) compared to the hypothetical where we didn't borrow?"

p10746
aS'And what are the prospects for making the same efforts with less pain by waiting for a better economic climate to do it in?'

aS'It was spent on running costs that got far too big.'

p10763
aS'Where did money for roads come from?'
p10764
aS'Where did money for our education system come from?'
p10765
aS'I would class building new roads and new schools as an investment, whereas repairing roads and running old schools is not.'
p10766
aS'Those would be capital expenditure, certainly.'
p10767
aS'Spending more on teacher salaries can be seen as investment - more teachers means smaller classes means better education.'
p10768
aS'However I know this can get very murky.'
p10769
aS'I do not have an economics dictionary here to consult.'
p10770
aS"I think repairs and upkeep and general running cost can be seen as a kind of investment - they may not produce a tangible asset to sit on the books, but they do result in a country that's overall better off than if we hadn't spent anything, and had instead dropped services or allowed things to fall into disrepair."
p10771
aS'Taking roads as an example... we spend on repairing them today so that all the traffic and commerce that depends on them can continue without being impeded or made more costly by the roads being in a poor state.'
p10772
aS'That constitutes a return on the investment, a slice of which is collected by the Treasury.'
p10773
aS'I think this may be thought of slightly incorrectly.'
p10774
aS"When you build a road, it's not a one-off expenditure - it requires maintenance."
p10775
aS'The initial build costs are an investment to get the road in place in the first place.'
p10776
aS'Without further work, they will eventually fall into disrepair and become unusable.'
p10777
aS'Maintenance costs are an investment in keeping the roads running for a further period.'
p10778
aS"I understand the principle of that stance, but if you don't 'have answers' of where the debt came from then it's just an opinion you're parroting because it sounds plausible instead of actually being able to defend it."
p10779
aS'Welcome to economics.'
p10780
aS'The very same could be said for your position.'
p10781
aS"And he wasn't disagreeing with you, just saying that there's more things you need to consider when making a judgement."
p10782
aS'In fact, completely paying the debt off, could harm the economy, as business would have no long term government bonds to leverage with.'

aS"Not sure how true it is but I've seen it mentioned a couple of times on documentary's."
p10784
aS'That the balanced budgets in the USA around 2000 made the recession a lot harder by pushing investors away from safe government debt towards real estate.'
p10785
aS"What you say is mostly accurate, but it's missing one thing."
p10786
aS'Assuming no more money-printing, the debt market is a competitive place.'
p10787
aS"UK gilts are competing to be bought against everyone else's government bonds, and also commercial bonds and other forms of investment."
p10788
aS'The going rate for a UK gilt at the moment is very cheap.'
p10789
aS"But there's two ways to look at this: 1) make hay while the sun shines, borrow a lot to invest; or 2) it won't stay that way forever, so servicing the debt will not just get worse, but also get worse as a proportion to the size of the debt."
p10790
aS'Balancing these concerns puts a practical limit on the safe size of the debt.'
p10791
aS"What about... Greece, it's sovereign debt crisis, imminent default and exit from the Eurozone?"
p10792
aS'What about them?'
p10793
aS"They're a very different country in a very different situation."
p10794
aS"People occasionally try to draw parallels as if we were about to go the same way, but we have control of our own currency (being part of the Eurozone, they don't) and we're generally a stronger economy."
p10795
aS'&gt;printing money to service debt is Not Advised in large quantities\n\nWe have \xc2\xa31.56 trillion of national debt.'
p10796
aS'Question: if the government decided to print off \xc2\xa31.56 trillion and pay off all of the debt, what would be the economic consequences?'
p10797
aS'The pound would be worth less as there would be more of it.'
p10798
aS'Pretty much everything would get more expensive.'
p10799
aS'(A very simplified view)'
p10800
aS'We let banks "print" money constantly in the form of fiat currency. '
p10801
aS"Continuing to run a budget deficit does indeed increase the national debt, and thus servicing it will become more expensive and it does affect our credit rating (as it did when we lost our triple A rating in 2013, which I think we've regained)."
p10802
aS'So why did we lose our credit rating in 2013 when we had a Tory government cutting the deficit for 2.5 years?'
p10803
aS'And why did it go back to triple A a year later when the deficit had risen again?'
p10804
aS'The reporting at the time said it was down to poor growth not anything to do with debt or deficit.'
p10805
aS'Is that wrong?'
p10806
aS'Genuine questions. '
p10807
aS'Because as a % of GDP the deficit has shrunk. '
p10808
aS'these words by a wiser person pretty much sums it all up:\n\n&gt;National debt is completely and totally unlike household finances.'
p10809
aS"The thing is that people just aren't used to thinking of money on those terms and default to thinking about credit cards, egged on by politicians who want to manufacture a crisis to implement their political agenda."
p10810
aS'&gt;So first of all, sovereign debt (that is, debt issued in the currency of the issuing nation) has a pretty spectacular get-out-of-jail-free card.'
p10811
aS"We agree to pay someone 1.1 billion quid in a year if they lend us a billion (the interest rate is a *lot* lower than that in reality but obviously I'm simplifying)."
p10812
aS'Hmm... where can we lay our hands on 1.1 billion quid?'
p10813
aS'Well, there are these printing presses over here...'
p10814
aS'Long-term this isn\'t sustainable - the "free" money makes its way back into the economy, devaluing the pound and causing inflation, and the people we lent the money to remember and want more money next time - but short-term, say when recovering from a truly unprecedented crash in the world economy, it\'s fine.'
p10815
aS'&gt;This, by the way, is why any comparison to Greece or any other Eurozone nation is entirely pointless.'
p10816
aS"Greece don't have a printing press, the Germans have it, and they're not going to fuck up their own economy to help out the Greeks, European Ideal or not."
p10817
aS"It's also why debt-to-GDP is completely and totally pointless as any kind of indicator when comparing us to the Eurozone."
p10818
aS'We can use our printing press to grow our economy, through investment in infrastructure, R&amp;D, and all that sort of fun stuff.'
p10819
aS"We don't need to shrink the debt side if we grow the GDP side."
p10820
aS'&gt;The next important difference between sovereign debt and household debt is cost - bond yields (the equivalent of an interest rate - basically we auction off bits of paper that are effectively IOUs saying "We\'ll pay whoever owns this bit of paper x million pounds on y date, and the difference between that face value and the amount they sell for at auction is basically the interest rate we pay) are spectacularly lower for sovereign debt.'
p10821
aS'Indeed, in times of great financial calamity - like, say, the last 5 years - investors are so desperate for a safe harbour for their money that they are willing to pay more than the face value of the bond for the lack of risk.'
p10822
aS'Just to reiterate, in bold because this is really fucking important, when things are really fucked, we actually pay a negative interest rate.'
p10823
aS'People will give us a million quid now for 990,000 quid later.'
p10824
aS'&gt;So.'
p10825
aS'National debt - at this point - not an actual issue.'
p10826
aS'However the Tories never let a crisis go to waste.'
p10827
aS'They implant the idea that we have to pay off our national credit card (obviously bloated by evil Labour spending money on mansions for pedophile gypsies, not in a desperate attempt to rescue a financial system that is the darling of the neoliberals from imploding from the inevitable stupidity and unreality at its heart).'
p10828
aS'This idea takes hold and the Tories give a really obvious solution to it - cut government spending!'
p10829
aS'This is an obvious, common-sense, man-on-the-street solution and so is, of course, completely and totally the wrong thing to do.'
p10830
aS'It completely ignores where almost all government spending goes, which is of course straight into the economy - in particular mostly to the poorest members of society, who instantly spend it (the feckless bastards) in local shops, who spend it with local suppliers, who spend it with local wholesalers, generating jobs and tax revenue all the way down the line.'
p10831
aS'Much better to let the rich keep it where they can do good things like it like dumping it into the housing bubble or squirrel it away in the Virgin Islands.'
p10832
aS"&gt;The net effect of massive spending cuts then is to shrink the economy, shrinking tax revenues, meaning... you're going to love this... we have to borrow more money when we cut spending."
p10833
aS"It's a lie so spectacularly big that literally nobody ever dares call them out on it."
p10834
aS"The government's solution to a problem which doesn't actually exist actually exacerbates the problem."
p10835
aS'MORE CUTS FOR THE CUTS GOD!'
p10836
aS'So why are they doing this?'
p10837
aS'The same two reasons they do everything, and the two central planks of all Tory (of all colour) policy:\n\n&gt;1: More money for us\n\n&gt;2: Fuck you\n\n\n\n&gt;Spending cuts have only one real effect - concentrating money into the hands who already have it.'
p10838
aS"This isn't a matter of opinion, it's simple fact."
p10839
aS"When pressed on this Tories will either say that well actually the people at the top deserve that money or really it's going to help the economy in the long term by getting the nasty inefficient government out of the way of the strivers, but see points one and two and work out which story better fits the observable facts."
p10840
aS"&gt;So, what could we as a society actually have done in '08?"
p10841
aS'Good question.'
p10842
aS"The one thing nobody knows is what would have happened if we'd just let it all crash."
p10843
aS'not even the most lunatic anarchocapitalist says that it would have worked out well - if nothing else pretty much every piece of money and property in the world would have ended up being the subject of three dozen different court cases in as many different jurisdictions trying to work out who actually owns it.'
p10844
aS"What's certain of course is that the poorest would be the most fucked because that's the inevitable conclusion of everything that happens in this world."

aS'&gt;Given that, if we accept that the system needed to be rescued, we could have just done what we always did before - borrow money, inflate ourselves out of the crisis, try to do what we can to cushion the blow as much as possible, and for fucks sake regulate the banking system properly to stop it happening again.'
p10847
aS"So, of course, what we're doing is the exact, polar opposite."
p10848
aS"We're fucking over the very poorest, saddling ourselves with more debt at worse rates (because the money markets aren't stupid and know that austerity is hurting our ability to repay and so cranking our rates up) and of course rejecting any calls to regulate anything ever."

aS'This is misleading the UK has never been able to sell bonds for negative interest rates.'
p10852
aS'It also ignores the fact that in the long term interest rates may not remain low and to borrow lots of money assuming that they always will is extremely risky.'
p10853
aS'We will end up having to issue more bonds (5/10/20 years) in the future which will have higher interest rates and will force us to spend more money on interest and less on services.'

aS'Debt = amount of money we owe.'
p10863
aS'Deficit = amount by which the debt is getting larger.'
p10864
aS'So when Cameron says "I\'ve halved the deficit", what he actually means is that the debt is getting bigger at half the rate it once was.'
p10865
aS"As a statistic this means nothing, borrowing is fine if it's spent wisely."
p10866
aS'As other have said, economics as applied to countries is very different from economics as applied to households.'
p10867
aS"If I were to give the politicians the benefit of the doubt, I'd say they use these cumbersome analogies as most people are unfamiliar with macroeconomics; but on the other hand, it plays well to their need to pull the wool over people's eyes too!"
p10868
aS'The danger of a debt that gets too large is it means an ever larger proportion of tax revenue is spent on servicing the debt, paying interest on it.'
p10869
aS"The danger of a deficit that gets too large is that should the debt market change (we're competing with other countries for money essentially - the UK has a good reputation so we don't have to pay as much interest as most other countries - but should someone like USA/Germany start paying more, we may not be able to raise as much at low rates), then we'd have no choice but to borrow at higher interest rates."
p10870
aS'Also, as others have said, there\'s a bit "get-out-of-jail" card in the fact we control our own currency.'
p10871
aS'Most, but not all!, of the debt is measured in Pounds Sterling, so we could just devalue the currency, that means we pay less.'
p10872
aS'This is not a happy ending though, for multiple reasons:\n\n1.'

p10878
aS')\n\nSo, all in all, it is good to "balance the books".'
p10879
aS'But balancing the books for an entire country means balanced over a twenty-year period, not each and every year.'
p10880
aS'Trouble is the current deficit has been going for nearly that length of time already, we forgot to reduce the debt during the mid-2000\'s "good period".'
p10881
aS'During a recession, national production drops, so if the tax rates remain the same, the government takes in less tax.'
p10882
aS'At the same time, more people are unemployed and eligible for state benefits.'
p10883
aS'At this point a government has a number of options:\n\n* Increase tax rates.'
p10884
aS"This isn't a good idea in a recession, because it means people have less money to buy goods and services."
p10885
aS'Production drops further, and the recession goes on for longer.'
p10886
aS'If anything it would be better to cut taxes.'
p10887
aS'* Cut spending.'
p10888
aS'Again this means that less goods and services are bought.'

aS'Production drops, the recession goes on for longer, and the government takes in even less tax.'
p10890
aS'* Borrow.'
p10891
aS"This results in increased interest payments, but doesn't prolong the recession."
p10892
aS'If a country has its own currency, and if borrowing costs are low, this is the least-worst option.'
p10893
aS'As the economy improves, production increases, the government takes in more tax without  needing to raise tax rates.'
p10894
aS'This option will leave the country with *less* debt than the alternatives.\n\n'
p10895
aS"I realise it doesn't seem like it now, but if recent history is anything to go by the next four or five years are likely to be the top of the next business cycle before another crash happens."
p10896
aS'The idea behind Keyesianism is that you are meant to run surpluses to reduce the national debt and the national debt as a percentage of GDP during the good times (ie, at the top of the business cycle) and do any capital spending in the next recession, because although things might be okay now, if we have another crash and have to spend a whole lot more money then even more problems are going to happen.'
p10897
aS"The issue is that the people so quick to advocate Keynes during a recession are the ones least likely to try and run a surplus when the times are 'good', and this is a way of holding their feet to the fire so they actually do it rather than taking the Brown approach of saying they have abolished boom and bust so they can continue spending at the top of the cycle."
p10898
aS'Getting rid of the deficit quickly is important.'
p10899
aS'The debate is only if the ultra-austerity approach is practical.'
p10900
aS'For all the talk the Tories have barely met what Gordon Brown planned for in 2010.'
p10901
aS"The argument isn't that the national deficit doesn't have to come down."
p10902
aS'The argument is that austerity is the wrong way to do it.'
p10903
aS'Does anyone have any insight into "spending" your way out vs. "cutting", it\'s clear parties left of Labour are fully against austerity, favouring more spending = jobs = taxes = gradual debt/deficit reduction.'
p10904
aS'Could this work?'
p10905
aS'Or is it a case of just taking too long?\n\n'
p10906
aS"Borrowing to spend works is you've lowered the debt/GDP ratio during the growth years."

aS'Sadly, the oft-quoted note left on the treasury\'s desk in 2010 by the exiting Labour minister reading "sorry, there\'s no money left" put a dampener on that.'

p10928
aS"If they stick to their principles- their arguement post 2010 was that the largest party sould have first shot at forming a government, and IIRC they tried to introduce a rule to this affect- that'll be the largest party."
p10929
aS"I spotted that too - but it's unlikely that Labour will get the ~300 seats needed to work with the ~25 the Lib Dems will get."
p10930
aS"&gt;  we'll just have another election\n\nNot quite as straightforward with the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. "
p10931
aS'How so?'
p10932
aS"If they can't command a majority they can't form a government &amp; a new election is called."
p10933
aS'Even after forming a government a new election could be called if one of the parties that originally agreed to support the government (in getting a majority) renege on that support. '
p10934
aS'A new election requires 2/3rds majority of the house under the new rules?'
p10935
aS'Na it just requires a vote of no confidence which only requires a majority.'
p10936
aS'After a vote of no confidence there would be a 14 day period to form a new government before an election is called (so the party that called for the motion would likely try to form a government if they can).'
p10937
aS'What this means for example is that say SNP support Labour, but then withdraw that support after 6 months, the Conservatives then call for a vote of no confidence, government gets voted out, but no new parties can form a new government (unless SNP support the Tories) so an election is called.'
p10938
aS'The 2/3rd rule is just to stop governments calling for early elections at opportunistic times, which they still could do if they had a 2/3rds majority.'

aS"I don't see the SNP abstaining, that would effectively be a vote in favour."
p10944
aS'Same can be said for Labour.'
p10945
aS"But besides the fixed parliament act doesn't have an effect here, it is literally just there to stop the government from calling advantageous election dates. "
p10946
aS"I'm surprised nobody else sees to have understood this..."
p10947
aS"The SNP initially ruled out a deal with Labour, which Labour then ignored because, as they've said repeatedly, they're focussing on getting an overall majority."
p10948
aS"The begging and pre-emptive deal making the SNP hoped for didn't happen."
p10949
aS'So in the latest debate, Miliband gave the snarling little anklebiting terrier a snack on the nose with the rolled up newspaper of "No deal".'

p10966
aS"(hint: it's not the SNP)"
p10967
aS"Thing is, Miliband doesn't have to agree deals, because all of the minor parties, minus UKIP, have already refused to work with the Tories to form the next Government, so he knows that he can run the country effectively with a minority Government and no coalition agreement."

aS'The minor parties - Plaid, SNP, etc, have played their hands too soon.'

aS'Coalitions only happen when parties have things which they disagree on.'

aS"On defence they'll vote against Labour, but that's the main thing that Labour and the Conservatives agree on."
p10974
aS'&gt; Coalitions only happen when parties have things which they disagree on.'
p10975
aS'The main thing they disagree on is powers to be devolved to Scotland.'
p10976

p10977
aS'Vocally and repeatedly refusing to work with the Tories, expecting a minority Labour government seriously *does* equal Labour support with nothing to show for it.'
p10978
aS"They're going to have to beg and plead for every concession on a vote-by-vote basis, as there's Labour, Conservatives and all the other minor parties who could vote against them to block their policies."

aS'They won\'t have the comfort of a coalition "you scratch my back" deal.'
p10980
aS"As much as I think he's going to do an absolutely terrible job, I'd say Miliband's playing it perfectly."

aS"&gt;They're going to have to beg and plead for every concession on a vote-by-vote basis\n\n\n\nYou've fundamentally got it wrong."
p10982
aS"The SNP will make Ed Prime Minister no questions asked, even if it's only by not supporting David Cameron for PM."
p10983
aS"But if Labour need the SNP to make up the numbers in the commons then they will **need** SNP votes to pass any legislation the Tories vote against, that means if they want to pass anything of value from their manifesto they're going to have to appease the SNP and the SNP would only be too happy to vote down some Labour legislation they think is Tory-lite as it would be great PR."
p10984
aS'However, the best outcome for the SNP is to get a few concrete concessions for labour in return for generally voting through government policies, and that is almost certainly what will happen if that is the outcome of the election.'

p11542
aS"You won't redistribute wealth by simply raising income tax you need to tackle the problem directly."
p11543
aS'But you have to remember that the Greens are the [polar opposite](http://www.politicalcompass.org/uk2015) to the Tories &amp; even Labour actually, so of course their policies are going to look a little crazy.'
p11544
aS"I'd also agree that I don't think it would work if we implemented them all at once because it's too big of a change."
p11545
aS'However, their policies take the country in the right direction imo. '
p11546

p11556
aS'Sure, they do believe that, but they have other policies too.'
p11557
aS"When I mention their other ideas, like free university fees or a national citizen's income, then people actually say they like that."

p11609
aS'**The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on out-of-work benefits** so sanctions or the actions of job centres will not affect it.'
p11610
aS'These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey which samples around 40-45 thousand people every quarter.'
p11611
aS'There are unemployed who are not entitled to out-of-work benefits  (e.g.'
p11612
aS'those with a large household income due to a spouse, those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are people who claim JSA but are not unemployed (e.g.'
p11613
aS'those who work less than a certain number of hours or fraudsters), so the two are not the same.'
p11614
aS'The number of people claiming out-of-work benefits is reported separately as the Claimant Count.'
p11615
aS'Zero-hour contracts are not regularly measured, however there is some regular measure of \xe2\x80\x9cunderemployment\xe2\x80\x9d  by measuring those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work.'
p11616
aS'People self-select whether they are full time or part time.'
p11617
aS'Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are counted.'
p11618
aS'The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation.'
p11619
aS'As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed; they do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy.'
p11620
aS'However those on \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment supported training &amp; employment programmes\xe2\x80\x9d are reported separately so you may recast the figures should you wish.'
p11621
aS'The definition of unemployment requires someone to be actively seeking work in the last four weeks and able to start work in the next two weeks.'
p11622
aS'Those who are out of work and say they want a job but don\xe2\x80\x99t meet this definition are reported separately under Inactive.'
p11623
aS'Note that the Inactive category is only for 16-64 year olds.'
p11624
aS'The figures are calculated by the independent Office of National Statistics based on internationally agreed conventions.'
p11625
aS'The government cannot interfere with the calculation of the figures or set the way in which they are calculated.'
p11626
aS'However knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly and create targets which may not be in the best interest of the public.'
p11627
aS'The numbers are seasonally adjusted, so there should be no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.'
p11628
aS'Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a margin of error, e.g.'
p11629
aS'the 95% confidence interval for the unemployment rates is \xc2\xb1 0.2%.'
p11630
aS'The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.'

p11640
aS'Well no, you just have to be able to commute to London.'
p11641

p12425
aS'in the south no doubt!'
p12426
aS"There's plenty of anti Scottish sentiment in the powerful northern cities.... 12 million people live between Liverpool and hull on the m62 corridor and fell mightily pissed of that just 3.8 million Scots have far far more say and money spent on them, and excluding the oil our tax receipts are far higher.... Northern England is very pissed with Westminster and Scotland..  "

p12428
aS"There's a lot of anti-Scottish sentiment in Norfolk, we get peanuts in government funding and UKIP are making ground in Great Yarmouth, and could take the seat. "

p12439
aS"What's wrong with wanting to scrap the Barnett formula?"
p12440
aS"Turkeys don't vote for Christmas, and I'm imagining Scotland does better under the Barnett formula than whatever would replace it."
p12441
aS'Scrapping the Barnett formula makes sense, but only if you have something to replace it with.'
p12442
aS"That means a real discussion about what we do with our taxation- and that's a tough question for Westminster."
p12443
aS"Westminster desperately wants control over the oil revenue but it also doesn't want to have to shell out money to Scotland due to it's higher demand for social support."
p12444
aS"Even worse than that, if Scotland gets more money the English will be pissed (and that's *not* what Farage is suggesting)."
p12445
aS'If the Scots get less money then they have a real and legitimate call for another referendum.'
p12446
aS"I'd like to see Farage suggest that the Scots don't get a referendum on *that*."
p12447
aS'Just like in the EU - a renegotiation of the terms of the union would have many calling for a referendum.'
p12448
aS"The No vote was close last time, imagine a referendum in 2017 where another Tory/UKIP government has been slashing the budget again, where we're also voting on our way out of the EU, money to Scotland has been cut above and beyond the austerity cuts, and Scotland has voted in almost exclusively SNP MPs - making their political representation entirely distinct from the rest of the UK."
p12449
aS"Scrapping the Barnett Formula isn't anti-Scottish!"
p12450
aS'This (oft-repeated) idea is unfounded shit.'
p12451
aS'In fact why the *hell* should they get this special treatment?'
p12452
aS'He wants Scotland to remain as equal partners in the UK.'
p12453
aS'Now I know you\'re going to point out that "Scots pay more income tax".'
p12454
aS'Yes, \xc2\xa3400 per head more on average.'
p12455
aS"But they receive \xc2\xa31200 more funding per head; so that's \xc2\xa3800 per head more funding after tax."
p12456
aS'Wanting the Scots to not receive this special treatment does not, by any means, equate to him "not giving two shits about Scotland" in my book.'
p12457
aS'The Barnett formula goes some way to addressing the effect that significantly lower population density has on per capita costs in Scotland.'
p12458
aS"It's a blunt instrument and not exactly fit for purpose but it does cost more per head to deliver equivalent services to a lower density population than to a higher density one. "
p12459
aS'Also Scotland has a third of the land mass of the UK (and a massively longer coastline).'
p12460
aS'These things cost a non-zero amount of money to take care of.'
p12461
aS'So as part of the UK, it makes sense that its not just population based ratio of distribution.'
p12462
aS'&gt; These things cost a non-zero amount of money to take care of.'
p12463
aS'How much of the extra money actually going towards that?'
p12464
aS'I never considered this.'
p12465
aS'So why did Joel Barnett deem it a "national disgrace" before his death last November?'
p12466
aS"Because it doesn't address the problem very well and because of this leaves the people of the rest of the UK feeling hard done by in comparison to Scotland."
p12467
aS'It was effectively intended as a stop gap measure to be replaced by something fairer and more politically acceptable but this never happened.'
p12468
aS"Who cares, he's some old dead guy. "
p12469
aS'Same argument could be made for Wales.'
p12470
aS'Barnett himself said the discrepancy came from an error in calculating how the populations would change and any attempt to justify it is just people not wanting to challenge the status quo.'
p12471
aS'Would be better to come up with a system which is fair (perhaps taking into account things like population density) rather than blindly sticking to something which we know to have a flawed origin.'
p12472
aS"Seems like if it was meant to address lower population density it'd be done on a per county basis... rather than allocated at a constituent country level."
p12473
aS'Yes - but the per-county (and further down, in fact per-person to an extent) split is done in achieved in a different way.'
p12474
aS'This is a massive oversimplification, but the big Central Government pot is split out according to need (in theory).'
p12475
aS'If the NHS bill is much higher in Manchester and the pension bill is higher in Bournemouth then that all still comes out of the single main pot.'
p12476
aS'Devolution means handing control of areas of Government such as health over to Scotland, so the money has to be divided properly as well.'
p12477
aS'The Barnet formula effectively says "You used to get X% of the health budget.'
p12478
aS"For every \xc2\xa3100 that we take out of the national pot to be spent on England, we'll send you a cheque for the right amount to make sure that you're still getting X%."
p12479
aS'"\n\nThe big debate is whether the percentage is currently right.'
p12480
aS'Since everyone wants more money spent on themselves, the status quo has been preserved...'
p12481
aS'The issue with that is you have a problem when you come to arrange infrastructure that crosses county borders - if every county is funded separately then who pays for what and how do you make those costs fair?  '

p12493
aS'Sue Perkins was rumoured to be the next top gear presenter, and she received death threats because of it.'

aS'When I was a kid no-one had mobile phones, and practically everyone allowed their landline number  to be listed in the local directory.'

aS'Today if you go on twitter and make death threats then idiots on Reddit will defend your right to "free speech".'
p12503
aS'No, Gaz, it\'s not "free speech", it\'s abuse and harassment, just like it\'s always been, and you could be arrested for it in the 70\'s and 80\'s if you were a persistent "telephone troll" back then, too.'

p12506
aS'Trolling was much more intelligent back in the internet of 2000.'

aS'It was about provoking someone into an argument and making them lose their composure.'

aS'Even now if someone engaged in old style phoning me up constantly, I could just block them.'
p12515
aS'Same goes for twitter and Facebook.'
p12516
aS'Which is why the troll needs the engaged victim who is going to publicly storm off the medium rather than simply block them.'
p12517
aS"It's not free speech, it's common sense."
p12518
aS"I do often get the sense that when someone today announces they are leaving twitter or Facebook, it is the same behaviour that was mocked in the 90's and early noughties on  message boards as being OTT and unnecessary."
p12519
aS'Except now, because celebrities and people the public admire are doing it, we all denounce trolling as if it is a disease rather than a few idiots.'
p12520
aS'Where did I make a comparison?'
p12521
aS'What I said is that abuse and harassment has always been illegal, and it remains so irrespective of the medium.'
p12522
aS'It was illegal in the days of analogue telephones, and it remains so on Twitter.'
p12523
aS"Assuming I accept your claim that sending someone a lot of tweets isn't harassment because of the block button (which ignores how prolific twitter trolls are at creating new accounts), that doesn't mean that criminal harassment and abuse doesn't happen on Twitter."
p12524
aS'Nor does it mean that abuse and harassment magically becomes "impossible" on social media, just because you think the internet is somehow different and it should be exempted from all law or reason.'
p12525
aS'Until a few years ago I was determined in the conviction that we should be able to say whatever we like on the internet, and that this new form of communication represented liberty and the opportunity to rid ourselves from the idiotic constraints of conformity and the easily-offended.'

p12631

p12733
aS'If you want to take two points completely and arbitrarily at odds with each other, fiscal conservatism and authoritarian drug policy, one says you should be free to use your money how you please, the other says we should restrict your access and use the government money to pursue you for doing so.'

aS"They are at odds, if you take a liberal drug policy, then you can cut the police budget as they no longer have to deal with the crime of it, you can tax the drugs so have more money (just like the conservatives did with VAT on all purchases) to spend, then of course the whole treatment of the drug issue which already exists becomes a problem for the fiscal conservative as they don't want to have government functions that help people, they believe you should help yourself, doesn't really work in this case."
p12735
aS'But the facts are the current drug policy is wasting a load of money on police resources, it is reducing tax revenues, funding criminal organisation, demonising and criminalising the actions of many working, functioning, voting, tax paying individuals, all while drugs are essentially readily available for anyone who want them, but in a more dangerous manner without any information about the effects and long term use of them.'
p12736
aS'How is that a good system?'
p12737

p12766

aS"I'd suggest we give Labour and the Conservatives 33% each, give UKIP 14%, the Lib Dems 8%, the Greens 5% and split the remainder between plaid and the SNP."
p12782
aS"Because that's what they're polling."

aS"Oh wait that isn't what you meant at all..."
p12793
aS"This is why your point really makes no sense, these are regional parties, with strong support in those regions, putting in a 40-50% conservative audience that is a balance of the UK rather than their constituencies, won't make a for a relevant balanced audience, London's voting habits is irrelevant to Plaid Cymru or the SNP, hence you need to over represent voters from regional demographics that have strong support within them, because actually they have even greater percentage of the voters in their constituency than even this over representation in the audience."

aS'Yes, I studied development for my MA.'
p13616
aS"The Washington Consensus's primary goal is to create a liberal, free market economy similar to those of Western developed nations."
p13617
aS'The problem is, most Western nations developed using centrally planned economies and policies which directly contradict those espoused by financial institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF, therefore, in reality, it leads to developing nations opening up their economies to foreign investment (i.e.'
p13618
aS"exploitation by MNCs), and although it may lead to increases in a nation's GDP, it rarely helps those at the bottom."

aS'All forms of capitalism are toxic, any resource distribution system which promotes inequality, can see people homeless even when there are enough houses, and can see people hungry even when there is enough food, is a problem.'

aS'Capitalism is primarily focused on growth.'
p13650
aS"It's actually quite good at growing."
p13651
aS"And it's good at working around restrictions on growth (which is what we need)."
p13652
aS'Despite having talked for decades about "restricting greenhouse gas emissions" and "social markets" etc, under capitalism greenhouse gas emissions are still going up every year, as is inequality, as is deforestation.'
p13653
aS'In order to prevent global warming, oil resources need to be left in the ground.'
p13654
aS'There is simply no mechanism to do that under capitalism.'
p13655
aS"They are too profitable (witness how our politicians talk about being green, but then rub their hands as new oil is discovered, and pass laws to make it's extraction easier)."
p13656
aS'If you\'ve been trying something for 20 years, it still hasn\'t worked, and you have considerably less than 20 left to make a difference, then "more of the same" is not a viable answer.'
p13657
aS'Capitalism can manifest itself it many different ways.'
p13658
aS'For example, the U.S. would be close to the type of *laissez-faire* capitalism which restricts government intervention in the economy, whereas China is a type of state capitalism in which the capitalist economy is managed.'
p13659
aS"All I'm saying is that it's impossible to immediately create an idealistic system in which the people and the planet are healthy and happy, although it is a noble goal for the distant future."
p13660
aS'First, we need to focus on how we can reform the capitalist economy in a way that best serves our interests.'
p13661
aS'That should involve heavy government intervention in order to restrict the type of cowboy capitalism which has been in place since the 1970s and led to increased inequality and greenhouse emissions.'
p13662
aS"Capitalism hasn't always been like this, and we can make it fairer again, before transitioning a more socialist or susintable type of politics in the future."
p13663
aS"The problem is that capitalism in any of it's manifestations focuses power on those who compete successfully in the marketplace."
p13664
aS'These people then use that power to support their own aims, via politicians and the press, creating a feedback loop that starts slow and then grows, further enhancing the power of capitalists.'
p13665
aS'This is equally true in both the US and China.'
p13666
aS"Whilst it's possible to imagine a benign capitalist system (as your do), in practice, whenever it occurs, it's a temporary phenomenon, since the pressure under capitalism is by default in the other direction (back in the late 20th century, there was another force limiting capitalism - the competing ideology of communism, which made capitalism more benign in order to appeal to the masses, but that pressure is gone now, and capitalism is becoming ever more rapacious)."
p13667
aS'DAE OCCUPY THE 1%?!!!?!??!?'
p13668
aS'Jokes aside: neoliberalism or "laissez-faire" liberalism is the complete removal of governmental responsibility from every day life ("small state") which advocates among other things privatisation of services and large spending cuts (austerity).'
p13669
aS'Both of these things are known to increase inequality and an upward redistribution of wealth due to the tendency of such governments to prefer keeping large amounts of business with the same corporations.'

aS"That's a pretty likely coalition in all fairness."

aS"That's a pretty likely scenario in all fairness."
p14103
aS"The problem with this is, I highly doubt the Lib Dems would want to work with the SNP, especially in the way they're going along with the Tory line of how bad they are."
p14104
aS"Although, they said they would never for a coalition last time, and they did, so I guess you can't trust them with anything"
p14105
aS'I\'m thinking everyone could avoid their "red lines" by having a Lab-Lib minority with SNP confidence and supply.'

p14115
aS"I'm hoping for a Lab+Lib+SNP coalition, personally."
p14116

p14122
aS"It isn't randomly generated numbers, it's informal seat predictions with an upper and lower limit."
p14123
aS"The reason you can't make a 'clusterfuck' of all the minor parties is because there will never be enough seats between them to get a 326 majority in the game."

p14148
aS'Sturgeon knows this.'
p14149
aS'So why constantly push it?'
p14150
aS'She wants to show potential voters that she is prepared to work with Westminster but not with the Tories is my best guess.'
p14151
aS'If she didn\'t extend her hand towards Labour, some Scottish voters would think "what\'s the point of voting SNP into Westminster, it\'s not like they can become government".'
p14152
aS"Of course, this doesn't explain why she is pushing so hard though..."
p14153
aS'Surely she knows that Ed has to say no until the election is over.'
p14154
aS"He can't be seen to be forsaking his candidates in Scotland."
p14155
aS'If he were to start talking up an SNP coalition now, it would free up too many Scottish voters wavering in support to go ahead and vote SNP.'
p14156
aS"The few Scottish Labour MPs who are returned to Westminster would feel betrayed and abandoned by Ed, which really wouldn't be good for the party."
p14157
aS'I do think Nicola had a tough role to play at the debates last night, both emphasising to Scottish voters that they are her primary interest, but also trying to moderate the independence stance for English voters wavering in their support from Labour that she would love to work with Ed to change politics for the better for the whole country.'
p14158
aS'I thought she did a decent job of that, and she had to - she knows that her only shot in power is being hitched to Labour.'
p14159
aS"And likewise, Ed knows that barring some divine intervention, Labour won't be able to form a majority on their own."
p14160
aS"So they both have to play this stupid coy game of pretending to be at arms' length to shore up their own supporters geographically."
p14161
aS"As a Labour supporter, I'd personally be more than happy (in fact, I'd prefer) a coalition with the SNP."
p14162
aS"Hell, I wouldn't even mind letting the PC or Green MPs (if any) inside the tent as well, even though they probably wouldn't be needed to form a majority."
p14163
aS"I just wish Nicola would tone down all the coalition talks for the time being, even if it's almost certain that Ed will be sat on the phone with Nicola watching the results come election day. "
p14164
aS'Yeah the extent to which she is pushing it is odd, the only other theory I can come up with is that she has seen the Tory campaign which is basically "A vote for Labour is a vote to break up the country as they will get in bed with Salmond", and therefore is deliberately encouraging Ed to take a firm stance against the SNP to throw the Tory campaign tactic off...'

p14169
aS"In reality the SNP can't enter coalition."

p14172
aS'Both parties have ruled out a coalition a long time ago now with the SNP doing so first.'

p14193
aS'And many Scots might say that Devo max should have been on the ballot paper.'
p14194
aS"It wasn't, and now its supposed to be settled for a generation...just like FPTP? "

aS'So that will be settled for a generation then. \n'

aS"That wasn't the choice."

aS'You can bet that would change if the SNP get a free go at the piggy bank, especially if the Tories win a majority in England. '

aS"Even the Lib Dems aren't left wing, they are just less authoritarian than the major parties."
p14255
aS"I think by 'left' /u/shudders meant 'left of the centre in the mainstream of british politics', which I guess translates to 'a slightly more social democratic social policy while still supporting the status quo of huge wealth inequality etc'. "

p14266
aS"I'm not sure if I believe it totally but there is some evidence that the alliance of voting interests they have carefully knitted together has been in decline since the height of Thatcher."
p14267
aS"You could say (pre election 'hug a hoodie') Cameron was a response to the Tory inability to win against Blair's 'social democratic-ish' centreism using explicitly 'right' rhetoric and policies to appeal to their traditional constituencies, he's hated by a significant section of Tory backbenchers and rank and file etc but just about got them into power.

p14281
aS"I mean aren't similar things true of other parties, the Lib Dems had a huge surge and weren't that far from Labour in terms of share of the vote last time, but only got a couple of extra seats, UKIP are polling ahead of the lib dems in some polling but are only expected to win a few seats."

p14286

p15504
aS'Well that would be their biggest problem really, the perception (true or false) that the SNP used a lot of anti-English rhetoric during the referendum campaign has made them pretty unpopular in England, even if most of their policies would actually play very well in large parts of the country. '

p15549
aS'I absolutely think Cameron and Clegg should have been there standing up for their policies.'

aS"It's kiss of death for Miliband to play footsie with the SNP."
p16592

p16595

p16604
aS'I voted Lib Dem to have a "toned down Tory" government, and am mostly happy with what they managed to do, at a difficult time.'
p16605
aS"The problem is that a lot of people voted for the Lib Dems to have a 'toned down Labour' government, and never in their wildest dreams did they see them picking the Tories as coalition partner."
p16606
aS"If people knew a bit more about the Lib Dems' past with Labour and their economic policy, it might not have come as such a surprise, but given the emphasis they put on appealing to the left (students, lower-income familes), I think it's understandable that voters weren't happy."
p16607
aS"Yeah, I understand why a lot of voters would be annoyed for one reason or another, but this way the LibDems actually managed to get some of their policies enacted, which they wouldn't have managed any other way."

p16616
aS'All parties are a minority on their own..  Tories/Labour are peaking at around 34%.'

p16828
aS'Well, personally, and as someone who works in trade, I see nothing but disaster from leaving the EU.'
p16829
aS"That's not a very comprehensive view to hold being a trader and all, the market itself is betting on a break up of the Euro hence the negative bond yields we see in Germany."
p16830
aS"I wouldn't say they're betting on it, just hedging against it, which is prudent as there's clearly an increased risk right now, but I still don't think it's likely."

aS'Or makes David Cameron look like an unlikable coward.'
p17059
aS'More like a underdog tbh, in a strange way.'
p17060
aS"I think you've made your party of choice quite apparent."
p17061
aS'Imo David not showing up makes him look cowardly.'
p17062
aS'Yeah it did at the start, after this showing i feel strangely sorry for him. '
p17063
aS"That'd be a blunder, if they all attacked him so viciously that the electorate felt pity for Cameron and voted a Conservative majority."
p17064
aS"From what I can gather that's quite the vote-winner in Scotland"
p17065
aS'Agreed, the anti Tory rhetoric is starting to sound stupid.'
p17066
aS"Yes, will be interesting to see the polls after this - whether that's worked against them or not. "
p17067
aS"Would the audience reaction to Farage's comment not prove that he had a point?"
p17068
aS"I think so, I've been listening on radio and I noticed that Farage whenever he spoke got murmurs in the beginning and also only or two claps."
p17069
aS'He is reacting to what he perceives to be a biased audience I think.'
p17070
aS"That's just what the general population thinks of him, he is a pretty polarising figure."
p17071
aS'Well yes, I am just telling you what I think he might be thinking.'
p17072
aS'Literally every time he opens his mouth there is a murmur - have a good listen.'
p17073
aS'And when he finishes, one or two claps.'
p17074
aS'He must feel like he was set up.'
p17075
aS"I'm sure he knows he's a polarising figure..."
p17076
aS"I think he's just trying to play to his supporters, make it look like everyone is ganging up on UKIP."
p17077
aS"Dimbleby really doesn't want to talk to Farage anymore"
p17078
aS'Neighbouring Russia? '
p17079
aS'Neighbor to NATO is what I think he was referencing.'
p17080
aS'Oh come on \n\nAt least let Farage respond hahahahaha '
p17081
aS"As much as I like miliband here he's losing the battle against sturgeon which is the key one."
p17082
aS'As much as this debate has been very left wing the floating voters he might have persuaded will be more than offset by the erosion of the tradition Scottish labour backbone'
p17083
aS'What have the DUP been saying recently about a coalition?'
p17084
aS"I don't know, but would probably side with the Tories. "
p17085
aS'DUP  and UUP tories,SDLP  and Alliance Labour'
p17086
aS"Tories, as long as there's more funding for Norn Iron I believe"
p17087
aS'DUP are allied with the Conservatives IIRC.'
p17088
aS'OH Nigel Farage.'
p17089
aS'How I love your stupidity.'
p17090
aS"It's hilarious."
p17091
aS"What's a hung parliament? "
p17092
aS'A parliament full of massive cocks.'
p17093
aS'No party has a majority and two parties have to join forces to form a government.'
p17094
aS'Like what the current coalition did'
p17095
aS'When no party gets enough seats to have a majority in the House of Commons.'
p17096
aS'Oh fuck off sturgeon you would have reduced Scottish defence forces to nothing '
p17097
aS'Why would Scotland, a country of 5 million people, need a large defence force?'
p17098
aS"Because 'we need 2 support are respect our troops!!1!!!"
p17099
aS"'  - some people act like scaling down defence equals kicking soldiers in the face or something."
p17100
aS'To protect their haggis and irn-bru!'
p17101
aS"We'll call her Fanny."
p17102
aS'Her mam was a Fanny, her granny was a Fanny.'
p17103
aS'But she keeps speaking about the need for up scaling conventional defence forces'
p17104
aS'Because Scotland is the first thing Russia would hit after coming through the GIUK Gap?'
p17105
aS"You don't need to go through Scandinavia to get from Russia to the UK."
p17106
aS'You seriously think that Russia would invade Britain?'
p17107
aS'Moron. '
p17108
aS'No.'
p17109
aS'And no.'
p17110
aS'My understanding of military strategy and readiness is somewhat more nuanced than that.'
p17111
aS"But the point is a lot of people think of Scotland as being way up north, and you'd have to go up through England or up around Ireland to get to it."
p17112
aS"It's actually incredibly exposed to anyone coming through the GIUK gap from the Arctic Ocean and ultimately the Pacific."
p17113
aS'Because of the way Mercator maps project the earth, many people don\'t realise quite how close Russia/China/Alaska are to Iceland and Scotland\n\n"But it\'s all the way over East.'
p17114
aS'"\n\n"No, it\'s due North a little bit.'
p17115
aS'"\n\nLet\'s say it did all go tits up though, Scotland is where Russian nuclear bombers would arrive first.'
p17116
aS"It's in both their and the rUK's interests for them to have some semblance of a defence force to launch fighter jets and man SAM sites."
p17117
aS'You know, the very reason the fighter units at RAF Lossiemouth?'
p17118
aS'A Nigel meltdown only benefits the Tories.'
p17119
aS'Tinfoil hat time.'
p17120
aS'What if Nigel Farage is still working for the Tories...?'
p17121
aS'DUN DUN DUHHHHH.'
p17122
aS'To be honest, most UKIP supporters will probably agree with his comments about the BBC being left wing. '
p17123
aS'The BBC is impartial.'
p17124
aS'This means that left-wing people will think it is too right-wing and right-wing people will think it is too left-wing.'
p17125
aS"And there isn't a moderate right party there to balance it, so it looks biased."
p17126
aS'I wonder why that is Dave...'
p17127
aS'Shit.'
p17128
aS"You've found me."
p17129
aS'None of them are particularly inspiring, are they?'
p17130
aS'I mean, can you picture any of them being our leader on the world stage? '
p17131
aS'Nicola would be a very strong leader'
p17132
aS'Not really no.'
p17133
aS'The need for houses is down to immigration though, us Brits stopped having kids long ago, the same has happened all over the developed world.'
p17134
aS"It's not a bad thing we need a growing population of productive to help us pay for our aging population, better that than suffer Japanese like stagnation."
p17135
aS'People also live much longer now though - so many 3 or 4 bed homes might be taken up by older couples of individuals who bought the house, raised a family then the kids moved out.'
p17136
aS'Not saying we should turf old dears out of their family homes.'
p17137
aS"But it's not just immigrants.."
p17138
aS"Agreed, it's wrong to dismiss it though like Sturgeon and the others did. "
p17139
aS'Brits stopped having kids?'
p17140
aS'When did that happen?'
p17141
aS'All most all developed countries have, our birth rate is now pushed up by immigrants having children, which is not a bad thing.'
p17142
aS"Better tell my nephew he isn't British then..."
p17143
aS'Why?'
p17144
aS"I'm being facetious, darling."
p17145
aS'So Farage thinks we share a border with Russia now.'
p17146
aS'we effectively do militarily in nato'
p17147
aS'Militarily.'
p17148
aS"Maybe Farage thinks Nicola Sturgeon is Soviet Russian because she's so far left of him that in his eyes she might as well be Communist."
p17149
aS"Go due north from the UK, take a right - it's right there."
p17150
aS"That'd be the reason Faslane is where it is - easy access to the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap, which is how the Russian Navy accesses the Atlantic."
p17151
aS"It's also why Russian bombers generally appear off Scotland - because they can take off from Murmansk and skirt around the outside of Scandinavian air space, accessing the UK via international airspace rather than having to fly across Finland/Sweden/Norway."
p17152
aS'Nigel Farage makes me sick.'
p17153
aS'Seconded.'
p17154
aS"I didn't realise that the far left parties get an unlimited budget."
p17155
aS"I don't support Farage or Miliband but at least they're sensible with money."
p17156
aS'Far left parties?'
p17157
aS"Just said that to be clear I wasn't talking about labour"
p17158
aS'Still not far left.'
p17159
aS"It's a difficult advantage to counter"
p17160
aS"Ed stop saying you plan balance the budget, you don't."
p17161
aS"It's nice to see Farage getting hammered, but those voters will go Tory."
p17162
aS"It's a benefit to Cameron to see Farage get destroyed. "
p17163
aS"Took Farage all of five seconds to mention immigrants, he's slipping a bit"
p17164
aS"I think there's enough pressure in that area already love..."
p17165
aS"I wished the host pressed Ed Miliband on the coalition question that he still didn't answer properly."
p17166
aS'"The host"?'
p17167
aS"He's called DIMBLEBY."
p17168
aS'Wish someone would challenge the regional leaders and Greens on trident - where exactly does 100 billion come from?'
p17169
aS'The most conservative estimates I have heard have been around 30 billion.'
p17170
aS'The entire programme went: Bash Cameron -&gt; Bash Farage -&gt; Bash Miliband.'
p17171
aS'Farage was really on the ropes but Miliband controlled himself well.'
p17172
aS'I believe the \xc2\xa3100 billion figure comes from the CND, and is the total cost over its lifetime.'
p17173
aS'They *would* overestimate the cost, but the government *would* underestimate the cost, and the MoD have gotten these kinds of things wrong so many times before.'
p17174
aS'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32236184\n\n&gt; So how do critics of nuclear weapons get to a total figure of \xc2\xa3100bn?'
p17175
aS'&gt; That includes the cost of running and servicing the submarines over a projected 40-year lifespan.'
p17176
aS'&gt; The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) has arrived at the round \xc2\xa3100bn figure by two routes.'
p17177
aS"One is to take the MoD's stated intention to spend 5-6% of its defence budget on running its nuclear deterrent."
p17178
aS'&gt; CND estimates that at \xc2\xa32bn to \xc2\xa32.4bn per year, and multiplies by 40 - though, of course, defence budgets can go up or come down.'
p17179
aS'&gt; The different approach is a breakdown of costs.'
p17180
aS'CND estimates \xc2\xa357bn in running costs, plus \xc2\xa313bn to decommission the submarines and weapons in the 2060s.'
p17181
aS'&gt; Add to that the upper end of estimates for building the submarines, at \xc2\xa326bn, and another \xc2\xa31bn for conventional military forces to protect them.'
p17182
aS'&gt; CND also adds more than \xc2\xa33bn for the cost of upgrading nuclear warheads and then replacing them in the 2030s.'
p17183
aS'&gt; That amount is disputed, because the MoD says the warhead and missile replacement costs are included in its overall procurement budget.'
p17184
aS'So the figure just comes from a campaign for nuclear disarmament.'
p17185
aS"Still surprised at why Ed/Farage didn't pick up on it."
p17186
aS'Thanks for clarifying it.\n'
p17187
aS'I wondered that as well,  saw it on the beeb earlier this week though.'
p17188
aS'Labour or Tory manifesto maybe?'
p17189
aS'Overused joke, not having it mate, sorry.'
p17190
aS'Pretty sure I was seeing this joke on Facebook back in 2012.'
p17191
aS"And here's me thinking I was funny and original... :/"
p17192
aS'Hypocritical Miliband talking about broken promises on tuition fees...'
p17193
aS'so why does labour seem so against a coalition with the other lefties?'
p17194
aS'Large parties always rule out coalitions near an election.'
p17195
aS"Because labour want a majority and they won't admit otherwise"
p17196
aS'hmm.'
p17197
aS"I guess they're trying to get the people on the fence to not vote for smaller parties"
p17198
aS'Because the majority of votes are in the centre and they know their long term future is best served doing a deal with the centrist lib-dems, not by being pulled toward the far left.'
p17199
aS"For all the people rag on New Labour's strategy of stealing the centre from the Tories it made them electable."
p17200
aS'They know this. '
p17201
aS"I recorded so I could fast forward through Milliband's speeches, his lack of personality really shines through compared to the other participants."
p17202
aS"Milliband's bits are actually pretty good."
p17203
aS'He seems to have gained a personality.'
p17204
aS'Found the Conservative, guys. '
p17205
aS'Voted Labour, Labour, Labour, Lib Dem, Lib Dem in previous general elections. '
p17206
aS"Either way, you should take a leaf out of Thatcher's book."

aS'"Listen to *what* I\'m saying rather than how I\'m saying it.'

aS'I fully understand why Labour lost their seat.'

p17227
aS"It's a fairly safe Tory seat but LD weren't that far behind in 2010."
p17228
aS"I was surprised when I went back through my constituency's history how close we were to a LD MP in 2001: it was 0.6 %points."
p17229
aS"I honestly don't think I had even heard of the party back then (I was still a kid though so didn't need to pay that much attention)"

aS'I would like to like him, but is he not clearly entirely incompetent?'
p17234
aS'What he has done is destroy his up and coming party that were a vote for hope of change in 2010, I am not even sure how he thought this was going to go?'
p17235
aS'They had 48% of the student votes (now 15%) and decided to just fuck over students and young future students, what did he think was going to happen?'
p17236
aS"The same is with the AV vote, you don't call a referendum on an issue you are going to lose, you make it so you are likely to win then get the referendum, it is just utter incompetence, especially when you take the fact he must of used up a pretty big bargaining chip to get that vote, which could have been used for something else, maybe not raising tuition fees."
p17237
aS"Though he seems the most normal of the bunch, he also seem like a terrible politician, I was going to say that is the problem with the whole system, you have to be a politician to play the game so only career politicians are any good at it, they have the experience after all, but that is a bunch of crap, you have to be a strategist, Nick Clegg would have been fine with a competent strategy, he didn't have one.  "
p17238
aS'he fucked the students over only if you look at top level naming and I agree you can\'t sign an "iron clad" pledge then renege on that unfortunatly.'
p17239
aS'The actual student deal tehy got was much more like a graduate tax and acutally much better than before or waht tories had planned  (under the new terms you pay less as a % of wages and are much more likily not to pay it all back).'
p17240
aS'Unfortuanlty it wcould not be sold as such and had to be voted for by cable who put it together.'
p17241
aS'They really were between a rock and a hard place.'
p17242
aS'The news fees actually charge most students less in actual repayments than the old system, and only the wealthy graduates pay more.'
p17243
aS'What we got is a graduate tax in all but name, but the newspapers were too keen to jump on the "GRrr traitor" bandwagon, rather than actually looking at the actual implications of the new system.'
p17244
aS"What students actually *need* at the moment is an increase to the maintenance loan, as rents are spiralling high and it's getting impossible to make ends meet."
p17245
aS'Lowering the fees only changes how soon wealthy graduates get to stop paying graduate tax, which is actually a regressive policy, yet Labour are pushing for tax cuts to well-off 40 year old graduates.'
p17246
aS'I think Nick Clegg did a good job of what he actually achieved.'
p17247
aS'But a bad job of communicating it to the public.'

aS'let him act like a child if he cant debate for shit, people will see it for what it is.'
p17287
aS"It's not that he can't debate for shit it's that the ruling party has actually had responsibility for 5 years and as such it's easy to criticise them, the ruling party has a hell of a lot to lose and not that much to gain from debates."

p17534
aS"That's a lot."
p17535
aS"Leaving the EU, and judging from UKIP's rational, potentially groups such as the OSCE and the EEC, would hugely impact our economy."
p17536
aS"Sure, you can show that we'd stop paying into organisations such as these and save money, but compared to the benefits we'd lose, these savings would be nothing."
p17537
aS'This is just considering the immediate impact, the long term effects on trade could easily ruin our country - never mind the impact on the rest of Europe.'
p17538
aS'Education:\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of people from the EU studying in the UK.'
p17539
aS'Without them, we would have a shortage of students unless entry requirements, and costs dropped.'
p17540
aS'This would lead to extra funding being required for universities, either from the government, private funds, or other students.'
p17541
aS'Leaving the EU and linked institutions would make it harder to study in the UK as someone from the EU by far.'
p17542
aS"These immigrants are a huge boon to our country, and losing them would have an effect - though not as large as some of the others - on our country as a whole: We'd have less professionals, as well as less funding for the universities."
p17543
aS'This also goes the other way.'
p17544
aS"Say you're a student, and want to go to one of the many amazing universities in Europe; your choice would be more limited unless you were rich enough to pay extra."
p17545
aS"This would cause an increase in competition for places in universities here for certain, and probably lead to more people studying in institutions that aren't as good as the ones they could have been."
p17546
aS'Possibly less important to you, but the European social fund and other Structural funds:\n\nLots of the developments to the poorest parts of the country have come from Europe.'

aS'Without it, there are huge investments in my part of the world that would never have been made, and local economies and outlooks would be even further down the drain.'
p17548
aS'International politics:\n\nHow do you think the rest of the world would react to us leaving the EU?'
p17549
aS"It sure as hell wouldn't look good to them... A rich, powerful country, leaving an international institution which has had huge benefits for it's members... How could we be trusted then?"
p17550
aS"Long term impact:\n\nMore independence as a country (no meddling European laws favouring British dairies, improving trade links, allowing population movement between countries), absolute hammer blow our economy, increased cost for students, worry for businesses and fiscal institutions (no one's quite sure what effect leaving the EU would have on exchange rates, interest rates and the like) leading to a decreased likelihood of investment or any economic risk taking."
p17551
aS"If we left the EU, and carried on making the UK independent, we would find ourselves more and more well...independent, and there's no way that any country could exist as ours does today without integration with the world around it."
p17552
aS"Even if you disagree with all of this (which is fair enough, I haven't supplied the sources - though they are mostly UK government, with some EU and UN ones, as well as one or two independent studies), and think that the EU is completely broken and of no benefit to us, how on earth could you improve the EU whilst not being a part of it?"
p17553
aS"Assuming you don't want to cut all ties with Europe, the only options are between reforming and maintaining the status quo, one of which UKIP is arguing against, and the other would be impossible if we did leave the EU."

aS"&gt; You don't lose anything desirable\n\nTo you maybe, but given the clear evidence of EU migration and their benefit to economy most disagree."

aS'If you look at ALL EU immigrants its clear they adding to our economy.'

p17584
aS"I'd disagree."
p17585
aS'Some have a shared language with us - hugely different dialects, generally with poorer understanding as well - but other than that we generally share more in culture with western European  countries.'
p17586
aS'Politically, economic and yes, even culturally, we are more similar to the Netherlands than Barbados for example.'
p17587
aS"As an English speaker, you'd definitely be able to talk to more Dutch people than Barbadian people (not an issue for me, but languages seem to have been thrown around as an issue loads by people who are anti-immigration/xenophobic on some level)."

p17598
aS'It was a deliberate policy decision.'
p17599
aS'I was under the impression there were *some* warnings, but it was underestimated.'
p17600
aS'The fact places like Germany had controls made it worse for us as instead of going to Germany they came here.'
p17601
aS'Some people think it was a conspiracy in that Labour wanted them to come here to import automatic Labour voters, which of course is absurd.'
p17602
aS'There were serious warnings and organisations like migration watch gave out calculations.'
p17603
aS'The trouble with your "absurd" claim is the labour quote "rub the right\'s nose in diversity".'
p17604
aS"I am not sure what Migration Watch's figures were, I believe even they underestimated it."
p17605
aS"Although to be fair, they aren't the most reliable source as they are a lobbying group which could lead to them being ignored."

p17925
aS"It may well be me the case, though I'm not aware of any rules in place to stop the other parties from talking about parties not present at the debate - so I think it's fair game. "
p17926
aS'I guess that would fall on the shoulders of the person leading the debate since they are in charge of keeping them in check in addition to them most likely being briefed on what they cannot say (They each have 4 other people to discredit on the debate than to collectively circlejerk in hatred of Cameron).'
p17927
aS'In my eyes, if Miliband says something like "We will introduce policy X, which the current government retracted" that would be fair but "Cameron is an old Etonian prick who hates poor people and wants to sell off the NHS" shouldn\'t be allowed.'

p17952
aS"The issue isn't that Cameron is an Etonian posh boy, it's whether he uses his power to attempt to introduce laws to benefit his old Eton mates."
p17953
aS"That's the salient point here, and the one that Labour were trying to make."
p17954
aS"That's certainly useful for Miliband."
p17955
aS'The worry is that appearing alongside the minor parties diminishes his credibility on a superficial level.'
p17956
aS"I think it's less of a concern than might be suggested that he's debating with parties to his political left, particularly given the SNP and Plaid are regional; they're unlikely to inflict more damage on Labour than they already have."
p17957
aS'The more damaging political swing is Labour voters turning Tory.'
p17958
aS'So if anything Miliband being to the right of the SNP, Plaid and the Greens might warm some Tory voters to Labour.'

aS"A strange kind of [non-remark from the BBC's Election 2015 site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32326557):\n\n&gt;**Why aren't David Cameron and Nick Clegg taking part?"
p18033
aS"**\n\n&gt;That's open to interpretation."
p18034
aS'&gt;The final schedule of pre-election debates came after weeks of wrangling between the political parties and the broadcasters over the timing and line-up.'
p18035
aS'Mr Cameron rejected the first proposal because it did not include the Greens.'
p18036
aS'The revised version was published last month.'
p18037
aS'&gt;The BBC said the broadcasters had "worked hard" to offer audiences "the best possible combination of programmes to help them engage with the election, to inform them about the issues and to scrutinise the politicians".'
p18038
aS'All sides in the negotiations had made "compromises", the corporation said, adding that "ensuring due impartiality is not only a priority, but an obligation".'
p18039
aS'Open to interpretation?'
p18040
aS'Huh.'
p18041
aS"They sort of failed to answer their own question didn't they?"
p18042
aS"I would guess the 'impartiality' is the key point."
p18043
aS"If Clegg is there he gets shat on by the others for being part of Government who then in-turn shits over Cameron since he's in charge, like what happened with the 7 party debate."
p18044
aS"By having only the 'opposition' parties the focus should be based about why they would be better than the current government and since they, bar UKIP, are fairly politically similar would offer a better chance to say why they are better than the others."
p18045
aS"As someone who is most like going to vote tory, I'm looking most forward to this debate because the other leaders won't/shouldn't be spending the whole time bashing Dave and focussing on policy."
p18046
aS"If we must have these 'debates' I feel it should be all the parties involved but I'd rather not have them at all because its just 2 hours of soundbites and name-calling which I grew out of around age 5."
p18047
aS"It'll be because the person writing the content for the website isn't one of the executives making the decision, and will be just as annoyed about it as anyone else."
p18048
aS'Basically "we can\'t tell you"'
p18049
aS'My view is that he has everything to lose and nothing to gain by putting himself on the same level as minor parties.'
p18050
aS"He's already done the job of PM and he can be judged on that record without having to put himself in the ring with politicians who can say anything because they've no chance of being PM."
p18051
aS"I'm not saying I like Cameron or anything, but in his position I'd do the same."
p18052
aS'The debates seem pointless without him and Milliband becomes the target. '
p18053
aS"And, to be fair, he's already done one."
p18054
aS"It's not as though he's refused to do *any*."
p18055
aS"I'm not sure why the broadcasters want 4, but Cameron does actually have a country to run."
p18056
aS"Parliament may have dissolved, but the cabinet *hasn't*."
p18057
aS"He's running a national election campaign, his own personal constituency campaign, and oh yes - the country."
p18058
aS"Odds are he would not participate in more than one hustings or candidate's debate in his constituency, so it seems reasonable that the Leaders would also have one debate."
p18059
aS'As it is, we\'ve ended up with one full 7-Leader debate, a "Challenger\'s" debate, and then two programmes which Cameron is participating in where he, Milliband and Clegg (in one of the two) answer questions without debating head-to-head.'
p18060
aS'That seems to me to be a pretty comprehensive programme of events for them.'
p18061
aS'The challengers get to distinguish themselves from one another as well as getting to debate the incumbents.'
p18062
aS"The election campaign is the 'interview'."
p18063
aS"We're electing a party and their policies."
p18064
aS'Since when did these pathetic TV debates start become such an integral part of electioneering?'
p18065
aS'I think there\'s a valid argument you could make against these TV debates, but David Cameron previously praised them and said it was good for democracy\n\nThen this election, it\'s all "my way or the high way".'
p18066
aS'He begrudgingly agreed to one (not before getting the Greens on board to tip things in his favour), and then rejected everything else.'
p18067
aS'I think Labour are 100% correct to call him out on it.'
p18068
aS'He only wants to do the debates if it looks like it will work in his favour, which is just nonsense.'
p18069
aS"He only got the Greens involved after UKIP's inclusion tipped things in Labour's favour, and many would argue that the only nonsense would be to do something that's not in your favour when you don't have to."
p18070
aS"Ed Miliband will of course contend that Cameron not doing more than one TV debate is important, but it's really not. "
p18071
aS'No, the nonsense is not stepping up to the plate when *every* single other party is.'
p18072
aS'Gordon Brown did 3 debates in 2010, and that was without all the silly demands.'
p18073
aS"Cameron was happy then wasn't he?"
p18074
aS'And now... Well it all speaks for itself. '
p18075
aS'If you think any of these parties are "stepping up to the plate" out of principle and not out of political calculation, then I have a bridge I\'d like to sell you.'
p18076
aS'Gordon Brown did the TV debates because he thought his campaign might benefit, end of.'
p18077
aS"The debates aren't mandatory and the broadcasters have set them up primarily to generate drama and news ratings."
p18078
aS"Given that, I don't really see why a nakedly self-serving political calculation that one should *not* take part is any more deplorable than a nakedly self-serving political calculation that one *should*."
p18079
aS"I'd like to see well-organised, informative tv debates made a part of our elections, but for that to happen they need to be overseen by something like the Electoral Commission."
p18080
aS"For now, the whole thing is a circus and I don't see anything particularly wrong with Cameron refusing to go along with it if he doesn't think it helps him."
p18081
aS'Cameron specifically said they were good for democracy last time.'
p18082
aS"But I guess he doesn't care about what's good for democracy this time."
p18083
aS'As I said, *none* of them care about what is good for democracy so much as what is good for them.'
p18084
aS"Incidentally, Cameron's position now is not wholly inconsistent with his claim that tv debates are good for democracy, he still did a debate and would no doubt argue that he would have done more had they been organised differently."
p18085
aS"Again, I don't see why people are surprised that he is seeking his own advantage when that is what they are all doing. "
p18086
aS'The key difference is that there is no evidence of it for other leaders.'
p18087
aS'DC has been specifically caught saying one thing, then doing another.'
p18088
aS"So you can make accusations about other leaders based on your opinion, but there is clear evidence about Cameron's position."
p18089
aS'His posturing and blockades about the debates only as to that position.'
p18090
aS'Since 2010 when they first happened and were considered a success.'
p18091
aS"A good opportunity for the general public, who often don't take much interest in politics, to see the major leaders argue against one another and outside the public school farce of PMQs."
p18092
aS'* \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is great we are having these debates and I hope they go someway to restore some of the faith and some of the trust into our politics because we badly need that once again in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Cameron, Leaders Debate, ITV, 15 April 2010\n\n* \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling for these debates for five years, I challenged Blair, I challenged Brown, I challenged when I was ahead in the polls, and when I was behind in the polls.'

aS'I can\'t stand the TV interview format, and the aftermath you always end up with "X looked weird, Y was so nervous!'

aS'" stuff.'
p18102
aS"Leave that to 'reality' TV and keep the election about party politics, not who the leader is."
p18103
aS"I'd rather a disheveled and hardworking politician than a shiny, ready for TV media machine. "
p18104
aS'Its a shame that the TV debates are so poor, because a political debate on TV, which is incredibly accessible, could be a powerful democratic tool.'
p18105
aS"However, quite simply, the quality of the debates are disastrously poor, but that's electioneering and politics in general, lack of honesty, lack of transparency and lack of accountability."
p18106
aS'This year it seems.'
p18107
aS'I like them though.'
p18108
aS'because america'

p18110
aS'America had them well before that.'
p18111
aS"Part of the reason for Kennedy's success over Nixon was that Kennedy had stage makeup applied so that he didn't visibly sweat on camera under the studio lights."
p18112
aS"Wasn't that also the debate where people who listened in on radio thought Nixon did better because they hadn't been influenced by Kennedy's demeanor and charisma like those who watched it on TV?"
p18113
aS'Look at how the current election campaign is being run, its how they do it across the pond.'
p18114
aS"Remember everyone talking about how 'Obama' was a closet Muslim and what not?"
p18115
aS"Well here we get soundbites about Miliband and his inability to eat a bacon sandwich and Daves 'punchable face'."
p18116
aS'And that has a grand total of nothing to do with the debates'
p18117
aS'If people want them they should exist'
p18118
aS'... and they do exist.'
p18119
aS'Whats the point your making?'
p18120
aS'Is this available on YouTube like the previous two have been?'
p18121
aS'iplayer.'
p18122
aS'I think given Camerons actually surprisingly "okay" performance in the other two debates, he might be silently regretting not signing up to a third opportunity to hold his ground... having said that I guess it was damage control in-case the other debates went horribly wrong for him.'
p18123
aS"I suspect though that this won't drastically change the situation."
p18124
aS'There is a definite case of *"Debate Fatigue"* by this stage and I doubt the viewing numbers will be as good as the previous debates.'
p18125
aS'He\'s probably already been as "hurt" by his no-show as much as he is going to from the extensive media coverage before the event.'
p18126
aS"The only real harm that can come to him tonight is from people criticizing him in a forum he can't react to... but given that 4 out of the 5 people there are leftwingers I think that position might be fairly redundant."
p18127
aS'I doubt (m)any people are going to, for example, vote Labour as a result of this debate instead of Tory.'
p18128
aS'I think the real damage from this might be to heap on the pain for the liberal democrats... their voter share according to polls has plummeted since 2010 and Clegg, as technically incumbent, has been excluded from this debate.'
p18129
aS'So far he has completely failed to revive the "cleggmania" of the debates in 2010, and this is now a missed opportunity to defend his party against the challengers that have emerged on the left... since UKIP don\'t seem to be seriously challenging the conservatives at this stage (although the potential role of UKIP in denying the Tories of seats they would otherwise have won remains to be seen).'
p18130
aS'I thought though that Dave had ruled himself out?'
p18131
aS"Cameron thinks so little of his chances he didn't bother turning up."
p18132
aS'In all seriousness I think it was a calculated risk on the Tories part.'
p18133
aS'Remember before these debates their only other experience of televised debates was in 2010 when the ensuing "Cleggmania" caused a last minute lib dem swing which at one stage even looked like it could land Cleggs party in power (and ultimately sort of did).'
p18134
aS'The other two leaders (Brown and Cameron) failed to connect with voters in this format.'
p18135
aS"Cameron will know that he's not a particularly dynamic politician infront of the TV cameras in the sense that say Boris Johnson is."
p18136
aS'His only saving grace is that his adversary Ed Miliband is about as [photogenic as ermagherd](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/275/927/c4b.jpg).'
p18137
aS'So I think the Tories took the risk that they would appear in the debates but water down the format and limit the damage incase they came across poorly.'
p18138
aS"Now in retrospect they actually haven't performed too badly and I suspect that they might secretly be regretting not just signing up to it - but at the end of the day 2 months ago they didn't know that."
p18139
aS"As much as people are criticizing Cameron for this, it's worth remembering that his parties watering-down of the format so he comes across better and the inclusion of the SNP/Plaid (at Labours expense in Scotland and Wales) has actually been a pretty big victory for him."
p18140
aS'He could have been up on screen against just Miliband... which would have been pretty tough given that the tories have built their campaign on *"don\'t vote for miliband because he\'s an awkward fuck"* which would quickly fall apart if Miliband comes across better than people expect - which he probably has (if only slightly). '
p18141
aS"I imagine it's more that he fancies his chances so much he doesn't see the point in showing up."
p18142
aS"I'd suggest the opposite, they're being questioned on all sorts of things, the NHS budget, the welfare cuts, and they're just holding out in the hope people won't keep asking and they'll make it to the election without having to tell us all how they're planning to fuck most of the country to help out the rich again."
p18143
aS"I'm pretty sure Cameron will be questioned on all those things in the two shows where he is answering questions with Milliband and Clegg (but not debating)."
p18144
aS'He was also grilled in the debate he did participate in.'
p18145
aS'To be honest, the notion of a "Challenger\'s Debate" is not a bad one since 3/5 of the parties all talk a pretty much identical speech (and the other two are a bit batshit).'
p18146
aS"Nice to see them having to differentiate themselves from *each other* rather than just trying to argue why they're better than the Tories, which doesn't help you to decide who to vote *for* if it *isn't* the Tories!"
p18147
aS"I bloody hope so, welfare's very important for millions, but it seems to have been pretty much ignored by all but the Greens."
p18148
aS"I guess, as someone currently off with mental health stuff, and an occasional volunteer in the community centre, I do see the results of the welfare 'reforms' and so to me it's a top issue, not the economy or immigration."
p18149
aS"It's kind of annoying that the Greens seem to be the only ones willing to pledge to stop screwing those at the bottom, just because it's been made popular with the electorate."
p18150
aS"I'd also suggest it's why Iain Duncan Smith and his people have been VERY quiet in the last month or so, because they really don't want to remind any voters that they exist while the focus is on the economy,immigration and the NHS."

aS"&gt; Your Honor, I feel so confident of Marge Simpson's guilt that I can waste the court's time by rating the super hunks."

aS'Miliband is applying.'
p18154
aS'Cameron is *re*applying.'
p18155
aS'The problem with that analogy is quite simple.'
p18156
aS'I applied for my job, got interviewed and then got the job.'
p18157
aS'If I was asked to interview again, for the same job (without any promotion or change) then I would question it.'
p18158
aS"I do agree that Cameron should be there, but you can see why he isn't, he has little to gain and a lot to lose."
p18159
aS'A job with a fixed term contract can often require you to re interview/re apply at the of the contract'
p18160
aS'Yep, I know a few people who teach and they have had to reapply for their job for the last 3 summers (along with everyone in their schools).'
p18161
aS'If you went into the job knowing that in a few years you\'d have to compete again with other people for the same job, effectively hitting re-set on the position, then you\'d be incredibly stupid to "question it" and your employers would have every right to give you a hard time about it as it shows either arrogance, stupidity or cowardice.'
p18162
aS"Also, you're leaving yourself open to being criticised by the other candidates for the job, who can now effectively spout any old bullshit about you, and you won't be there to defend yourself."
p18163
aS"Surely that's worse than not doing a great job of defending yourself."
p18164
aS'To be fair, he didn\'t really "get the job".'
p18165
aS'He just happened to be in charge of the Tory party during a hung parliament. '
p18166
aS"If we're using the interview analogy anyway it should apply to the whole party and the whole election campaign period, rather than just one person on one TV program."
p18167
aS'In this thread: People are incredibly naive to the realities of politics... and are writing off what has actually been a strategic victory for Cameron - in so much as he successfully pressured the TV companies and the other parties into changing the format to benefit him (by watering down his own air-time) at the expense of Labour, who have had to compete on the left with 3 other left-wing parties, particularly the SNP who have arguably done very well out of it... hardly at their own guise either, their success has been because Cameron facilitated them being on screen next to Miliband, which can only hurt Miliband.'
p18168
aS'If anything I think it shows Cameron can be a fairly shrewd political operator at times. '
p18169
aS"I don't get why you are being downvoted for making a good point."

p18179
aS"I imagine with his money and connections he could go to the next level and get even more reputable doctors to compromise their intergrity, there's enough element of doubt that a doctor can't be accused of blatant fraud just like in the Ernest Saunders case."

p18533

p18538
aS'So build new social houses &amp; remove right to buy?'
p18539
aS"Those houses wouldn't be for new immigrants but I don't see why long term immigrants should be disadvantaged over nationals when they pay tax the same as we do (actually they pay more per capita but yea)."
p18540
aS"I also don't think we lack space to build new houses on a nationwide level."
p18541
aS"I think it's problematic in some parts of the country &amp; we need to redistribute our population better to solve this housing crisis in the long term (or yes the SE will become like Tokyo)."
p18542
aS'We can do that by being less London centric &amp; investing more in the other regions so that those areas experience more growth, more jobs, and so more people want to live there.'
p18543
aS"I know London is a net contributor but I'd like to see that number increase even further. "

p18549
aS"You have to solve it by building new houses as well though, existing housing stock isn't enough to cope with our increasing population."
p18550
aS"This is especially the case at the moment because ever since the financial crisis the number of new houses being built by private contractors has dropped dramatically yet our population growth hasn't really decreased."
p18551

p18999
aS'!'
aS'The [BBC Trust actually made an effort to change this last year](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10944629/BBC-staff-told-to-stop-inviting-cranks-on-to-science-programmes.html).'
p19000
aS'Where to start?'
p19001
aS'Firstly, the BBC do not "always have some bozo on denying climate change in the name of fairness and balance" perhaps 10 years ago they did, but these days its rare.'
p19002
aS'Secondly, proportional to what?'
p19003
aS'If you look at the 2010 general election, UKIP got 3% of the vote and 0 MPs.'
p19004
aS'The Green Party got .9% of the vote.'
p19005
aS"Let's make our first assumption and assume by proportional we mean proportional to the number of votes cast in the last election, rather than the number of seats held."
p19006
aS"That means of course than any new party can never get any coverage, but setting that aside\n\nLet's take the 90 minute debate between all the candidates."
p19007
aS"That would mean that Nigel Farage would get 2.5 minutes to talk, compared David Cameron's 29 minutes and the Greens would get 53 seconds."
p19008
aS'Does that sound like a healthy way to conduct a democratic process?'
p19009
aS'Aha!'
p19010
aS'you might say "that\'s so dumb - clearly you should take into consideration, more recent polling and at least give smaller parties enough airtime to set out their broad policies so that voters are aware of them".'
p19011
aS"And I'd agree with you - and I think that's what the BBC attempts."
p19012
aS"But it isn't proportional, it tends to even out the time given to different views."
p19013
aS'Because debate over different *views* of how the economy and social systems should be run is nothing *like* having a debate on climate change, where objectively much of the science is settled.'
p19014
aS'I did mention floors and ceilings on exposure.'
p19015
aS"So no, I wouldn't expect Cameron to get 29 minutes compares to 53 Green seconds."
p19016
aS'But at very least a 3:1 or 4:1 ratio seems sensible.'
p19017
aS"I'm not just talking about debates - I am talking about wider coverage. "
p19018
aS"And I would guess that if you looked at the ratios that the BBC devotes to - say - the Conservative manifesto, compared with, say UKIP you're probably looking at that kind of ratio."
p19019
aS'Why?'
p19020
aS"It still doesn't seem all that democratic?"
p19021
aS"It's good that all options are being covered."
p19022
aS'It changes people like the greens and ukip so they are not only reserved for protest votes and actually offer something different (Albiet not so much).'
p19023
aS"I wouldn't vote if I only knew about labour, conservatives and lib dems."
p19024
aS"There wouldn't be any point in voting if we didn't have difference and options. "
p19025
aS"In the last year or so they have shifted BBC policy towards climate change, so they don't need to represent the views of those who deny it any more."
p19026
aS'This is the inherent problem with trying to be unbiased really.'
p19027
aS"I wouldn't say they covered all the manifestos equally, but they mentioned them all."
p19028
aS'They were cricitised for being "too" impartial with climate change recently, they were creating false balance by giving too much airtime to cranks.'
p19029
aS'The BBC Trust instructed them to stop. '
p19030
aS"I think it's fair that the media assumes every party has the same chance even if that's not the case."
p19031
aS"Otherwise you're just giving into the two party political mindset which isn't healthy for democracy."
p19032
aS'Though In reality you probably have to draw the line at 5% of the popular vote to avoid discussing the minor parties like the BNP or the Pirate Party at length'
p19033
aS"&gt; I think it's fair that the media assumes every party has the same chance even if that's not the case\n\nWhy would you assume something you know doesn't hold true?"
p19034
aS"I'm not saying giving small parties just their proportional amount (i.e."
p19035
aS'the Greens would only get 1% or whatever of the Tories) - there can be an upper / lower bound. '
p19036
aS'I think the more a party is talked about the more likely someone is to vote for that party.'
p19037
aS"If you only report on 2 or 3 parties because they are the only ones people traditionally vote for you're simply creating a self-fulfilling prophecy"
p19038
aS"What about the 20 million that didn't vote who don't want to hear about the election."
p19039
aS'Should we reduce our current coverage down to 60% so that it is more representative?'
p19040
aS'I suspect that much less than 60% of TV news is election related.'
p19041
aS"I don't know."
p19042
aS"Feels like it's all they talk about at the moment. "
p19043
aS'Because Green Surge LOL'
p19044
aS'Sorry but I completely disagree.'
p19045
aS'The BBC has disappointed me recently and has shown some pretty clear bias toward certain parties.'
p19046
aS"I swear it's something like 1 in 10 articles is UKIP coverage."
p19047
aS'And a shamefully small amount of Green party coverage, despite the greens having far more members. '
p19048
aS'Party members are meaningless.'
p19049
aS'What matters is the number of potential seats, and to a lesser extent, votes.'
p19050
aS'The Greens will most likely hold their one seat, they claim that they might get three but the odds of that are slim.'
p19051
aS'UKIP on the other hand have two MPs already and have a reasonable chance of extending that to around five or so.'
p19052
aS'It might not happen, or they might get more.'
p19053
aS'When UKIP consistently poll three times the amount of the greens then surely they deserve more coverage?'
p19054
aS'At least 10% of coverage given that they poll around 15%.'
p19055
aS'The greens will likely remain a one-MP fringe group as far as cold electoral arithmetic goes.'
p19056
aS'For the record I support neither the greens nor UKIP.'
p19057
aS"I just think you're being unduly harsh on the BBC. \n"
p19058
aS'Too much of the same idea makes politics stale.'
p19059
aS"Giving all parties the same coverage and letting the public vote is more fair as more coverage shouldn't equate to more votes."
p19060
aS'Coverage should help inform the voters on who they are voting for rather than just who they should vote for. '
p19061
aS'I agree in principle, but where do you draw the line?'
p19062
aS'Just parties with MPs?'
p19063
aS'That would be twelve.'
p19064
aS"Plus there's a fair few independent MPs to consider."
p19065
aS'All the parties running?'
p19066
aS'Too many to count.'
p19067
aS"Obviously you can cram all that information into a newspaper or a website, but if it's the BBC six o'clock news when you only have half an hour to play with (and not all for politics), sacrifices are going to have to be made."
p19068
aS"People want to hear about the parties that will affect them by taking power or influencing policy, not George Galloway's latest exploits for example. "
p19069
aS'I think the content of what they do choose to broadcast during the six o clock news should be reproached.'
p19070
aS'It does a fantastic job at not holding anyone to account. '
p19071
aS'&gt; 1 in 10 articles is UKIP coverage\n\nvs 9 in 10 on r/UnitedKingdom.\n\n'
p19072
aS'Right?!'
p19073
aS'The place you expect it least.'
p19074
aS"I literally don't think I've ever seen anyone put a positive spin on UKIP on here; the articles are all posted on here as a platform to call them racist and shit rather than big them up."
p19075
aS"Maybe that's because they are racist."
p19076
aS'And shit.'
p19077
aS"If a racist person votes for Labour that doesn't make the party racist."
p19078
aS"Likewise if a Labour MP holds racist views it doesn't make the Labour party racist."
p19079
aS"The party's policies define whether the party is racist or not."
p19080
aS'For example, Diane Abbot is a massive racist, yet the Labour party does not have racist policies.'
p19081
aS'&gt; Diane Abbot is a massive racist\n\nAny examples?'
p19082
aS'Genuinely curious.'
p19083
aS"Look under 'Political Controversies'\r\rhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Abbott\r\r"
p19084
aS"Nothing there says to me she's a massive Racist, just some poor taste comments."
p19085
aS'Would you settle for massive?'
p19086
aS'That is very true.'
p19087
aS'I retract my accusation that they are a racist party.'
p19088
aS'They are merely a party that appears to disproportionately attract racists in their membership and candidates.'
p19089
aS'I strongly stand by my statement that they are shit though.'
p19090
aS"They do attract a huge amount of racists as they are the only party that would 'keep the Pakis out', however the policy they are promoting is par for the course and almost every non-EU country as a similar variation."
p19091
aS"If the EU would allow boarder controls (which it won't) the racists could be more equally distributed."
p19092
aS'As for them being shit, that is a perfectly legitimate view.'
p19093
aS"I didn't say they weren't."
p19094
aS'But I thought it was worth pointing out the obvious that all of the coverage of UKIP on here is overwhelmingly negative.\n'
p19095
aS'&gt; And a shamefully small amount of Green party coverage, despite the greens having far more members.'
p19096
aS"There are, of course, other measurements of how relevant a party is beyond how many party members it has, which generally don't put the Greens on the same level as UKIP."
p19097
aS"Consider elected representatives, for example (where a percentage is shown in brackets, that's the percentage of the vote that party got in the most recent relevant non by-election - so 2010 General Election, 2014 European election, etc):\n\nPosition | UKIP | Green\n----|----|----\nMP (in the last parliament) | 2 (3.1%) | 1 (0.9%)\nMEP | 22 (26.60%) | 3 (6.91%)\nMSP | 0 (0.91%) | 2^* (4.38%)\nAM (Wales) | 0 | 0\nAM (London) | 0 (4.5%) | 2 (8.5%)\nAM (Northern Ireland) | 1 | 1^**\nCouncillor | 369 | 190^***\n\n^* [Scottish Greens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Green_Party), of course!"
p19098
aS'^** Goes without saying this is [Green Party in Northern Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_in_Northern_Ireland)\n\n^** 14 from the Scottish Greens, 172 from [Green Party of England and Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales), 4 from Green Party in Northern Ireland'
p19099
aS'This is really the crux of the matter.'
p19100
aS'UKIP and the LibDems are the minor two of the four significant non-nationalist* parties.'
p19101
aS'The Greens are the biggest grouping outside of those parties nationally, but do get commensurately less coverage as a result.'
p19102
aS"Membership size really doesn't matter for parties with clear, recent electoral histories."
p19103
aS"After all, we aren't giving Labour considerably more coverage than anyone else because they have by some margin the most members, and a significant number of affiliated (now opted in) union members as well."
p19104
aS'\\* Nationalist in the UK sense of a party being for the interests or independence of one of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom.'
p19105
aS"I've only really watch BBC, don't follow any of their articles online so I'll have to take you're word for it."
p19106
aS'Shows like Daily Politics and Newsnight are both pretty decent in my opinion.'
p19107
aS'I think while being unbiased overall, they have a tendency to follow the popular parties, which I feel is filling their duty of being a public funded broadcaster.'
p19108
aS"It pains me to say it but UKIP in the past year have been some significant gains, they're worth covering."
p19109
aS'Could it be that their gains are somewhat linked to every news source picking up every word that Farage says?'
p19110
aS'I no longer trust the BBC as a neutral source - especially when you pair this with their awful coverage of the Scottish referendum. '
p19111
aS"I have to agree, when the UKIP was less popular they had a ridiculous amount of coverage with 0 MP's and like 3% of the vote, if anyone didn't know you would have thought they were the 3rd biggest party in the UK."
p19112
aS'The BBC seems to have built the UKIP, just through covering their BS when they were irrelevant nobodies.'
p19113
aS'UKIP are literally the most represented party in terms of MEPs.'
p19114
aS"They aren't as fringe and irrelevant as many like to think."
p19115
aS'The BBC did not create their relevance, their relevance stems from deep seated uncertainty in the UK about our status in the EU and disillusionment with the main parties.'
p19116
aS"And no one gives a crap about the EP, hence they voted the UKIP in as a joke protest, that doesn't mean they were relevant, people just voted for them because the tories and labour are same shit in a different colour in regards to Europe."
p19117
aS"Go put leaving the European union to vote, it will never pass, it won't even be close. "
p19118
aS'If the EU is such a non-controversial topic, why are UKIP polling as the third biggest party in the country based on their anti-EU platform?'
p19119
aS'Because the third biggest party has 10-15% of the vote?'
p19120
aS"I mean it is ridiculous this question even has to be answered,  it would be a land slide towards staying in Europe, if people actually bothered to come out and vote, even without it if 40% of the people who could actually be bothered to vote wanted to leave Europe I would be very surprised, take a 100% turnout and it is probably 25%, at most, and most of those are stupid people who don't understand the economic and geopolitical advantages of the European union, and yes, 25% of the adult public in the UK are idiots, in fact, far higher in regards to politics and economics. "
p19121
aS"I agree that if it came down to it we'd vote to stay in all likelihood."
p19122
aS"But you surely can't be so wilfully ignorant to the fact there is obviously a lot of discontent with the EU."
p19123
aS'I\'m also not really sure the "people disagree because they\'re ignorant and/or stupid" line of reasoning is either fair or reasonable.'
p19124
aS"I'm not sure."
p19125
aS"A lot of the people I talk to don't understand much about politics and economics etc, but my peers are 18~ year olds."
p19126
aS"But at the same time there are lots of adults that don't really follow politics like my parents or even some teachers in my college."
p19127
aS'Once one of the teachers was lingering about and started chatting to my business teacher in our lesson and started asking her why we should stay in the EU and in about 5-10 minutes of conversation his opinion was completely swayed towards staying in the EU.'
p19128
aS'People often form opinions for strange, arguably stupid reasons.'
p19129
aS"I don't disagree."
p19130
aS"My point is you can't fairly label *everyone* on a particular side of this argument stupid."
p19131
aS"I'm certain there are people far more intelligent than you or I who want us to leave the EU."
p19132
aS"Yes i can see both sides of the argument, i was just agreeing with the other guy when he said a lot of people don't know what its all about."
p19133
aS'&gt; I\'m also not really sure the "people disagree because they\'re ignorant and/or stupid" line of reasoning is either fair or reasonable.'
p19134
aS'It largely is, there are very few arguments that when it comes down the crux of the economics of it actually hold up as bad for the UK.'
p19135
aS'Maybe a Polish person has come in and taken your job, but who gives a crap about you, the country as a whole is better off having immigration, and if your job can be done by unskilled labour for cheaper, maybe you should have worked harder in school.'
p19136
aS'Not to mention that currently a lot of semi-skilled labour, i.e.'
p19137
aS"plumbers, carpenters, electricians and are very highly paid, for a job that while does take some training, isn't that hard, it isn't like being a Doctor, Engineer, Software developer."
p19138
aS'This is due to lack of supply of labour, even with immigration, imagine how bad it would be otherwise, you would be paying plumbers \xc2\xa3100K a year just to get one to come to your house.'
p19139
aS"The problem isn't immigration, it is a lack of high skilled jobs for the aspiring British workers, this means they are stuck working at Bars, in Supermarkets, in generic offices, with specialist degrees that have just gone to waste because the government isn't willing to invest in high skilled engineering, science, maths and computer science."
p19140
aS"They are who are taking your jobs, people smarter than you, who should be doing better with their lives but can't because there is no opportunity too, these project cost millions to run, there is no lets just start our own business aspect."
p19141
aS"Of course there are going to be some points when taken alone are bad for the UK, and that is the case for everything, having a well funded NHS means you pay more in tax, that is the realities of life, but overall no one who isn't an idiot is making the argument that on balance EU membership isn't a solid net gain."
p19142
aS'As it happens I agree.'
p19143
aS'I think we should stay in the EU.'
p19144
aS'I just think its extremely arrogant and condescending to label anyone who disagrees as an idiot.'
p19145
aS'There are certainly people more intelligent and more informed than you or I who would be in favour.'
p19146
aS'&gt; I just think its extremely arrogant and condescending to label anyone who disagrees as an idiot.'
p19147
aS"That doesn't mean it isn't true."
p19148
aS'&gt;  There are certainly people more intelligent and more informed than you or I who would be in favour.'
p19149
aS'I would question the intelligent part, more racist maybe, more intelligent not so much, but that is mainly because it is such a no brainer, not because you need to be intelligent to work it out.'
p19150
aS"As for the UKIP candiates, this doesn't mean they are stupid, Farrage is a PR machine, he has turned a irrelevant issue into a vote winner, he is just there to power grab and say what he has too to get the idiots to vote for him, just because he is exploiting an issue that people believe in doesn't mean he really believes it is in the best interest of the UK as a nation (he certainly might though)."
p19151
aS"There is an ideology that the UK should be the people who were born and raised here, that doesn't mean the UK is better off with just the people who were born here, it would be worse off, even if his voters believe it wouldn't."
p19152
aS"But that is irrelevant if that is your ideology, and it is irrelevant when your voters are too stupid to realise it isn't good for the UK, that is even if they care about the UK and not just themselves, maybe leaving Europe would mean they could get a crappy dead-end job that is currently taken by an immigrant, the fact they are competing for that job however is actually the problem, a problem with them, not the system."
p19153
aS'They are entirely different ideologies.'
p19154
aS'No - 5 years ago UKIP were making exactly the same complaints as the Greens.'
p19155
aS"Today, their profile has grown because they've engaged voters."
p19156
aS"While Green Party membership might have grown, their polls are still very modest - they just aren't representative in the same way UKIP is. "
p19157
aS'What is it with the Greens always parading about how many members they have?'
p19158
aS"If it doesn't translate into votes or electoral success it is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things"
p19159
aS"Because it's relevant?"
p19160
aS"The only reason it isn't translating into votes is because of the flawed, outdated electoral system."
p19161
aS"Or because people aren't voting for them."
p19162
aS"Yes, it's because of the pseudo two party system we have, where people feel their votes are wasted by ticking for a third, and first past the post is ridiculous too."
p19163
aS"But then, look at the Scottish parliament where it's more or less proportional voting and they're not exactly superstars there either."
p19164
aS"&gt; Or because people aren't voting for them."
p19165
aS"well we don't know yet."
p19166
aS'A lot of their membership has come recently, so the next election those members can vote in will be next month.'
p19167
aS'Green Party for England and Wales are a different group to the Scottish Green Party and I believe the 60,000 members are for E&amp;W only.'
p19168
aS'You could also argue that the SNP take a vast proportion of the Green vote away in Scotland too.'
p19169
aS"Well technically it's Scottish Labour and (I think) Scottish Conservative parties, but they still get classed together as they generally have the same goals."
p19170
aS"Although yes, you're right that we have three significant parties (because let's face it, the Lib Dems shot themselves in the foot this time around). "
p19171
aS'Have you heard of tactical voting?'
p19172
aS'Assuming most Green voters are ex-Labour voters, any green vote is effectively a tory vote in &gt;99% of constituencies.'
p19173
aS'By voting green you make it more likely that the party you hate the most will get into power.'
p19174
aS'This is not democracy.'
p19175
aS'Fortunately, the rise of UKIP makes me feel more comfortable voting green.'
p19176
aS'Check the poll in your constituency: [https://yougov.co.uk/#/centre](https://yougov.co.uk/#/centre).'
p19177
aS"They fluctuate a bit but they'll give you an idea who has a chance of winning in your area."
p19178
aS'Your only real choices are the top party and any parties close to them in the poll.'
p19179
aS'comfortably labour.'
p19180
aS"Since I don't want to vote for them or the conservatives I'll continue to vote for the greens, driving future policy changes in one of those two parties if they see a big enough chunk of the electorate care about those issues."
p19181
aS"Nope, the reason it isn't translating into votes is because not enough people like the Greens."
p19182
aS'The complaint was that UKIP are getting more press coverage then the Greens despite the Greens having more members, but that is irrelevant as despite having less members [UKIP have consistently been polling at 3x the Green Vote](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/uk-polling-report-average-2)'
p19183
aS'Which, to bring me back to my original point, is largely down to the fact that mainstream media seem to have a massive hard-on for Farage.'
p19184
aS'Probably because everything he says is controversial and sells more.'
p19185
aS'Or maybe because Nigel Farage can actually do interviews, and whenever Natalie Bennet does one it is a trainwreck?'
p19186
aS'UKIP had to start from the same position the Greens are in now, and it was a slow process.'
p19187
aS'You cannot claim that the only reason UKIP are doing 3x better then the Greens is that they receive more press coverage'
p19188
aS'Slow process?'
p19189
aS'More like an explosive process capitalising on peoples casual racist attitudes around the country to distract from the extreme right wing policies UKIP hold.'
p19190
aS"And sorry but I'm basing my vote on party policies, not whoever does better in an interview. "
p19191
aS"A lot of their policies really aren't that extreme or bad, let's be honest here."
p19192
aS"I'd be basing my vote of policies to, but if you don't have a good campaign or leader to give those policies exposure they are unlikely to be heard."
p19193
aS'Like Liberty GB would likely have a lot of supporters if everyone knew their policy, as would Left Unity and every other tiny party etc etc'
p19194
aS'True, but when you look at their policies as a whole, they are not sensible at all.'
p19195
aS'Seemingly no thought of the long term effects, or the affects they would have on the opinions of foreign countries - which really does matter when trade plays an enormous part of our economy.'
p19196
aS'Regardless of any issues regarding bigotry, or sheer stupidity, they are a populist party with no long term outlook as far as I can see.'
p19197
aS"They're polling below all the major parties and UKIP though."
p19198
aS"They BBC have done very well to have so much coverage of such a small party, they don't deserve the same coverage as con/lab which are both on 34% at the moment or UKIP (14%) or Lib (9%).\n"
p19199
aS'It shows popular, engaged support.'
p19200
aS"Perhaps it's telling that people will go out of their way to pay money to be a Green Party member, while UKIP, Labour or the tories get votes but have a far less engaged base."
p19201
aS'With UKIP perhaps there is a stigma attached to being a member?'
p19202
aS'An engaged base is always a good thing but not a necessary one perhaps'
p19203
aS'And with their focus on the working class, who are less likely to have spare cash or motivation to join a party. '
p19204
aS'Basically as it is all they have.'
p19205
aS'Parties will always try and use something as a positive - large *recent* increases in support even if it is a net decrease in recent years, most members, website hits (the BNP used this if I remember!'

p19210
aS'I think they already do! '
p19211
aS"It's always funny how the political bias the BBC is accused of seems perfectly in conflict with the political bias of the accuser."
p19212
aS"It doesn't help that the Green Party leader decided not to do as much media after her LBC disaster - one minute the Greens moan about not getting any attention, the next they don't want to take part."

aS'Never should have got rid of Caroline Lucas as leader.'
p19216

aS"It's not surprising she got elected. "

aS'The BBC is always very balanced when it comes to everything *except* for British politics.'

p19221
aS"You're not kidding."
p19222
aS"It wasn't *completely* terrible until the last couple of weeks and then they started taking 'Yes' as a serious threat - at which point it was like someone threw a switch and they started pulling stuff like broadcasting agitprop stories from the Telegraph completely uncritically."

aS'UKIP are an important current factor in British politics, like it or not.'
p19228
aS"They've clearly moved the political window on immigration and EU discussion, the main parties are very aware of this and have adjusted their policies because of the UKIP pressure."
p19229
aS'This is the general role of the more fringe parties in British politics, and UKIP are extremely successful at this.'
p19230
aS'They have significantly more relevance in politics than the Greens, and its not even close.'
p19231
aS'Party members is a fairly pointless and cherry picked measure of relative importance.'
p19232
aS'UKIP currently have more MPs (2:1) and are actually THE most represented party in terms of MEPs.'
p19233
aS'They also poll consistently higher than the Greens.'
p19234
aS'They will almost certainly have more MPs than the Greens after the election too.'
p19235
aS'Hell, Plaid Cymru will have as many if not more seats than the Greens.'
p19236
aS"The Greens just simply aren't very important."
p19237
aS'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/poll-tracker\n\nAccording to that and most polls, UKIP are the third most popular party in British politics and have been for a while.'

aS'They could well overtake the Lib Dems.'
p19239
aS"I'm aware that here on /r/unitedkingdom we like to pretend they're irrelevant nutjobs, and I wish they were too, but they just aren't."
p19240
aS'Why are they more relevant because they blame problems on immigration and the eu.'
p19241
aS'Most of their arguments on immigration are weak and narrow sighted.'
p19242
aS"They've done well to ride the media wave of blaming benefit claimants and immigration which has helped turn that into votes."
p19243
aS'Particularly with Murdock supporting ukip, enforcing opinions through his outlets. '
p19244
aS'The green party is more or less a joke party though.'
p19245
aS'Unlike ukip who [insert obligatory will not be voting for comment] will possibly have some influence in the upcoming election'
p19246
aS"It's only considered a joke party because of people like you who roll their eyes and make jokes about them."
p19247
aS'The green party have more momentum than ever yet people flock to Farage because he seems like a normal bloke.'
p19248
aS"But he's not a normal bloke he's a career politician who doesn't have the nations best interests at heart."
p19249
aS'They literally are a joke party.'
p19250
aS'Anyone with an actual job can see that.'
p19251
aS'Also fair play to farage for being a competent politician unlike Natalie bennet who gets flustered in all her interviews when her terrible policies get brutally picked apart'
p19252
aS"Think you're largely exaggerating and you know it."
p19253
aS"It was a couple of interviews that weren't perfect."
p19254
aS'She held her own in the live debate just fine without resorting to the same level of shit flinging as the others.'
p19255
aS"To be fair, I've never seen or heard Natalie Bennett impress in an interview - she's occasionally satisfactory, but nothing more."
p19256
aS'She is a massive liability for the party in terms of performance and personality - she just comes across as a whiner. '
p19257
aS'Their policies are also just a teeny bit bat shit insane?'
p19258
aS'They have a couple of policies that are a bit weird.'
p19259
aS'Many of them are very good though. '
p19260
aS'Some of them are good on principle, which is what their supporters love to mention.'
p19261
aS"I've not yet seen anyone talk about how the greens want to get rid of the armed forces, and things like the oil industry."
p19262
aS"Even if you agree with the principles of that, I just don't see how the greens can justify getting rid of all those jobs without creating any more in their manifesto."
p19263
aS'Presumably people who lose their jobs from certain sectors will benefit from the increased funding to other industries and the jobs it creates.'
p19264
aS"It is important to note that whilst the Green Party does want to reduce our armed forces and believe in free movement of people, they aren't suggesting this happens overnight."
p19265
aS'They believe that by improving the economy and human rights in the UK, EU and rest if the world, we will eventually be able to implement these policies.'
p19266
aS"I don't agree with all of their policies."
p19267
aS'I do generally support the motives behind them though. '
p19268
aS'Yeah but you try telling someone "you\'re gonna lose your job but don\'t worry, presumably you\'ll benefit from this other thing" '
p19269
aS'Yeah nobody likes it.'
p19270
aS"But we don't have coal shovellers anymore or chimney sweeps."
p19271
aS"Certain jobs won't be around forever. "
p19272
aS"Just getting rid of jobs because someone on a moral high horse has decided they're arbitrary when they aren't though, isn't the same as preventing young boys climbing around in soot filled chimneys."
p19273
aS"No I'm not saying it's to do with morality, I mean the jobs are obsolete."
p19274
aS'In an ideal world, the military would be obsolete.'
p19275
aS"That's all the Green Party mean."
p19276
aS"That's what their ultimate goal is. "
p19277
aS"Far too many of the greens' policies are based on a hypothetical utopia that doesn't exist for them to be taken seriously"
p19278
aS'I don\'t think there is anything wrong with saying "we want to create a fair society for everyone and move towards demilitarisation".'
p19279
aS'It\'s not any different to "we want to half the deficit and double NHS spending".'
p19280
aS'This is purely my opinion at this point. '
p19281
aS"Yeah it's all opinion, the difference is (using the Greens and Labour manifestos), Labour actually outlined roughly how they're going to make things happen."
p19282
aS"Not just what they'd like to happen. "
p19283
aS'The Green Party have outlined the funding for their more immediate policies.'
p19284
aS"They haven't for their more long term goals though."
p19285
aS"For example they want to introduce a basic income and it is mentioned in their manifesto, but as it isn't relevant to this parliament they haven't gone into much detail. "
p19286
aS'How could that possibly work though?'
p19287
aS"It's achieved through Twitter hashtags, apparently. "
p19288
aS'If only politics worked like Tinkerbell, then the Greens would be laughing'
p19289
aS"More momentum and ever and they're still the 5th biggest party who have no realistic chance at more than 1 seat."
p19290
aS"You might like them and think they're great and thats entirely up to you."
p19291
aS'But the objective observations suggest they are still a minor party with little relevance compared to UKIP, who are polling at nearly 3 times the amount of support, dwarf them in MEPs and will almost certainly have more MPs to boot.'
p19292
aS'So its not surprising or unreasonable for UKIP to get a lot more attention.'
p19293
aS'The only reason UKIP have a realistic chance is because of Farage harping on about foreigners.'
p19294
aS"As for having more MEPs that's a very recent story and it also came after large media bias."
p19295
aS"What many UKIP supporters don't realise is that one of the green party's key policies is to hold a referendum on EU membership - because they're pro democracy."
p19296
aS'UKIP just have a more charismatic leader.'
p19297
aS"So basically, to sum up your comments on this thread, you think the only reason the Greens aren't considered more important is the fact that the media is biased towards UKIP (BBC apparently having developed an anti-EU agenda for no discernible reason), and that our voting system unfairly hurts the Greens, despite them having significantly lower polling numbers than UKIP?"
p19298
aS"If we'd actually voted for AV the Greens would still be comfortably less relevant than UKIP given they're 1/3rd as popular."
p19299
aS'The mental gymnastics are impressive and all, but it might be better to just accept more people like UKIP than they do the Greens.'
p19300
aS"I don't think that they have said the Greens are more popular than UKIP anywhere in this thread. "
p19301
aS'What even was the turn out for the mep elections?'
p19302
aS"I feel like I don't even remember voting. "
p19303
aS'34.19%.'
p19304
aS"That's why I'm not too worried that UKIP did well there, as that's a pathetic turnout and not representative of the population."
p19305
aS"The only reason UKIP have done well is because they've found a single issue which a load of voters are concerned about."
p19306
aS'The SNP are the same.'
p19307
aS'Maybe the Greens should try it. '
p19308
aS'Well they do address very serious issues!'
p19309
aS"They've vowed to make sure corperations pay their tax in full which will provide a lot of extra money."
p19310
aS'Not to mention how important their focus on environmental issues could be.'
p19311
aS'I CANNOT wait to see the butt hurt comments from The Greens when the results come through.'
p19312
aS"It's going to be like the Euro elections but 5 x better."
p19313
aS'They have been delusional this past year. '
p19314
aS"The only people I know who're voting Green are either the crazy lefty socialists with arts or social science jobs or stoners."
p19315
aS"So every time I see someone defending them on Facebook that's all I can imagine. "
p19316
aS'Which is unfair.'
p19317
aS"We don't judge ukip for its voters."
p19318
aS'The greens offer, at least a nudge, in the direction of getting more power back from cooperate control.'
p19319
aS"It's puts me off the larger parties because they don't seem to think inequality is an issue (apart from election build up)."
p19320
aS"This is an important issue for me and all other options don't seem to want to tackle inequality."
p19321
aS"I'm left with voting green. "
p19322
aS'UKIP may be a kingmaker,  gaining enough to either form coalition with Tories or hand it to labour by taking Tory seats.'
p19323
aS"They also have a constant stream of controversy, it's not like much of the coverage is positive. "
p19324
aS'"Any publicity is good publicity"'
p19325
aS'UKIP is the most interesting story.'
p19326
aS"It's their first real test, and is in the best position to break the three-party narrative."
p19327
aS'The BBC are the only thing I ever listen to when it comes to election coverage.'
p19328
aS'Every other source is just dripping with bias.'
p19329
aS"The Torygraph and Guardian wouldn't know what impartiality was if it bit them in the arse."
p19330
aS'The article and the study is about broadcast media, not print or online news.'
p19331
aS"Frankly, if you're getting all your information from BBC News online, you might be getting a balanced picture but you're going to be missing a lot of detail."
p19332
aS"Their situation prohibits them from doing much in the way of analysis or syncretic links between different news stories, and also forces them to write all articles at a reading level that's accessible to every demented granny and illiterate preteen in the nation, which really inhibits their usefulness as a text source."
p19333
aS'Personally I recommend ditching all dailies and 24 hour sources and sticking with the weekly/bi-weekly/monthly magazines like the Economist, New Statesman, Spectator etc.'
p19334
aS'They can go into much more depth and often provide details that completely reverse the implications of a surface level understanding of each policy.'
p19335
aS'If I want to read more about a particular area I do go for things like that, but in terms of broad election coverage the BBC are as good as it gets.'
p19336
aS"Those are good sources if I want to read a lot about a specific issue, but I often don't need or want that much depth for most things."
p19337
aS'And any way, 5 live and other political shows on TV etc do actually go into more than enough detail for most.'
p19338
aS"I'm not an economist."
p19339
aS"I go to the FT for detail and good (both diverse and considered) opinion columns, and it's brilliant at it. "
p19340
aS"FT is the best paper in Britain by such a distance it's not even funny"
p19341
aS'This is good to know, I do feel that getting all my news from BBC Online leaves me with little overall depth of knowledge.'
p19342
aS"Oh and the Graun and Torygraph's bias often rubs me up the wrong way."
p19343
aS'Thanks. '
p19344
aS'Just to ask.'
p19345
aS'Who is the gaurdian bias towards?'
p19346
aS'Is that a joke?'
p19347
aS'The Guardian is to Labour what the Telegraph is to the Tories.'
p19348
aS'Not a joke.'
p19349
aS"I hadn't read enough of it to know it had a labour bais."
p19350
aS"This is the first I've heard people state it had one. "
p19351
aS'&gt; The BBC are the only thing I ever listen to when it comes to election coverage.'
p19352
aS'Rather than only relying on one news source, why not read both The Guardian and The Telegraph as well?'
p19353
aS"Although they're biased, they tend to have a lot more detail than the BBC."
p19354
aS"Knowing that they're both biased, knowing which way they're likely to be biased, and doing some fact checking, you should be able to work out a fairly unbiased story for yourself with more detail and multiple viewpoints."
p19355
aS"Probably because they're the one with the least bias and as such can focus on the details."
p19356
aS"What do you expect, the daily mail to have a detailed analysis of Labour's NHS reforms?"
p19357
aS"I have to say that I've been really impressed by the BBC this election."
p19358
aS"I've been listening a fair amount to 5Live and I really appreciated the way that they've been pulling in external  fact-checkers to sift through announcements."
p19359
aS'The policy editor from Newsnight has been putting in the hours too, as has John Pienaar. '
p19360
aS'me too.'

aS"I wouldn't watch any other channel for election coverage."
p19364
aS'I feel Andrew Neil has once again been fantastic throughout, his knowledge and researching (whether it is by him or the BBC) far exceeds other interviewers, especially around finance.'
p19365
aS'I just wish the main party leaders would let him interview them, it seems they are just a little too scared.'
p19366

p19367
aS'!'
aS'I watch the Daily Politics most days &amp; it has ups and downs.'
p19368
aS'My issue is sometimes they may have 2 Conservative guests, and interviews with Torygraph reporter "experts".'
p19369
aS'Other times they will have multiple Labour guests on the show too (they never seem to interview the Guardian though).'
p19370
aS'The media "impartial" observers are usually crap on that show too, they seem to love using the Telegraph.'
p19371
aS'So what I would say is it depends very much upon whom they have on the show, and the guest makeup is often not fair to either side.'
p19372
aS'On balance it is OK but some episodes are really biased.'
p19373
aS"Andrew Neil himself is fine, asking the right questions generally, but a lot of the show is him asking other people's opinions &amp; if you're purely talking to Tory or Labour supporters it tends to become a bit of a mouthpiece for party political commentary."
p19374
aS'Question Time for instance generally has a much better makeup of guest speakers.'
p19375
aS"That show usually doesn't favour one political party in my experience. "
p19376
aS"I was part of news production before parliament closed for a local online bulletin and our problem was we'd report on torries coming to the area but when trying to balance it there was no other party movement in the area."
p19377
aS'So we had to use balance over time but obviously we were tiny compared to the bbc.'
p19378

aS'The fleeing from immediate danger is over and they are making the expensive and dangerous trip to the UK for other reasons. '

aS'Some may have had it organised to get them here via whatever means, so they had no other choice.'
p19896
aS'Also where they have been and why is irrelevant, asylum has to be taken on face value - the people are here, now, and their case does not take into consideration if they may have passed through elsewhere.'
p19897
aS'It is just the way it has to be unfortunately. '
p19898
aS'Yes I understand that but we have people on this sub using very emotive language regarding turning people down who are fleeing from murder.'
p19899
aS'We have to realise that they are people who arrive here have already fled from their homeland, often they are already in countries such as France, Italy etc and now they are making an decision to come to the UK for quality of life purposes.'
p19900
aS"That's not to say the UK shouldn't accept their share of migrants and asylum seekers but it doesn't help to castigate other commenters with very emotive language based on untrue premises. "

aS'Of course, there are some who want to come here for "quality of life" reasons - whatever they may be.'
p19902
aS'Some might look at it as wanting freebies, but it is more likely to be existing links to this country, being turned down elsewhere, and that they can speak English.'
p19903
aS'After all, people do complain that people arrive here without learning the language first!'
p19904
aS'The UK is the first English speaking country they might reach, though.'

p19915
aS"Encouraging those who don't already speak English to learn seems worthwhile, but this fundamentally *isn't* encouragement - it's punishment."
p19916
aS'Cutting translation is just going to mean that non-native speakers are left *more* confused by official paperwork and technical jargon, and *less* able to integrate themselves.'
p19917
aS'Where was the announcement of increasing spending on *helping* people learn?'
p19918
aS'That would be constructive encouragement, rather than another classic-conservative "Hit them with a spending-cut stick until they magically fix their own situation"... because, evidently, what\'s holding new arrivals back from learning the language is that they don\'t want to and can\'t be bothered because we\'ll just translate everything anyway.'
p19919
aS'Yeah, that must be it.'
p19920
aS'Makes total sense.'
p19921
aS'I mean, a few translated leaflets make it seamlessly easy to operate in an unfamiliar culture, and as soon as you decide you *want* to learn a new language you instantly become fluent.'
p19922
aS"Pretty sure that's how it works."
p19923
aS"Seriously, how is it acceptable to support people who come to the UK, expecting to make a living, who can't communicate?"

p19941
aS"I mean sure you'd make an attempt to try and get the basics so that you can hold a conversation, communicate when you're in shops, do your job, but it can take many years to become *fluent* in a language, and somtimes people don't have that long to prepare."
p19942
aS'How basic is "the basics" though?'
p19943
aS"I should elaborate and say that by fluent, I don't mean knowing advanced grammatical words, spelling and sentences, but at least be able to speak and understand someone and not say that they're talking too fast."
p19944
aS"If you think that someone speaking in their own language talks too fast, then you're not fluent enough."
p19945
aS"Right, but that's not really what's meant by the word 'fluent."
p19946
aS"' Fluency is about being able to express yourself very clearly and articulately and generally means speaking a language at a near-native level."
p19947
aS"As you said, if someone speaking too fast is a real problem then you're not fluent."
p19948
aS"And I don't think it's reasonable to expect people to be fluent before they ever move to a country."
p19949
aS"So you're telling me that you think it's perfectly reasonable for your employer to move you to a different country for work purposes, where you speak a bit of the language, enough to get you around the town, but where all the staff will be speaking too fast for you to comprehend, therefore being unable to do your job?"

p20046
aS"It was clear she had already made up her mind that she doesn't like Labour."

p20049

aS"I was referring to this part:\n\n&gt;GD: But what I can't understand is why I am still being taxed at 66 years old because my husband's died and I have some of his pension tagged onto my pension."

p20062
aS"EDIT: Basically what I'm saying is that she seemed like the kind of person who would buy a dress with a 7 day return policy, then kick up a fuss when she can't return the dress after 8 days..."
p20063
aS"That's not making shit up, that's expressing concern about ending the winter fuel payment (perhaps because of fear about there no longer being enough money for it?"
p20064
aS')\n\nAs for jumping from issue to issue, she did indeed seem to have a lot she wanted to cover but this was more a case of letting Brown know what his voters were concerned about rather than finding reasons to hate him.'
p20065
aS"She claims to still support Labour and to be a life long Labour voter after all, this isn't some Tory shill."
p20066
aS"Finally, with regard to Brown's counter-points she seemed sufficiently content with his response to not need to press it further and to want to ensure she covered all of the issues she felt were pertinent in the (very) limited time she had to put her concerns across."
p20067
aS"Again, it wasn't a conversation, just a brief moment for her to let him know what was worrying her as a Labour voter."
p20068
aS'It was an inarticulate question about immigration, welfare, and public services.'
p20069
aS'It was pretty unintelligible.'
p20070
aS"The issue was that Gordon Brown's automatic assumption was that Duffy was bigoted, not that she was expressing genuine concern about the effect of immigration on working class people."
p20071
aS"It was symbolic of Labour's general attitude to immigration at that point; which was to dismiss working class concerns as driven by bigotry or racism, not concern over the effect of immigration on their living and working conditions and quality of public services."
p20072
aS'Thankfully, Labour (or Ed Milliband at least) seems to have moved on from that position and recognises that people who express concern over immigration are not necessarily bigoted / xenophobic / racist.'

aS'A quick search shows that some of their members have shouted ["kill all muslims"] (http://www.islamophobiawatch.co.uk/charlton-man-threatened-to-kill-all-muslims-after-lee-rigby-death/) before.'
p20668
aS'Sounds pretty similar to "kill all men" to me.'
p20669
aS'Wouldn\'t it be more like an EDL member sarcastically saying "kill all the English"?'
p20670
aS"Well the EDL aren't known for their opposition to the English."
p20671
aS"They're known for (along side a load of racist shit) their opposition to Islamic extremism."
p20672
aS'For them to say "kill all muslims" is very much like a feminist saying "kill all men" as they are known for their opposition to, among other things, patriarchy, male privilege etc etc.'
p20673
aS'Perhaps another example would be when a UKIP member said that Africans should "be left to kill themselves off".'
p20674
aS'Maybe he said it sarcastically as an ironic jab at those who say UKIP is racist.'
p20675
aS'Hmmm.'
p20676

p20677

aS'Valerie Solanas wrote the book, the SCUM manifesto which said that women should "overthrow the government" and "eliminate the male sex".'
p20681
aS'Some people (apologists of violent extremist rhetoric like yourself) tried to claim that it was only a satire but Solanas herself said she was "dead serious".'
p20682
aS'A couple of years later she actually shot Andy Warhol (who thankfully survived) and was sent to prison.'
p20683
aS'After this Ti-Grace Atkinson (another prominent feminist), called Solanas as "the first outstanding champion of women\'s rights" and as "a \'heroine\' of the feminist movement".'
p20684
aS'Also do you also think death threats are acceptable if there is no intent to follow through?'
p20685
aS"I'm pretty sure Sue Perkins (and indeed many stalking victims) would disagree."
p20686
aS'&gt;She suffered from schizophrenia, known to make people paranoid and sometimes violent, and she shot Warhol while believing him to have been stealing her work, not because he was a man.'
p20687
aS"Well then perhaps we should be screening the woman in OP's post for mental health problems."
p20688
aS"And what of the feminists who supported Solanas' actions in the aftermath?"
p20689
aS"&gt;SCUM Manifesto is satire\n\nSo why did it's author say that it was real?"
p20690
aS'Why do some RadFems support it as real?'
p20691
aS'Why can I find so many other examples from other sources.'
p20692
aS"It's ridiculously easy to find radical feminists who are all about female supremacy."
p20693
aS"It certainly doesn't represent all feminism but you are burying your head int he sand if you are pretending it doesn't exist."
p20694
aS"&gt;I don't think that death threats are acceptable."
p20695
aS"Good thing that this wasn't a death threat."
p20696
aS'Just like the "kill all muslims" quote is fine then?'
p20697
aS'I honestly find it baffling that you are defending hate speech and incitement to violence.\n\n'
p20698
aS"she's really not."
p20699
aS"I've have the misfortune of dealing with this person online, she genuinely believes this shit."
p20700
aS'She is now potentially ging to be used to make us all look bad, im mad furious she gets to be the example that some people are gonna have of transgender feminists.'
p20701
aS'She an unhinged extremist viewpoint who should never have been allowed to get where she was.'
p20702
aS'She is attempting to mock them, but still ends up being unacceptably intolerant to men.'
p20703
aS'Just like Osama Bin Laden mocked Islam by blowing up the WTC.'
p20704
aS'That was hilarious right?'
p20705
aS'Or remember that time when Hitler mocked fascism by killing 6 million Jews?'
p20706
aS'I don\'t give a shit if you think she\'s "not being intolerant to men", because she clearly is.'
p20707
aS'She openly espouses genocide and sexism, I don\'t call that "mockery".'
p20708
aS'Its called reality, and she deserves to be imprisoned for espousing such views.'
p20709
aS'Do you have any evidence then that she is actually using satire?'
p20710
aS'At least "A Modest Proposal" was easily distinguishable as satire due to its writing styles, as far as I can tell Sarah Noble is being sincere.'
p20711
aS'Are you not aware of Latin satire?'
p20712
aS'The Essay was written in exactly the same style to make it easy to determine that it was satire.'
p20713
aS'He also employed styles used by Horace and Juvenal.'
p20714
aS'Sarah Noble does none of this, she just says "kill all men" in a non satirical manner.'
p20715
aS'Indicating to me that you are indeed talking out your arse.'

p20718
aS'&gt; The onus is one me to do what?'
p20719
aS'Prove that what she says is satire.'
p20720
aS'&gt; How do those tweet prove that she is serious?'
p20721
aS'By that same logic, everything is ironic because there is no proof of anybody being serious.'
p20722
aS'You seem to be struggling with the very concept of attribution.'
p20723
aS'She published those words, there is no indication they were satirical (unless you can provide some); therefore she is serious.'
p20724
aS'Why is this so hard to understand for you?'
p20725
aS'I will stop humoring this ridiculousness soon.'
p20726
aS'&gt;Her saying "Kill all men" is satirical, as it\'s clearly ridiculous for anyone to geninely want that.'
p20727
aS'Have you considered that she might be ridiculous?'
p20728
aS'&gt; Her saying "Kill all men" is satirical, as it\'s clearly ridiculous for anyone to geninely want that.'
p20729
aS'Kind of like when a UKIP councillor said "islam is a cancer that needs eradicating".'
p20730
aS'Clearly no one wants to eradicate all 1.5 billion muslims so this was clearly a biting satire of those who call UKIP racist.'
p20731
aS'Totally.'

aS"&gt;Isis is a terrorist group\n\n&gt;Isis is made up of people who are part of the Islamic religion\n\n&gt;Everyone who follows Islam is a terrorist\n\nThe only reason Radfems have louder voices is because we are sitting on reddit and honestly it's a massive circle jerk that creates its own online bubble where tumblr is the home of all feminists."

aS'Not even sure there\'s a feminist movement, as such, at least with the connotations the word "movement" has with at least relatively solidified organizational structures and a clear, common agenda and so on?'
p20788
aS'Seems like it\'s more like what LimitlessLTD says: "a group of people that shares a similar ideology".'
p20789
aS'And even that ideology has become very broad and heterogenous.'
p20790
aS"Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it means you can't really judge it on the work of a couple of on-and-off columnists."
p20791
aS'Prefacing this with the observation that I\'m really not informed enough to talk about this (but when has the ever stopped anyone on Reddit), I don\'t think that feminist ideology "has become increasingly extremist," as you wrote in your other comment, I think it\'s more that it\'s splintered into many different directions.'
p20792
aS'Which seems pretty typical for ideologies in our time - same is true for socialism etc.'
p20793
aS'E.g.'
p20794
aS':\n\n* Academic feminism has become increasingly dense and theoretical.'
p20795
aS"I've tried reading some bell hooks and Judith Butler but found it hard to get through."
p20796
aS"But in terms of sophistication and nuance it's obviously a different universe from feminist CiF columns."
p20797
aS"Universities also don't look kindly on generalist work anymore; to get published and be taken seriously within their discipline academics face an insane pressure to specialize ever further - making it harder to produce work with any impact on the broader social debate."
p20798
aS'* Political feminism has gone mainstream.'
p20799
aS"Talking about the US: when Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act as soon as he got into office, or when the Democrats tried to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act last year, those were women's rights fights."
p20800
aS'Senator Mikulski, who introduced both bills, also brought feminist academics into Congress to give presentations for her fellow Congress members, and has said that what she is doing is "applied feminism.'
p20801
aS'"\n\n* Even the corporate world has coopted some feminist sheen - the "Lean In" business and all that.'
p20802
aS'* Grassroots feminism has black feminists in the US, for example, focusing on issues like police brutality and mass incarceration, and the impact discrimination and exclusion have on black women - concrete and hard-hitting subjects.'
p20803
aS"And they've taken some swipes at the unreflexive, privileged white middle-class perspectives of their fellow feminists while they're at it."
p20804
aS'* And in the meantime you have the college and Tumblr feminists making memes and decrying micro-aggressions, in addition to tackling (in my privileged-male eyes more important-seeming) issues like sexual violence on campuses.'
p20805
aS"That's my superficial impression of the landscape, anyway."
p20806
aS"And it's not necessarily that these things conflict with each other, it's just that their protagonists almost seem to exist and act in separated universes."
p20807
aS"And maybe because the academic feminist thinkers have kind of retreated into the ivory tower, and the feminist politicians focus on the unspectacular sausage-making business that is lawmaking, the stuff you're most likely to come across browsing blogs and online newspaper columns (and other stuff Reddit links to) is the CiF/Tumblr-type stuff."
p20808
aS"And of course it doesn't hurt that the likes of Salon love to publish that stuff because of its massive link bait value."
p20809
aS'That doesn\'t make it representative for feminism overall, but also means that there might not be clear "leaders" to easily point to as alternative.'
p20810
aS'But this kind of segmented splintering seems to have happened within most ideologies.'
p20811
aS"So, you can't name a single feminist who you think I should be reading?"
p20812
aS"It's a simple question."
p20813
aS"i'm sure the guy who's entire post history is about feminism and posts in KIA is just itching to read books about feminism!"
p20814
aS"for someone who speaks a lot about feminism, it's quite remarkable you haven't even read any writing by them. "
p20815
aS'Any reason you have to make things personal?'
p20816
aS"You can't debate the ideas without resorting to making snide comments about my posting history?"
p20817
aS'sure, post history tells a lot about a person.'
p20818
aS'the fact your post history is 70% about feminism and 30% about islam suggests you already have strong opinions on feminism, the fact you post in KIA is a strong indicator to your general views on feminism, the fact every post in other subs like /r/science is *still* always about feminism or women a strong indicator of your "passion" for feminism, and the fact you debate it endlessly without having even read any writing by them indicates just how worthwile and honest debating feminism with you will be i.e.'
p20819
aS'not much \n\nalso it\'s a bit rich talking about personal attacks instead of addressing points when about 5 hours ago you (ironically) said someone was a "delicate flower who can\'t handle a joke" because they disagreed with you about the level of respect you were showing to them '
p20820
aS"No, I didn't say someone was a delicate flower."
p20821
aS"I was asking if homosexuals were such delicate flowers that they'd be offended by a very mild quip."

p20828
aS"&gt; No, I didn't say someone was a delicate flower."

aS"I was asking if homosexuals were such delicate flowers that they'd be offended by a very mild quip."
p20830
aS"in reply to someone saying you don't respect homosexuals by using a casual slur... you reply with saying they're delicate flowers with a thin skin who are irrational.... basically proving their point by continuing to show zero respect to their POV and try to discredit them with personal attacks!"

aS'how thick are you exactly?'
p20832
aS"&gt;And sorry, but my post history is not 70% feminism and even if it were, it's my decision which subjects I write about, is it not?"
p20833
aS"it's just pretty sad that your life is so sheltered and empty, the most important thing in the world to you right now is a bunch of weird extremist feminists who mostly exist on the internet who nobody really takes seriously outside of their own niche circles which I doubt impact your life that much."
p20834
aS'&gt;Finally - of course I have read feminist writers.'
p20835
aS'And what I read troubles me.'
p20836
aS'then why are you asking disigenous questions like "can you name any 3rd wave feminist writers I should read" if you already read them?'
p20837
aS"because you're disigenous in debate maybe?"
p20838
aS"&gt;OK, I'm adding you to my 'ignore' list and won't be responding to any more comments from your account."
p20839
aS"you can't debate the ideas without blocking people?"
p20840
aS"Because that's much better than personal attacks (which you also engage in when it suits you) you seem to regularly block people who disagree with you which is interesting...\n\nbye then lol good luck with smashing the matriarchy, destroying islam and your other SJW endevours "

aS"From my comment:\n\n&gt;I've tried reading some bell hooks and Judith Butler but found it hard to get through."

aS'Yeah, you had to go for the insult.'
p20853
aS"OK, I'll end this conversation here, because I don't see why I should put up with that kind of snide personal comment."
p20854
aS'Are you kidding me?'
p20855
aS'I wrote a long, thoughtful post, which didn\'t just mention a couple of names (because it did), but also argued why I believe that the question about "who the leaders are" is the wrong one, because of the way the ideology (and others like it) have developed.'
p20856
aS"And your entire response to all that was: \n\n&gt;So, you can't name a single feminist who you think I should be reading?"
p20857
aS"It's a simple question."
p20858
aS'That was ridiculously rude.'
p20859
aS'Considering I did name a couple.'
p20860
aS'And made a broader argument too.'
p20861
aS'You will find that you get treated the way you treat others.'
p20862
aS'I took your initial question seriously and answered it thoughtfully.'
p20863
aS"If you answer with a rude, facile and factually incorrect one-liner, you're going to get responded to accordingly."
p20864
aS'If you don\'t want to "put up with that kind of snide comment," maybe don\'t post any yourself?'
p20865
aS"And you still haven't named a single feminist who you think I should be reading!"
p20866
aS'You said that Bell Hooks and Judith Butler were hard for you to get through.'
p20867
aS'Was that an endorsement?'
p20868
aS"And you mentioned some senator who does 'applied feminism'."
p20869
aS'OK, but does she write?'
p20870
aS'Because that was my question.'
p20871
aS'So, once again.'
p20872
aS'Which feminist do you think I should be reading?'
p20873
aS'No need for a long comment.'
p20874
aS'Just tell me their name and a short sentence or two about why you think I should read them.\n\n'
p20875
aS'&gt;You said that Bell Hooks and Judith Butler were hard for you to get through.'
p20876
aS'Was that an endorsement?'
p20877
aS'Since I also wrote that "in terms of sophistication and nuance it\'s obviously a different universe from feminist CiF columns," yes, in a manner, of course.'
p20878
aS"Just cause it's difficult doesn't mean it's not worth it."
p20879
aS"I didn't get through the bell hooks book I borrowed, but I still learned from it (and who's to say you're not smarter or hardier than me?)."
p20880
aS"But you're still ignoring the entire meat of my argument."
p20881
aS'You wrote that you found "the leaders of the movement" to be "becoming more extreme", and added that you are judging who those leaders are on the basis of "Guardian columnists" and the like.'
p20882
aS'My argument is not just that you\'re looking at the wrong "leaders", but that you\'re asking the wrong question in the first place.'
p20883
aS'There are no "leaders of the movement".'
p20884
aS'There are different manifestations of feminism in different parts of society.'
p20885
aS"They're in academia, yes, and those women write books you can read."
p20886
aS'In another comment you wrote that "of course I have read feminist writers", so, OK; Butler, to stick with her, seems to have been the single most lauded feminist thinker of the last decade or two.'
p20887
aS'What about her work strikes you as "extreme"?'
p20888
aS"Then they're also in legislative politics."
p20889
aS'E.g.'
p20890
aS"Sen. Mikulski or Rep. Rosa DeLauro are not writing feminist treatises, they're writing bills."
p20891
aS"Yet their work represents a part of feminism too - and of course you're free to read (about) those bills."
p20892
aS'Do you consider those extreme?'
p20893
aS'Feminism is also in street activism.'
p20894
aS"To stick with the US, it's for example the [Women's Freedom March](http://womensfreedommarch.org/)."
p20895
aS'Do the issues and priorities they highlight strike you as extreme?'
p20896
aS'And finally, feminism is also the bloggers and columnists on Tumblr, Salon etc., sure.'
p20897
aS'To judge feminism, as a whole - as silly as I think that endeavour by itself is - you have to take on board all those aspects.'
p20898
aS"The Tumblr blogs; the thinkers who write books - and the feminism FAQ's list of recommended works that I linked to has a bunch more of those; but also the politicians who write laws, and, say, the feminist activist who's helping to organize the National Domestic Workers Alliance to improve the labor conditions of the (overwhelmingly) women who work in that sector."
p20899
aS'So I\'m inviting you to consider all these fields - the blogs, the books, but also the bills, the march, etc - and review whether you still consider it, in total, to be "becoming extremist", and why.'
p20900
aS"Not a simple question; but a necessary one, I'm afraid."
p20901
aS'Um, OK.'

p20906
aS'You pick off a book or two from the /r/feminism reading list, and then draw a conclusion about what you think of "feminism" after all?'
p20907
aS"It would still be wrong, if that's all you'd be going on, because making declarations about today's feminism on the basis of books and blog posts alone, while ignoring feminism in politics and policy, feminism in activism and community support, feminism in business even (maybe), is still not going to be very useful."

aS"It's not that I'm uninterested or that I think it makes me look cool - it's that I looked at the author you suggested and her ideas seem completely divorced from reality."

aS"Honestly, if there's a modern feminist who is making reality based arguments and is willing to engage with the rest of the intellectual world, then I will give them a go."
p20914
aS"But I don't have any time for this type of post-modernist ideological feminism which seems to me  to be wishful thinking bordering on religion.\n\n\n"
p20915
aS"OK, I'm looking at the [Wikipedia page on Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler), and I'm already running into what looks like post-modernist nonsense:\n\n&gt;The crux of Butler's argument in Gender Trouble is that the coherence of the categories of sex, gender, and sexuality\xe2\x80\x94the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies\xe2\x80\x94is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time."

p20918
aS'She had described them as \xe2\x80\x9csocial movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left\xe2\x80\x9d.'
p20919
aS'[60] She was accused of defending "Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations" and supporting their tactics.'

p21256

aS"Nothing will happen with the GP if you complain, they'e currently free to act as they will because its left to their discretion when honestly all they need to do is listen, nod and refer you to those who are there to help you."
p22117
aS'BUT, they dont HAVE to do that currently, they can ignore the pathways and just deny someone at the point of contact and refuse to go any further with it free of any comeback.'
p22118
aS'currently the only way to deal with these people IS to hop from GP to GP until you find one capable of doing their job corectly.'
p22119
aS'The side effect of this is that the doctors who will corectly refer patients on to to people often get samped, because as soon as one trans person in an area gets a good doctor, they will spread that info to other people in the catchment area and suddenly 1 GP is dealing with all of the trans patients in their catchment area.'
p22120
aS'You can see the problem.'
p22121
aS"If a sex change is vital to someone's life, why shouldn't it?"
p22122
aS'Gender dysphoria causes depression.'
p22123
aS'A lot of trans people have severe problems with depression, and suicide is a leading cause of death for pre- and post-transition trans people.'
p22124
aS"Edit: Also, a lot of trans people have so many problems with the NHS provision that they choose to go private (when they can afford to) anyway, because it's a lot quicker to do private."
p22125
aS"Then shouldn't those people be seeking mental help?"
p22126
aS'I get that you feel as if you are a woman/man , but you were not born one.'
p22127
aS'You were born a physical male.'
p22128
aS'Why are we trying to change the appearance rather than the mental process behind it?'
p22129
aS'Like, What do you end up getting from the sex change?'
p22130
aS'You seem happy for looking in the mirror and seeing a female?'
p22131
aS'I have no idea about the subject and am just wanting some questions asked.'
p22132
aS'If anyone has been through the process please let me know your thoughts on it.'
p22133
aS'People might be born physically one gender, but not mentally.'
p22134
aS'Brain chemistry is fundamentally different for men and women, including things like hormone production.'
p22135
aS"Since you can't change someone's brain (medically and morally), and can change their body, it's better to enable sex changes."
p22136
aS'Gender dysphoria is when you feel uncomfortable as the gender assigned at birth.'
p22137
aS"It doesn't feel like your body."
p22138
aS'It feels wrong, alien.'
p22139
aS'Transitioning enables such a person to feel like their body is their own, that it fits and they are comfortable in it.'
p22140
aS"It's not a mental illness, but it can cause mental illness if there's no way out, just like being trapped in a bad relationship, poor home situation, or hated job can lead to stress-related mental health problems."
p22141
aS"For more than that I'd suggest looking for trans people's testimonies; I'm not trans, and while I consider myself an ally and repeat what I've been told I can't speak for trans people."
p22142
aS"Take a look at what they've got to say, though."
p22143
aS'Consider Pink Star News, and look for trans bloggers, if you want to learn about it more.'
p22144
aS'Thanks for your explanations, this has helped me better understand the subject.'
p22145
aS"I don't mean to offend anyone as I know this is a touchy subject for many."
p22146
aS"But the way I'm seeing you describe it, I'm struggling to see how it's not a mental issue."
p22147
aS"You mention it's when someone mentally doesn't assoicate with their physical gender and could be sorted through changing their brain chemistry, a fix which could also apply to mental illnesses, if they could medically figure out how to do it?"
p22148
aS"I can understand why a trans person wouldn't want it to be attached to the mental illness label as our current society has put such a huge stigma on mental illnesses."
p22149
aS'People with Depression are often told to just "get over it" so I can see how a trans person basically being told the same thing can be harmful.'
p22150
aS"So surely it's a problem of awareness and how society percieves it then simply reclassifying it as a disorder to something that isn't a mental illness?"
p22151
aS"If someone can clarify that'll be great as I'm willing to learn more about the subject."
p22152
aS"Gender dysphoria is indeed a mental illness, but (for want of a better phrase) trans advocates don't wish for trans people to be seen in this way, for obvious reasons."
p22153
aS"Meanwhile, as 'T' has tacked onto LGB the idea of finding a mental health cure for trans people can easily look like trying to cure gay people of old.. although they are very different situations.. thus it becomes toxic to even talk about in a straightforward manner."
p22154
aS'Just imagine if I thought I were a different race to what I am..'
p22155
aS"I'd be locked up in a mental institute, not provided surgery to black me up."
p22156
aS"&gt;I'm not trans, and while I consider myself an ally and repeat what I've been told\n\n..that says it all really."
p22157
aS"Its more than just 'mental illness has stigma, we're not mentally ill' its that theres a genuine physiological basis in brain chemistry underneath it all."
p22158
aS'Think for a crude analogy of a petrol car trying to run on diesel.'
p22159
aS'You wouldnt expect it to end well for the car.'
p22160
aS'But then you also wouldnt say "this car has a faulty engine" its just being fed the wrong fuel.'
p22161
aS'Many trans people report feeling this general sense of unfocussed depression and anxiety that doesnt dissipate until given hormones... when suddenly it does, before physical changes become apparent.'
p22162
aS'So there are mental health aspects to it, sure.'
p22163
aS'But the underlying condition is physiological. '
p22164
aS'You are describing a mental illness.'
p22165
aS"I'm pretty sure you have to be fully cleared by psychologists and psychiatrists before you can have a sex change operation."
p22166
aS'With upmost respect, I know people who have had a sex change and are in no way convincing at all.'
p22167
aS"There isn't the slightest possibility you would think that the person was a man/women."
p22168
aS'So the operation is there to help the person with regards to how they feel about themselves, however what the operation is trying to do is gain acceptance from others, and this is not achieved.'
p22169
aS"If it was simply a matter of accepting yourself you wouldn't need the opp."
p22170
aS'I am being facetious, but what really is the difference between me feeling like a charming, young, attractive and athletic dream-boat but actually being an old, fat, obnoxious alcoholic?'
p22171
aS"That's how I feel most of the time, because I am drunk, I doubt if I could get liposuction, plastic surgery and MDMA on the NHS."
p22172
aS'Genuine question, do people getting a sex change think that the general population will think they are of the opposite sex?'
p22173
aS"Is that what it's about or am I missing something?"
p22174
aS'Why not?'
p22175
aS"As far as I know it's the only decently effective solution for transgender people."
p22176
aS'If left untreated, their mental health can and often will deteriorate, which can cause depression, increasing amounts of stress, and make them more likely to commit suicide.'
p22177
aS'As it would be expensive for a transgender person to pay for it all themselves, I think the NHS should pay for it.'
p22178
aS"It's not like they're literally going to die without it, but they will probably kill themselves."
p22179
aS'So you as a taxpayer for the NHS and other government services are happy with your Tax money going towards giving people gender reassignment?'
p22180
aS"I'm not sure I am."
p22181
aS"I guess I just don't know how these people feel."
p22182
aS'Must be pretty shitty I suppose to be in that situation but I could never consider killing myself because I am male/female.'
p22183
aS"And again,  I won't lie, I find people that have had surgery to look different a bit odd."
p22184
aS'Same with botox and all that other stuff people pump into themselves.'
p22185
aS'I dunno.'
p22186
aS'I guess I just cant comprehend how looking like a female/male can stop you from killing yourself.'
p22187
aS'I guess I keep imaging kids saying "I want that bag of sweets and if you don\'t give them too me i\'ll jump off this building"\n\n\nI mean, I can totally see why people would get depressed but without that mindset and without knowing what they feel I can\'t judge nor put my opinion in on the matter.'
p22188
aS"I'll stay out of this topic :)"
p22189
aS'Yes.'
p22190
aS"It's normal to not understand something like that."
p22191
aS'Most people would never consider their gender at all.'
p22192
aS"You're stereotyping, though."
p22193
aS'The results of hormone therapy and surgery depend on the original material (how they looked to begin with) and the quality of the surgeon and a fair amount of luck.'
p22194
aS"The stereotypical view of a transgender person is a woman who's clearly a man in a dress, with bolt-on looking fake boobs and too much makeup."
p22195
aS"It's bullshit."
p22196
aS"Chances are you've seen more than one transgender person and had no idea - that's the point."
p22197
aS"And you're very wrong to compare it to children."
p22198
aS'It\'s not "gimme gimme.'
p22199
aS"I'm going to threaten to kill myself unless you give me the shiny surgery."
p22200
aS'" What the hormones and surgery do is bring your body closer in line with what your brain thinks it is, thinks it should see in the mirror.'
p22201
aS"It's valid to have an opinion without being transgender - the thing is you have to know what you're talking about. "
p22202
aS'Any info on the others in the LGBT group?'
p22203
aS'There are big problems with sex education in schools, and a general lack of discussion of LGBT specific issues in PSE classes (such as when discussing bullying, etc.'
p22204
aS').'
p22205
aS'UKIP actually want to stop any kind of sex education being taught in primary schools.'
p22206
aS'Which would presumably include any LGBT issues, even in the context of bullying.'
p22207
aS'Unless they can clarify further. '
p22208
aS"Isn't that more like something for the NHS to change, not central government."
p22209
aS"The government don't make up defined treatment regimes as far as I know. "
p22210
aS'&gt; access to appropriate healthcare is very hit-and-miss.'
p22211
aS'...Welcome to the NHS?'
p22212
aS'My friend was told by her GP that she had CFS and they refused to do anything but give her anti-deps.'
p22213
aS'So she had to go private.'
p22214
aS'Turns out she has cancer.'
p22215
aS'This is the way the NHS is for everyone.'
p22216
aS'Sometimes you have to cycle through several GPs to find a decent one.'
p22217
aS'Trans people are mentally ill, they need psychological help not injections of hormones. '
p22218
aS"It doesn't work"
p22219
aS"apparently it doesn't work for pedos either, what is the solution other than just keeping them in a padded cell? "
p22220
aS'Gender reassignment therapies and surgeries'
p22221
aS'Paid for by the tax payer?'
p22222
aS'No thanks'
p22223
aS'why not'
p22224
aS"Because it's a waste. "
p22225
aS'How is it a waste?'
p22226
aS'Because it is.'
p22227
aS"The government shouldn't pay money to make people feel better, mental health should be privatised.  "
p22228
aS'Do poor people not have the right to feel better? '
p22229
aS"It's not about rich and poor it's about us and them (us tax givers) and them (tax takers)."
p22230
aS"We need a government which doesn't waste money on crap. "
p22231
aS"Why is mental health 'crap'"
p22232
aS"Because it's not a real problem, i'd rather the money was spent on useful things. "
p22233
aS"How isn't it a real problem?"
p22234
aS"Because it's all in their head. "
p22235
aS"Does that mean their problems aren't real?"
p22236
aS"If a person's problem is they look in the mirror and see themselves as a dragon does it make it real? "
p22237
aS"I don't think a human being can be born as a dragon."
p22238
aS'So none then. '
p22239
aS'Better education and support for LGBT folk.'
p22240
aS'Sex ed on lgbt specific issues is pretty shoddy.'
p22241
aS'Plus homophobia would decrease of people actually knew what being LGBT is actually about.'
p22242
aS'Better support for LGBT people under the NHS (though as the other guy said, this probably comes under the umbrella of mental health).'
p22243
aS'Aside from that, there are still a whole bunch of technical issues in various legislation (like I believe there are some issues related to how domestic abuse and rape is handled in LGBT cases).'
p22244
aS'Do people not know what LGBT is all about.'
p22245
aS'Women who like women, men who like men, both who like both and both who are the wrong gender.'
p22246
aS"It's not rocket science. "
p22247
aS'"wrong gender"?'
p22248
aS"Their mental gender doesn't match their physical sex and they feel serious dysmorphia about it. "
p22249
aS'So why is everyone trying to fix the Physical issue rather than the mental issue?'
p22250
aS"I'm asking a genuine question here."
p22251
aS'Everyone seems to be changing their body through surgery and other techniques.'
p22252
aS'but no one seems to want to change their mind.'
p22253
aS"It's a sort of."
p22254
aS"I am a woman in a guy's body."
p22255
aS'You cannot change my mind cause I said so.'
p22256
aS'Please tell me if I am wrong or looking at this incorrectly.'
p22257
aS'I would rather get someone else opinion on the matter.'
p22258
aS"I guess you could crudely compare it to anorexia, It is certainly a mental health issue but you need to treat is as a physical issue also to actually 'treat' it."
p22259
aS'&gt; So why is everyone trying to fix the Physical issue rather than the mental issue?'
p22260
aS'Because a great deal of time and effort has already been put in exploring the possibility of adjusting the mental self image a person has.'
p22261
aS'Up to and including large doses of aversion therapy (i.e.'
p22262
aS'the Gay cure) and ECT.'
p22263
aS"It didn't really work and the medical opinion was that the subconscious can't be changed."
p22264
aS'There were also some reports, from autopsies, that a Transsexual\'s brain does more closely resemble that of the other gender (men &amp; women apparently have different densities in different regions of the brain *shrug*) so the old line of "I\'m a man trapped in a woman\'s body" (or vice versa) may actually be spot on in the case of a Transsexual.\n\n\n\n'
p22265
aS"Of course I'll never have any idea how those people feel."
p22266
aS"But When I wake up I really don't care what gender I am."
p22267
aS"I could wake up tomorrow and feel as if I'm a female and wouldn't care."
p22268
aS'Is this only me or is there something deeper?'
p22269
aS"I mean they could have different brains or whatever but changing your gender surely wouldn't fix that would it?"
p22270
aS'Because it would be far deeper than just feeling like a man/woman.'
p22271
aS"I Guess I'm waiting for the day someone doesn't want to be a female, Changes to a male, then changes back then changes to male again and can't make their mind up."
p22272
aS"Then we would at least have some evidence that it doesn't matter what gender you are you would always feel that way."
p22273
aS"You could honestly change me to a female and I wouldn't complain."
p22274
aS'Except for the periods.'
p22275
aS'Fuck that noise.'
p22276
aS"&gt; But When I wake up I really don't care what gender I am."
p22277
aS"I could wake up tomorrow and feel as if I'm a female and wouldn't care."
p22278
aS"But you didn't, you've known something wasn't quite right with your reflection and how you were expected to interact with the world since a very early age."
p22279
aS'This discontinuity became much worse when you went through puberty and all the other girls developed differently to you.'
p22280
aS"&gt; I mean they could have different brains or whatever but changing your gender surely wouldn't fix that would it?"
p22281
aS'First separate gender from sex.'
p22282
aS"Consider gender to be what's in your head and sex to be what's between your legs (and on your chest), it makes things easier."
p22283
aS'Your gender is set by that mental self image.'
p22284
aS'But fix is the wrong word, it implies a cure or finality to the problem.'
p22285
aS'Even post-operative Transsexuals get issues from the condition, however the surgery (and all other steps that are undertaken) are to make the condition easier to manage. \n'
p22286
aS'&gt;So why is everyone trying to fix the Physical issue rather than the mental issue?'
p22287
aS"I'm guessing you haven't looked into the storied history of 'psychosexual therapy,' of which 'ex-gay' counselling is the most obvious example in the modern age."
p22288
aS"It ranges from counselling, 'prayer therapy,' aversion therapy and electro-convulsive therapy right the way up to brain surgery - and it has never at any point in time been demonstrated to accomplish anything except make the 'patients' kill themselves."
p22289
aS"If you have a great idea for 'reprogramming' gender identity, sexual attraction, body image or sexual behaviour then I encourage you to quickly google it, there is practically nothing that hasn't been tried."
p22290
aS'There was a good ELI5 thread about this which will explain it much better than I ever can:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/31u95d/eli5why_is_a_transgender_person_not_considered_to/\n\nI think basically, the thinking is the brain developed differently from the body in terms of biological sex as male and female brains do have distinct differences.'
p22291
aS"Trans people can't change their personality, self-identity or brain chemistry just by wishing really hard any more than you or I could."
p22292
aS"Gender dysmorphia has tangible biological causes that predate a person's birth."
p22293
aS'For many people affected by this, sex reassignment represents a real solution to what would otherwise be an unimaginably poor quality of life.'
p22294
aS'Because we can\'t "fix" the brain.'
p22295
aS"Far as I know, we don't enough about it."
p22296
aS'And would it be possible anyway?'
p22297
aS"Once it's set, it's set."
p22298
aS"If you're an adult, your body has done it's development."
p22299
aS'Would it be possible to change the brain at that point?'
p22300
aS'And even if it were, would it be ethical?'
p22301
aS"It's a significant part of that person's identity you'd be changing."
p22302
aS'It\'s not a "you can\'t change my mind because I said so" it\'s "You can\'t change my mind because it\'s biology, not belief". '
p22303
aS"I think it's something that as a non-trans person I have no comprehension of."
p22304
aS"I just don't want to seem like a dick by putting words in trans people's mouths."
p22305
aS"I'm sure there are some trans people who find psychotherapy helpful, but that doesn't seem to be enough to rid them of their dysmorphia. "
p22306
aS"I believe the rationale is that with current levels of medical knowledge we don't know how to fix the mental issue, so the only option is to fix the physical issue."
p22307
aS"Presumably ones gender is determined by physical structures in the brain, so hypothetically at some point in the future when our knowledge of neuroscience is greater it may be possible to perform surgery that alters ones gender, but that would be horrendously complicated and it's not going to be possible any time soon. "
p22308
aS'But how does looking like a female/male fix that?'
p22309
aS'Does it just.. feel better to not look like a female/male anymore?'
p22310
aS'Because deep down you still are.'
p22311
aS'&gt; Because deep down you still are.'
p22312
aS'Care to elaborate?'
p22313
aS'Just my own silly thoughts.'
p22314
aS"Being born a gender and changing it in my view doesn't change who you really are."
p22315
aS"If you were born a woman I'd see you as a woman first man later if you decided to change that."
p22316
aS"I don't think you can do 100% Female or 100% male, I've seen some Trans and imo they don't look so pretty."
p22317
aS'Kinda weird looking if we are being honest here.'
p22318
aS'Like something was forced to change.'

aS"I've heard it compared to gay conversion therapy."
p22326
aS'People who are gay who undergo gay conversion therapy to try to "turn them straight" often end up (a) not straight and (b) suicidal as a result of attempting to live a lie.'

p22341
aS"I do agree that there shouldn't be any discrimination in law, or in employment.  "
p22342
aS'These are not "opinions" these are serious mental health problems.'
p22343
aS'There shouldnt be discrimination in the NHS system at all and protective legislation to back up transgender patients who DO suffer discrimination would go a hell of a way.'

aS"At the moment it's up the the whim of the GP you first see and the GIC you get reffered to."
p22345
aS"Unification of discrimination laws to explicitly protect trans patients and enforce that GIC's actually follow the rule set they are given is like a very basic thing that goes a hell of a long way."
p22346
aS"Well, I said above that I'm against discrimination in law or in employment.\n\n"

p22404
aS"Furthermore, you don't have a RIGHT to donate blood anyway."
p22405

aS"I'm a fucking person not a statistic."

aS'No, you ARE a statistic.'
p22412
aS'We are all statistics.'
p22413
aS'These measures are present for several reasons.'
p22414
aS'Firstly, because eliminating risky parts of the donor pool is the most effective way to prevent infected blood from entering the supply chain.'
p22415
aS'We do screen batches of blood (several donations pooled, then tested together - and each individually tested if there is a positive), but no test is 100%.'
p22416
aS'Therefore, risk prevention is taken at every step of the way.'
p22417
aS'Yes, sadly by simply being gay your risk is higher.'
p22418
aS"You may hate being told that, but it's the trust."
p22419
aS"It's not simply about YOU though."
p22420
aS'You date other gay guys, who are also statistically way more likely to be HIV+ than a random straight member of the UK public.'
p22421
aS"That's one reason why HIV is so much more prevalent within the gay community, because you're sharing the same dating pool."
p22422
aS"You could turn up with a fresh certificate, but it still wouldn't show if you had very recently contracted HIV - which again is more likely because of being gay."
p22423
aS"And as I said, if I just got back from Thailand then I also couldn't donate."
p22424
aS'They even prevent previous transfusion recipients from donating.'
p22425
aS"It's the same reason we don't pay for donations - because it would attract more risky people."
p22426
aS'And again, nobody has a "right" to donate blood.'
p22427

aS"Being gay isn't what spreads HIV."
p22442
aS"It doesn't magically appear in the blood of gays."
p22443
aS"The reason it's more common in gays is due to lack of education; many don't use condoms because pregnancy isn't a risk."
p22444
aS"It's nothing to do with sharing a dating pool; especially as the rule excludes all gay people not just those who are active within the gay community."
p22445
aS"And yeah, it might not be a right, but that doesn't mean it's okay to talk to gay people like their subhuman when it comes to issues like this."

aS'A staggering percentage of people with HIV are unaware of the fact, and however sad/unpleasant/provocative it might be the fact remains a gay person is more than twenty times as likely to be HIV+ than a heterosexual person.'
p22450
aS"The fact they 'test' the blood is **not some sort of guarantee** of safety, since like all immunological assays it's not 100% effective."
p22451
aS"If you want gay people to be permitted to donate blood on the same terms as heterosexual people then I suggest you divert your energies to encouraging young people to take HIV as seriously as they did in the early 90s - the prevalence of riskier sexual behaviour (in both gay and straight young people) in the age of HAART where people don't necessarily think of HIV as an effective death sentence is increasing every year."
p22452
aS'Your last paragraph sums up my views perfectly.'
p22453
aS"I'd much rather time and energy were put into education and explaining why and how to avoid hiv, rather than just being told we're high risk."
p22454
aS"I'll also admit my experience is based on going to sexual health clinic rather than giving blood (since obviously I can't give blood) "
p22455
aS"I think part of the problem is that you're considering this personally as an individual, whereas anyone charged with looking after public health has to consider generalities."

aS"They don't know you, or your partner."
p22463
aS"They can use as much of your sexual history as you'll admit (and believe me when I tell you people lie about that all the time) to colour their assessment of your individual *absolute* risk, but in population terms simply by being a sexually active gay male you are at 'high risk' (relative to the baseline) for a whole host of STDs."
p22464
aS"One of the favourite stories of my (spectacularly gay, Karaoke Drag Queen) GUM doctor friend is the number of people who simply cannot understand *how* they caught X, Y or Z because the few people they'd slept with **swore** they were either virgins or neurotic about protection."
p22465
aS"Recognising this isn't discriminatory - this idea actually boggles my mind since forcing the government to **recognise** the disparity in STD rates and make appropriate provision in Sexual Health clinics to deal with the problem was a very long battle and something of a triumph for the civil rights activists of days gone by."
p22466
aS"Just take a step back for a moment and consider that - irrespective of how it makes you feel - the fact that you sleep with men increases your likelihood of contracting or carrying various STDs, then ask yourself if it's better the government recognises that fact (and ALL its implications, ranging from appropriate provision for sexual health to restrictions on blood donation) or ignores reality and just lets things unfold as they will."

p22921
aS"So you've got less time to work on your professional qualification in the evening - a professional qualification that your company only pays for 80% of the costs of, whereas your colleages of other demographics get funding covering 100%."
p22922
aS"And while we're talking about your job, you're getting paid 10% less than the person hired the same day, with the same qualifications and experience, doing the same job, just because of your demographic, because it's perfectly legal to do that."
p22923
aS"The result is, you get paid less and your pay doesn't go as far because you've got to pay more for services or you've got to travel further to get to them."
p22924
aS'Solely on the basis of your gender, race, sexuality, whatever.'

aS"You can't buy essential supplies to help you get out of that abusive relationship, because you don't have the time to travel to the nearest shop that will serve you."
p22931
aS"So you're stuck in this abusive relationship, because discrimination by businesses means you can't get the things you need to escape it."
p22932
aS'And all this is because businesses can discriminate.'
p22933
aS"Even if they can only discriminate against customers, and not staff or in hiring practices, it still stands - there's still the problem of those who get discriminated against having to travel further or pay more for the same service."
p22934
aS'Now, sure, this is a fairly dystopic scenario.'

aS'And sure, in many of those cases good people in the area will be "well, that\'s not on" and boycott any business that acts like that.'
p22940
aS"But a lot of people won't bother to take action, or will make excuses for not taking action (it's the most convenient shop, I don't have time to go to the next nearest, I don't know where there's another shop that sells this item) and continue spending money with such unethical businesses."
p22941
aS"And the result is that certain people in certain areas will get caught up in that situation, stuck, unable to do anything about it, because it's al perfectly legal."
p22942

p22965
aS'Yes, this is what I was trying to say.'
p22966
aS"It's a necessary law, because it's something the market cannot provide, and because people are irrational/uninformed/prejudiced."

aS"If people shunned thieves (which most people would readily do if thieves were readily identifiable), then this wouldn't stop them."

aS'If anything, thievery would increase, owing to the people concerned being ostracised from normal society.'
p22985
aS"But as I've said, I think we *do* need anti discrimination laws!"
p22986
aS"Because, as history has shown us, people *aren't* capable of self-regulating using pure market forces."

aS"Because having laws in place basically says 'we don't trust people not to discriminate'."

aS'I then pointed out that *this particular argument* applies equally well to other laws, such as stealing and murder (which it does), and so is a silly reason to dislike them.'
p22995
aS'Even if market forces would work, the process *at best* is slow and offers no individual protection to consumers who are at risk of being discriminated against in any instance that it happens.'
p22996
aS"And besides, it's obvious that it wouldn't always work since the existence of discriminatory businesses in the first place already demonstrates that a certain segment of the population is okay with discrimination."
p22997
aS'And further, even disregarding those issues, if market forces not only worked but were actually quite effective at fighting discrimination, so what?'
p22998
aS'Every now and then discrimination would still pop up, so what benefit could possibly be derived from scrapping the laws?'
p22999
aS'Again, what it comes back to, the only reason you\'ve given for considering the laws to be a negative and harmful thing (as opposed to simply a potentially unnecessary thing) such that we would actually *benefit* in the slightest from getting rid of them, is the perceived insult that "we are not trusted".'
p23000

p23209

p23221
aS"&gt; Spousal Veto\n\nThat's a thing?"
p23222
aS'Wow.'
p23223
aS'I mean, I can see divorcing someone who wants to/does transition, but having a veto on what someone else does with their body... again, just wow.'
p23224
aS"It doesn't mean that at all from what I've read online."
p23225
aS"A spousal veto is the non-trans partner's ability to veto an already established marriage (be it hetero or homosexual) changing to the other kind of marriage upon issue of a GRC (Gender Reassignment Certificate)."
p23226
aS'So, in an example, Amy and Brian get married, Brian is awarded a GRC, Amy has the ability to prevent the marriage from continuing under the new, same-sex relationship.'
p23227
aS"I don't see a problem with this in principle, the only real argument against it is that it's unnecessary as it takes 2 years (plenty of time to initiate divorce) before a GRC can be issued, and presumably the partners in a marriage would be fully aware of their partner's feelings."
p23228
aS"I still however, think it's a good thing to have in the event the restrictions of the time frame for a GRC are severely reduced."
p23229
aS'I also think it\'s good as a "last opportunity" threshold for the non-trans partner to decide whether or not they\'re happy for the marriage to continue.'
p23230
aS"What I don't get is the strong opposition to this really."
p23231
aS'It used to be that a spouse could prevent the other from obtaining a GRC, which is patently unfair, but the new rule seems to be balancing.'
p23232
aS'The trans partner can unilaterally seek to amend the marriage arrangement, it makes sense that the other has the ability to decline that this occurs.'
p23233
aS"If I've misunderstood what the spousal veto is, please tell me, but if I'm right, I think it could be argued that this is akin to a human right of the non-trans person to be able to select who they are married to."
p23234
aS'Better transition support for transgender people'
p23235
aS'Is that something the government micro manages?'
p23236
aS'Seems like an inner NHS treatment issue.'

p23238
aS'The [NICE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence) is a part of the Department of Health, and offers guidelines for NHS procedures across the country.'
p23239
aS"So I guess yeah, it's down the chain but easily influenced by legislation."
p23240
aS'The precedent is sets though?'
p23241
aS"From what I can tell they're meant to act independently using published academic research to best decide what treatments to offer and not to offer."
p23242
aS"If they're not doing that correctly, then that's worth addressing as an issue in itself."
p23243
aS"Making a special case for trans people when the science isn't yet conclusive seems like a bad idea even if I sympathise with them."
p23244
aS"I'm not saying the science isn't conclusive (I don't know if it is/isn't) but as I said above, if it is then we should find out why NICE hasn't already implemented proper treatment and solve that problem as it might solve problems that more than just trans people are having."
p23245
aS'What does that mean in practice, in terms of things that the government can do?'
p23246

p23250
aS"High suicide rates certainly need investigating, that doesn't mean everything else can be ignored entirely. "

p23321
aS'Explain why suicide rates are still higher among LGBT people.'

p23325
aS'Explain why there is not enough support for LGBT in the NHS.'
p23326
aS"That's just a handful of cases of where LGBT people are still unequal."
p23327
aS'If you seriously think that everyone is on a completely equal footing, then you are ignorant and need to educate yourself...'
p23328
aS"Most people feel awkward when straight couples make out in public, the reason it's probably met with less hostility is because men are less violent against a woman than they would be with two males."
p23329
aS'Suicide rate seems irrelevant to rights.'
p23330
aS'Sex education is a joke as it is, it\'s basically "don\'t get pregnant", I\'d say it\'s equally shit for everybody and that\'s a sex education issue, not a LGBT in sex education issue.'
p23331
aS"Because when you have a man using a woman's bathroom, it upsets women, when you have a woman using a male bathroom, it makes men feel awkward."
p23332
aS"I didn't realise police ignored domestic violence if they where gay and I find that hard to believe, but if you have a source do show me."
p23333
aS"I don't see why homosexual would need more treatment than a straight person in an NHS hospital."
p23334

p23337
aS'That is equality, true equality.'
p23338

p23341
aS'&gt; Suicide rate seems irrelevant to rights.'
p23342
aS"It indicates that there is a problem that society is failing to address\n\n&gt;Because when you have a man using a woman's bathroom, it upsets women, when you have a woman using a male bathroom, it makes men feel awkward."
p23343
aS'The problem is that trans people are discriminated against regardless of what gender bathroom they go in.'
p23344
aS'A male-to-female transsexual will be attacked in a male bathroom for being too feminine, and attacked in a female bathroom for not being feminine enough.'
p23345
aS"&gt;I didn't realise police ignored domestic violence if they where gay and I find that hard to believe, but if you have a source do show me."
p23346
aS'There is generally less support networks open for LGBT domestic violence issues.'
p23347
aS"Also, I believe some laws don't adequately cover these cases (for example rape law doesn't cover female on female rape)."
p23348
aS"&gt; I don't see why homosexual would need more treatment than a straight person in an NHS hospital."
p23349
aS"Trans I agree with but that's simply mental health not having enough funding, not a LGBT specific issue."
p23350
aS'See the part about higher suicide rates... Also some sexual health related issues are specific towards LGBT people and are not adequately covered in our current system.'
p23351
aS'&gt;There is nothing an LGBT person cannot get, I as a straight while male cannot get.'
p23352
aS'That is equality, true equality.'
p23353
aS'And as a gay, white male, I can categorically state that this is absolute bullshit.'
p23354
aS"You can be openly heterosexual on the street, I can't be openly homosexual without receiving abuse."
p23355
aS'If you got beaten up for holding hands with your boyfriend, you would have the exact same rights as if I was beaten up for any reason to have the attacker arrested for assault.'
p23356
aS"That's not an issue with rights, that's an issue with the publics uncomfortabilities."
p23357
aS'The government treats gays being assaulted and straights being assaulted equally.'
p23358
aS"Yes, but it's irrelevant to rights, and that's what we're talking about."
p23359
aS"You can't stop people being uncomfortable with trans people in their bathrooms, again you said attacked, if they're assaulted for being in the wrong bathroom that is subject to the exact same punishment as if I was assaulted for wandering into the wrong bathroom."
p23360
aS"It's equal."
p23361
aS'Female on anybody rape is something fixing.'
p23362
aS"It's not just lesbian rape, a female cannot rape *anybody* even if she drugged you, strapped you down and gave you boner enducing drugs and raped you for a week, it would be sexual assault."
p23363
aS"I know a man who has been raped by a woman and he was laughed at, that isn't a strictly LGBT issue, that's a female in sexual assault issue."
p23364
aS'Yes, which is why mental health in general needs additional funding.'
p23365
aS"It's not just trans people suffering from poor mental health, depression, dementia, the elderly are all (depressingly) equal in their poor treatment \n\nThe issue here isn't that LGBT has any less rights than others, they don't."
p23366
aS"In the eyes of the law LGBT and straight people are exactly the same, it's public perception."
p23367
aS"But if you want to tell women to not feel uncomfortable changing in front of what used to be a man, and still looks like a man, well you're going to have a difficult job."
p23368
aS"And like I said, it's already illegal to abuse you for being gay and holding hands, how can the government make it *more* illegal?"
p23369
aS'You already have the right to not be attacked for being gay, just as I have the right to not be attacked at all. '
p23370
aS'But the point is that yes homophobia and transphobia is a social issue.'
p23371
aS'However things can be done at a government level to limit how much an LGBT person is affected by homophobia and transphobia.'
p23372
aS"As long as an LGBT person can't feel free to be themselves, they are not equal in society."
p23373
aS'LGBT rights campaigners these days campaign for the right of LGBT folk to be equal not just in law but in society as well.'
p23374
aS'Sure.'
p23375
aS'But everybody should be equal in the law.'
p23376
aS'Change society as much as you want with voulenteer campaigns but as soon as you make the punishment for attacking a LGBT person worse, or longer than attacking a straight person you will create animosity.'
p23377
aS'You want to make people stop being homophobic by choice, not by fear.'
p23378
aS"It's similar to where a lot of anti Islam and racist sentiment comes from."
p23379
aS'People are no less racist than they used to be, they just fear showing it now.'
p23380
aS'Ex "you fucking cunt" will get you disciplined.'
p23381
aS'"you fucking nword" will end your career.'
p23382
aS'This actually makes a worse situation for Muslims because it\'s silent resentment, stopping people talking to them at all, fearing rightly or wrongly they might "say the wrong thing" and be disproportionately punished.'
p23383
aS'The last thing the LGBT community needs is MORE animosity because the law is stacked in their favour, causing resentment with the average, most likely not too intelligent person.'
p23384
aS'So yes, my original point was there is nothing in the law that gives me as a straight male any more or less power than a homosexual.'
p23385
aS"Yes, a homosexual may have a harder time socially, especially with older people, but as soon as you start punishing people further for that, it's only going to build resentment which nobody benefits from. \n\n"
p23386
aS"If someone can't talk to a black person or a Muslim without thinking they're going to use a slur, that's something they need to talk over with a therapist."

aS'Straight couples can and do show affection in public.'
p23388
aS'They tested this in America.'

p23394
aS'A political party really should have policies which address these legal and social matters. '
p23395
aS'yeah they have a policy about making sure that veterans get easy access mental health treatment due to the higher rates of suicide or something, right?'
p23396
aS"that *is* a special interest group seeing as its not consistent - otherwise they would've included trans people there too."
p23397
aS'It says they will fund an extra \xc2\xa31.5 billion for mental health and dementia care over 5 years.'

aS'http://www.ukip.org/ukip_manifesto_summary\n\n&gt;Invest an extra \xc2\xa31.5 billion into mental health and dementia services over the next five years '
p23400
aS"As far as I'm aware LGBLT have the same rights I do, I'm sure that's equality enough in UKIP's eyes to warrant not needing a special section in their manifesto about making them *more* equal."
p23401
aS"And if they have mental health issues and crime issues, surely that'd fit into Health and Crime sections, no?"
p23402
aS'They have the same theoretical rights, perhaps, but so too do black people.'
p23403
aS"You can't say, however, that there aren't still racists out there."

p23411
aS'Nothing much else really needed coming from someone in the LGBT community.'
p23412
aS"Don't see the issue."
p23413
aS"I never understood why gay marriage is such a big deal, rather than it just being symbolic of changing attitudes (but that's just my opinion, as I never had an interest in getting married anyway)."
p23414
aS"the real issues are the higher suicide rate for gay teens, 42% of trans people saying they've attempted suicide, the higher rate of homelessness for lgbt people (kicked out of their homes etc), lack of sex education for anything 'gay' (this is genuinely dangerous!"
p23415
aS") and changing attitudes so this doesn't happen. "
p23416
aS"It's a big deal because it's just a right that heterosexual couples had but, for a long time, homosexual couples lacked."
p23417
aS'Equal rights and all.'
p23418
aS'Maybe we could start by scrapping the "LGBT" category and treat them individually.'
p23419
aS"I've never seen the rationale for transgenderism to be tacked onto LGB, given they are all about sexual preference and quite distinct from gender identification issues."
p23420
aS'It is actually quite odd these days I agree.'
p23421
aS"The problem stems from the fact that in days of old the T really did just mean Transsexual's and as a group they were usually G, L or indeed B."
p23422
aS"So it did kind of work, to a degree and you could understand why they'd be included."
p23423
aS"Getting the main issues sorted as far as GLB went would sort out some issues as far as the T's were concerned."
p23424
aS"Very rapidly though the T started to include not just Transsexual's but also other entities (Transvestites, pure fetishistic crossdressers, etc.)..."
p23425
aS'who are by and large heterosexual and want very different things to a TS.'
p23426
aS'For example, for the majority of Transvestites a gender recognition certificate or the ability to be married to someone of the same sex is neither use nor ornament.'
p23427
aS'To use an old and probably quite out of date statistic:  1 in 10 men is a crossdressser of some description, 1 in 50,000 is a M2F TS.'
p23428
aS"The Transsexual's quickly became a minority within the Trans community and the general backstabbing, politicking and arse about face behavior that endears us to no one that anyone who's been involved in the GLBT/LGBT community for the last few decades has witnessed began."

aS'same'
p23431
aS'If there was discrimination occurring against black people - hold on what do I mean "if", but anyway - would you say the right way to approach this would be to ban talking about racial categories and discrimination and treat people as individuals?'

p23433
aS'I think transgender people get the really shitty end of the stick, I believe the problems they go through are on an entirely different level.'

aS'Whereas I think people are willing to accept gay and lesbian people, there are still problems yes, but from all the people I know that are gay or lesbian they have very few problems and are mostly happy.'
p23435
aS"I don't see the need to categorise them all in the same tag."
p23436
aS"I don't know why you're mentioning discrimination of black people, again most people I know experience next to no problems."
p23437
aS'Sorry I thought you meant treat people as individuals and ignore their sexuality/transgender status, it turns out you actually meant treat LGB and T separately.'

p23439
aS"I'll be brutally honest."

p24067
aS'TV shone a light on him and people saw.'
p24068
aS'And if it was a strategy to shore up a core vote, well what does that say about super soaraway Nigel? '
p24069
aS'That the core voter targeted by his party is not one that should be given the reins?'
p24070
aS'That really makes little sense.'
p24071
aS"I'm going to ignore the being given the reins bit because that really doesn't help the start of what I suppose is a proposition and sounds silly."
p24072
aS'Are you implying that the core voters are ordinary people he is reaching to?'

p24082
aS'I feel so conflicted when I read UKIP stuff and agree with it...'
p24083
aS"Their stances on Multiculturalism and Secularism are pretty understandable, it's shame that the other parties can't take a stronger stand on this rather than Carbon Copying each others stances on the issue."
p24084
aS'It annoys me quite a bit considering I disagree with UKIP on pretty much everything else. '
p24085
aS'Who did not see this sort of thing coming when we had to elect them'
p24086
aS'Knowing the private investments and economic interests of MPs is usually pretty enlightening, especially when they would be voting  on policies directly counter to their own self-interest.'

aS"I'm actually surprised that the proportion of landlord MPs isn't higher. "

aS"Property in relative's names will not be shown here...."

aS'It would be interesting to look at whether being on this list affected how they voted compared to other MPs. '
p24090
aS"Yeah that's good idea."
p24091
aS'Who ever created this website should include a link to show their voting on policies on housing.'
p24092
aS'...So what?'
p24093
aS'Is the fact that these MPs are landlords supposed to be a bad thing?'
p24094
aS'they are not going to be big proponents of building lots of  houses which may bring down prices and their income is one thought.'
p24095
aS'Or regulating a completely out of control buy to let market.'
p24096
aS"You can't say that for certain."
p24097
aS"I'm a landlord, and I'd happily support building more houses."
p24098
aS'We fucking need them at the end of the day!'
p24099
aS"You could also argue that because they're landlords they're more aware of the details of renting property, where the law is too lax or too restrictive, and better understand the effect that legislation change may have on the market."
p24100
aS'Or not.'
p24101
aS"Again there's no telling anything for certain just because they are landlords."
p24102
aS"Thinking about it it's also worth noting that by design, a lot of serving MPs weren't born + raised in central London, so it's perfectly natural that they may have a house elsewhere that they're renting while acting as an MP and living near to the house of commons."
p24103
aS'Or not...'
p24104
aS'These are a perfectly good and valid points!'
p24105
aS'The reality however is there has been very little housing built and the Gov has done nothing.'
p24106
aS"Conflating MP's rentals and this fact is a not a direct correlation, but it is relevant. \n\n"
p24107
aS'Also a very good point!'
p24108
aS"I do suspect though that the reasons we don't build enough houses in this country are considerably more complex than simply MPs serving their own vested interests."
p24109
aS"For one thing, a large percentage of *voters* don't want to see more houses built!"
p24110
aS"Of course it's quite complicated, but the only way we will get more housing is for the national government to change some regulations."
p24111
aS'NIMBYism is the biggest problem here for sure :)'
p24112
aS'Yeah, only those that already own their homes (which were built on greenfields)\n\nBoomer Nimbys should not be allowed to hold up housebuilding because they like the view out of their window or they take their dog to a nice field for it to shit all over.'
p24113
aS"&gt;a large percentage of voters don't want to see more houses built *near them*.\n\n"
p24114
aS'You can tell how many MPs support building more houses by looking at how many have supported it.'

aS'Hardly any.'

p24127
aS'and almost no light pollution'
p24128
aS"Wouldn't have had a powerful Royal Navy!"
p24129
aS"That's actually largely a myth."
p24130
aS'Yes British wood was used to build naval ships, but there is no way over the centuries it made more than a slight nibble into the overall woodland amount.'
p24131
aS'For example, through the middle ages, more timber went into buildings than ever went to ships.'
p24132
aS'Most was removed due to changing land use, and increased agriculture and herding.'
p24133
aS'I hear you.'
p24134
aS"Wouldn't have expected naval use to have been particularly large until the 18th Century."
p24135
aS'Interestingly, what little remained (especially in England) after WWI (lots used for trench construction) lead to the creation of the Forestry Commission.'
p24136
aS'&gt; Interestingly, what little remained (especially in England) after WWI (lots used for trench construction) lead to the creation of the Forestry Commission.'
p24137
aS'Which lead to the the Borders and Scotland getting planted with huge regimentally planted swathes of quick-growing pine, which was kind of a good / bad thing.'
p24138
aS'I know at Kielder Forest, just south of the border, they have been actively clearing regimented areas and planting with a wider variety, to rejuvenate the ecosystem.'
p24139
aS'Not sure if it is happening as well in Scotland.\n\n'
p24140
aS'Not where I live.'
p24141
aS'Landowners plant trees, mostly Scots Pine, on their land, wait a few years then advertise "Woodland for Sale".'
p24142
aS"It's not the land but the trees which are for sale."
p24143
aS'The machinery moves in and totally strips the area leaving swathes of brushwood and a jumble of rocks.'
p24144
aS'3 or 4 years later, trees are planted, ----- and so it goes on.'
p24145
aS"It's a cash crop, and to hell with the wildlife."
p24146
aS'The only "good" forests are owned by the RSPB and other charities.'
p24147
aS'Kielder has a commercial side to it too, but is closely managed.'
p24148
aS'The clearances are planned and areas left unplanted so as to stimulate more wildlife.'
p24149
aS'Shame not all forests are managed so well :/'
p24150
aS'A lot was used for salt production, to heat salt pans.'
p24151
aS'And I think a fair bit was used to make charcoal for metal working. '
p24152
aS"Charcoal burning (at least in Britain) is a weird one, charcoal burners actually *managed* the forests to a degree, Instead of hacking and chopping they coppiced / pruned trees for the wood they wanted and promoted growth so probably didn't reduce it as much as alter it slightly. "
p24153
aS'Hmm.'
p24154
aS'Thanks for educating me mate! '
p24155
aS"Presumably altered it considerably though I'd guess."
p24156
aS'A forest of small coppiced hazel would be quite a different habitat to one of mature trees, right? '
p24157
aS'Whilst the place names may well be detailed, the map is inaccurate.'
p24158
aS'The coastline of England was not the same in the 5th century as it was in the 9th century, and neither is the same as the coastline in the 20th century, which this map uses.'
p24159
aS'Just looking at a few areas is a complete giveaway - Winchelsea used to be a port, Romney Marsh and Canvey had significantly submerged areas, and the coastline around the Wash was very different.'
p24160
aS"Whilst this map is interesting, it's not particularly useful historically."
p24161
aS"&gt; The coastline of England was not the same\n\nI've always found Morecambe Bay interesting, I don't know how much the sands have shifted over time, in more recent times we've come to regard it as part of the sea, but in previous years it was (when the tide was out) viewed as land, pushing the boundary of Lancashire over to Barrow which is now Cumbria."
p24162
aS'There are still guided walks which take people across the sands, but a lot of the old coach houses round the bay show old pictures of it being a favoured route for travellers.'
p24163
aS'The boundary of Lancashire went all the way up to Coniston (Coniston Old Man was even in Lancashire), driving down the east shore of Windermere you can still see an old marker showing where Westmorland ended and Lancashire began.'
p24164
aS'Being from Furness, I did wonder why it was formerly part of Lancashire, the old Lonsdale Hundred, and we still use the term North Lonsdale, but your comment explains why!'
p24165
aS"&gt; Coniston Old Man was even in Lancashire\n\nI knew there was a reason that's my favourite walk!"
p24166
aS'Plus "Dark Ages" isn\'t really a thing anymore.'
p24167
aS"I don't think Historians even use the term."
p24168
aS"I'm a historian with the University of Cambridge and we use the term Dank Ages now."
p24169
aS'haha, well memed my friend. '
p24170
aS'I hate myself.'
p24171
aS'Fascinating!'
p24172
aS"I had no idea that's the case - where would I find more info on what's changed, do you know?"
p24173
aS"Very nice map, but the term 'Dark Ages' isn't really used much by historians any more."
p24174
aS"It's a hangover from an older period that was intended to illustrate the decline of the Roman Empire (the 'light')."
p24175
aS"A throwback to an older school of thought that saw the Roman Empire being 'overrun' by 'barbarians' as being an inherently bad thing."
p24176
aS'&gt;The term once characterized the bulk of the Middle Ages, or roughly the 6th to 13th centuries, as a period of intellectual darkness between extinguishing the "light of Rome" after the end of Late Antiquity, and the rise of the Italian Renaissance in the 14th century.'
p24177
aS'This definition is still found in popular use, but increased recognition of the accomplishments of the Middle Ages has led to the label being restricted in application.'
p24178
aS'Since the 20th century, it is frequently applied to the earlier part of the era, the Early Middle Ages (c. 5th\xe2\x80\x9310th century).However, many modern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the Middle Ages.'
p24179
aS"It's generally considered poor form to use the term 'Dark Ages' in scholarly conversation, instead you can use the terms Early Middle Age, Middle Age and High Middle age (which is then of course proceeded by the Renaissance).\n\n\n\n"
p24180
aS'Is this a lesson in historian PC?'
p24181
aS'Check your high middle age privilege shitlord.'
p24182
aS'Darklord.'
p24183
aS'Calling the darklord he-who-must-not-be-named is the pinnacle of PC gone mad!'
p24184
aS"Seeing your location, I'll ask you what I asked elsewhere in this thread: have you managed to find Oxford on the map?"
p24185
aS"I've found Eynsham, Wantage, Abingdon (Abbundun hope all ye who enter) and Thame, but nothing at the confluence of the Cherwell and the Thames."
p24186
aS'Am I missing something?'
p24187
aS'Oxford is where Cherwell meets the Thames, so it should be just underneath the "ham" where it says "Egonesham".'
p24188
aS"Perhaps Oxford didn't exist at the time?"
p24189
aS'Haha the Abingdon name is pretty hilarious!'
p24190
aS"&gt; where Cherwell meets the Thames\n\nPsst that's what 'confluence' means."
p24191
aS';)'
p24192
aS'You and your high middle ages language!'
p24193
aS'This conversaion just made me realise something.'
p24194
aS'Like the final scene in The Usual Suspects:\n\nConfluence.'
p24195
aS'Effluent.'
p24196
aS'Flow.'
p24197
aS'Chimney flue.'
p24198
aS"They're all related."
p24199
aS'And all of them are leading up to... log flume. '
p24200
aS'Interesting, so it was possibly originally an offshoot of Eynsham (note the locals pronounce it "En-shum") which is on the list.'
p24201
aS"It makes sense that it wasn't an original conurbation since Oxford is essentially a swamp."
p24202
aS"It isn't really PC."
p24203
aS'It is that the whole mentality towards that time period is misleading.'
p24204
aS'The Roman Empire fell because it was functionally achieving less with its resources than the barbarians were doing.'
p24205
aS'To characterise this as the fall of civilisation is daft.'
p24206
aS"Well we don't want to upset any Visigoths or Franks reading this now do we?\n\n\n\n\n"
p24207
aS'It was Petrarch that really coined the "Dark Age" term, wasn\'t it?'
p24208
aS'Succeeded by the Renaissance surely?'
p24209
aS"I've also heard the term 'Migration Period' used  describe the Saxon and Viking eras. "
p24210
aS'Periodisation is always a funny thing.'
p24211
aS"It's nice to chop up history in periods to make sense but sometimes the tropes get overblown (cf."
p24212
aS"'Dark Ages')."
p24213
aS'Now a lot of historians refer to the period between the end of the Western Roman Emp.'
p24214
aS"to the early Middle Ages as 'Late Antiquity'."
p24215
aS'The Migration period refers to the end of the Western Roman Emp.'
p24216
aS'to around 800AD where a lot of the migrationary peoples/tribes/confederations/what-ever-people-call-them stopped moving and started settling down.'
p24217
aS'So Goths, Vandals, Huns, Lombards, Franks, Angles, Jutes, Saxons, Vikings, Slavs, Burgundians just to name a few.'
p24218
aS"And as trivia you can also note a lot of the names of countries and regions derive from said 'people' in history like Burgundy, England, Lombardy, etc."
p24219
aS"'The Dark Ages' sounds way too cool not to use."
p24220
aS"I've seen this a few times and the reasoning is actually a little more subtle than what is usually made out."
p24221
aS'The reason is historian\'s dislike putting a "flavouring" term onto *any* era of history, not necessarily whether it\'s true or not.'
p24222
aS'Many scholars would have just as much objection to calling an era of innovation the "Light" ages, because they prefer utmost neutrality in all things.'
p24223
aS"I don't see the problem of using it in common parlance though, since the reason the objection was made only really applies to people who study it for a living."
p24224
aS"Most people probably won't be aware of the nuances in the middle ages-- and the dark ages are a catch-all term which everyone knows."
p24225
aS'It seems to be quite strange that people almost seem offended when you refer to the era as the Dark Ages in Europe, but almost unquestionably and by virtually all metrics the early middle ages were the "darker" ages, compared to what was before and after them.'
p24226
aS"That's not to say there weren't events and outcomes of colossal significance to everything that follow in this era, indeed it was as significant as any other point in history, before or after, but it seems to me bizarre to get so uppity about labelling an era of regression as such."
p24227
aS"For instance, the greek dark age is still labelled the greek dark age and I've never seen anyone criticize it."
p24228
aS'And besides all this, there is the sheer literal fact that they were the Dark Ages, because we have only the vaguest idea what happened for most of it, since the historical record is scant to nonexistent.'
p24229
aS"And not just obscure things which only historians care about, but huge and important events such as wars of major consequence and kings who are responsible for the fate of modern nations can sometimes be scarcely placed within a century or two, or don't even get names apart from obscure mythos written sometimes centuries later."
p24230
aS'Compare this to the classical era where the literary record is so abundant, we can often pinpoint the exact motivation of rulers or how soldiers were feeling on a particular day. '
p24231
aS'Are you actually being serious?'
p24232
aS"The 'Dark Ages' isn't acceptable even in common parlance because it's flat-out wrong (I highly doubt a physicist would like it if people called gravity velocity or something like that, for instance) - it encourages the incredibly out-dated Whiggish and teleological attitude of history as the relentless march of progress, while also being incredibly Eurocentric (the Middle East and China were by no means stagnant) and looking over things like the Carolingian Renaissance in the ninth century."
p24233
aS"The Middle Ages were a period of history that saw the emergence of things like universities, urbanisation, parliaments and sophisticated financial systems, it certainly wasn't an 'era of regression'."
p24234
aS'Your last paragraph is also wholly inaccurate.'
p24235
aS"There isn't an 'abundant' literary record for the classical era (especially ancient Greece), even when compared to the stereotypical 'Dark Ages' period."
p24236
aS"Just of the top of my head, you've got Bede, Fulda, St. Bertin, St. Vaast, Einhard, Notker, Ermoldus, Thegan and the Astronomer."
p24237
aS"It's also hard enough to pinpoint the motivations and feelings of figures from the 20th century even with modern sources, let alone those of, say, Augustus or Claudius using the likes of Tacitus, Cassius Dio and Suetonius (the latter of which is more tabloid journo than historian)."
p24238
aS'If you want a phrase that everyone understands, just use early/middle/late Middle Ages. '
p24239
aS'This enormous thing was published by the Ordnance Survey in 1935.'

aS"It didn't look like it, the grammar was too modern, so to speak."
p24246
aS'Really cool though.'

aS"We have a map from 1800 at home and it's really cool to see our cities like they were in those times."
p24248
aS'Haha - I like that the map was clearly ridiculously detailed and yet the grammar was what made it stand out as a modern map :P'

aS'I think some people wrongly parse it as two consecutive simple past verbs (which wouldn\'t make much sense) but in fact "sat" is understood as the past participle, forming a passive clause with "was".'

p24655
aS"They benefitted too, and he won't have got the homes at a discount. "

aS"Because he wouldn't have been able to buy them if it wasn't for Right to Buy."
p24657
aS"RtB wasn't about giving people in social housing the opportunity to own their home, it was about moving council-owned property into the private rental market, which conveniently happened to be friends, relatives and party colleagues of those involved."
p24658
aS"I'm finding it a bit hard to believe that most of the friends, relatives and party colleagues of the 1980's Tory cabinet were council house tenants. "
p24659
aS'In many cases they gave the tenant the money to buy their property outright (at a huge knockdown), with an agreement that they could live there rent free until they shuffled off this mortal coil or they decided to move, at which point it would transfer to the new landlord.'

aS"Probably once or twice a year for the past 15 years I've had someone knocking on my mum's door offering me cash upfront to buy her house under right-to-buy so long as I agree to hand it over when she dies - with the option to live rent free in there for as long as we like."

aS'Sure, some property developers will try and cut a deal but this is not remotely widespread. '
p24666
aS'This may have been true under the old system where housing benefits were transferred straight to the landlords, this is no longer the case and landlords end up chasing rent from people who have a lump sum transferred directly to their bank account every month.'

p24671

p24672
aS'The ONLY solution to these problems is building many many more houses.'
p24673
aS'Everything else creates more problems.'
p24674
aS"Building more houses won't solve anything."
p24675
aS'It will only bring more properties to the table for richer landlords to buy, develop and do the same again.'
p24676
aS'The *only* way to fix this is to introduce a cap to the number of properties you can own, or tax heavily (80% or more) after a certain figure, so that it\'s less "worthwhile" for said landlords.'
p24677
aS'This however will make the house prices shoot down, which will piss off every current home owner out there.'
p24678
aS"It's a very difficult situation, and I have no idea how they will fix it, which is probably why none of the parties want to touch this."
p24679
aS'They could laways build more houses and keep them as council houses, cheaper than the cost of a house plus profit that they are already paying out in housing benefits'
p24680
aS'Problem: not enough houses to go round, drives up prices and rents.'
p24681
aS'Solution: increase supply.'
p24682
aS"By limiting the number of houses a landlord can own you don't affect supply, just spread the existing across more landlords."
p24683
aS'No but by limiting the number of houses a landlord can own you are effecting demand.'

aS' sure i understand, but whats to stop his wife, children, or relatives putting the property in their name..?'
p24685
aS'Yeah each system has their flaw :/'

aS"BTL landlords translate rental demand into buy demand, but that need doesn't go away if they are taxed more heavily."
p24692
aS"Renters aren't going to suddenly magically turn into buyers in huge numbers. "
p24693
aS'Every solution to the housing market problem has short term pain for a long term solution (or a short term solution that just amplifies the problem later on) \n\nIf BTL is taxed, then it becomes a less attractive proposition, meaning less BTL homes are bought/overall demand drops, meaning either cheaper homes or more available for first time buyers.'
p24694
aS"I'd not say its better for people currently renting, but it should help them (as a group) in the long term"
p24695
aS'Taxing BTL will make an overnight change to renters pockets - your short term pain is someone not being able to afford to live properly as their rent jumps \xc2\xa3100 per month.'
p24696
aS'So the number of prospective tenants stays the same, but the availability of rental properties drops.'
p24697
aS'Tell me: what normally happens to prices when demand outstrips supply?'
p24698
aS'Prices go up!'
p24699
aS'That will make things harder for most tenants, not easier. '
p24700
aS'In the short term, yes.'
p24701
aS'Which is exactly what I said.'
p24702
aS'If these people can then buy houses, the number of tenants drops.'
p24703
aS"So we're back where we started, except more people are homeowners. "
p24704
aS'Their rents will go up, because it strongly becomes a sellers (landlords) market, not a buyers (tenants) one.'
p24705
aS'Can you explain how increasing their outgoings allows them to easily save for a deposit compared to now?'
p24706
aS"Plus you won't be able to balance supply of rental houses, as you've increased the barriers of entry to the market so the only people who can sustain the margins to become a landlord are those with so much disposable cash that they can buy outright."
p24707
aS"There isn't any long term gain here."
p24708
aS"You're creating a short term problem for tenants, then locking that problem in long term by artificially restricting supply thus pushing up rents. "

aS'Everything else creates more problems.'
p24711
aS'Building loads more houses creates problems too - if house prices fall there will be loads of people trapped in negative equity.'
p24712
aS"I'm not suggesting that more houses shouldn't be built - just pointing out that actually, not everyone wins if house prices were to fall."
p24713
aS"In practical reality we can't build them fast enough to create that big of a problem."
p24714
aS'The Buy to Let scheme was very lucrative for private landlords, no wonder the Tories want to ramp it up.'

p24719
aS'Its a joke on the idea that people will be able to buy their council house for a reduced rate and then soon after sell them for full market rates.'
p24720
aS'Then the housing market is flooded and house prices drop so while some first time buyers will benefit the main buyers will be property developers and buy to let landlords.'

aS'It seems fairly obvious that home ownership is desirable to increase.'
p24727
aS'As for them leaving owner occupier hands that ultimately boils down to market conditions.'
p24728
aS"If it's too profitable for BTL landlords to own and rent out compared to how feasible it is for people to own properties then we get right to buy homes leaving owner occupier."
p24729
aS"I don't fully understand how this helps private landlords."

aS'You push lots of cheap property on the market.'
p24734
aS"The people who qualify to buy can't afford the mortgages,  so they buy,  sell as soon as possible, take the cash and are soon back in a council house."
p24735
aS'Meanwhile those properties that flooded the market lowered prices allowing the people with money -  the landlords - to sweep in and buy them  cheap.'

p24852
aS"I was going to snark about how much the plan would cost (I reckon about \xc2\xa312bn for the sports pitches alone) but to be absolutely honest I can't fault your logic anywhere - diabetes is crazy expensive, and utterly debilitating to those who have it."
p24853
aS'I might spend a bit less on children and a bit more on young adults (because kids run around a lot, while twenty-somethings apparently spend all day eating, drinking and being sedentry the rest of the time), and try to get mental health treatment in a sensible place (although direct costs of mental health treatment are small, the number of work-days missed because of e.g.'
p24854
aS'depression is a sizable chunk of GDP and therefore tax base).'
p24855
aS"I'd also shut down a lot of hospitals."
p24856
aS"I know that's apparently counter-intuative, but a lot of problems in the NHS are caused by politicians fighting to keep open specialist services where there is absolutely no need for them to be located."
p24857
aS'For example, there are three A&amp;E departments within five minutes of each other where I live (five minutes by blue-light ambulance, not five minutes by traffic-heavy commute.'
p24858
aS') In a high-skill emergency like a heart attack, the difference between getting a highly skilled surgeon / trauma team and an adequate surgeon / trauma team is much greater than the difference caused by a five minute delay in getting you to an acute ward.'
p24859
aS'By coincidence, each A&amp;E department see almost exactly one-third of the cases they would need to keep their skills at really world-class levels, so combining them would mean a serious boost to the survival rate in these kind of acute emergencies.'
p24860
aS'But because the A&amp;Es are located in constituencies run by different parties, and because locals love having a nearby A&amp;E, any plan to integrate the departments is blocked, leading directly to people dying when they need emergency treatment.'
p24861
aS"It's a really sad state of affairs."
p24862

aS"No idea how that'd scale up or whether or not it's a true reflection of cost but still possibly not as much as I thought it'd be."

aS"If you phased it in over the life time of a parliament it wouldn't be too much at all."
p24867
aS"Splitting up A&amp;Es into true A&amp;Es and minors is something I'd seen floated around as a cost saver."

aS'Almost turning some A&amp;E clinics into very high end walk in centres.'
p24869
aS'I calculated half a million per pitch times 25,000 schools in the UK (some already have a pitch, but those schools would be subsidising schools in Central London where land is ridiculously expensive).'
p24870
aS'That comes to \xc2\xa312bn, or about \xc2\xa32.5bn per year over a Parliament.'
p24871
aS"Although I think the best way to finance it would be to sell bonds to fund the whole thing immediately and pay them back over - say - 10 years at 1.5%, which is a total cost of about \xc2\xa31.4bn a year for the next ten years, or basically within the scope of some of the completely idiotic things the government *are* threatening to fund next Parliament, and against which you could offset the savings on diabetes and the increased revenue from the 'sugary goods' tax, so it would probably hit the average taxpayer as something like a \xc2\xa330-\xc2\xa350 / year increase in taxes for the next decade (although there are maybe better ways to reduce diabetes, I'd want to look into that first)."
p24872
aS'Impressive maths skills. '
p24873
aS'Ha ha, thanks.'
p24874
aS"I'm trying to be much more conscious about using ballpark numbers when I talk about politics, because - like you were demonstrating - 'a small cut in diabetes prevalence' doesn't sound as impressive as 'ending the bedroom tax for good', when in fact the first is worth way more money (obviously there are ethical issues too, but once you've got the money stuff out the way the ethical stuff is easier to grapple with)."
p24875
aS'A major problem of shutting down A&amp;E departments is the lack of infrastructure and overall plan for who will take the volume of patients.'
p24876
aS"It's not just the front door stuff - there's knock on effects for the rest of the hospital."
p24877
aS"It's also going to be very expensive, unpopular and hard to explain."
p24878
aS'For each DGH with an A&amp;E, they will have the labs, clinical teams and beds to support investigations and admissions.'
p24879
aS'If we presume that the A&amp;E patients that need admission (which usually end up as referrals to specialist teams i.e.'
p24880
aS'Ortho, O&amp;G, Medicine etc...) end up at the designated "Super A&amp;E", you\'d have to build in the capacity for that hospital to take over that demand and work that the extra patients will generate - which means building more bed capacity, more A&amp;E capacity, transferring staff from the hospitals that won\'t need to run an acute take for A&amp;E admissions, lab staff, support staff - cleaners, porters etc.. - all very expensive.'
p24881
aS'The interesting thing will be what happens to GP referrals.'
p24882
aS"Would they have to goto the new super centre - or will the remaining DGH's run acute takes for GP/Clinic referrals and an inpatient review service?"
p24883
aS'The former will need yet more capacity to sort out and the latter is less rational and probably more expensive.'
p24884
aS"If we did the former, lots of the acute teams at the DGH's with closed A&amp;Es would naturally get transferred to the centralised hospital, which will need to ensure that they have ward beds, operating space, clinic space to operate efficiently."
p24885
aS'There would also have to be a robust cross county agreements for ambulance services and discharge planning.'
p24886
aS'Some services - e.g.'
p24887
aS'trauma, work on a centralised model and I believe that payment does follow the patient.'
p24888
aS'But they tend to rely on there being less specialised Trauma/Orthopaedic teams that filter their take into the trauma team as needed.'
p24889
aS"I agree that some things need consolidating and rationalising, but it'd be a brave politician to try and explain that."
p24890
aS"It'd also require a lot of investment before you start seeing benefits in the long run."
p24891
aS"We'd have to specifically design the service and not end up hodge podging it, which I'd guess we would."
p24892
aS'Good ideas.'

p25182

p25185
aS'Well they also mention that they want to cut \xc2\xa312bn from the Welfare budget, which looks to be a distinct claim from the \xc2\xa313bn they want to save from departmental budgets.'
p25186
aS'I suppose it is possible that they intend to cut \xc2\xa312bn from the Welfare budget, which they *also* count as being a departmental budget, so the total saving they intend to make is \xc2\xa312bn welfare + \xc2\xa31bn extra departmental but you might accuse them of being a little misleading if that is the case.'

p25481
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the conservatives have communicated this particularly well, perhaps because it\xe2\x80\x99s more nuanced than \xe2\x80\x9cno more debt".'
p25482
aS'Fiscal conservatism isn\xe2\x80\x99t about saving big businesses cash, it\xe2\x80\x99s about a different worldview in how we can create social mobility and lower the tax burden for everyone, in particular working class people.'

aS'Our welfare system has produced a situation where some get far more money than they could realistically hope to earn, yet others are having to make the decision to eat or heat.'
p25487
aS'The problem is that when cuts are made to reduce welfare for the better off, they usually end up hurting the poorest as well.'
p25488
aS'When I talk of the very poor I mean those getting less than 2/3 of the minimum wage per household.  \n  '
p25489
aS'&gt;&gt; The real question here is whether there are mechanisms to make sure \xe2\x80\x9cthe poorest\xe2\x80\x9d don\xe2\x80\x99t stay that way or we can lower their reliance on the state, to offset those cuts.'
p25490
aS'Does "lower their reliance on the state" just mean reduce tax credits or benefits?'
p25491
aS'Because for working people that is exactly the same as raising tax.'
p25492
aS'They may get money back in tax cuts but if people are worse off that can hardly inspire social mobility.'
p25493
aS'This kind of policy just reduces income redistribution from higher rate tax payers.'

p25495
aS"I agree with the idea of fiscal conservatism but don't see how it can be applied to an economy like ours."
p25496
aS'We just have too much income inequality to make it workable.  '

aS'why does the difference from the top to bottom matter?'
p25498
aS'As long as the bottom is at an adequete level, the top shouldnt matter.'
p25499
aS'At the end of the day, most of the highest earners also happen to be the ones fueling the economy because they, through their companies provide the jobs for the lowest income earners.'

p25510
aS"Anyone under any delusions that the whole Tory manifesto isn't just about making rich people richer and then pandering to the middle class on subjects they care about is quite frankly an idiot, it is their whole mandate."
p25511
aS'Just look at the NHS, just last week during the hot weather A&amp;E departments were having black alerts (the highest level) due to the numbers of people because of the hot weather and pollution, they are massively overcrowded, but why does that matter when rich people have private healthcare?'

aS'This just seems like an easy way for them to gather peoples details.'

p25523
aS'Its not sensationalist to be concerned by the vague use term of "extremist"  given a party with a proven track history of anti-worker legislation.'
p25524
aS'Given that the police have both broken up and spied on *peaceful* enviromental protesters and leaked information to an organisation that provided a blacklist for unionised contrstuction workers it isn\'t a "slippery slope" to be fearful of powers to deal with vague "extremist" nonsense.'
p25525
aS'I\'d even be on side if I thought "yeah, that\'ll make us safer" but there isn\'t even the slightest bit of evidence to support this.'

aS"Socialism isn't a dirty word in the same way that it is in the US."
p25544
aS"I think it's a bit extreme to point to American attitudes towards socialism and say that it could happen here, the two countries have very distinct histories of socialism."
p25545
aS'Socialism might not be a dirty word, but every government in my lifetime has pushed the country decidely away from Socialist ideals.'

aS'The stuff about family life is generally the more controversial part of the right to privacy, but the Government has already changed the law on that (not sure how well it will go down) - many of the highly-published cases in that area, though, seem to be situations where the Courts use the HRA to override what they see as unjust decisions by the executive; something they were happy to do before, but now they have a statutory framework for it.'

p25700
aS"you keep your own money and don't share it around, and then pandering to the middle class to get more votes, with things about families and childcare, while those families ignore the fact that they just lumped all their children with \xc2\xa340K debt if they want a university education, because in the end, the parents don't have to pay that and they are the ones who are voting, ironically in their own interest, but not their children's."
p25701
aS"The conservative voting pool is from the middle class, lower middle class and rich people, hence they cut everything, the rich doesn't use any of these services, police, they live in low crime areas, the NHS, they have private healthcare, schools, they pay for private schooling."

aS'The middle class are similar on a large majority of these things.'
p25703
aS"Even the school one, they can afford to live in the better school districts, even if they can't afford private education."
p25704
aS"Then you have the lower middle class, the people who like to believe they are rich, but aren't, of course they vote for the tories, that is what other rich people do, then they even get an extra bit of cash from the cuts they make, all great right?"
p25705
aS'Wrong, the lower middle class are actually using the services that are being cut from, they use the NHS, they use the school system, crime is higher in the neighbourhoods so they use the police.'
p25706
aS'They lose out from the rich and middle class not paying in to services that would help them all so they can get a short-term monetary gain.'
p25707
aS'Lets say they gain \xc2\xa3500, yet if they didn\'t have this \xc2\xa3500 and it went towards the government services, a middle class person who wasn\'t using their "fair share" of the services would have put in \xc2\xa3750, a rich person who is using essentially none of the them \xc2\xa31500, the services they use are now out of pocket by \xc2\xa32750 all so they could get \xc2\xa3500.'

p25719
aS"It's like watching a fundamentalist religious person argue that their God is the only true God and everyone else is wrong, it's a ridiculous lie that you're telling yourself to make you feel superior, and all it does is widens a divide."
p25720
aS"Elsewhere in the country there is somebody complaining that Labour gets all their votes from a bunch of naive left-wing children who only vote because they're young and stupid, it's exactly the same and I'm sure there would be outrage if it were uttered here."

aS'But it\xe2\x80\x99s not normally split out like that, so people don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much each element costs or when they\xe2\x80\x99ve finished paying for their phone.'
p26159
aS'If you don\xe2\x80\x99t switch as soon as your contract has ended it could end up costing you around \xc2\xa322 for every month you go over.'
p26160
aS'O2, Virgin Media, Tesco Mobile and Utility Warehouse have tariffs where the handset and airtime costs are separate, while giffgaff has never bundled the handset in.'
p26161
aS'Whereas Vodafone, EE and Three customers still continue to be charged one bundled price.'
p26162
aS'We think people are being misled, so we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on all providers to separate out the cost of the handset so you don\xe2\x80\x99t continue to pay after your contract comes to an end!'
p26163
aS'Thanks r/UK :)'
p26164
aS'Thanks Paddy.'
p26165
aS"The submission doesn't break any rules and it's a good talking point."
p26166
aS"Personally I think providers should be made to offer deals to customers once they've hit their upgrade period and the contract ends."
p26167
aS'Or if the customer misses the offered deal it should automatically change to the tariff only rate.'
p26168
aS"I mean, I know they already do these deals, but they don't tell you about them, you have to go looking yourself."
p26169
aS"That's the main issue I have. \n\n"
p26170
aS'Yeah it should be standard procedure to not charge people for something that they have already paid for, more transparency about how much of your monthly bill is phone and how much is tarriff would go a long way to help this.'
p26171
aS'Note that the government mandate that energy companies do this now, my combined energy bill tells me exactly how the money is split. '
p26172
aS"I agree, it's like paying the monthly instalments for say a hire purchase agreement, the company not telling you it's ended and them continuing to take those payments even though they're fully aware that you've paid up."
p26173
aS'Seems kinda deceitful and even fraudulent in my book. \n'
p26174
aS'Not really.'
p26175
aS"You're paying a contract that's based on a tarriff."
p26176
aS"You are still receiving that service when your contract is up, it's just you should then be getting it for a lot cheaper."
p26177
aS"that's what's being said, after the cost of the phone is repaid, the contract should drop to tariff only. "
p26178
aS"I can't speak for anyone else but I get bombarded with calls, texts and emails from EE during my entire contract period, first encouraging me to buy add-ons or get a contract that includes a tablet, and then, once the contract is nearly over, the messages switch to telling me to upgrade."
p26179
aS"Honestly, unless you automatically junk all their emails, and somehow managed to block all their texts and calls, it's next to impossible to *not* know your contract is up."
p26180
aS"Edit: in the couple of hours since I wrote this I've already got an email from EE telling me to buy an iPad mini."
p26181
aS'&gt; first encouraging me to buy add-ons or get a contract that includes a tablet\n\nBTW some of those extras reset the contract period, hence why they push them so hard. '
p26182
aS'They did not contact me once after the first month or so.'
p26183
aS'Easily switched to 3 now, since EE was overcharging so much. '
p26184
aS"That's interesting because I recently upgraded and heard nothing."
p26185
aS'Although it was an upgrade from my old t-mobile account to EE. '
p26186
aS"&gt; Personally I think providers should be **made** to offer deals to customers once they've hit their upgrade period and the contract ends\n\nDisagree."
p26187
aS"I don't see why the government should be enforcing what deals a mobile phone company offers, as long as there's no barriers to switching provider."
p26188
aS'They can offer whatever deals they like, so long as they are clear about telling you what the deal is, i.e.'
p26189
aS'how much of your monthly bill is the repayment of the handset and how much is for the network service.'
p26190
aS'Why?'
p26191
aS"The whole point is it's a package deal."
p26192
aS"You might as well ask Alton Towers to break down your ticket price to show the maintenance cost of the various rides\n\nThey **are** clear what the deal is, the deal is you pay *x* up front, and *y* every month for a minimum of *z* months, and they give you a phone to keep and you get phone service for as long as you're still paying them."
p26193
aS"Splitting it up into semi-arbitrary pieces would imply they would be willing to offer you each piece separately, which they aren't"
p26194
aS'The point is to give consumers as much information as possible so that they can make an informed choice on what deal is best for them.'
p26195
aS"But the information isn't *helpful*."
p26196
aS"At best, it tells them the price that mobile companies get phones in bulk from the phone manufacturers at, but since the customers can't buy the phones at retail at that price, it's not much use."
p26197
aS"The customer has to compare *x*+*y* X *z* for each deal , including if they decide to buy the phone outright and go SIM-only, in which case *x* is very large and *z* is presumably set the same as the other deals for comparison purposes, but then that still doesn't compare non-numerical concerns like the advantages of not being locked into a contract and the disadvantages of needing the money up front."
p26198
aS"I genuinely don't see how an arbitrary split of the monthly costs helps."
p26199
aS"For example, let's say EE offers a new phone for \xc2\xa340 a month for two years, and says that \xc2\xa320 a month of that is for paying for the handset, because they buy the phone off the manufacturer for \xc2\xa3480."
p26200
aS"Let's say O2 offer the exact same phone and exact same contract details, but they say \xc2\xa325 a month is the split for the phone, because the RRP of the phone is \xc2\xa3600."
p26201
aS"What useful information, exactly, does the customer now have that they didn't before?"
p26202
aS'The information about how much you should negotiate to pay following the end of that contract period when the phone is paid off.'
p26203
aS'The way a 2-year contract works is the company is saying "we will partially subsidise the cost of a new phone and in return for us getting somewhat less money, you\'re locked in for 2 years so we get a guaranteed income"\n\nIn what way does knowing what degree they valued that lock-in 2 years ago help you now negotiating a per-month contract?'
p26204
aS'In the case I mentioned, where two providers could give different answers for the same set of underlying data, how do you interpret the result?'
p26205
aS'And actually, do you actually have a right to internal company information about their costings?'
p26206
aS"If I want to buy a used car, I'd really like to know what their absolute best price is, but I don't have any kind of right to that information and not knowing that isn't unfair, as long as the car isn't misrepresented"
p26207
aS'Presumably you should be phoning up your provider the day the contract ends to request unlock and a PAC code - and then start shopping about for a new tariff, including from your existing provider. '
p26208
aS'&gt;At best, it tells them the price that mobile companies get phones in bulk from the phone manufacturers at\n\nnot really if you calulate the sim only vs handset costs for the same calltime, txt data etc then it often works out much better buying the phone outright if you can afford it.'
p26209
aS'It is more of a loan with interest to buy the phone than a discount.'
p26210
aS'sometimes yes, but the thing is, the data you *already have* is enough to make that choice.'
p26211
aS"The provider arbitrarily splitting their charges wouldn't help you there, because you need to compare the *total* cost of phone+service vs the total cost of the deal."
p26212
aS"i am usually rung by a few rivals and then ultimately my phone provider when i'm near the end of my deal."
p26213
aS'The way they dress it up, is that you get a free phone at the start and what you pay is your contract with a minimum period.'
p26214
aS'All fool you if you choose to go over that period imo.'
p26215
aS"My problem with cancelling at the end of a contract is they always want a specific number of days notice, and so I don't know when to call up to cancel so that the higher price ends on the precise day it ought to. "
p26216
aS'For some reason they fuck around when cancelling a contract, but if you choose to go to another provider they have to facilitate this.'
p26217
aS"It means that to cancel a contract it might need 30 days notice, but there's nothing to stop you getting you PAC and transferring to a pay as you go sim from another network for free / 99p, then just binning the new sim."
p26218
aS'Transferring should take less than 5 days (usually much less).'
p26219
aS'So transferring your number to another sim will cancel your contact in those 5 days you have to wait.'
p26220
aS"I've had the issue on the past where 3 continued to charge for a few months for a contract I told them to cancel and they didn't for a while."
p26221
aS'It says on the contract how many days notice you have to give, just call up that many days before the end date.'
p26222
aS'I always buy my phones off contract and go for a sim only.'
p26223
aS'In my experience the cost of my phone spread over two years, plus the cost of my sim only contract equals pretty much the cost of a standard contract with phone from a phone shop.'
p26224
aS'Even if people are being mislead, the prices arent really that far off I have seen.'
p26225
aS'I think these companies should be forced to display the representative APR, both over the length of the contract (e.g 2 years), and over double that.'
p26226
aS'Doing that would make it obvious that taking out a loan that never ends is a very poor way to buy something.'
p26227
aS'They could make out the APR was 0 but overcharging for the handset in the first place.'
p26228
aS'At least you could easily compare though then - buy this iPhone for \xc2\xa3619 for Apple, or for \xc2\xa3900 from Carphone Warehouse etc.'
p26229
aS'The FCA could easily intervene and tighten this all up in the way it is for other industries.'
p26230
aS"If people compared prices, they'd already see that the ones from carriers are dearer than from elsewhere."
p26231
aS'I think most would just see the shiny shiny for \xc2\xa335/month.'
p26232
aS"I don't think people do though, I don't think many people realise that a \xc2\xa312 SIM from giffgaff or a \xc2\xa316 from EE or whatever is exactly what they are paying for + a finance agreement on the phone."
p26233
aS'It depends if you can afford the upfront cost.'
p26234
aS'For some people \xc2\xa31200 over 2 years is easier than \xc2\xa3600 upfront and then \xc2\xa315 a month.'
p26235
aS"If that's the case you shouldn't be buying a top of the line phone anyway."
p26236
aS'Paddy, would getting a free upgrades off-set this? '
p26237
aS"Yes, but it's not 'free' - you're just going to be paying for the new handset as part of your monthly cost."
p26238
aS'The thing is, what if your new handset is actually a cheaper one than your original phone?'
p26239
aS"It'd be much easier if the costs were just split out in your bill so you know exactly how much you're paying for the service versus the handset."
p26240
aS"I can't speak for right now, but I know it used to be the case for some networks (Orange for example) where terms and conditions explicitly stated that the handset wasn't actually part of the contract."
p26241
aS"It's the same now"
p26242
aS'Wait, what does that mean?'
p26243
aS"Like you aren't actually paying for the phone or you're just using it or what?"
p26244
aS'I\'ve always just kind of accepted "Well thems the costs" and not looking into it.'
p26245
aS"Its obscure enough that they'll bend it to suit themselves, but basically it would avoid them having to break down the bill into line rental/usage and phone cost."
p26246
aS"You get the phone and it's yours, but you're stuck with the cost you sign up to the whole way through."
p26247
aS"I would assume it's also to limit their responsibility for repairs/theft of the handset also."
p26248
aS'Not that that stops them from asking for the phone back when you try to cancel.'
p26249
aS'As I said, I can only speak for Orange.'
p26250
aS"I've not really read every detail of Vodafone's T&amp;C's for either of my lines as they've not pissed me off enough yet but I'd imagine it's similar."
p26251
aS'My experience with 3 has been very different.'
p26252
aS"I'm coming to the end of my contract and the price of the handset and airtime have been bundled for 2 years."
p26253
aS'I went into a 3 store yesterday to talk about the rollover period and the first thing they said was to come in when it finished so that they could reduce my rate to one that excluded the handset fee.'
p26254
aS'Would you say this is the typical approach of providers?'
p26255
aS'In which case public education from Which?'
p26256
aS'and the press is likely to be the best solution?'
p26257
aS'Or do you think the best solution is a legally binding, automatic drop to the reduced rate for just the network services? \n\n'
p26258
aS'I think the key thing there is separation of customers.'
p26259
aS"You're a pro-active customer who is clearly shopping around."
p26260
aS"They'll keep you by cutting your bill."
p26261
aS"What if you're not a pro-active customer?"
p26262
aS"What if you're busy and don't take any time to look into your phone contract?"
p26263
aS'They get to keep charging you more.'
p26264
aS'The same goes for anything, insurance, TV / Broadband, gas / elec.'
p26265
aS'Not sure why it would be any different with mobile phone contracts.'
p26266
aS"If you want to be lazy there's nothing stopping you, but it comes with a higher monthly price."
p26267
aS"I'd rather not bother."
p26268
aS"I do bother and I do save money by it, but I'd rather not have to."
p26269
aS'Absolutely.'
p26270
aS"I haven't checked but I'm sure the providers are exploiting some poorly drafted law."
p26271
aS'My point was more about how to stop the separation of customers.'
p26272
aS'(1) educate them about the issue, making inactive customers less likely; or (2) make it illegal to separate and overcharge.'
p26273
aS'As a counterpoint, finding out the  final date of my contract was as simple as logging into their website (alternatively I could have use the 3 app) - the providers might argue that they would never refuse to charge less and that it is hardly a burden on the customer to enforce. '
p26274
aS"Hi, it's true that lots of providers start trying to upgrade their customers when their contract is coming to the end."
p26275
aS'However, this is often about getting you to sign up to another contract, even if this is a Sim-only contract.'
p26276
aS"You should always be able to clearly see what you're paying for, so you can look around the other providers and choose the best deal for you."
p26277
aS'If O2, Tesco, Virgin and more can do it, why not Three?'
p26278
aS'Went into a similar deal with O2 last year - two x two year contracts.'
p26279
aS'I can pay off my handset contract quicker if I prefer - no penalty - and get a new phone.'
p26280
aS'The price they charged me for the phone was also fair.'
p26281
aS'Was pleasantly surprised by the deal. '
p26282
aS"My contract and my girlfriend's contract are pretty much the same, except I'm on O2 and she's on Vodafone."
p26283
aS'We pay the same thing for the first 24 months.'
p26284
aS"Then if we choose to carry on the contract, I get mine a lot cheaper whereas she doesn't."
p26285
aS"It's a ripoff!"
p26286
aS'If her contract finishes after the 2 year period, presumably she can just go in and cancel her contract without any fees, and start a brand new "Sim only" contract which will end up cheaper'
p26287
aS'I will be recommending this to her.'
p26288
aS"i'm really surprised people aren't bugging the operator every day it's near upgrade time tbh."
p26289
aS"It's always obvious how long you sign a contract for and i'm afraid I don't see any underhand tactics here as it's clear from the outset when you are due an upgrade."
p26290
aS"I'm afraid i'm putting this down to lazy people not getting the best they can get."
p26291
aS"It's a bit different to the energy companies not letting you know the best tariff available and charging more if you don't pay by direct debit but not making that clear to people."
p26292
aS"It's something they should be teaching in school how to manage your money better."
p26293
aS'When I last switched my provider I phoned up to get the PAC, I was transferred to their retentions type sales people, after flatly ignoring his offers and stating I\'d already signed a new contract anyway thanks his parting sarky words were along the lines..\n\n"Well I\'m sorry you\'ve decided to leave, if you had stayed with us you could have had everything you are currently getting for half the price.'
p26294
aS'" He made it out like I was missing out on some fantastic deal, this being the month after my contract had expired so I should have been paying half anyway.\n'
p26295
aS'Had the same with some mobile broadband thing I cancelled a couple of days ago because I didn\'t need it anymore, they tried the, "here\'s a laptop for free, just give us \xc2\xa325 for the next 2 years every month" this after I said I had no need for a laptop and just wanted out.'
p26296
aS'In fairness, I listened to the guys offer, turned it down and that was that.'
p26297
aS"I'm a fool, fixed."
p26298
aS"And now I'm talking to a bot &gt;_&lt; "
p26299
aS"Don't worry, it's all fine and well till you end up arguing with a bot."
p26300
aS"I'll probably be doing that when I'm in a care home in 2070 when they they can't find my slippers"

aS'&gt; We think people are being misled, so we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on all providers to separate out the cost of the handset so you don\xe2\x80\x99t continue to pay after your contract comes to an end!'
p26304
aS"Won't this just lead to a price hike for us sensible consumers?"
p26305
aS"It's not as if our cellular providers are going to just stomach the estimated \xc2\xa3335m lost annually, is it?"
p26306
aS"&gt;&gt; cellular providers\n\nWell, no wonder the prices are high if they're running on batteries!"
p26307
aS"Witty sarcasm aside, they won't be able to price themselves out of the market."
p26308
aS"I'm wondering if they'd get in on the act, and try and undercut the wholesalers on phone-only deals. "
p26309
aS"If they could make \xc2\xa3335m per year more some other way they'd be doing it already."
p26310
aS"Well, that's not a very healthy way to get money from their customers."
p26311
aS"Providers need to be more transparent about what you're charging you."
p26312
aS"It's not fair that some are being misled just to donate to their mobile provider."

aS'" and \'sensible consumers\' whining that it meant they were getting stiffed.'
p26316
aS"The truth though [at least where the banks were concerned] was that those 'sensible consumers' were being subsidised through the banks screwing over the consumers who were paying the fees."
p26317
aS"It's not quite the same in the sense that the bank fees ended up being literally the poor subsidising the better off."
p26318
aS"Still at the point you recognise it's literally expecting someone else to carry the burden of part of your cost I don't think there's much scope for sympathy."

p26320
aS"Every contract I've had with Vodafone, they will ring me when it is due to upgrade."
p26321
aS'If I have chosen to keep the same handset they give me reduced rate on my tariff so it is the same as a SIM only contract.'
p26322
aS'No doubt there are people that are paying a fortune more than they need to, but I have never had this experience with Vodafone, they are always more than willing to reduce the tariff and as I say, will always call me to do so. '
p26323
aS'The problem, in my experience, is those calls from Vodafone are indistinguishable from their upsell calls.'
p26324
aS"I'm not interested in their upsell calls, as is the case with plenty of people."
p26325
aS'I can well imagine someone forgetting it was coming to an end (esp.'

aS'And if other major providers can split the costs out, why not Vodafone?'
p26334
aS"Oh I'm not saying Vodafone shouldn't be transparent."
p26335
aS"Just that I don't feel as if I'm ever stuck paying for the phone after I own it. "
p26336
aS'What do you think about the idea of publishing the effective APR of the deal so that they can be easily compared?'
p26337
aS"I share your comment with our campaigns team, but it still doesn't solve the problem of providers continuing to charge customers for phones they've already paid them in full for."
p26338
aS"You're right, but it would raise awareness of how these deals actually work."
p26339
aS"If people see an APR figure next to the deal, because what they're effectively signing up to is a loan with an interest rate, it will make them think more about the charge in the first place."

aS"The point I think being made here is that people's contracts come to an end, they carry on paying the same amount they always have even though the phone has been repaid, it should be much lower. "
p26373
aS'Nothing stopping them from moving over to a sim only contract then if they want a lower monthly contract.'
p26374
aS"If anything these people's laziness somewhat subsidises the cheap sim-only plan smarter consumers would be on."
p26375
aS'I agree.'
p26376
aS'Some people want an easy life and for their phone to just work.'
p26377
aS"I'm willing to put in a bit more effort to get a saving."
p26378
aS'Why should people be handed the saving on a plate?'
p26379
aS'Likewise I work to stay on the cheapest energy tariff.'
p26380
aS"People who can't be bothered to put the effort in end up paying more."
p26381
aS"What's unfair about that?"
p26382
aS'A couple of years back I had a moment of clarity and realised that the standard "mobile phone contract" arrangement just wasn\'t working for me.'
p26383
aS'The negotiation process whenever it came up for renewal was just tedious and frustrating.'
p26384
aS'Nowadays, I buy my handset and my phone service as two completely distinct entities.'
p26385
aS"I know that this isn't possible for everyone - some people need to spread the cost of their handset over 24 months - but if you can afford to buy a handset up front, it makes sense."
p26386
aS'I now have the freedom to change my handset when it suits me, rather than on a forced schedule.'
p26387
aS"I also have the freedom to change my provider when I choose - I'm not locked in for years."
p26388
aS'I think that the reason why I did things the suboptimal way for so many years was that it seemed like the easiest course of action.'
p26389
aS"I didn't have the confidence to try something that I perceived to be abnormal."
p26390
aS'I started doing that after I ran out of mobile phone companies after getting pissed off with them one after the other.'
p26391
aS"Monthly rolling contracts means there's nothing to keep me if they raise prices/start doing stupid shit."
p26392
aS"&gt; Monthly rolling contracts means there's nothing to keep me if they raise prices/start doing stupid shit."
p26393
aS'Precisely.'
p26394
aS'And, ironically, the contract renewal negotiation bollocks is exactly the kind of stupid shit that would make you want to leave anyway.'
p26395
aS"I've been with giffgaff for over 2 years now, and it's the utter simplicity of the whole thing that is a delight."
p26396
aS"I've taken a similar approach with my ISP - I pay a little more than the norm, but it's a monthly rolling contract so I can leave at any time, and the customer service is second to none."
p26397
aS"&gt; I've taken a similar approach with my ISP\n\nWho are you with?"
p26398
aS'I\'d say A&amp;A as they have amazing customer service, but you said "a little over the norm" :)\n\nI\'m also with giffgaff for what it\'s worth.'
p26399
aS'I came to the same conclusion as you did.'
p26400
aS"Trying to negotiate a contract renewal with my previous provider was the final straw, and it's just as well as I couldn't be happier with giffgaff."
p26401
aS'&gt; Who are you with?'
p26402
aS'I\'d say A&amp;A as they have amazing customer service, but you said "a little over the norm" :)\n\nIndeed, A&amp;A.'
p26403
aS'You disagree with my assessment of their prices?'
p26404
aS"I've recently tried changing my line to AA."
p26405
aS'What a waste of time that was.'
p26406
aS'One word responses to my e-mail questions, expecting me to already understand their BT backhaul &amp; LLU arrangements (and the implications that has on line rental transfer).'
p26407
aS"The impression I got from them is they *really* don't want any extra customers."
p26408
aS'I get the impression that they want to spend more time on wanky stunts like "LOL if you want a filter piss off" or whether they are some compliant to some humorous RFC.'
p26409
aS'Zen seem to have cemented themselves as the "reasonably priced great service" ISP, and have been expanding by creating their own backhaul network to avoid paying BT Wholesale squillions per user.'
p26410
aS"Xilo are also good (but they are reliant on I think Daisy rather than renting BT capacity directly)\n\nI'm sure A&amp;A are good but I honestly don't get the fanboyism that they attract, as if they're the only good ISP in the UK."
p26411
aS"I guess they're all sore from remortgaging their houses to pay for the ability to download 100GB a month"
p26412
aS'All I really want is my own range of (public) IP addresses.'
p26413
aS'Sky offered me a single static address, AA offer a /48 ipv6, and most others only supply a dynamic ipv4 address.'
p26414
aS"I'll give Zen a look, though."
p26415
aS"I really can't believe AA's sales team - I'm a telco engineer myself but even I felt uncomfortable having to fight for one-word e-mail responses."
p26416
aS'Zen offer at least a /29 for v4 (I think they go up to at least /28 until questioning why).'
p26417
aS'No IPv6 though, and unfortunately the official line is the BS about how they "have enough addresses for now" which totally misses the point, although I believe various bits of their core network are already running v6.'
p26418
aS'I get by with an HE tunnel.'
p26419
aS'any IP assignment is free on signup but \xc2\xa325 one-off if you ask for it after the first month.'
p26420
aS"When I signed up I had to phone up to get the order changed from 1 static to /29, but that's free\n\nThe Entanet-based ISPs will offer IP blocks too, and they kinda-sorta do IPv6 too (you have to ask Entanet directly for it when I did it 7 or 8 years ago)"
p26421
aS'As someone also on 1 month contracts with my ISP who are generally just as good at A&amp;A when it comes to things.'
p26422
aS"Yes they're pretty expensive."
p26423
aS"I had to get a new handset recently but I got a great condition 2nd hand one and pay less than 10 quid a month on giffgaff so I figure it's cheaper."
p26424
aS"It's certainly nice that if I'm short on money I can easily just not buy credit that month."
p26425
aS'You have to shell up for the handset but in the long run I find it way more flexible.'
p26426
aS'I used to swear by giffgaff.'
p26427
aS'I bought a phone outright and then got the \xc2\xa310 goodybag.'
p26428
aS'Then they upped it to \xc2\xa312.50 and I fancied an actually good phone, so I got a contract with 3 and got given a new phone for no additional fee.'
p26429
aS"I've strongly considered going back to giffgaff now that my contract has ended, but I can't live without the unlimited data I currently enjoy, especially since they made it a minimum \xc2\xa320 for unlimited data."
p26430
aS"Yeah, I tend not to actually use my phone for phone stuff much, but I'm always using it as an organiser and for looking things up."
p26431
aS"Having a phone is a must but I can live without texts/calls/mobile internet for a few days here and there so I save a shit ton on what I'd be paying for the same phone on contract."
p26432
aS"Oh yeah in your situation you're definitely doing it right."
p26433
aS"I used to mainly just text people, but now I get through ~10GB of mobile data a month it's left me locked in :("
p26434
aS"You can buy the handset retail over 12/ 24 months - Apple offer finance, eXpansys offer finance (on some phones), and I'm sure that others do as well."
p26435
aS'I bought my wife an iPhone 4 on the apple finance, and was able to upgrade her after 9 months to the lates greatest etc, as the resale value of the iPhone was actually higher than the outstanding finance value.'
p26436
aS'I got my phone through giffgaff, they offer finance as well'
p26437
aS'I want to recommend against using expansys - my last phone from them was sold as "UK SIM-free" when it was in fact grey market stock from Vodafone Germany, and getting it repaired under warranty was a bitch the first time and impossible the second (tried to claim it wasn\'t in warranty, then said it had water damage despite it being in a waterproof case and not used anywhere near water)'
p26438
aS'Its possible the case caused the issue, if it was waterproof and you seleaed the phone in on a warm day then considerable condenstaion could occur on colder days.'
p26439
aS'None of the water indicators I could see had turned colour.'
p26440
aS"I'd assume that you'd also see condensation against the screen or something too."
p26441
aS'Anyway, the fault was that the flex connecting the power button to the motherboard had broken.'
p26442
aS"It's a recognised design flaw, nothing to do with condensation "
p26443
aS'you put it in a waterproof case but never took it near water.... a bit suspicious sounding....'
p26444
aS'Not really - it was a rugged case that happened to be waterproof.'
p26445
aS"Given that they were BSing about the warranty (and only backtracked when I sent them a scan of the warranty document in the box, which was in German might I add) I'm doubtful that there was any truth to it being water damaged (especially since the thing I wanted to be fixed was a common design fault and the same issue as when I got it repaired first)."
p26446
aS"I'd buy from the likes of Carphone Warehouse before I'd buy from them."
p26447
aS'At least CPW is likely to be selling proper SIM free / UK stock'
p26448
aS'I too had this moment of clarity and found that it was cheaper to buy the phone on contract.'
p26449
aS"Oh, I'm sure that in certain circumstances it is."
p26450
aS"However, for me I wanted to have a decent monthly bandwidth allowance, but didn't necessarily need a top-of-the-line phone."
p26451
aS"The phone companies don't offer that flexibility - I had the choice of a posh phone on a \xc2\xa350/month contract with lots of bandwidth, or an inexpensive phone on a \xc2\xa325/month contract with only 500MB per month."
p26452
aS'By separating the handset from the contract, I could get exactly the combination that was right for me.'
p26453
aS"That's pretty much what I found."
p26454
aS'I wanted a Nexus 5 on 4G, my best option was to buy it on a contract from Carphone Warehouse.'
p26455
aS"PAYG didn't work out well for data and sim only contracts for 4G were overpriced."
p26456
aS'I did the same thing.'
p26457
aS'Nexus 5 from Google &amp; sim only plan with 3.'
p26458
aS"They don't do the deal I got anymore, but I pay \xc2\xa315 a month for rolling contract 3000min + 3000 3to3 minutes + unlimited data."
p26459
aS'I will never leave this contract as I need the data too much :) '
p26460
aS"I'm on 200 mins 5000 texts and unlimited data and feel much the same."
p26461
aS'My wake up call was when I spotted a mysterious second line on my phone contract.'
p26462
aS"I've gone very carefully watched sim only since then."
p26463
aS'yeah my last "negotiation" with Vodafone left me with the feeling I am for sure doing this come next April.'
p26464
aS"You won't regret it."
p26465
aS"Seriously, it's the best thing."
p26466
aS'I had massive problems with EE and I was stuck in a stupid contract.'
p26467
aS'I had nothing but problems.'
p26468
aS'I finally just cancelled it early, paid the fee, bought a new iPhone unlocked and then went sim only with three.'
p26469
aS"It's the best way to do it."
p26470
aS'Added bonus if you travel somewhere you can just pick up a cheap sim card and have some data on your phone without worrying about any overages. '
p26471
aS'You can always get a very good Android phone for about \xc2\xa3250.'
p26472
aS'LG G2 is currently pretty cheap.'
p26473
aS"Buy from Amazon and they'll just replace it if there's any problems, too.  "
p26474
aS'I bought a Nexus 4 back in January 2013 which cost me \xc2\xa3280.'
p26475
aS"The beauty of not having a 2 year contract is that I can upgrade on my own timescales - as long as it's still working, and there's nothing out there that really takes my fancy, I can just keep on using it."
p26476
aS'The G2 is a good value phone, but not really a compelling upgrade from the Nexus 4.'
p26477
aS'Ditto the Moto G.'
p26478
aS'G2 is a pretty serious upgrade from the Nexus 4 in terms of [battery, screen and camera](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=5543&amp;idPhone2=5048).'
p26479
aS'My Nexus 4 battery deteriorated to the point where I had to charge it twice a day and keep a small battery pack with me all the time.'
p26480
aS'Shame, because I loved that phone.'
p26481
aS"It's now a streaming device for Google Play Music connected to one of my hifis."
p26482
aS'Best thing about the G2 is the APTX Bluetooth codec which is great for streaming audio in high quality.'
p26483
aS'It also has an IR blaster which can clone remotes for anything, I use it all the time!'
p26484
aS'You can turn off the football in the pub.'
p26485
aS'huh?'
p26486
aS'the G2 is exactly the same as the (LG made) nexus 4 except it has a better battery and camera.'
p26487
aS'the processor, memory, etc, are the same.'
p26488
aS'There are plenty better ways to get credit than from your network provider.'
p26489
aS'A small loan from your bank for example.'
p26490
aS"Bottom line is, don't buy your phone from your network provider - they're (mostly) scamming you."
p26491
aS'I just took out a credit card with a 0% interest for 13 months offer last time.'
p26492
aS'This is what I do unfortunately you are tret with such utter contempt from the service providers if you are on a sim only monthy or payg deal.'
p26493
aS"Once you're signed up to a 24 month contract, they treat you with utter contempt for the next 21 months anyway."
p26494
aS"I've done this since my first 'pay monthly' contract."
p26495
aS'Always seemed like the wisest way to go about it and the hassle my girlfriend has to deal with when she wants to upgrade is insane.'
p26496
aS'Go online, book a slot to pick up a handset from your favourite vendor (or have it delivered), go back online, choose a SIM-only contract, have it delivered.'
p26497
aS'Glorious. '
p26498
aS'I do the same.'
p26499
aS"It has forced me to buy more average handsets as \xc2\xa3500+ on a cutting edge iPhone 6 or something isn't viable!"
p26500
aS"But overall it's a hell of a lot cheaper. "
p26501
aS"I think I'm going to start doing this, it works out cheaper."
p26502
aS"If you can't afford to pay for it all upfront, and have a good enough credit rating to get a 0% credit card, just put it on that and pay for it every month or so."
p26503
aS"Then when a new phone comes out, sell the old one and you've only got a couple hundred to pay for the new one."
p26504
aS'Yup, I bought my iPhone outright and use a Giff Gaff sim.'
p26505
aS'I put all the numbers in a spreadsheet and contracts were always hundreds more over the life of the contract.'
p26506
aS"It's just getting the lump sum that's the problem for a lot of people."
p26507
aS'Apple actually do interest free credit from time to time.'
p26508
aS"Another added benefit of ditching contracts is you won't get huge unexpected bills for using your phone abroad because you can only use the credit you have."
p26509
aS"I'm paying on an O2 contract for a good smartphone that I'm happy with."
p26510
aS"I'm paying about the normal price over 24 months, and after that time, I won't pay anymore."
p26511
aS"I'm quite good when it comes to electrical devices as I haven't broken any."
p26512
aS'I had my previous phone for at least 6 years before it started to die on me.'
p26513
aS"If I can do that with this current phone, then I'll be happy."
p26514
aS'I completely agree with you.'
p26515
aS"Though unlike you, I've never had a phone contract with handset in my life."
p26516
aS'When I first went for a phone contract I calculated how much it would cost for the full contract with handset vs how much it would cost to buy the phone SIM free and opt for a SIM only contract.'
p26517
aS'It was significantly less.'
p26518
aS"Not only was it cheaper, it meant I could change contract at a moment's notice."
p26519
aS'So it was a no brainer for me.'
p26520
aS"I've never seen a contract with handset that is cheaper than the equivalent SIM free phone with a monthly contract."
p26521
aS'I did this for my iphone 6+.'
p26522
aS'Handset cost me \xc2\xa3700, the contract is \xc2\xa320 a month, unlimited internet 4g, 600mins, 600 texts.'
p26523
aS'That works out at around \xc2\xa3940 for the first year.'
p26524
aS'The cheapest contract i could get at the time with 4g was around \xc2\xa355 a month which is also limited to 4gb 4g internet.'
p26525
aS'This also worked out to \xc2\xa31320 for the 2 years.'
p26526
aS'Its not much cheaper, but im not stuck in a contract, and my plan is much better than those i could of bought with the headset.'
p26527
aS'I advise anyone to do this if they are able, i paid the phone off on my credit card in 3 months, incurring very little interest.'
p26528
aS'I will always advise someone to buy the handset outright now rather than a contract, it is much cheaper and leaves you with a lot more freedom. '
p26529
aS'I live in Romania.. it might be full of corruption and the wages are shit..'
p26530
aS'BUT i have 5gb of 4g internet for 4 euros, and unlimited free calling to ANY country.'
p26531
aS'I also pay 15 euros for Gygabit internet speed plus tv/home phone.'
p26532
aS'Maybe we have these low prices to keep us from going insane.'
p26533
aS"If wages were high in Romania, you'd be paying a lot lot more."
p26534
aS'we  pay more for gas than germany,UK,etc, \n\nwe have the most taxes in europe, highest VAT if im not mistaken.'
p26535
aS'Cars yearly tax is ridiculouslly high.'
p26536
aS'When i lived in canada or the US, everyhting cost less, gas,insurance,clothing,cars,housing,utilities etc.. all because of corruption.'
p26537
aS'so no, we wouldnt be paying more, we would probably overthrow the govenment like we did in 91.'
p26538
aS"You pay less for petrol:\nhttp://autotraveler.ru/en/spravka/fuel-price-in-europe.html#.VS5JphPF-Xw\n\nAmerica costs a lot less than most of Europe; it has access to a lot of it's own natural resources for a start."
p26539
aS"I can't understand the Romanian car tax website very well using a translator, but it seems the most expensive vignette is 120RON which is about \xc2\xa320."
p26540
aS'How long does this last for?'
p26541
aS"It's not the vignette that is a problem, we have a yearly tax that is over 1000 euro on cars with engines over 2700."
p26542
aS'And under 2700 you pay 500euros.'
p26543
aS'Even if you don\'t use your car at all or if your car costs 200 euros\n\nAnd more stupid laws like if i buy a brand new car, and want to sell it after 5 years, the new owners have to pay thousands of euros for a "pollution tax" which has been deemed illegal by the EU.'
p26544
aS'A friend of mine has a Mustang he bought for 10000 euros 7 years ago, but if he tries to sell it , the new owner will have to pay 4000 euros because it has a 4000 engine AND  a 2500 euro tax for pollution alongside the regular yearly 1500 euro tax for ...pollution..\n\npure insanity for a country that has incredibly low wages'
p26545
aS"It's low because wages are low and standard of living is low."
p26546
aS'Thats not why.'
p26547
aS'Clothes are more expensive than America/ Western Euroipe, any Lacoste,Armani,Zara ,any name brand actually has a 10-50% higher price in Romania.'

p26568
aS'unlimited mobile data?'
p26569

p26571
aS'Do you think this may change? '

aS'So we have a range of asks to make things easier for people:\n\nWe want mobile companies to:\n\n- Unlock handsets automatically for free\n- Notify customers at least a month before the end of their contract and give them information on the best deals for them\n- Show the monthly cost of the handset separately from the service charge\nWe want Ofcom to:\n\n- Introduce a system where the provider gaining the new business is responsible for the switch to make the process easier for consumers'
p26600
aS"Shouldn't Ofcom be making all of the above mandatory?"
p26601
aS'Whatever happened to their statutory obligation to represent the interests of citizens and consumers? '
p26602
aS'The government or Ofcom can only do so much.'
p26603
aS'People ultimately have to do their own research if they want to get the best deal.'
p26604
aS"It's no good for people to complain when they can't be bothered to even look into it."
p26605
aS'I hate this attitude.'
p26606
aS'It basically amounts to, *"it\'s your own fault if you get ripped off!'
p26607
aS'"* and it exonerates profiteering companies who know perfectly well that\'s what they\'re doing.'
p26608
aS'Oh and it\'s not just that people *"can\'t be bothered to look into it.'
p26609
aS'"* For many it\'s an absolute ordeal trying to sift through the myriad options and make sense of all the convoluted ways companies present their products and services.'
p26610
aS"Most of my family turns to me for advice on their technological purchases, because they'd rather soak their feet in acid than do the research for themselves."
p26611
aS"If you can suggest regulation that'll work, then I'm all for it, but it's really not that hard to buy a mobile phone off Amazon and a SIM only contract from O2 or GiffGaff."
p26612
aS"The people who are buying overpriced contracts are those who aren't satisfied with a cheap phone that's within their means (a \xc2\xa320 dumb-phone or a \xc2\xa3100 Android) and they're effectively using financing to buy the latest gadget on the never-never."
p26613
aS"It takes a single phonecall to switch to a SIM-only contract - the bloke in [/u/CressCrowbits' example](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32nzu5/mobile_phone_owners_are_wasting_355m_each_year/cqd0sv8) can't even be bothered to do that, then it's a level of financial illiteracy that goes well beyond mobile phone contracts."
p26614
aS'Well the Which suggestions outlined by /u/paddysteen above would be a good place to start for regulations that would work.'
p26615
aS'You make it all sound so easy, and for many, like you, no doubt it is.'
p26616
aS"But you can't expect everyone to have Martin Lewis levels of enthusiasm for keeping up to date with the best deals around."
p26617
aS"Some people simply don't have the time and/or patience to go through changing *any* of their utility or service provisions."
p26618
aS"I'll grant you doing that nowadays is easier than many people imagine, but there are still potential pitfalls \xe2\x80\x93 e.g."
p26619
aS'one or more aspects of a switchover not going to plan or the new product/service not being quite what was expected/hoped for \xe2\x80\x93 and the prospect of having to deal with things like that can certainly be daunting enough to put people off.'
p26620
aS'Even to the extent of knowingly spending more than they need to.'
p26621
aS"I guess some people just feel that if something ain't broke it's worth spending a bit more to avoid 'fixing' it. "
p26622
aS'I\'m very lazy about switching utility providers myself, but you don\'t have to be "keeping up to date".'
p26623
aS"If you just shop around once a year, and save yourself \xc2\xa310 a month, then that's \xc2\xa3120 a year you've saved by going an hour or two of googling and reading."
p26624
aS'That\'s not really what\'s being talked about here, though - contracts which come with a "free" phone are very obviously overpriced, specifically to spread the cost of a \xc2\xa3300+ handset over 12 or 18 instalments.'
p26625
aS'Those contracts are not overpriced by a mere \xc2\xa35 or \xc2\xa310, they\'re overpriced to the tune of \xc2\xa320 or \xc2\xa325, and it\'s not a "myriad of options" to pick up the phone and ask for a cheaper tariff.'
p26626
aS'Getting a SIM only, pay monthly contract from your current provider will probably save you \xc2\xa320, the problem is that you have to resist the temptation to get another new "free" iPhone.'
p26627
aS"It's financial illiteracy that needs addressing, not this one specific symptom of it."
p26628
aS"Oh I agree that *knowingly* paying that much over the odds once the contract has paid for a phone is foolish, but I dare say a lot of people don't realise quite the extent to which they're being fleeced."
p26629
aS"And that's my main point: the fact that companies can get away with fleecing a proportion of their customers in that manner is appalling."
p26630
aS'To me, too much onus is put on consumers to protect themselves from business practices that really ought to be outlawed. '
p26631
aS'A lot of people are of the mindset that "I must have the iPhone 6 plus 128GB but I can\'t save up for it" so they\'ll agree to ludicrous contract terms to get it without paying a penny upfront.'
p26632
aS'Hence people paying 50 quid a month for a mobile phone.'
p26633
aS"I don't see why or how Ofcom should be regulating that."
p26634
aS"It's a bit like Brighthouse and the people who choose to pay 10x the purchase price for a flashy TV "
p26635
aS'No-one is suggesting they should regulate that.'
p26636
aS"If people want to pay a premium for a service in order to obtain a flashy piece of equipment that's fine."
p26637
aS"But it *should* be regulated to make the phone purchase a separate part of the contract that has an expiry date, so that consumers don't get fleeced even further by continuing to pay for something ad-infinitum."
p26638
aS'This is just basic consumer protection of the sort Ofcom and Trading Standards ought to be pushing for automatically.'
p26639
aS'Not leaving it up to consumer rights groups and organisations like Which to pressurise them into action.'
p26640
aS'In my situation, sim only deals are only slightly better.'
p26641
aS'Instead of paying for a 24 month unlimited minutes/text and 2GB of data (it was originally 1, but got an extra free on some off), I can get that for 12 months.'
p26642
aS"Obviously this is better, but I get a 30% NHS discount, so I'd only do this if I can still get that discount."
p26643
aS"O2 Refresh, which was announced quite a long time ago now, actively splits the phone / service parts of the bill so when you've paid off the handset your bill drops like a stone."
p26644
aS"I'd like to think this becomes industry standard, but then, without consumer outrage, they won't bother..."
p26645
aS'Consider this the rally cry!'
p26646
aS"Yep, separation like O2 Refresh is what we'd like to see across the board."
p26647
aS'Eg: A contract with O2 Refresh for an iPhone 6 costs \xc2\xa349 a month for 5GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts.'
p26648
aS'Of this, O2 is clear that the handset part of the bill is \xc2\xa325, meaning that you\xe2\x80\x99ll only pay \xc2\xa324 per month when the contract\xe2\x80\x99s over.'
p26649
aS'On a similar plan with Vodafone (4GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts) it costs \xc2\xa348.50 a month.'
p26650
aS'However, that price doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change once you come to the end of your contract and you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished paying off the cost of the handset.'
p26651
aS"except, Vodafone WILL call and text you about 2 months before the end of your contract and offer you either a phone upgrade, or if you're happy with your phone, a sim-only plan."
p26652
aS'They will of course push the upgrade as it makes more money, but welcome to business.'
p26653
aS"Separation of the two elements just benefits people who aren't on the ball about knowing when their contract is up."
p26654
aS'Surely educating people about that is more effective than expecting profit seeking business to change policies that make them money. '
p26655
aS"It's still better doing it O2's way and not Vodafone's."
p26656
aS'Think about it, if you are going for an upgrade in your phone, you can still do that while paying about the same price with O2.'
p26657
aS"If you don't want an upgrade, at least you're saving a lot of a money with O2, whereas you're stuck paying for what you've paid for with Vodafone."
p26658
aS"but you're not stuck at all."
p26659
aS"voda call you up and say 'do you want a new phone?"
p26660
aS"If you say no they'll offer a sim only plan which is half the price of your current deal."
p26661
aS'Its the exact same thing as what 02 are doing... there is no difference.'
p26662
aS"Oh I see, I didn't realise that."
p26663
aS'I was going to reply separately, but I think this reply covers it: http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32nzu5/mobile_phone_owners_are_wasting_355m_each_year/cqdc2t6 Thanks'
p26664
aS"No they don't."
p26665
aS"My wife was being mugged by Vodafone long after she paid for her phone, they weren't even embarrassed about it when confronted."
p26666
aS'Slightly off topic but can anybody offer advice?'
p26667
aS"My 2 year contract is just coming to and end and I've been paying 25 quid a month for something I have barely used."
p26668
aS'I detest smart phones and only really want a phone so I can send the odd text (less than 5 a day) and make the odd phone call to family and friends (amounting to about 20 minutes a week at most).'
p26669
aS'I do find a phone useful for checking my emails on occasion however as without one I probably would never remember to look at them.'
p26670
aS'Whenever I seek advice from the main networks they try to sell me a phone that is far too advanced for my needs and sell me texts, minutes and data that are way above what I require.'
p26671
aS'Is there a contract for a basic phone that anyone could recommend?'
p26672
aS'I am fairly useless when it comes to phones as they are of no real interest to me so I feel like it is fairly easy to rip me off.'
p26673
aS'The 1st generation [moto e](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Motorola-SM3812AE7F1-Moto-E-black/dp/B00KBHS4KU) is a very cheap smart phone (\xc2\xa370).'
p26674
aS'That with a sim-only deal will be fine for texting, calls, and email, and much more.'
p26675
aS'Alternatively you could get a [Nokia 105](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nokia-Mobile-Phone-Free-Unlocked-FULL-BLACK/dp/B00DBWI2E0) which is a incredibly cheap (\xc2\xa316) simple phone that will allow you to make calls and texts.'

p26686
aS'Your best bet is to buy a cheap phone outright and then get a rolling monthly contract.'

aS'Giffgaff has good rates for this, i think you can get a \xc2\xa310/12 contract that covers your needs.'
p26688
aS"In terms of cheap smartphones, if you don't mind windows as an operating system, the nokia lumia 630 is a good phone."
p26689
aS'You can buy it outright for around \xc2\xa370.'
p26690
aS'The good thing about rolling contracts is that you can quit at any time instead of being locked in for 24 months.'
p26691
aS'Or get a giffgaff sim for the phone you already own.'
p26692
aS'Thanks for the advice!'
p26693
aS"My favourite phones were the old unbreakable Nokia's so I will definitely consider the hand set."

p26698
aS"I've just looked on the giffgaff website and can see a contract that offers 500 minutes, unlimited texts and 1gb of internet for a tenner a month which seems perfect for me. "

p26717
aS'I would have recommended Pay as You Go, but if you want to check your email it might pull the price up.'
p26718
aS'Alternatively, you could get a pay as you go, switch off data, and connect it to your home wifi (if you have it).'
p26719
aS'That way, you emails will appear as soon as it connects, without requiring data.'

p27626
aS'Because if you go for "academic enlightenment", then work a low-paid job forever, you wouldn\'t pay anything back anyway/\n\nOther than that, I\'d hardly describe \xc2\xa330 a month repayment on an average graduate salary as anything unbearable.'

aS'Every other party does it all the time, why should the LDs (who never got a damned say before) be remember and punished so disproportionally?'
p27629
aS"The thing was, it became clear that the pledge was a stupid one, it focussed on fees instead of repayment - they voted through a better solution even though they knew it would make them unpopular, just like going into coalition with the tories (who even most members, and even MPs of the party are no fans of) wasn't going to make them popular but was for the greater good."
p27630
aS'It\'s funny how people claim the libdems "sold out", almost every one of them is on the same salary as in opposition, few of them got any real power as any power they had in coalition was spent in the coalition agreement (which was great, it was when they moved away from that and started horse-trading that things went bad and I left the party), and they\'re less likely to keep their seats - "selling out" tends to mean power or money - and none of them really got enough of that to make their personal losses (seats, compromises, unpopularity &amp; abuse, damage to the party) worthwhile except that they thought it was the right thing to do.'

aS"Before the current system we had several pisspoor Labour fees &amp; loans schemes, while they scrapped grants - Labour removed the free part (after most of it's leaders benefited from it), it's still free at the point of access - and a great deal more affordable than most of the old loan schemes which meant paying HUNDREDS of pounds back every month!"
p27635
