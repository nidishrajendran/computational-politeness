p80
aS'We are not going to see results instantly.'
p81
aS'If there was some magic way to fix the economy like that then it would have been implemented already.'
p82
aS"The fact is that we're seeing more and more companies sign up as more and more universities make more and more space available."
p83
aS'If the pledged numbers come to fruition - after giving these companies enough time to function, much less startup - then the opposite will be true.'
p84
aS'Startup NY is an interesting approach.'
p85
aS'It was very clear that the old ways of doing things were not working.'
p86
aS'At least the state is now trying something different than full on neglect.'

p119
aS'Right now there are 76+ companies on board slated to create 2000+ jobs and $100million in private investment.'

p542
aS"A ton of history happened there, everything from a Presidential assassination, Teddy Roosevelt's inauguration, Nikola Tesla's hydroelectric/AC current work, Mark Twain, the underground slave railroad (with Harriet Tubman), modern spirtualism (with seanaces and crazy stuff like that),Bell Aerospace, early 20th century architecture (like Frank Lloyd Wright) to superfreak Rick James."

p588

p589
aS'Wow, those are awesome!'
p590

p602
aS'I found this (http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/EDN/I/17/802), but it makes no mention of language.'

aS'The logic that thinks that the aggregate performance of a state is a direct, 1:1 reflection of the teaching quality of that state is based on faulty premises to start with.'

aS"alright, I'm not going to bother with a full reply because this is going to turn into one of those endless threads that go back and forth without resolution."
p1630
aS'But giving people shittier benefits will cost THEM more in the long run, not me.'
p1631
aS"It'll only cost me more if teachers refuse to teach for those benefits and the difference is more than made up in salary OR if good teachers refuse to teach for those benefits so we have shittier teachers which means our students learn less which means it ends up costing us all more because we have a less-educated populace."

p3757
aS'I do wonder if the woman in the video would have still felt harassed had every guy talking to her been rich and good looking.'
p3758

aS') If they are just trying to say hello do you think they would do that to a random man walking by or a less attractive woman?'

p3772
aS'My guess would be that yes, if a group of male models were saying "hey, hey baby sweet ass" she probably wouldn\'t swoon?'

aS'I said "hello".'
p3782
aS'I very specifically addressed your statement regarding the guys who said "god bless" and "hello".'
p3783
aS'I then very specifically pointed out how all the other things said and done by the guys in the video are in fact harassment.'
p3784
aS'To reiterate my points, saying "god bless", "hello", or even "smile", even with romantic intent, is not wrong or harassment.'
p3785
aS'Saying "hey baby nice ass" is harassment.'
p3786

p3790
aS"This is why people can't discuss these kinds of issues."
p3791
aS'We are having a discussion right now... so apparently the reason we can\'t have these discussions is because you cry "troll" and think I\'m just trying to bait you into an argument.'
p3792
aS'You literally said "well men and women can be a little over sexual when trying to say an **honest hello** (which I was trying to point out was laughable because the subtext was NOT "hello" it was "oooh baby") then you pondered if maybe the woman only felt that way because the men weren\'t rich or handsome (???'
p3793
aS') and *I* am the one who is trolling?!?'
p3794
aS'There is a difference between catcalling and saying hello and you seem to be completely unable of telling the two apart and **that** is what I disagree with you on.'

aS'Threats are not a compliment.'
p3797
aS"It's the type of this that can spark outrage in a number of groups."
p3798
aS'A lot of these arguments boil down to "there will be room for a lot more of these people that I don\'t like," which to me is kind of distasteful.'
p3799
aS'Instead of seeing them as "others" who could take over, you should remember that they are Americans and New Yorkers too, and it makes sense that they should try to grow their community and build up a life that suits their desires.'
p3800
aS'While ruining ours?'
p3801
aS'Seems pretty biased since they already get basically what they want.'
p3802
aS'Again, though, the arguments presented in the video for how they are "ruining" things basically amounts to "there will be a lot of these people near me.'
p3803
aS'" If you are bothered by having a certain population grow near you, I consider that to be a problem of intolerance.'
p3804

p3824
aS'the real reason people hate the police is because even after reciting the law that showed the cop he was wrong, 2 more policemen helped him do the illegal arrest.'
p3825
aS'A case can be made for the black officer that appeared, as he was just called in as support, but that undercover cop was there, and had heard the first cop read the law stating it was an illegal arrest, and then, instead of telling the cop to just walk off with hurt pride, instead helped him continue his actions.'
p3826
aS"and that's even ignoring the unnecessary hit to the face with his own guitar, or the fact that after reading the law and knowing he was in the wrong, he attempted to just use his position of authority to scare the musician out of the train stop regardless."
p3827
aS'And the same thing will continue every step of the system thereafter, where he gets roughly thrown into holding, and then the wardens "lose" his records for hours, etc, etc.'

p4337
aS'In regards to Amtrak, there is a direct train between New York Cityand New Orleans; [The Crescent](http://www.amtrak.com/crescent-train).'
p4338
aS'Total journey time is roughly 30 hours.'
p4339
aS'Your other option regarding a train is to head west to Chicago and transfer to the train called [The City Of New Orleans](http://www.amtrak.com/city-of-new-orleans-train).'
p4340
aS'You might be looking at 50+ hours travel time with that one.'
p4341
aS'One of the problems is the cost.'
p4342
aS"It's certainly not going to be like the Indian Pacific's prices, but a one-way ticket on the The Crescent can cost anywhere between $150 for a coach seat to $550 for a bedroom."
p4343
aS'If you end up taking the train to Chicago before heading south, expect the price to be much higher.'
p4344
aS"Again, I'm not sure what your budget is."
p4345
aS'I think the thing to keep in mind regarding "shorter distances, get on-off, in towns along the way" is that The Crescent operates 1 train a day in each direction (unlike the Indian Pacific\'s 1 train a week), so it\'s certainly a doable idea.'
p4346
aS"It's just that you run the risk making your trip too expensive as well as the risk of missing the train and getting stuck for an extra day somewhere...\n\nHope this all works out!"
p4347
aS'Looking at The Crescent, it makes some great stops doing exactly what you want to do.'
p4348
aS'Atlanta, Charlotte,  DC, Baltimore and Philly all are great stops'
p4349
aS"Thanks so much, that's great info."
p4350
aS"I've heard Chicago in winter in pretty brutal, and 30 hours is long enough in a train I think."

aS'I have more than a month, so really want to see as much as possible this time. '

aS"Found this thread late, but I'll just add one other thing if you aren't familiar with US public transport: our trains are *far* more pleasant to travel on than our buses and our airplanes."
p4355
aS'Avoid our cramped, amenity-less buses unless you are on a very tight budget, and air travel is such a hassle here.'

aS"For higher profile candidates I would go here: http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm\n\nFor more local candidates I don't believe there is a truly good source online."
p4376
aS'My advice would be to pay attention for different opportunities to meet your local candidates.'

aS'I live in a more rural part of NY, and know that during this time of year, you will find candidates at just about every major community event.'
p4378
aS'I consider local politics to be the last true front for bipartisanship, so you will often find (in my opinion anyway) that they are very approachable.'
p4379
aS'Edit: My last sentence is really two thoughts in one.'
p4380
aS'To clarify, I believe that local politicians (but not all) are much more apt to work with members of the other party to work for a common solution. '

aS'I really respect your passion for this issue, but I propose this question in return, are you willing to vote for a candidate based solely on their position on the second amendment?'
p4385
aS'For example, what if this imaginary candidate held no similar beliefs besides their position on the second amendment? '
p4386
aS'I approve of the SAFE act.'
p4387
aS'Its a good first start.'
p4388
aS'I doubt the founding fathers would have worded the second amendment the way they did if they had access to the type of gun we have today.'
p4389
aS'There is also a TON of more important issues out there.'
p4390
aS'The second amendment was put in place so the people could be armed with the same weaponry the government had so, in case the powers that be become tyrannical, they can be overthrown by the people.'
p4391
aS"You are being disarmed by a tyrannical government and now can do little to stop it\n\nEdit: Even with what I've said, this doesn't stop criminals from breaking the law, it simply makes it harder for law abiding citizens to defend themselves "

aS'A good first start to disarming the populous and trampling on the bill of rights.'
p4393
aS'Believe me, if I had a button that made every firearm in the world go "poof", I would press it in a heartbeat.'
p4394
aS'But then I would need a button for making the means of making firearms go "poof" (machine shops, foundries, 3D metal printers, etc.'
p4395
aS'all of which are vital to our modern world).'
p4396
aS'Then I would need a button that made swords, knifes, blunt objects, bows and arrows, piano string, crossbows, rocks, cars, cattle prods, etc.'
p4397
aS'go "poof".'
p4398
aS"At the end of the day, an evil doer doesn't need to use a gun to do evil, he can use just about anything, including his own hands, to do it with."
p4399
aS'Besides, disarming the populous is always one of the first steps down the road of tyranny.'
p4400
aS'Even still, do you think an evil doer cares if his weapon is in violation of the SAFE act?'
p4401
aS'"Uh-oh, my weapon has 8 rounds in it instead of 7, has a pistol grip, has a bayonet lug (a knife on a gun, how dangerous!'
p4402
aS"), and has a threaded barrel, guess I can't rob that bank or steal that old lady's purse, or invade that unarmed family's home and hold them hostage with this, considering it has too many rounds loaded in its magazine, it has a pistol grip, a bayonet lug, and the barrel is threaded."
p4403
aS'"\n\nAnd Cuomo shouldn\'t be impeached based on the SAFE act alone (though a strong case could be made for it), he and his administration are also incredibly corrupt, and he disbanded a federal probe investigating him and his cronies when they got too close to home. '

aS'Agreed \n'

p4487
aS'The Niagara Falls, NY side has three state parks (Devils Hole, Whirlpool and Niagara Falls) that run alongside the Niagara River for about 7 miles and by far is the much more naturistic side.'
p4488
aS"The downside is that once you go into the city it's a Detroit level ghetto and pretty much an old industrial town."
p4489

p4490
aS'The city is built right up to the edge of the gorge.'
p4491
aS'Still if you take the two cities as one geographic region and can manage to cross the border, they offer the best of both words.'

p4493
aS"It's gotten a bad wrap in the past but now and days it's much more like Seattle, WA or Portland, OR."

p4526
aS'As far as the city goes though, it has some seriously major problems.'
p4527
aS"Over 75 % percent of the city is on government assistance and there are hardly any jobs (largely due to be an old industrial town that lost all of it's factories over the years)."
p4528
aS'Another big problem is that the state controls the actual Niagara Falls state park and operates it as a cash cow for the state.'
p4529
aS'Tourists get funneled straight into the state park by way of the Robert Moses parkway and straight back out across the border.'
p4530

aS"As for the city government, it's a mess."
p4533

aS'Crime is legitimately out of control with several different street gangs controlling huge parts of the city.'
p4537
aS'There is gun violence and shootings almost every night.'
p4538
aS'There was a huge fight last year where the city council de-funded the NACC (Niaraga Arts and Culture Center) because  it was the mayor\'s "pet project" and despite the fact that a philanthropist from Buffalo offered to pay for half the funding.'
p4539
aS"There was a struggle to get a new hotel built downtown on an empty parcel of land directly across from the state park and culinary center because one of the city councilmen's brother owned a tourist shop next door and stood to make a lot of money if the project was halted and the land's value re-evaluated (in turn bringing up his family's property value)."
p4540
aS'This stuff happens all the time in Niagara Falls and the city never seems to go anywhere.'
p4541
aS'Pine ave is considered the nicest area in the city and only is kept up because of how interconnected the business owners are, despite being a dump.'
p4542
aS"Areas like main street, Buffalo Avenue, Lasalle and parts of Devaux are left to rot while Pine Avenue soaks up all the city's revenue on dumb projects that benefit only a small select amount of people."
p4543

p4547
aS'When I was working down at Niagara Falls state park, I used to just tell people to go to Buffalo or Lewiston.'
p4548
aS"Both have big connections to Niagara Falls through people like Nikola Tesla or Mark Twain and a serious amount of history  going back to the glory days (like Buffalo's Pan Am Expo or Fort Niagara )."
p4549
aS"Basically go to Niagara Falls to experience nature and see the waterfalls but go to Buffalo if you want to get something to eat or drink and experience the area's culture."

aS"Secondly, be aware that the quoted rates don't include taxes and fees--which are STEEP (the city gouges tourists on this -- I think it's a 15% rate)."

p6168
aS'20% - baseline.'
p6169
aS'The server was attentive and friendly and got your order right.'
p6170
aS'15% - you found yourself annoyed at the server often.'

aS'The order was right, or fixed when you requested it be fixed.'
p6172
aS'Maybe the server seemed to have a bit of an attitude.'
p6173
aS'&lt; 15% - you literally stood up a couple times thinking of walking out.'
p6174
aS'Literally.'
p6175
aS"Tipping lower than 15% really shouldn't happen."
p6176
aS'The only time I\'ve done this was when the server took our order, disappeared for nearly an hour, came back finally and asked us what we\'d like to order again because "the kitchen lost the order", made a few racist remarks, and eventually our order came and was wrong.'
p6177
aS'20% of your PRETAX bill.'
p6178
aS'Tip on service, not on tax.'
p6179
aS'Technicalities really help to show the appreciation.'
p6180
aS"My simple rule of thumb is to take the final bill, round it up to the next amount most easily divided by 5 for the tip calculation, then divide by 5, and that's the tip."
p6181
aS"If the service is bad, I'll round down to the next easy number."
p6182
aS'So if the final bill is $73.82, and the service was good, I round up to 75, and the tip is $15.'
p6183
aS"If they didn't do a good job (and I do try to determine if it was the waiter or the kitchen that made the mistake), I round down to $70, and the tip is $14. "
p6184
aS"No, it's 20% of the entire bill. "
p6185
aS'15-25% depending on how the server did.'
p6186
aS"This is exactly how America's tipping culture gets really dumb."
p6187
aS'You are paying these servers more for doing the same job at a cheaper restaurant, just because prices are higher.'
p6188
aS'Of course the most ridiculous thing is that the cooks are often paid a pittance of what a server makes in tips...and they are doing the hard work.\n\n'
p6189
aS'At most cheaper restaurants, they typically take your order, bring your coke, maybe refill it, and then bring your meal.'
p6190
aS"At a high end restaurant, they're giving you more details about what's on the menu, bringing multiple cocktail orders, and/or wine, plus they're probably bringing you bread, salad, dessert, etc."

p6198
aS"&gt;cheap gastro pubs where the server is required to know at lot about the beers and win\n\nWell sure, that's what makes it a gastro pub."

aS'My wife was a server for a while at some mid-upper level places, and we got to be good friends with everyone; cooks other waiters, the owner, etc.'
p6201
aS"It does seem strange the way it's organized."
p6202
aS'For the most part, everyone busted their ass every night, and sometimes you got the shitty customers, and sometimes you got the good ones.'
p6203
aS'Nobody could do their job without the rest, so it always seemed to me that a smarter approach would have been to pool and split things more evenly, rather than the archaic system of some people tipping some other people out, so when the whole place did well, everyone did well.'
p6204
aS'The power a host/hostess has to keep your section full or empty is really strange too.'
p6205
aS'Piss them off, and they can let you know better than your boss.'
p6206
aS"It's a weird system we've developed, but I guess it's what we have."
p6207
aS"Given the nature of being thousands of small businesses, it'll be really hard to enact a culture shift from our weird tip based system to one where the food costs more, but you don't tip, and the waiters etc."

aS'make $20/hour.  '
p6209
aS'At a finer restaurant the server should be a reasonably well-versed sommelier (or have on on staff), know the dishes really well and make recommendations.'
p6210
aS'They also tend to be much more pleasant and know the right times to interrupt to ask you how your meal is going, and when you\'re deep in conversation and you body language is saying "not now, waitress".'
p6211
aS"You also tend to spend 2-3 hours at the restaurant when fine dining, as it's not a rush you in, microwave you a dish, rush you out."
p6212
aS'So, number of patrons in a shift is much lower.'
p6213
aS'Also, they are probably significantly better waiters and waitresses to get the job there rather than at TGI Fridays.'

aS'Are you on mobile?'
p6576
aS'Try reloading it.'
p6577
aS"I've heard some mobile users are having troubles that tend to go away after a while."
p6578
aS'There are some diners in both Greenwich Village and Midtown that are great for breakfast--really any with a good rating on some website like Yelp.'
p6579
aS"For lunch, some special places would be Katz's Deli on the Lower East Side or Shake Shack, which has a few locations around Manhattan."
p6580
aS'There are great dinner places all over, nothing specifically comes to mind for me.'
p6581
aS"For drinking, a cool place to check out is McSorley's Old Ale House in NoHo."
p6582
aS"It's an old school Irish pub filled with cool historical memorabilia--they have fairly low prices and good food for lunch (burgers, etc.)."
p6583
aS'Enjoy your time in NYC!'

aS"Definitely McSorley's!"

p6598
aS"OK I'll agree the experience of waiting in line at MSP differs from waiting in line on, say, the UWS."

p6892
aS'That way you will be confident in where you are going.'
p6893
aS'- as someone else already posted, avoid empty cars, but they did not tell you why: because there, most likely, is a homeless person stinking up the car to the point it is unbearable.'
p6894
aS'- on the subway, there are poles.'
p6895
aS'These are for holding, not leaning against.'
p6896
aS'- if you are wearing a backpack, take it off and place it between your legs if you are standing in a crowded train.'

p6903
aS'Enjoy yourself, relax and take the subway. '
p6904
aS"just curious... let's say i was at that McDonald's and I saw the woman trying to kidnap the kid."

aS'Would I be legally allowed to tackle her ass and grab her until police arrived?'
p6906
aS'Report it and try and get proof!'
p6907
aS'They would handcuff you at first, then check out your story, her story, and the story of witnesses.'
p6908
aS'Then they would let you go (unless you tried to bash her head in the floor or some way over the top use of force).'
p6909
aS'During this time the press and photogs listening to police radio would show up.'
p6910
aS"Then you'd be on the front page of the ny post and the daily news the next day and be tried and convicted as a hero in the court of popular opinion."
p6911
aS"If you are into 'nerd' culture, visit Forbidden Planet (http://www.fpnyc.com/) and The Strand Book Store (https://www.strandbooks.com/)."

aS"I'm not denying that there's work in Buffalo."

aS'Hell, there is a decent chance I end up staying in the region.'

p7352
aS'I have never denied that the money the government is shelling out to the companies is going to bring the region jobs.'
p7353
aS"In the grander scheme of things, since the government is dishing out money across the state, I also think it's good that Buffalo is getting its fair share."

aS'That said, not everyone looks at corporate welfare as if its the road to fascism like I do.'
p7355
aS"Most of the reddit hasn't dealt with what I think Western New York's true problem is, the rampant poverty."
p7356
aS"Those who are truly suffering do not benefit from the 500 jobs IBM promised, because they don't have access to the education needed to get any of those jobs."
p7357
aS'In my opinion, the corporate welfare that you think is going to turn the region around helps those at the top, the CEOs of these companies, helps some of us in the middle, the several thousands that are able to get these jobs, but leaves those at the bottom, the people that truly need the aid from the government, untouched.

aS'This is good news for Bitcoin!'
p9184
aS'Did they figure out how to do quick transactions?'
p9185
aS'I had heard BitCoin was too slow for point-of-sale stuff. '
p9186
aS'Transactions themselves make it into the network very quickly.'
p9187
aS'Confirming them (i.e.'
p9188
aS'getting them into at least 1 mined block, preferably 4-6) is what takes forever.'
p9189
aS"As long the merchant doesn't mind the risk of fraud (which is already frequent in Bitcoin) they could in theory have you through the register without a ton of time (it would still take a lot of money and effort to train their cashiers on how to do it, setup needed IT, update policies, etc."
p9190
aS'etc.'
p9191
aS")\n\nThe problem from Bitcoin's side is that increasing the rate of block generation is itself detrimental to the security of the blockchain, so it can't be reduced much further anyways."
p9192
aS"So that means if the merchant *does* want to get at least 1 confirmation of the transaction, they'd need to wait [at least a few minutes on average](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time), which is a non-starter at any business I've ever been to."
p9193
aS"But without a confirmation there's no way for the merchant to know that the transaction will ever truly be counted in the blockchain (and since the [longest blockchain wins](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-orphaned-blocks), you'd ideally have more than one confirmation since that represents correspondingly longer chains including that transaction)."
p9194
aS"If the transaction isn't picked up within a mined block within a day or so (IIRC) it's canceled, whether the merchant delivered the goods or not."
p9195
aS"Even worse, there's no *guaranteed* way to ensure that the customer's transaction will even be included in a mined block, as it's probabilistic."
p9196
aS'Having the customer use a higher transaction fee (yes, Bitcoin has transaction fees) gives you a better probability of a miner including your transaction in a block.'
p9197
aS"While this wouldn't have been as big a concern a few years ago, there's been at least 2 times in the past 6 months where the [unconfirmed transaction backlog](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) (warning, audio) grew to the size of an entire mined block itself."
p9198
aS'Essentially if you want a better guarantee you have to have your customer use a high-enough transaction fee (at least enough to entice the miner more than the pool of existing unconfirmed transactions pending at the time of the transaction).'
p9199
aS'So the business is left with either getting fraud insurance and allowing unconfirmed transactions (but which makes Bitcoin more expensive than credit card fees), going without insurance and accepting greater risk of transaction fraud, or forcing the customer to wait for a confirmation or two (which is, in practice, just another way of saying "we don\'t support Bitcoin here...").'
p9200
aS"But fraud insurance relies on trusting some other (and by definition 'larger') third-party, so that goes against much of the reason you'd be using a 'decentralized, trustless' system like Bitcoin in the first place."
p9201
aS'I had always thought the economics and philosophy behind BitCoin was silly but at least the technology was cool.'
p9202
aS"But the more I learn about the tech the more it appears it's not a very good solution. "

aS'Green Apple books on Clement takes bitcoin and dogecoin.'

p9207
aS"I don't know why any non-online businesses bother."

aS'It is a city, you have your good, you have your bad.'

aS"It's not just SF's problem though."
p9428
aS"It's a symptom and manifestation of our entire country's failure to offer a social safety net to certain demographics."
p9429
aS"And since the problem gets concentrated in cities like SF, few people out in the squeaky clean suburbs would vote for tax increases to take care of the problem, because they don't really see it."

p9436
aS"I know that it's IYO, but looking at it from an objective standpoint no amount of nice public space is worth what the city's rental market is going through."
p9437
aS"Decades of shitty legislation and failed public policy (not just from SF itself) is playing a huge part in this, and I personally think it's a little disheartening and bewildering that so many people are willing to pay such extortionate prices just because of the OMGSANFRANCISCO factor."
p9438
aS"It's a lovely city but out of principle I don't think I would live here on a long-term basis, even if I worked in the tech industry."

p9489
aS"I'm curious why does finding genuineness feel so rare in YC?"
p9490
aS"I recognize there've been a ton of change since Sam took over but even then the cargo cult that exists around the organization seems to attract the wrong type of people."
p9491
aS"That might be, but I have every reason to be pissed when a person attacks me personally because he thinks I don't have a right to an opinion because of my age, gender and ethnicity."

p9502
aS"I tried to be witty and failed miserably at it, I tried to apologize for it, you and everybody else obviously don't accept it, which is fine as I did what I could and there is nothing more I can do."
p9503
aS"Do you think it's ok that posters are making fun of me personally, writing posts with no content other than to make fun of me and the subreddits I subscribe to?"

aS"Do you think it's ok that people downvote everything I've commented on in the last two months?"
p9505
aS'Do you honestly think that it makes for a healthy environment for discussion to call me a bitch and a terrible person?'
p9506
aS"Again, there is absolutely nothing I can do to change your opinion of me, and I'm not gonna try because you're an internet stranger, but I think it's really sad that everybody looks at my post and decides that it's completely acceptable to call me names."
p9507
aS'When I made the comment about $150k it wasn\'t intended as a "oh girls like ME are so amazing that we only date guys that make $150k" it was more intended as a "oh my god aren\'t you bitter, you must be fun to date.'

p9510
aS"Also, I made a post in a car specific subreddit - like plenty of others do every single day -  because I was on the receiving end of a very expensive gift and wanted to make sure that I would make the right decision as I'll probably drive my car until it dies."

aS'If so, that makes sense, given the direction most people come from (East Bay, SF, Peninsula, South Bay, other).'

p9708
aS'&gt;The pictures \xe2\x80\x94 158 irreplaceable records of the ruined city \xe2\x80\x94 were taken by Arnold Genthe, one of the most famous photographers of his time.'
p9709
aS'&gt;The collection is endangered.'
p9710
aS'Genthe\xe2\x80\x99s photographs were made using cellulose nitrate negatives, and the negatives are fading and the images on them will soon be gone.'
p9711
aS'The process is irreversible.'
p9712
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are disappearing before our eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Ganz, curator of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts in San Francisco.'
p9713
aS'&gt;The solution is to digitize the photographs, but that\xe2\x80\x99s an expensive and time-consuming proposition.'
p9714
aS'However, said Karin Breuer, another curator, the photographs are \xe2\x80\x9ca priceless record of the earthquake\xe2\x80\x9d and what followed.'
p9715
aS'&gt;The cost to digitize the negatives and make prints is about $40,000, and the city\xe2\x80\x99s fine arts museums have begun a campaign to raise the money.'
p9716
aS'&gt;Many of Genthe\xe2\x80\x99s earthquake pictures are famous, particularly a noted shot of families standing on Sacramento Street, dressed in their best clothes, surrounded by damaged buildings and watching a huge fire approach.'
p9717
aS'&gt;A few dozen of Genthe\xe2\x80\x99s best-known pictures from 1906 have been published in books, and many are in the Smithsonian Institution collection.'
p9718
aS'But more than 100 others are in refrigerated vaults at the Legion of Honor museum in San Francisco.'
p9719
aS'&gt;\xe2\x80\x9cA majority have never been seen in public before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoria Binder, who is an associate conservator at the Legion of Honor.'
p9720
aS'&gt;The museum showed a reporter some samples this month \xe2\x80\x94 highly unusual pictures of the destruction and rebirth of the city and its people.'
p9721
aS'&gt;There is a rare night shot of a large building ablaze, with flames glowing in every window.'
p9722
aS'There is a moody picture of the entrance to a ruined Nob Hill mansion \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cPortals of the Past,\xe2\x80\x9d only this one is taken at dusk and the portals look like something out of an ancient Greek ruin.'
p9723
aS'&gt;There are many shots of San Francisco families living in the parks and in the Presidio Army post, and women cooking dinner on stoves set up on the street.'
p9724
aS'Some pictures show small children made homeless by the earthquake playing together as if they were at summer camp in the park.'
p9725
aS'&gt;Some shots show the city rebuilding, with streetcars on new tracks, with jam-packed passengers hanging on for dear life outside the car.'
p9726
aS'&gt;Genthe, who was born in Germany, came to San Francisco in 1895 to be a language tutor.'
p9727
aS'At that time, the city was a center for art and photography, and he became a self-taught photographer, fascinated by the city.'
p9728
aS'His best-known work was a series of highly regarded photographs of San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s Chinatown.'
p9729
aS'&gt;He developed a successful photo business, but when the earthquake struck on the morning of April 18, 1906, it was clear to him he was in the middle of a major catastrophe.'
p9730
aS'&gt;His studio was destroyed, along with many of his glass plate negatives.'
p9731
aS'But he could see that the quake was only the beginning.'
p9732
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cHe could see that his city was burning down before his eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d as Ganz put it.'
p9733
aS'&gt;So he went to his regular photo supply shop.'
p9734
aS'The owner told him to take anything he wanted since it was all going to be destroyed by the fire, now burning out of control.'
p9735
aS'&gt;Genthe took a Kodak A3 camera, the top of the line, and stuffed his pockets with the technically advanced cellulose nitrate film.'
p9736
aS'He roamed the streets, photographing the devastation in what is now called real time, never dreaming that his pictures would last more than a century.'
p9737
aS'&gt;Others took hundreds of pictures of the 1906 disaster, including Jack London, the writer.'
p9738
aS'But there was only one Arnold Genthe, and his are clearly the best.'
p9739
aS'&gt;And now they are vanishing.'
p9740
aS'The curators offered examples of the original negatives, and it is clear that the images are slowly fading into nothingness.'
p9741
aS'&gt;The museum has made 3-by-5-inch contact prints of some of the negatives, but the idea is to make large display prints so the photographs can be put on exhibition.'
p9742
aS'&gt;When they are digitized, they can be enlarged in high resolution to capture more detail.'
p9743
aS'&gt;\xe2\x80\x9cThat way, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to look inside the houses and see how the people lived\xe2\x80\x9d during those famous earthquake and fire days, Ganz said.'
p9744
aS'&gt;But first, money has to be raised, and the museums are offering an incentive.'
p9745
aS'For $2,500, donors can pick a negative to adopt.'
p9746
aS'For a gift of $250 they can adopt a picture chosen by the museum.'

p9752
aS'Does this seem absolutely nuts to anyone else?'
p9753
aS"I'm pretty sure Kinko's can beat that price quite handily.\n"
p9754
aS"They're digitizing the negatives rather than scanning the prints so maybe that affects the price."
p9755
aS"Plus they're from 1906 so the scanning technology that's used for more recent film may not be applicable to the older negatives."
p9756
aS'And they also want to make large display prints which are not cheap if you start getting to larger sizes.'
p9757
aS"It seems like a lot per photo but it seems reasonable considering they're permanently archiving and creating a display out of 100+ year old film. "
p9758
aS'They probably want to hire a professional to do each one carefully by hand and touch everything up for the absolute best quality.'
p9759
aS'That may take multiple scans for each photo as well as some skilled work in Photoshop.'
p9760
aS"We're taking about digitizing the negatives themselves, not just scanning prints."
p9761
aS'Printing from a negative causes quality loss.'
p9762
aS"I'd wager there are no ultra high quality prints so they need to do some other process to preserve the images without substantial quality loss."
p9763
aS'I mean, these images are already digitized.'
p9764
aS"There's one in the header to the article."
p9765
aS'But these digital copies are a fraction of the quality/detail of the negatives.'

aS"&gt; I'd wager there are no ultra high quality prints so they need to do some other process to preserve the images without substantial quality loss."
p9767
aS"If they don't do whatever process, they have a full loss... so, who cares about preserving the images without some loss of quality in the original?\n\n"

aS'Edit: a word'
p9870
aS'Yeah, unfortunately the whole bay area is full of nutcase NIMBYs.'
p9871
aS'The reason Marin City is predominantly African American is because after the war, all the white people living there started to move to other communities in Marin.'
p9872
aS"Those communities wouldn't let blacks move in."
p9873
aS'So, they all stayed behind in Marin City.'
p9874
aS'Then in the 70s and 80s, they decided this was where all the "affordable housing" should exist, and mowed down a bunch of shit and put in those large housing complexes.\n'

p9877
aS"It wasn't predominantly black during WW2."

p9879
aS'By the 1970s, it was about three quarters African American.\n\n'
p9880
aS'TIL\n\nGood to know.'

aS'There is one glaring issue with this plan.'

p9892
aS'Uhh, you can just CGI all that stuff in in post.'
p9893
aS"I've read the housing will be mostly geared toward seniors."
p9894
aS'Rich people in Marin still need gardeners, cooks, nannies, mechanics, plumbers, hairdressers, etc., no?'
p9895
aS'exactly there are tons of people from richmond that drive over to work those kinds of jobs'
p9896
aS"Yeah, but it's more convenient for those people to live somewhere else and drive to work than live close to work and drive everywhere else."
p9897
aS'It also gets kinda slave-y if you have your gardeners and cooks and whatever living in a little complex out back.'
p9898

p9899
aS"I think there's one bus that comes by every hour or so. "
p9900

p9901
aS'This describes everywhere in Marin.'
p9902
aS'Haha true.'
p9903
aS"People commute to San Francisco for work from Vallejo, Brentwood, Milpitas, etc...it's no further than those places."
p9904
aS"It's also a very short drive from San Rafael which is not exactly a one horse town."
p9905
aS'The people who commute to the City from those places certainly are not on government assisted housing.'
p9906
aS'They make those commutes because they skills they have most likely translate to an office environment.'
p9907
aS'Also, I grew up mostly in San Rafael.'
p9908
aS'These places are not that short of a drive due to the one lane roads.'
p9909
aS'I just think the cost of finding work for people living out there will be high, generally speaking. '
p9910
aS"There's a ton of renters in Marin."
p9911
aS'Selling 224 affordable units will be easy peasy.\n'
p9912
aS'No doubt.'
p9913
aS'I am just hoping these places actually go to low income families and not just the highest bidder.'
p9914
aS"I don't want this beautiful area to be built up without a good reason."
p9915
aS'And I think adding low income housing in Marin is a good reason. '
p9916
aS"Marin's a pretty fucked up place."
p9917
aS"Lucas knows that he's surrounded by a bunch of insincere dipshits who spout about social causes that they don't really want to fix, all while complaining that smart power meters are giving them cancer and plastic bags are ruining the environment."
p9918
aS"Then, in the middle of chronic water shortages (this isn't the first time Marin has been faced with almost no water), they put it fake wetlands that are fed by sprinklers."
p9919
aS"It's way more NIMBY than San Francisco, even.\n"
p9920
aS"Marin has it's own reservoir (which isn't far from Lucas' site) and it is almost full."
p9921
aS'I am not sure what you mean about the sprinklers.'
p9922
aS'But yes, Marin is in fact the most NIMBY county in America.'
p9923
aS'Over the last 50 years, it has had the least amount of property development in the country. '

aS'Wow.'
p9925
aS'That true?'

p9927
aS'http://www.marinwater.org/water-watch\n\nMarin was basically created by MMWD.'
p9928
aS'No I mean about the development.'
p9929
aS'But how did the mmwd create Marin?'
p9930
aS"I can't speak to the mmwd, but my understanding is that a good deal of Marin was put into state parks and open space preserves in the 60s and 70s."
p9931
aS'If you had towards Tomales Bay from San Rafael, it becomes very clear really quickly where the edges are: tightly clustered development from 20 years ago, to just hills.'
p9932
aS"&gt;a good deal of Marin was put into state parks and open space preserves in the 60s and 70s  \n\n[There are some rather horrifying mockups here of what might have happened if they hadn't, too."

p9937
aS'Oh.'

p9947
aS'Completely disagree.'
p9948
aS'People make such crazy commutes because the housing within easy commuting distance of San Francisco is far too expensive.'
p9949
aS"Everyone I met who was doing that was in unskilled labor - working restaurants, making food deliveries, driving for Lyft/Uber, etc...It's true they're mostly not on government assisted housing, but that is the very reason they had to look so far away to find something affordable at market rate."
p9950
aS"Also this property is less than 1 mile from a Highway 101 onramp so that one lane road argument doesn't make much sense."
p9951
aS'Same places other people find work.'
p9952
aS"We don't all make $500k a year, but we all don't make $20k a year either."
p9953

p9958
aS'There was never any major opposition nor was there any lawsuits.'
p9959
aS'The environmental impact report was going a few days away from getting rejected by state and federal regulators because for some reason digging out a good size hill, dumping it in a near by creek and passing that off as "beneficial" to water quality didn\'t pass the smell test.'
p9960
aS'So just before Lucas was going to be embarrassed into having to admit his proposal was dogshit, he pulled the project blaming NIMBYs and took his Star Wars figurines and went crying home.'
p9961
aS'As for the comments about practicality, its a good question.'
p9962
aS"Lucas Valley is very very far from the freeway, and if you are low-income you're bus bound and Marin's public transportation is bare-bones."
p9963
aS"Lucas doesn't give two shits about poor people, this is a face-saving PR spin and nothing more."
p9964
aS'Edit\nSource: http://www.savemarinwood.org/  It even includes a letter from the Water Board, to paraphrase, "We don\'t usually bother following up with a project that has been withdrawn but we needed you to know you did a shit job listening to us and explaining how your plan was going to make a fuck all of the water quality.'

p9967
aS"This guy's approach to zoning seems creepy to me."
p9968
aS'He bought a ranch in the middle of nowhere that was only empty because it was preserved from development, tried to turn it into high-impact industrial space, and then flipped out when he was obviously and totally foreseeably turned down.'

p10506
aS"I'm not the person you were responding to, but I would view that example as being ok not because it's a non-profit but because they are buying old busses and not putting substantial money into retrofitting them which sounds more in line with the ADA exemption than what Leap is doing."

aS"If I came into your business and demanded a discount because I'm an artist, you'd laugh at me."
p10781
aS'Tech companies demand tax advantages from cities in exchange for the benefits they claim to bring.'
p10782
aS'Assuming cities and citizens value and want to support a community of art and culture, perhaps artists need some protection from typical market forces too?'
p10783
aS'Perhaps, but then tax breaks are paid for by the whole community, not just one private citizen.'
p10784
aS"Not saying artists deserve special treatment, though I do like my culture, but would a rent supplemental for artists be something you'd support?"
p10785
aS'I have no idea how such a thing would be administered but just in theory. '
p10786
aS"No, I wouldn't support that."
p10787
aS'It seems unfair and ripe for abuse.'
p10788
aS'Well what makes that more unfair than the tax breaks for the tech companies? '
p10789
aS'Arguably, because the tax breaks can help pay for themselves by stimulating economic activity. '
p10790
aS"Look, I'm inclined to believe that as well."
p10791
aS'Arguably, however, artists with expanding studios and shows would likewise stimulate economic activity. '
p10792
aS"Not to the same extent; artists can't compete on economic terms."
p10793
aS"Ok, but it's not a competition."
p10794
aS"A ratio matching artist contribution doesn't seem to violate the rules of physics. "
p10795
aS'It is a competition: we were comparing the relative economic value of tax breaks for tech companies versus rent subsidies for artist collectives.'
p10796
aS'We were comparing them as an exercise in extending our logic, not to see which is better than the other.'
p10797
aS'Again, it does not violate the rules of physics to have both tax breaks for tech companies and rent subsidies for artists.'
p10798
aS'They are not in competition *necessarily*.'
p10799
aS'My only issue with the latter is how we could thoroughly administer it in a city already teeming with corruption. '
p10800
aS'You give a tax break for a big tech company to move in, and it costs you $5 million.'
p10801
aS'They employ 500 people in your city at a mean salary of $100k.'
p10802
aS"That's $50 million in combined salary, not including expenditures for health care, running the business, and employee perks."
p10803
aS'You can see how pumping this much money back into the community, and the taxes that are gained from this money being spent can more than make up for the tax break, yes?'
p10804
aS'Absolutely - I completely agree.'
p10805
aS'No one is advocating giving artists a tax break beyond their ability to contribute, however. '
p10806
aS'I think the justification for the tax breaks is that the business will result in a net increase in taxes due to increased spending.'
p10807
aS"Much as I appreciate art, most of it isn't going to raise the amount of money people spend in the community."
p10808
aS'Lacking ~~Rent Protection~~ *Owning the Building*, Artist ~~Community~~ *Rented Office Space* Faces ~~Displacement~~ *Normal Business Relocation Issues*.'
p10809
aS"Edit: I'm not saying it doesn't suck... it does, i'm friends with one of the guys who works there, but conflating this to evictions is nonsense."
p10810
aS"It's a commercial space, giving rent control to businesses is a wildly unwise thing to do in any economy. "
p10811
aS'It has its issues in residential communities too. '
p10812
aS'"$11.12 per square foot per year" is waaaaay under market value.'
p10813
aS"A rent increase shouldn't come as a surprise."
p10814
aS'The implied increase to $30 - $33 is still a good deal today.'
p10815
aS'It is sad when SF loses a bit of diversity though.'
p10816
aS"I, for one, don't want to live in a city dominated by one type or class of people."
p10817
aS'This looks absolutely amazing.'
p10818
aS"Does anyone know why this isn't already common?"
p10819
aS"It takes minor effort and expense, but many buildings are rented, so there's no guarantee that anyone will take care of them for any length of time, and the owner has no incentive to raise the value of a rent-controlled building anyways."
p10820
aS'Some landlords also seem deathly afraid of trees, just because of the minor maintenance and occasional sidewalk repairs.  '
p10821
aS'Sounds like it requires volunteer effort to do the plantings and care for the plants.'
p10822
aS'That is probably the main limiting factor once the regulatory hurdles have been cleared.'
p10823
aS"Also, it seems to result in quite narrow sidewalks, so it isn't suitable where the sidewalks are heavily used."
p10824
aS"I think some of their plantings do intrude a bit into pedestrian zones but it doesn't always need to be."
p10825
aS'That strip of concrete between the street and main sidewalk area (the strip planted with tree pits) need not be only concrete, it can be broken up into continuous planting areas.'
p10826
aS'The main obstacles are driveways and water meters.'
p10827
aS'I am a tad taken back the city puts street trees in these tiny rectangular pits and then the concrete breaks up and is a hazard.'
p10828
aS'Removing the concrete continuously around the trees longitudinally wold reduce concrete installation costs and repairs and allow more plants to be planted.'
p10829
aS'Edit: I forgot other obstacles from making these happen easily are parking meters.'
p10830
aS'I find it funny a tech city has old school meters still that clog up the street.'
p10831
aS"PS: I'm not from SF but love the city and thought I'd share this organization."
p10832
aS'Super cool.'

aS'Columbus St. is annoying as shit.'

p10841
aS'You and I apparently live in different worlds.'
p10842
aS'I vastly prefer a sidewalk filled with people sitting and talking and contributing to the street life over hundreds of dollars worth of square footage being given to people to store their private property at the benefit of nobody but themselves.'
p10843
aS'Wut?'

aS'Between the meters and the parking tickets, the city was making good money for that land.'
p10845

p11169
aS'It is actually basically half a studio.'
p11170

p11199
aS'Passive-aggressiveness by necessity is not overt and direct.'
p11200
aS'A good example of passive-aggressiveness would be if an upset family member intentionally bakes a pie, but chooses a type of pie the person they are angry at hates.'
p11201
aS'You of course will respond "Why are you nit-picking?'
p11202
aS'" or something similar, but maybe at some point you will self-reflect, and maybe choose your words more carefully (and accurately) in the future.'
p11203
aS'Also, back to the main point, your argument for the value of this sub 300 sq feet studio condo is that someone is currently willing to pay 415k for it, which is circular.'
p11204
aS'By your logic, it is actually impossible to ever overpay for a piece of real-estate, because by definition, whatever you pay for it is an amount someone is willing to pay for it.'
p11205
aS'Its a more complicated than just that, though.'
p11206
aS'The owner also has to pay real estate taxes (approx 1%/yr, so $345/mo), HOA dues ($289/mo), plus maintenance items.'
p11207
aS"Plus there's the opportunity cost of that $83k deposit not being invested."
p11208
aS'On the other hand, there are tax deduction considerations\n\nMath is hard, but this is expensive as fuck.'
p11209
aS'Its smaller than most studios in this city.'
p11210
aS'Not sure why everyone keeps throwing out 3k/mo in rent, you can get a *much* nicer placer for $3k/mo rent.'
p11211
aS'Sure, there are other costs.'
p11212
aS'You forgot insurance, which might be about $600/yr.'
p11213
aS'Now, the money is invested.'
p11214
aS'If the owner holds on to the place for 10 years, it will probably go up in value, so no big opportunity cost.'
p11215
aS'And then there is the income the owner can make on it.'
p11216
aS'They can rent it for at least 3K or live in it and stop paying someone else 3K+ for rent.  '
p11217
aS'Again, nobody is going to pay $3k for a place like this.'

aS"Prices for everything just seem so expensive anymore, I'll take the cash I saved and live elsewhere."
p11225
aS'Definitely a reasonable thought.'
p11226
aS'The way I think about living here and paying to do so, especially since I own a condo in SF, is that if I can make it here, I can move anywhere in the world.'
p11227
aS'If I had settled somewhere cheaper, I would have a very hard time moving to a more expensive area.'
p11228

p11249
aS'My feeling exactly.'
p11250
aS'The first thought you should have when seeing this is:  this is how legalized bribery works in America.'
p11251
aS'Remember how [Duke Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Cunningham) had his house bought for $1,675,000, and the buyer sold it a little later on the market for $975,000?'
p11252
aS'The only mistake Duke made was not taking advantage of the plausible deniability of a "hot real estate" market like San Francisco.'
p11253
aS"I couldn't find the previous owner but would love to know."
p11254
aS'Except that this price is verifiably market rate, if not below.'
p11255
aS'There is a floor for entry into any sort of ownership around downtown and that floor is about $500K.'
p11256
aS'There are a lot of people looking for the cheapest deal they can get, which pushes up the floor.'
p11257
aS'Once you go just $50-$100K over the floor, you get a lot more for less money.'
p11258
aS'Huh?'
p11259
aS'That price is $1,426 / sqft according to the article.'
p11260
aS'The median in San Francisco is $847 / sqft, up to $902 / sqft in Soma, where this apartment is.'
p11261
aS'The whole point of the article is that this is way way above market rate.'
p11262
aS'So... what are you using to judge "market rate?'
p11263
aS'"'
aS'My rule for market rate is what someone is willing to pay.'
p11264
aS'You are welcome to disagree, and it might not be scientific, of course.'
p11265
aS'My feeling in this case on why the SqFt is so high is that it is the location and new-real-estate-premium that dictate the price of this property.'
p11266
aS"I have no direct evidence to point to, but the rule in SoMa has generally been that you don't get into an immediately livable place for under about $500k."
p11267
aS'This means that even tiny apartments get bid up to there, right next to less nice but bigger apartments.'
p11268
aS"Then, if you add another 20-40% of the price, you easily double your square footage--it's not linear."
p11269
aS'What people are buying is the location, not the size.'
p11270
aS'And by that measurement the Duke Cunningham purchase was also market rate!'
p11271
aS'Yeah, there is no corruption anywhere in the world b/c efficient market!'
p11272
aS'I\'ve been in multiple situations in San Francisco where I could have paid a bribe &gt; $100K and seen an immediate return (I mean economically "could have", I haven\'t been tempted nor offered)'
p11273
aS'Not what I said, but you think there was corruption involved here?'
p11274
aS"It's always possible."
p11275
aS'I see no reason to think that, in this case.'
p11276
aS"Well, if there's any corruption, it'll be in these extreme examples that you'll find it."

aS'Want me to show you other examples of $1400+/sqft in SF?'
p11279
aS"I won't have to look far..."
p11280
aS'It kind of is what you wrote.'
p11281
aS'&gt; My rule for market rate is what someone is willing to pay.'

aS"It's understandable from a city planning perspective that there should be some restriction on taking rental units off of the market."
p11362
aS'This ensures the housing stock maintains a consistent number of units.'

aS'However, cities change over time and you have to respect the rights of the property owner to change their property according to their own economic needs and the demands of the city.'

aS'The Ellis act is very generous in that it provides $5-18k per unit in order to aid relocation.'
p11365
aS'This should be plenty of a safety net if we lived in a sane housing market.'
p11366
aS'We already live in a market where land rarely changes hands, and I worry that tightening restrictions on the Ellis act will only tie the hands of land owners from making their property available for the necessary improvements housing in this city greatly needs.'
p11367
aS'We have rent control to guarantee housing stability, but even that has been twisted from protecting residents from short term price fluctuations to creating the illusion that they permanently have rights to rent a given unit.'
p11368
aS"We probably wouldn't even be having this conversation if the past 50 years of voters accounted for the side effects of their housing policy, and I worry so much of this talk is about deferring solutions one more generation into the future rather than doing the hard work of actually building this city in a way that provides for all of our needs."
p11369
aS'We have old buildings with residents resisting improvements for fear of losing rent control, we have NIMBYs resisting construction because they want to make more money on their property values, and now we even have regular fires in neighborhoods where these code issues have never been dealt with.'

p11372
aS"I don't disagree that some adjustments are necessary, but I think that stability the current policies ensure are better than the uncertainty associated with having no idea what your next year's rent will be, whether you'll have to save up the money to move, or whether you'll have to find a new job in a less expensive area."
p11373
aS"I think there are probably policies that can maintain this benefit while lessening some of rent stabilization's negative impacts."

aS"I can't tell if you're arguing for rent control to be discarded or if you're just saying the allowed increase is too low."
p11379
aS"I wouldn't necessarily advocate for discarding rent control in SF entirely, but it definitely needs to be revised from its current form."

aS'Tenant protections in SF are obscenely skewed in favor of renters.'
p11383

aS'The likelihood of a tenant being evicted, even for just cause, is ridiculously low to non existent.'

p11389
aS"In my experience, it's people who actually try to grow and build a life here that this city really needs."
p11390
aS"The problem is they're the ones end up having to leave because they get married and/or have a kid and outgrow the apartment they got when they first moved here at 24 and can't afford a bigger place in the city as a result of price distortions caused, at least in part, by rent control."

p11401
aS'Housing stability means that when I move into a rental apartment, I can be reasonably assured of being able to stay there at a rate I can afford.'
p11402

aS'If the price is reasonable, it will sell.'
p13210
aS"If the price is not reasonable, it won't sell."
p13211
aS"You're obviously correct, but by way of explaining why people on this thread are disagreeing:  by far the most common way I see people price things is guessing at the costs (usually wildly inaccurate and dependent on cost-of-labor assumptions that are essentially made up) and then throwing in a couple dollars on top of that."
p13212

p13218
aS'It presumes everyone\'s time is "worth" the same and that my only alternative is to make my own broom.'
p13219
aS"the best part is the handle on this thing isnt round, and doesn't even look well sanded or polished at all."
p13220
aS"a few passes through a table saw and a quick zip along the belt sander and you've got the word working done in 5 minutes."
p13221
aS'and then once you get the hang of bundling and fastening the straw you can knock a broom out in probably under 15 minutes.'
p13222
aS'Not really.'
p13223
aS"$48 sounds pretty reasonable if you're factoring in overhead, economies of scale, living wages, and presumably expert hand craftsmanship."
p13224
aS'It only feels like an unreasonable price because our entire economy has been geared towards cheap, fragile, disposable goods imported from other countries where people are paid slave wages.'
p13225
aS"But given the fact that a well made broom like this could and should last you decades of use (compared to say, a chintzy plastic broom from Wal-Mart that will break on you in two years) you could make an argument that it's totally worth it."
p13226
aS'i was gonna say "but we\'re talking about a *fucking* broom here" however some of the most popular results for broom on amazon are already $20+ so...twice the price of bottom-middle end stuff I guess is not that unreasonable.'
p13227
aS'But the picture still strikes me as ridiculous, as in the end, it is a *fucking* broom and I dont think that says much about our cheap consumer culture, as people keep their dirty ass old cleaning products for years.'

p13229
aS'I dont know you but I love you.'

p13231
aS'Something we all forgot to do these days, take care of our things and not treat everything as being disposable.'
p13232
aS"You're assuming this broom is higher quality and more durable, justifying the price."
p13233
aS'Why would you assume that?'
p13234
aS'Based on the picture, the bottom part (the straw) appears to just be a standard broom brush, probably made in a factory.'
p13235
aS'The "artisan" appears to have just attached that to a shitty rough stick.'
p13236
aS'What makes you think this broom will perform better or last longer than any other broom?'
p13237
aS"Also, it's made of *straw* and some sort of soft wood (probably pine) so you can be pretty sure it'll wear out or break quicker than any plastic broom you could find."
p13238
aS'seriously, that octagonal stick will give you blisters if you use it a lot.'
p13239
aS"there's a reason most hand tool handles are round."
p13240
aS'The person who buys a $48 straw broom is not a person who does much sweeping.'
p13241
aS'I feel bad for the maid who will be forced to use this unergonomic thing.'
p13242
aS"this broom is probably fucking terrible, the handle isnt round, and isn't polished, it going to be uncomfortable as fuck and give you splinters."
p13243
aS'the flat edges will chip and ding and that will make it deteriorate faster than a round wood stock.'
p13244
aS'Also, for about $20 in materials you can spend an afternoon and make 8 of them out of a single pine 4x4, which is probably exactly what this person did.'

p13246
aS'Using your time and materials estimates...\n\n$20 in materials            \n3 hours labor @ $20/hr = $60   \nCost of materials and labor alone: $80 for 8 brooms\n          \n+200% standard retail markup        \nRough retail value of your 8 brooms: $240.'

p13269

aS'But only when t makes sense.'
p13271

p13275
aS'I can spend my time making an artisanal toothpick that is exactly the same as a regular toothpick and dare to say that its worth $50.'

p13278
aS'If you want to pay extra for no benefit because you think it makes the world better for some intangible, unquantifiable thing thats ok with me.'
p13279
aS'Also Im ok with people making their own things.'
p13280
aS'We live in a world where we need a lot more ultra cheap products because most of the world does not have access to that.'
p13281
aS'So ultra wasteful super expensive handmade products with no tangible advantages are pretentious and maybe even harmful.'
p13282
aS'Like I said.'
p13283
aS'It may be true for the US.'
p13284
aS'And what is cheap here may still be too expensive for the rest of the world.'
p13285
aS'So we have to learn from these experiences and make ultra cheap goods.'
p13286

p13296
aS'For the context of this argument, a wooden mass produced broom is as disposable as a wooden artisanal broom and will equally fill up your landfill.'

aS'The difference being that the 2nd one used up way more resources and is thus less sustainable.'
p13298
aS'You may have reasons to hate mass produced products that may be valid, but this talk of it helping the people is not.'

p15305
aS'Of course.'
p15306
aS'Almonds are ridiculously profitable.'
p15307

p15317
aS'That point of my initial comment was that I think people are taking away a good message from these anti-almond articles.'
p15318
aS'The message is that: Certain foods take far more water to produce than others, for example beef and almonds.'
p15319
aS'With this in mind, we can make better decisions to ensure our diets are compatible with our water supply.'

aS'so if this were to happen we would be producing and eating the same food?'
p15331
aS'another problem with the almond farming is that it is like 2 dollars of water to make 4 dollars of almonds or some very wasteful amount. '
p15332
aS"I don't think this is a good view of why people use Almonds and not animal agriculture."
p15333
aS"The first argument is that there's more chance that a single crop single output ingredient, such as almonds, would become unsustainable (as prices of almond rise with the cost of water, people buy less and farms have to close)."
p15334
aS'Almond and almond based products are a small market when compared to animal agriculture products: chicken, beef, pork, eggs, milk, leather, wool, etc.'
p15335
aS'People are saying that almonds have to shut down, when in reality the whole discussion is: what will happen is 80% of the almond production increases greatly in price?'
p15336
aS"There's also the issue of how animal agriculture is studied."
p15337
aS'The whole "pyramid" effect is used in ways that are convenient but don\'t capture the whole thing.'
p15338
aS'Farmers normally grow plants in cycles, they grow plants that consume nutrients and then grow plants that recover nutrients back to the ground.'
p15339
aS'Alfalfa is one of the better ones because it can get sold as animal feed.'
p15340
aS'Notice that better choices for animal feed (based on water consumption) would probably be soy and corn *except* that alfalfa serves a secondary purpose.'
p15341
aS'So if we take animal products, alfalfa will still have be grown.'
p15342
aS'Of course unless we decide to stop using natural techniques and just fill the ground with chemicals and hope it holds as well.'
p15343
aS'With that said, the solution is simple: reduce the tax breaks gently, use that money to invest in more water.'
p15344
aS'The problem is not that we are running out of water per se, but merely that the water available is very expensive.'
p15345
aS"I'm not talking desalination (though it is one possibility) but also buying it from out of state."
p15346
aS"The problem is that the weather may be changing (I mean if we are going to accept that global warming is real, then we shouldn't be surprised about it having consequences in 2015 after refusing to do anything drastic to change it) but that is something we'll have to see."
p15347
aS'Worst comes to worst, a second dust bowl happens (the first one was due to bad care of the environment too).'
p15348
aS"The problem of punishing the farmers, is that most farmers are in north CA were water consumption isn't that bad."

p15358
aS'&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, my top local political concern is that we should be building as much housing as the Planning Department believes the city could support, at all levels of the affordability spectrum, with the long-term goal being to accommodate everyone who wants to live here.'

p15362
aS'&gt; \n&gt; I ask because I was recently at a community meeting regarding [what to do with the Balboa Park Reservoir site](http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2014/01/renewed_interest_in_developing_the_empty_balboa_park_re.html), and a year prior, a similar one regarding what to do with the Glen Park BART parking lot.'
p15363
aS'In both cases, the overwhelming, strong-voiced majority demanded the absolute minimum development possible -- indeed, in both cases, the most popular viewpoint was to leave the parking lot in question as-is.'

p15365

p15366
aS"Are you silent on these matters because you think it's outside the scope of your mission, or because you believe that adding to the housing supply wouldn't have much of an effect (or a negative effect) on evictions and housing costs?"

aS"What's been interesting with the relapse is smaller law enforcement agencies have suffered the brunt of this."
p15579
aS'Local agencies have released a larger percentage of those held in county lockups than the state department of corrections has, possibly due to the fact the local agencies have fewer resources and thus simply prosecuted for the drug charge they could prove.'

p16082
aS'By contrast, if we were to cease all agricultural water use in the state, food costs will rise slightly and the state GDP will contact by 2-3%.'

p16098
aS"Let's not talk about the way consumers around the world would feel the pain."
p16099
aS'Yes, it would be a national recession.'

aS'This is such good news.'
p16210
aS'Shows that a simple solution can potentially cut costs (it costs $ to send workers to clean up street poop every time) and increase public health (less poop on the street).'
p16211
aS'Just imagine how much better the poop situation would be if these toilets operated 24/7!'
p16212
aS"Right now they are only open 7 hours a day, 4 days a week, yet there's already a 1/3 decrease in the # of poop complaints. "
p16213
aS'I have no problem using my tax dollars for this program, A 24/hr one and a couple more around town would be great too. '
p16214
aS"There's a key part to why they aren't 24/7: they have attendants taking care of them."
p16215
aS'Let me explain to you the logistical issue: people shooting heroin can stay in a bathroom for a long long time.'
p16216
aS'You could hire people 24/7 but the cost-effective part might go away.'
p16217
aS'Another solution is to have a timer, if a bathroom remains locked for over 15-20 (I have no idea what is a reasonable number) minutes a police officer will be called to investigate what is going on.'
p16218
aS"Maybe the reason this works is because it's such a small set of the day."
p16219
aS"Most homeless people would be willing to hold it in a bit longer to use an actual toilet and with consistent use their body would work so that they didn't even need to hold it."
p16220
aS"OTOH the people you probably want to keep off the toilets (for the sake of the other homeless) wouldn't wait either way."
p16221
aS'More around town would be a great idea, I think that it could help with the situation.'
p16222
aS"This coupled with the bathing stations I've seen would be great for the health and hygiene of the homeless."
p16223
aS'Wish the poop map had trend data to see changes over time.'

p16227
aS'Is there a date toggle for the "Poop Historical and Forecast" too?'
p16228
aS'If all else fails, I can dig into the [raw poop data](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Human-Waste/mv85-4ee7) and Excel pivot table this mother. '
p16229
aS'Not in the UI, but you can do that through the developer console (how to open in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console)/[Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console)).'
p16230
aS'Here\'s what you need to put in:\n\n    var scope = angular.element(document.querySelector("[ng-controller=\'MainController\']")).scope();\n    scope.forecast = scope.forecastPoop(100, 0);\n    scope.$digest()\n\nYou can replace 100 and 0.'
p16231
aS'The place for 100 is number of days before today, and the place for 0 is days to "forecast" (using polynomial regression).'
p16232
aS"that's actually a good idea."
p16233
aS"it'd be great to gather data and connect the times of when the toilets are out and when poop is added to the map"

aS'Litter will go down.  '
p16238
aS"Next step, bring back public ashtrays so those still smoking don't have to flick their butts on the street."
p16239
aS'Yes yes smoking is bad and will probably eventually be entirely prohibited, but in the mean time, it would cut down on that kind of litter too.'
p16240
aS'They can put butts in the trash, smokers are just lazy assholes.'
p16241
aS'They can, but it can be dangerous, since a not fully extinguished butt could start a fire in the trash.'
p16242
aS'Hate smokers all you want.'
p16243
aS'Tht idea will lower the amount of cigarettes on the ground. \n\n'
p16244

aS'I am on moblie or would link it directly.'
p16248
aS'Its sfw besides language. '
p16249
aS'So are homeless people, but we cater to them left and right (see above article).'
p16250
aS"Restoring a few well placed ashtrays would cut down on some litter, that's all I am saying."
p16251
aS"You can't put shit in trash cans without getting it all over your hands, this is totally a false equivalence."
p16252
aS"What purpose do ash trays serve for disposing cig butts that trash cans don't? "
p16253
aS"Ash trays have sand in them that can't catch on fire."
p16254
aS'Trash cans are full of things that can light on fire if you happen to improperly extinguish your cigarette.'
p16255
aS"Also they are often located where people actually smoke, which isn't always the case for public trash cans."
p16256
aS'As for it being a false equivalence, I disagree because many services aimed at the homeless operate under the theory that \xe2\x80\x9chomeless people have problems, and since we can\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily solve them in one fell swoop, we can mitigate them by X\xe2\x80\x9d.'
p16257
aS'These solutions don\xe2\x80\x99t always solve the root issues, but provide benefits for the person and for society.'
p16258
aS'Think of free needles for drug addicts.'
p16259
aS'Or better yet free disposal for said needles (I have seen boxes in certain public housing just for drug needles).'
p16260
aS'If you find smoking is gross and you dislike people who smoke, you may be  cutting off your nose to spite your face by opposing a simple solution that would reduce litter.'
p16261
aS'Yes smokers should stop, yes they should seek out trash cans when possible, but since we know many don\xe2\x80\x99t (for instance a lot of homeless people smoke and by nature of their predicament don\xe2\x80\x99t always view how their actions effect society as a whole), why not create more solutions that could help everyone?\n'
p16262
aS"You have to shit, you don't have to smoke."
p16263
aS'There are public trash cans within a block of anywhere in this city, public toilets are a mythical unicorn.'
p16264
aS"Once you're finished shitting you can't carry the shit around with you to dispose of it later, once you're finished smoking you can put it out and carry the butt with you wherever."
p16265
aS"Smoking and taking a dump are so wildly different in basically every way possible that it's fruitless to try and connect the two activities like you are doing for some reason."
p16266
aS"I'm trying to connect things that make public spaces dirty (shit/butts)."
p16267
aS"I'm not trying to connect them on moral grounds."
p16268
aS'Nobody has to liter therefore lets get of trash cans!'
p16269
aS"I'm only using analogies at all because the notion of ash trays = less litter was questioned."
p16270
aS'I thought the analogies helped explain why I thought what I thought, but I guess it made things worse!'
p16271
aS"I'm simply saying we like clean streets and my anecdotal observation is that since ash trays became rarer, the amount of butts I see on the ground has increased."
p16272
aS'A specialized receptacle for specialized trash is not unprecedented or unreasonable.  \n'
p16273
aS'As others have mentioned, some of them are definitely litterbugs but San Francisco charges smokers a tax (or in this case, a "regulatory fee") of [20 cents for every pack of cigarettes sold.'
p16274
aS'](http://greencitiescalifornia.org/best-practices/waste-reduction/SF_cigarette-litter.html) The resulting estimated $5,000,000 per year is supposed to be used to pay for the cost of cigarette cleanup, in addition to regular trash pickup.'
p16275
aS"I've never been able to discern much of a change in the amount of litter on the streets after that, but it was also concurrent with Mayor Gavin Newsom removing roughly half of our public litter receptacles, so who knows?"
p16276
aS'[" In 2007, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered workers to remove nearly half of the city\'s trash cans, which then numbered around 5,000.'
p16277
aS'](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-s-overflowing-trash-bins-are-public-nuisance-3668720.php) He said the action would ensure the bins were only used for the occasional coffee cup or food wrapper.'
p16278
aS'At the time, residents protested the move, arguing that fewer cans would only exacerbate the illegal dumping problem.'

p16283
aS'You are only screwing over the people who have to walk 7 blocks to find a trash can.'
p16284
aS'Sf taxes the shit out of people and one of the most basic things a city provides is sanitation police and fire.'
p16285
aS'In that order btw.'
p16286
aS'Its like the bathroom situation.'
p16287
aS'Of its late and I am drunk i will try and find a legitimate place to pee but if not i am not going to piss myself. '
p16288
aS'Except when the homeless dig through the trash and toss it back on the street.'
p16289
aS'2 cans were removed from my block and the trash has gone down a ton just because its not tossed back by the homeless digging.'
p16290
aS'Never thought of that.'

p16292
aS"It doesn't really bother me either, I get why they do it."

aS'Farmers can use tile drainage and a reservoir to conserve more water and typically get higher yields (at least this is the case for corn and soy.'

aS'Literally, in the same factory where the car is assembled, they wind DC motors, etch and solder circuit boards, stamp body panels, you name it.'
p16808
aS"They outsource a few things like glass and tires, but that's about it."
p16809
aS"I'm still not seeing the draw for Tesla here."

p16813
aS"as far as Tesla goes, i don't know if they'd align their brand with racing...yet."

aS'Formula E is a single-make series, meaning one constructor/manufacturer makes all the cars, unlike F1 or stock car racing where multiple makers field teams.'
p16815
aS"the extent of my knowledge of Tesla in racing is this: last July at Sonoma for a sportsmen-class drag racing event), there was a Tesla with manufacturer's plates (not dealer, mfr) was parked in a VIP spot."

aS'Most shows will just use the pre-recorded vocals.'
p16825
aS"The only show I've been to where the actual singers are there is Armin's and cameos at some of the bigger edm festivals."
p16826
aS"It's still pretty fun to experience however =)"
p16827
aS"So if there isn't anything being performed live, is most of the energy and fun dependent on the visuals (as well as just the atmosphere of being around other fans of EDM)?"
p16828
aS'All of this seems reasonable at the club experience, but seems somewhat weird in a concert atmosphere.'
p16829
aS'I honestly have no idea.'

aS"At genesis, the lack of expert knowledge within the Navy on the engineering and payload trade offs the fundamental design spec called for (high speed) meant that these ships, in the famous triad of every contractor's wisdom, weren't going to be on time, on budget, or soundly built."
p18148
aS'Needing to go fast (40 plus knots) in a small hull meant:\n---expensive because you need light weight materials and high powered engineering plants---and 35, 40, even 65 knot ships can\'t really displace quickly enough to dodge ship killing Mach 1-3 sea skimmer missiles...\n---being light and small meant lots of bad payload compromises ---no real endogenous medium anti air capability, no long distance (Harpoon-class) surface strike...compare this to the Spruance class hull---deliberately over sized to start, along the lines of 40%---with so much excess room to grow that vertical launch systems, close in defenses, RAM Sparrow, Harpoon, TLAM, and finally Aegis radar systems ---making the hull into the basis for an ABM defense system in the end---all were able to evolve on the platform or its variants\n---"Innovative" hull designs which turned out to not make the sea-keeping criteria required and, worst of all, actually had premature hull fatigue and developed cracks which needed repair.'
p18149
aS"--- mind numbingly expensive---to conceptualize this, the ships are supposed to be used as modern day PT boats or frigates ---in shore, in close to hostile shores (the litorals) where you expect everyone to know you are there and be able to shoot at you with their own assets--so you're gonna lose some...but at hundreds of millions per---it doesn't really work...\n---failed design concept (supposed to have plug and play mission modules; spec ops, mine clearing, intelligence, anti surface, etc...) changeable at wharf-side and redeploy able shortly there after and it failed."

aS'I know there are lots of people out there who are gloating that many Central Valley farmers are in serious trouble.'
p18324
aS"And I personally don't think we should be growing a shit ton of those crops where they are."
p18325
aS"But keep in mind that ag may use a large part of the state's water (40 to 80%, depending on the conditions), but it's also the first to get cut off."
p18326
aS"Also, the consequences of many farmers going out of business - if that indeed happens - will be enormous for the state's economy."
p18327
aS"Not only because of the financial aid the state and federal governments will have to provide, but the state's revenues will take a huge hit, as thousands of businesses throughout the state depend on that economy and will be seriously hit."

p18336
aS'The majority of the rice and alfalfa grown in the state also is exported.'
p18337
aS'Whether it\'s to "cover domestic consumption" or to be exported is irrelevant from an economic perspective.'
p18338
aS'Well I was thinking there is the economic perspective and the water use perspective.'
p18339
aS'Considering water use, stop using water for exported crops and any crops that are maybe over-produced (like corn).'
p18340
aS'Economically, have the fed cover any loses for destroyed crops.'
p18341
aS'Maybe my logic is flawed?'
p18342
aS"I'm sure the internet will set me straight. "
p18343
aS'Well first of all, the growers are the first ones to get hit from water restrictions.'
p18344
aS"Also, I'm not sure I understand why some crops would be given over others based on whether or not they're exported."
p18345
aS'This is not a socialist economy.'
p18346
aS'Whether the crop is exported is irrelevant.'
p18347
aS'You do make more sense if you start talking about crops that are not subsidized over those that might be, but that would suppose a state and federal agricultural and food policy.'
p18348
aS"The U.S. - for better or worse - doesn't have one."

aS'So there is no way to enforce that in any way.'

aS'If we want something like you suggest, we first need some sort of regulation.'

aS"The greater damage is going to be over the state's economy."
p18353
aS"A huge chunk of Californians live in metropolitan areas - S.F., L.A., O.C., San Diego - and do not realize how much the state's economy is dependent on the inland, in particular the Central Valley, which produces an incredibly bounty of crops for the state, the country and the world."
p18354
aS'There are thousands of businesses that are entirely dependent on it.'
p18355
aS'Hundreds of municipalities, and millions of people who live off it.'
p18356
aS"What happens when even a quarter of the farmers and the jobs are gone because we can't grow the world's almonds anymore?"
p18357
aS"Or when the citrus, alfalfa, cotton, rice, tomatoes, soybeans, peaches can't be grown there because water's gone?"
p18358
aS"It's going to be a recession of gigantic proportions which will affect everyone, because price of food will shoot up, which will - as always - affect the poor the most."

aS'I have a hard time believing that when _100%_ of people arrested for dealing drugs in the TL is black, there is no racial bias.'

aS'I have seen plenty of people of other races engaged in all kinds of sketchy activity down there, especially at UN Plaza.'
p18365
aS'I live in the TL and have personally seen people of all races get arrested there for both drug related and gang related issues.'
p18366
aS"I've seen white people arrested on Leavenworth."
p18367
aS"I've seen hispanics arrested in UN plaza."
p18368
aS"In fact most cops down there that I have seen don't even really care about drug usage, but dealing and gang activity absolutely."
p18369
aS"I'm not sure how you an say it is 100% of people arrested for drugs when that is just plain a lie."
p18370
aS'100% of 37 people total selling to undercover cops during one operation?'
p18371
aS'Sure.'
p18372
aS'Having lived there for years, you know who would violently approach me trying to sell me drugs?'
p18373
aS'Black gang members as they practically own much of that area.'
p18374
aS'How many people in the last year TOTAL not just this one operation were arrested for drug trafficking in the TL?'
p18375
aS'SFPD has had over 30 drug trafficking arrests this year alone.'
p18376
aS'Were they all blacks?'
p18377
aS'In 2014 a quick google search showed over 200 arrested/booked for drug sales.'
p18378
aS'Were they all black? \n\n\n\n'
p18379
aS'When I used to walk through the TL and 6th and Market, 100% of the people walking up offering to sell drugs were black.'
p18380
aS'If you go to 15th and Mission, there used to be a crack block there with mostly blacks selling.'
p18381
aS'A block down to 16th and Mission is almost 100% Hispanics selling heroin and I would assume some coke.'
p18382
aS"A few blocks up to Valencia and it's mostly whites selling coke and weed."
p18383
aS'The Haight and Upper Market is the same but with meth and heroin.'
p18384
aS'Chinatown has mostly Asians running opium dens and some other street level sales.'
p18385
aS'&gt; 100% of people arrested for dealing drugs in the TL is black\n\nThis is a great example of misusing statistics to draw a biased conclusion (see also: [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)).'
p18386
aS"If the sample population is largely black, and the actual number of people arrested is a small number in comparison to the entire population, there's a very high chance this outcome would occur even if police contacts were done at random."
p18387
aS'thanks r/sanfrancisco for upvoting this racist bullshit. '
p18388
aS'On second look, they may possibly have a case, but the article still makes no sense.'
p18389
aS'37 people were arrested, most of them women (11 of 18 on one day?'
p18390
aS'), yet that story ([and this story)](http://www.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2015/04/02/joint-dea-sfpd-drug-task-force-in-tenderloin-is-only-arresting-black-people) suggest that the officers were targeting black males.'
p18391
aS'I think the whole case depends on the "asian chick" and whether their informant had known the other dealers before the sting operation (which is suggested in the original article).'
p18392
aS'In the end, in the tenderloin, especially along market at civic center, has a lot of black people selling drugs.'
p18393
aS'Does this mean that all those that sell drugs here are black?'
p18394
aS'No, of course not.'
p18395
aS'Does this mean that black people are more likely to sell drugs?'
p18396
aS'No, of course not.'
p18397
aS"If this had happened in another neighborhood with different demographics, it would certainly raise an eyebrow, but 37 people selling drugs in the tenderloin and all of them being black simply doesn't seem shocking to me, primarily, because they used informants who probably know people in one social circle (which means you'll probably end up with some homogeneity), and also because it's simply a fact that most people who've walked around the area in the afternoons or evenings have been offered drugs, unsolicited, by black drug dealers."
p18398
aS"It's simply not shocking."
p18399
aS"If you think still that sentiment makes me racist, then i don't think you understand what racism is."
p18400
aS"I don't take issue with what you said, it's very plausible."
p18401
aS"I guess what makes me uncomfortable is that we know this won't be what white power groups, some within that very police force, will cite as the reason it was nothing but black people arrested."
p18402
aS"I'm glad these people are off the street."
p18403
aS'Regardless of whether they are black or white, they tend to be assholes that are an embarrassment to SF.'

aS'That said, while what you say is plausible, my amount of trust in this police force has diminished to the point that I would need it proven before I just accept this is how it is.'
p18405
aS'Of course black people are more likely to sell drugs.'
p18406
aS"It's not racist to state a fact like that."
p18407
aS'Are black people predisposed to sell drugs?'
p18408
aS'Of course not.'

p19077
aS"I can't speak to other areas in Bay Area because I'm not familiar with them."
p19078
aS'As others have stated, a bikeshare serves a different market than bike rentals, this is especially the case with SF.'
p19079
aS"You're not going to see tourists going across the Gold Gate in 45 pound bikes anytime soon."
p19080
aS'The Minneapolis bikeshare had three users types- commuters going from cheap parking and light rail stations to their offices in the CBD, weekend tourists, and Friday/Saturday night partiers.'
p19081
aS"As SF has a ton of huge hills, traffic and bad bike infrastructure(comparatively)- you can count drinkers out of the equation, they're already using rideshares."
p19082
aS'Tourists will likely continue to use standard bike rentals to get so Sausalito as well.'
p19083
aS'This leave the primary market as commuters who are getting into downtown from Bart and Caltrain.'
p19084
aS"My prediction is that by adding stations to SOMA, the Financial district and more in North Beach, we'll see a lot commuters (with year-round, 88$ passes) commuting distances between 2-10 blocks- a distance a bit too long to walk, but not worth using public transportation or ride shares."
p19085
aS'Unrelated; the bikeshare in Minneapolis hugely increased the non bikeshare bikers on the road as well.'
p19086
aS'This resulted in more  political will to dedicate more space and resources to bikes and transit.'

aS"You pay $9 for one day, but if you don't return the bike to a station within 30 minutes it costs you $4 more."
p19097

aS"If you're going to use it often, it's more expensive than buying a bike."

aS"If you're in a rush, it's not better than taking a cab / Uber / Lyft."

p19102
aS"You'll be making a ton of short trips around downtown in one day and you'd rather not walk?"
p19103
aS'Can someone come up with *one* coherent use case?'
p19104
aS"At $88/year, it's actually super cheap if you use it with any regularity."
p19105
aS"It's not meant to be an all day, bike-to-Marin-and-hang-out-for-the-afternoon solution, either-- standard bike rentals exist for that."
p19106
aS'This system is built for short trips, and most intra-SF travel can be handled in 30 minute chunks.'
p19107
aS"I guess it would make sense if you take Caltrain to the city, don't want to take your bike with you, and need something for the last mile to work (if your workplace is near a bike station)."
p19108
aS'It would be cheaper, faster and more predictable than taking Muni if there are always bikes available.'
p19109
aS"If you're in the city already and plan to bike around, might as well own a cheap bike and not stress about the 30-minute limit."
p19110

p19111
aS'If I commute into work, go out with co-workers afterward, and then meet up with friends at a few different locations, I have to retrieve, walk with, and re-lock a bike each time.'

p19113
aS"If for whatever reason at the end of the night I don't feel like biking home, I'm out of luck."

aS'The bike share makes it possible to grab a cab or Muni at any point without logistical complications.'

aS"Bike share isn't a bike rental."
p19116
aS"This isn't novel, it's a annual membership for commuters who'd like to commute one way by bike. "
p19117
aS'I mean this is a city where people pay $14 for a drink. '
p19118
aS'To me the sad part is that if this takes off, the city has even less of an incentive to fix public transportation.'

aS"I would like to believe that city planners think this initiative is a net benefit for everyone, but it's probably a good thing only for the young and well off."
p19120
aS'The poor (and those unable to ride bikes) need better public transportation.'
p19121
aS"That's a good point. \n\n"
p19122
aS"I can understand why you think that given Muni's track record and demographics - but bike shares are very popular in lots of cities with spectacular public transit."
p19123
aS'NYC, Barcelona, Paris, Taipei, etc.'
p19124
aS"They can definitely co-exist, one doesn't have to take away from the other."
p19125
aS"But hopefully it'll make the place safer for bicyclists, which usually has the side effect of slowing traffic on those roads and making it safer for pedestrians."
p19126
aS'Bike shares are complements to public transit, not competition.'
p19127
aS'They address the last mile problem pretty well, by allowing people to bike one-way to and from BART stations, e.g., without taking the bike on the train.'
p19128
aS'It\'s great for the "fill in the gap" situations.'
p19129
aS"It's perfect for those 1-2 mile distances - distances just far enough that walking takes a bit too long (~15-30 minutes), but waiting for a bus/train might not be worth it."
p19130
aS'We all know Muni is not the most reliable, and sometimes even with BART you have to wait 20 minutes for a train off-peak.'
p19131
aS"So for something 1-2 miles (say, Caltrain to FiDi) it's much quicker (~5-10 minutes) than walking, which for obvious reasons can be quite inefficient, and you're on your own schedule - no waiting for a bus/train."
p19132

p19145
aS"Yeah but when it finally arrives you'll get four service improvements in a row. "
p19146
aS'I bet the competition with other bus services played a part.'
p19147
aS'They have been raising prices and rolling back services for years. '
p19148
aS"Seems most of these changes are relating to rapid routes, so a lot of people probably won't see much of a change."
p19149
aS'Also, putting "new system map" as a shelter improvement is really reaching. '
p19150
aS"They're increasing service hours and I know for a fact that Muni has gone on a hiring spree (realistically, they cannot train people fast enough to keep up with demand)."
p19151
aS'&gt; The service increase, which amounts to about a 2.5 percent rise in service hours, is the first of three planned for the next six months, Haley said.'

p19153
aS'The increases were included in Muni\xe2\x80\x99s two-year budget.'
p19154
aS'Also, the rapid routes are usually the most congested ones (38, 14, 9, etc.'

p19165
aS'It would have been faster, cheaper and less irritating to walk.'
p19166

p19167

p19168
aS"For everything else I'll bike, walk or drive."
p19169
aS"I don't believe Muni will be a reliable way to move around SF in the foreseeable future."
p19170
aS'The Central Subway might alleviate some of this.'
p19171
aS'The frustrating thing about the KT is that is *should* be extremely fast - it has its own lanes all the way down 3rd street!'
p19172
aS"There's no reason it shouldn't be able to average ~20MPH including stops."
p19173
aS"Yet it crawls along because it isn't properly synced with the lights and for god-knows-what-else."
p19174
aS'What a waste.'
p19175
aS"&gt;  I've decided that I'll only use the Muni underground\n\nThis is pretty much what I do as well."

p19180
aS'Is Pocket Muni more accurate than Google Maps?'
p19181
aS'Google Maps said 9 minutes, but when the next train showed up (more or less when Google had predicted) it said "Not in service.'

p19210
aS'The ability to keep up with traffic makes all the difference for me.'
p19211
aS'On a bicycle I feel like a moving obstacle. '
p19212
aS'How about letting us use those 4 locked seats on every bus! '
p19213
aS"They're locked because other transit agencies were sued when passengers were injured sitting in those seats when buses abruptly stopped."
p19214
aS"So it's an insurance liability. "
p19215
aS'The bus manufacturer recommend it too.'
p19216
aS'According the New Flyer, three people sustained quadriplegic injuries in those seats (on top of any other less severe injuries) from hard braking.'
p19217
aS"It wasn't even a crash :/"
p19218
aS'It will be much safer to have them standing in front of the seats or just sort of awkwardly sitting on top of the locked-off part.'
p19219
aS'What percentage of people a) standing and b) sitting on seats that have been designated as unsafe by the bus manufacturer will end up quadriplegic after a traffic accident?'

p19221

p19222
aS'Then count the number of people sitting that are holding a hand rail.'
p19223
aS'This is about rider expectation for sitting versus standing versus leaning.'
p19224
aS'I had heard that too, but really the whole bus is pretty dangerous.'
p19225
aS"No seat belts, people are standing when it's crowded, etc. "
p19226
aS'its about liability, not safety.  '
p19227
aS"The point is that the liability issue isn't exactly solved with that fix. "
p19228
aS'Buses rely on the concept of compartmentalization to protect passengers in the case of a crash.'
p19229
aS"And generally put, buses are much larger and bulkier than regular cars, so proportionally, the damage won't be affecting the bus as much as a regular car would experience. "
p19230
aS'So long as they hit a car, rather than a building.'
p19231
aS'I love those "seats" they\'re the best ones on the bus.'

aS"Don't have to give them up for old folks."
p19235
aS"If you get the one next to the window they're almost as good as actually sitting down. "
p19236
aS"I'm kind of short so they're really uncomfortable to lean on."

aS'And I can barely reach the high bars to hold on to.'
p19238
aS'If there are no open seats it generally a rough ride for me!'
p19239
aS"I'm sure they'll forgive us if we're skeptical."
p19240
aS'Rather than more improvements to shelters how about actually installing more of them and putting up poles where there aren\'t shelters rather than the current "try and guess where the stop is" method of painting it on a nearby post or maybe just a worn-out patch in the middle of the street.'
p19241
aS"I'm still deeply annoyed that at the end of the 21-Hayes they removed some unnecessary stops (a good thing), but took out the ones with shelters and left the ones without."
p19242
aS'So now there are a few new, unused shelters on the outbound side a block or so away from the end of the line where nobody will ever use it, while the inbound side has absolutely nothing.'
p19243
aS"I wish they would do something about the N. It's a packed cattle car during any commute hour."
p19244

p19247
aS"Clearly the Nx buses aren't working. "
p19248

p19270
aS"They're already reversed engineered but it's generally not worth the felony charge to have a slightly reduced commute."

aS'The answer to homelessness is not trading money between very rich people and less rich (but not destitute) union workers.'
p19590
aS"Not that it wouldn't be great for everyone in the US (and world) to have a much more comfortable standard of living, but the left uses homeless people only as a motive for a fight against inequality, not as the object which that fight is meant to help."

aS'No one left or right cares for these people, so they are left out to rot.'
p19592

p19594
aS"This interview isn't about homelessness."
p19595
aS'The pull quote was about the homeless but the thrust of the interview was economic inequality in general, and a lot of people quite convincingly argue that the rise of income inequality is tied to the decline of the labor movement as a politically relevant voice.  '
p19596

p19597
aS'I love it how he created a false dichotomy (trichotomy?'
p19598
aS') and you just ignored it like the figment of his imagination that it was.'
p19599
aS"From the article: Bernie Sanders laying out his agenda, directly after bringing up homelessness:\n\n&gt;There was a time in the '60s or '70s when the rich wanted to get richer, but they kind of understood that it wasn't the worst thing in the world that their employees had a union; it wasn't the worst thing in the world that people had Medicare or Medicaid and that college tuition was often very low."
p19600
aS'What do unions, medicare/medicade or college tuition have to do with solving homelessness?'
p19601
aS'This is middle-class populism.'
p19602
aS'Homeless people have substance and mental health issues as well as limited access to affordable housing.'
p19603
aS'Driving up middle class home prices and giving them handouts when their children enroll in college does nothing for the truly poor.'
p19604
aS"Hmm.. by your response I get the feeling you don't know what a false dichotomy (trichotomy?"
p19605
aS') is.'
p19606
aS'I established that Sen Sanders brought up both points, showing that the two topics were introduced in the article.'
p19607
aS'Then I pointed out that, while they might not be mutually exclusive, helping unions and the middle class has very little to do with the day-to-day problems of the homeless.'
p19608
aS"A similar example: It might not be mutually exclusive that we can have a powerful military while helping the homeless, but funding more soldiers isn't going to improve the lives of homeless on market street in any measurable way."
p19609
aS'Multiple choice questions are by definition a mutually exclusive way of posing a question.'
p19610
aS"That's:\n\nA) not true\n\nB) irrelevant to the point I'm making "

p19614
aS'Actually, in practice, they absolutely are.'
p19615
aS'CA state (and many municipal) budgets are being absolutely fucked by union-negotiated benefits. '
p19616
aS"I don't think there is the political will in San Francisco to seriously address the problem."
p19617
aS'If we could completely fix homelessness in a humane way, that would easily be worth 1-5% of my salary in additional taxes to me.'
p19618
aS'I guess this would include addiction recovery programs, and a lot more housing based social welfare programs.'
p19619
aS'Homelessness is particularly tough to fix because the good services we provide here promote more people to move here as homeless.'
p19620
aS"A true solution would need to be on the state or national level, but that's where the lack of political will exists."
p19621
aS"Also, much of SF's inequality comes from the forcing out of the middle class."
p19622
aS'We need to make serous changes to allow the average family to make a life here and support the community.'
p19623
aS'This is where the true lack of political will exists.'
p19624
aS"How can we house the homeless when we can't even house our working people?"
p19625
aS"I'm not saying we shouldn't try to house them, but I'm saying the problem is one in the same."
p19626
aS"There's no reason that $22k per person shouldn't already house them other than that we've built a city that rejects more people from fitting."
p19627
aS'I agree with a lot of what you say, but I wonder how the level of homelessness is impacted by affordable housing - which sounds really weird, I know.'
p19628
aS'But when I was a little kid in the 60s, there were a LOT of people on the street here.'
p19629
aS'I remember how horrified my parents were as they tried to steer us around them.'
p19630
aS'Of course, there were a lot of hippies and a LOT of drunk sailors back then, so a very different population.'
p19631
aS'SF in general, however, was not considered an unaffordable place to live. '
p19632
aS"What I'm getting at is really two separate issues."
p19633
aS'The rate of homelessness will probably stay constant unless there is action on the state or national level.'
p19634
aS'However, one of the things that seems to be very effective for solving homelessness is setting up programs that get people into communal housing, and gradually work with them to live with some stability in an SRO or BMR housing situation.'
p19635
aS'While effective we only have three resources to take this so far.'
p19636
aS'If there was less scarcity of housing the $22k per person we currently spend would go much further.'
p19637
aS"There's no reason that that isn't enough to build communal housing for them all except that space is too expensive."
p19638
aS'Also, the middle class is the backbone of the city.'
p19639
aS'Regardless of how high you raise taxes the functionality of government on the city level is dependant on a healthy middle class.'
p19640
aS"Urban blight boomed in this country when families began to move to the suburbs because when you have large concentrations of poverty in the city with little middle class support there aren't much resources to go around to support schools, social programs, etc."
p19641
aS'San Francisco survived the era of suburban expansion because many people remained in the city, and the low housing stock retained value.'
p19642
aS'However, we live in a different time.'
p19643
aS'People are moving back to the cities en masse and the inability to respond to a changing future is hurting people.'
p19644
aS'Easy to give away 1-5% of your salary when you are in the upper middle class or above, but like so many programs aimed at helping the very poor in San Francisco, this would just make the city even more unaffordable for lower-middle/middle class folks. '
p19645
aS'I assume that any actual city income tax would be a progressive one, not a straight flat tax.'
p19646
aS'Also, taxing the upper middle and above leaves them with less to spend on everything else, slightly reducing overall local demand and therefore reducing the cost of living for us all.'
p19647
aS'If Vermont had temperate weather and hundreds of programs that would give homeless food, money and shelter and a bunch of political hacks "advocating" for them then he\'d be seeing homeless sleeping on his streets. '
p19648
aS'Did he see them shitting on the streets?'
p19649
aS'Thats always fun... '
p19650
aS'Somebody shit in the front seat of my pickup truck once at 8th &amp; Minna.'
p19651
aS'Then he went to sleep in the truck.'
p19652
aS'When I came out to get in my truck the guy woke up and took off like a jacket rabbit.'
p19653
aS'I can understand sleeping in my truck, but taking a shit in the truck and then going to sleep in the truck is a sign of some real mental or substance abuse problems.'

aS"The fact that this guy's brother rented some random 1BR in the mission for $2,500 is irrelevant to whether or not sfrentnow is practicing price discrimination."
p20310
aS"This is why I asked you for proof that they (sfrentnow) were advertising the same listings shown in OP's photograph at other prices."
p20311
aS"Nevermind the fact that listings by sfrentnow are typically going to be a little higher but that's because they are providing a service as a leasing agency."
p20312
aS"In addition their pricing is higher across the board, for ALL potential renters That isn't price discrimination."

p20319
aS'Damn you for wanting to make more money off of your own investment!'
p20320
aS'This is not price discrimination.'
p20321
aS'An example of price discrimination is a senior discount for a MUNI ticket.'

aS'This has nothing to do with you being wealthy.'
p20324
aS"Price discrimination doesn't mean that it's *impossible* for a given individual to get more than one price."
p20325
aS'It just means that the product is marketed toward different groups with different prices.'
p20326
aS'Senior discounts are a special case where you cannot get the lower price unless you actually are over a certain age.'
p20327
aS'**Discrimination** \n&gt; Action that denies social participation or human rights to categories of people based on prejudice.'

p20329
aS'According to the Wikipedia definition, no social participation in apartment bidding is denied to readers of swanky magazines.'
p20330
aS'Unless you are making your own dictionary, what you described is simply called marketing.'
p20331
aS'You seem a fan of throwing dictionary definitions at people, but you must have stopped short of looking at the [actual wikipedia page for price discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination), which reads (emphasis mine):\n\n**Price Discrimination**\n&gt;Price discrimination or price differentiation is a pricing strategy where identical or largely similar goods or services are transacted at different prices by the same provider in different markets or territories.'
p20332
aS'[1][2][3] Price differentiation is distinguished from product differentiation by the more substantial difference in production cost for the differently priced products involved in the latter strategy.'
p20333
aS"[3] **Price differentiation essentially relies on the variation in the customers' willingness to pay**."
p20334
aS"[2][3]\n\nNot sure if you're being disingenuous, but to be fair I made the same leap in logic that you made when I was in intro to microecon."

p20339
aS"As a reader of swanky magazines, I may be marketed to spend 200% on the same apartment as a non-reader of said magazines, but it doesn't mean that I'm restricted in this market."
p20340
aS"I can't however, change my age to 60 to buy a MUNI ticket on the cheap."
p20341
aS'The strongest example of MUNI price discriminating would be charging $6.00 for one-way users of the cable cars (to get $ from out-of-town tourists riding a novelty ride), but honoring weekly/monthly passes so locals can still ride them for transportation.'
p20342
aS"Price discrimination doesn't *have* to exclude a certain group of people from purchasing a good at a certain price."
p20343

p20344
aS'No, just no.'
p20345
aS'If I were an airline company marketing director, my marketing strategy is then: the price is inversely proportional to the amount of available seats and/or time before takeoff.'
p20346
aS'Saying that I, the marketing director, am becoming more discriminatory with time is just mixing up words and causing confusion. \n'
p20347
aS'WTF are you even arguing -- Price discrimination is a specific phrase with a specific meaning.'
p20348
aS"It isn't an insult, it's a sales strategy."
p20349
aS'"Price Discrimination" has appeared in economic literature for over 90 years ([1923 Paper](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1278063?sid=21106320908093&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739560&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=4))\n\n&gt; If I were an airline company marketing director, my marketing strategy is then: the price is inversely proportional to the amount of available seats and/or time before takeoff.'

aS"Thanks for the link to the study, I'll forfeit that analogy, then."
p20353
aS"I guess it's true, if my demand elasticity is higher, I can get a better deal on the ticket, and those that waited until takeoff can't get the same pricing."
p20354
aS"I hold my ground on the lack of discrimination in swanky magazine advertisement, however, there's nothing barring someone more wealthy than I from getting the same deal, time including."
p20355
aS"&gt;am becoming more discriminatory with time\n\nRight, because you wouldn't say that."
p20356
aS"Instead, you would say that you're employing a price discrimination strategy, setting the price inversely proportional to the amount of available seats and/or time before takeoff."
p20357
aS'"Becoming more discriminatory with time" would mean that your strategy *itself* is changing over time to segment the market more.'

aS'The term appears to denote a scenario where the seller has different prices for different segments of the population.'
p20379
aS'A landlord might accept a lower rent from someone in a lower income bracket, but advertise a higher number to those he thinks will just pay it without haggling.'

aS"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8326555/california-water-restrictions\n\n* California Governor Jerry Brown has announced the first-ever mandatory water restrictions as the state's brutal drought continues."
p20630
aS'* The State Water Resources Control Board will force cities and towns to reduce their usage by 25 percent over the next nine months.'
p20631
aS'* The state will also order golf courses to cut their water use, replace 50 millions of acres of lawns with drought-tolerant landscaping, and offer rebates for consumers to buy more water-efficient appliances.'
p20632
aS"* **This new round of rationing will not apply to California's agricultural users, who are responsible for roughly 80 percent of the state's water use."
p20633
aS"**\n* The move came as California's drought shows no signs of relenting."
p20634
aS'The snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, which typically melts and provides water in the spring, is at just 6 percent of historic levels.\n'
p20635
aS"Unfortunately that's not really the case."
p20636
aS'From a different article - "Agricultural water users \xe2\x80\x93 which have borne much of the brunt of the drought to date, with hundreds of thousands of fallowed acres, significantly reduced water allocations and thousands of farmworkers laid off \xe2\x80\x93 will be required to report more water use information to state regulators, increasing the state\'s ability to enforce against illegal diversions and waste and unreasonable use of water under today\xe2\x80\x99s order.'
p20637
aS'Additionally, the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s action strengthens standards for Agricultural Water Management Plans submitted by large agriculture water districts and requires small agriculture water districts to develop similar plans.'
p20638
aS'These plans will help ensure that agricultural communities are prepared in case the drought extends into 2016.'
p20639
aS'"\n\nSo while this will require cities to lower their water consumption by 25%, all it does it require Ag businesses to report their water use.'
p20640
aS"With Ag businesses accounting for about 80% of California's water usage, I don't see this announcement doing much to solve the problem"
p20641
aS'California has [25 million acres of farmland](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0825.pdf) so having hundreds of thousands of acres lay fallow is less than 4%.'
p20642
aS"So where's the Almond farm restriction?"
p20643
aS'I could have sworn that I read that they are responsible for something like 80-90% (probably way off..) of the water consumption in the state..'
p20644
aS"It's 10%, [according to Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/05/_10_percent_of_california_s_water_goes_to_almond_farming.html)."
p20645
aS"That's a lot."
p20646
aS'Agriculture as whole uses 80%.'
p20647
aS'But CA grows very water intensive crops like Almonds, Pecans, and Rice.'
p20648
aS'Rice?'
p20649
aS'We grow rice in CA?'
p20650
aS'that is plain silly.'
p20651
aS'It gets sillier.'
p20652
aS'[Some of that rice is sold to Japan](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2008-05-22/how-japan-helped-ease-the-rice-crisisbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice), which does not need to buy rice from anyone, due to some old WTO rules.'
p20653
aS'There, it sits in warehouses until they can donate some of it to some poor country that needs it.'
p20654
aS'So, at least some amount of water is wasted growing rice that nobody needs or eats.'
p20655
aS'Yay. '
p20656
aS"If we're picking battles, I'm more okay with almond or pecan farms getting a pass for now since they do help with stormwater runoff and air filtering and like, since they're trees."
p20657
aS"I'm sure the farms could do with some water rationing, though."
p20658
aS'Pecan and walnut trees are gorgeous too.'
p20659
aS'Love how large they get.'
p20660
aS"You got downvoted but it's true that we should give orchards a pass."
p20661
aS'Yes walnuts take a lot of water, but it takes decades to grow a mature tree.'
p20662
aS'We should focus on annual crops like rice, broccoli, corn, sun flowers etc... Crops that can start growing again when the drought ends.'
p20663
aS'If we let the trees die, it will take a long long time to get them back,'
p20664
aS"They use like 0.0001% of the state's water."
p20665
aS'And they have regional bottling plants, so their customers would largely be in California.'
p20666
aS"I don't think it matters, for water conservation purposes, whether a Californian drinks a liter of water out of the tap or a bottle."
p20667
aS'&gt; Your data is wrong\n\nSure, 0.0001% is just a made up number for rhetorical purposes.'
p20668
aS"But trying to figure out a real number, it appears that California agriculture uses [34 million acre-feet of water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_in_California#Uses_of_water) and that's 80% of the water use, therefore California must use 42.5 million acre-feet of water."
p20669
aS'According to [this article](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/bottled-water-california-drought), about 10 billion gallons of bottled water is produced in the entire US.'
p20670
aS"If we assume California produces 50% of that (which seems high), that's 5 billion gallons."
p20671
aS'But according to [this other article](http://www.scpr.org/blogs/economy/2014/09/02/17232/is-bottled-water-taking-away-from-calif-s-water-su/), about 2 billion gallons of bottled water is consumed within California, so that amounts to about 3 billion gallons net exports.'
p20672
aS'Plugging that into a unit converter, 3 billion gallons equals 0.009 million acre-feet, which is 0.02% of 42.5.'
p20673
aS'So, exported bottled water accounts for about 0.02% of water usage in California.'
p20674
aS"&gt; It doesn't matter what the volume of the water is."
p20675
aS'It needs to end.'
p20676
aS"It's just one example of an industry that exports products and uses water to make them."
p20677
aS'Why does it in particular need to end above all other such industries?'
p20678
aS'California exports wine, and it takes water to make every bottle of wine.'
p20679
aS'Does that need to end too?'
p20680
aS'Do we need to stop all exports of wine?'
p20681
aS'If not, why is that different?'
p20682
aS'I can think of many possible reasons that I have no data for.'

aS"What's your point, why does it need to end?"

aS'&gt; Call on water agencies to implement new pricing models that discourage excessive water use.'
p20685
aS'They really have a lot they can do here.'
p20686
aS"I noticed that the majority of my water bill isn't related to using water, but is for sewage and fixed fees."
p20687
aS'Seems like they could collect the same amount of money overall, but make it a simple price per gallon.'
p20688
aS'This would award water conservation a lot more.'
p20689
aS'Is the sewage usage based as well?'
p20690
aS"If so, it's not going to make a lot of difference since reducing water usage will directly reduce sewage as well."
p20691
aS'Yep part of it is.'
p20692
aS"But think about all the water use that doesn't end up in the sewage system - cleaning cars, watering plants."
p20693
aS'And those are the uses we need to cut down the most on.'
p20694
aS'You could structure the bill that water usages pays for sewage and in this way the largest water users have to pay more.'
p20695
aS'&gt; Call on water agencies to implement new pricing models that discourage excessive water use.'
p20696
aS'Its a nice idea, but our water rates have gone up despite water usage going down.'
p20697
aS"It's always nice to be punished for doing the right thing..."
p20698
aS'you are seriously complaining that water is more expensive in a drought?'
p20699
aS'In reality the cost of water distribution is fixed and if anything becomes more expensive to run as demand goes down.'
p20700
aS'&gt;In reality the cost of water distribution is fixed and if anything becomes more expensive to run as demand goes down.'
p20701
aS'Sure.'
p20702
aS'And after a certain point you literally can not conserve any more and yet your rates still go up.'
p20703
aS'So, do tell me what am I supposed to do then?'
p20704
aS'Stop drinking water?'
p20705
aS'Washing?'
p20706
aS'using the toilet?'
p20707
aS'Tell me, when will it end?'
p20708
aS'Where will it end?'
p20709
aS"Or perhaps it wont, it'll just keep going while the fields keep flooding.\n\n\n"
p20710
aS'If you are using water for washing, toilet flushing and drinking then you are not part of the problem.'
p20711
aS"It's the sidewalk sprayers, car washers and lawn sprinklers who need to change their behavior."
p20712
aS'And those people would be more sensitive to a price increase in water.'
p20713
aS'So yes you might conserve and your rates go up.'
p20714
aS"But if you hadn't conserved, your rates would've gone up *even more*."
p20715
aS"That's the entire point."
p20716
aS"Apart from the idiocy of blaming cities for water use, I'd direct a sizable middle finger toward LAT for their use of incredibly misleading units."
p20717
aS'50 million square feet?'
p20718
aS"That's 1.7 square miles."
p20719
aS"It's absolutely nothing."

We also talking about Au pairs, which run 18k+a weekly stipend equal to minimum wage, but we don't have the physical space in our SF place to house one."
p21892
aS"Until we figure out the money thing, we're going to have to keep a wrapper on it ... so to speak .. and I'm not sure there is a good solution for a middle class couple like us to procrate besides to move to another, cheaper city outside of the bay area, and give up our decent tech jobs and rent control here."

aS'I am really glad to see projects like the Salesforce Tower happening, but wish it would similarly happen on the residential side.'
p22009

aS"They aren't evicting themselves, they are driving up their own home values"
p22011
aS'I think the anti-development crowd is a much broader base than that.'
p22012
aS"Many people in rental situations don't have an understanding of housing economics."
p22013
aS'They see a new condo tower go up, and they see wealthy people moving in, and they mistakenly think the new condo tower caused the wealthy people to move in and drive up rents.'

p22023
aS'I will be honest and say I do not have peer reviewed articles from Jesus to support my point by I doubt that the success of a development hinges on building/not-building affordable housing.'
p22024
aS'I think you misunderstand my point - allowing no new market rate housing will _also_ stop the development of affordable housing.'
p22025
aS'If you are an advocate of affordable housing, you should oppose market rate housing restrictions, because affordable housing is built using the profits of market rate housing.'

aS'Furthermore, I do not understand your point about affordable housing being built with profits.'
p22030
aS'My understanding is that it is built with the same capital as the original housing development.'

aS'Are you implying that developers cannot afford to build both market rate and affordable housing projects concurrently?'
p22032

p22033
aS'You are still misunderstanding my point, which is literally exactly this.'
p22034
aS'Current regulations require a certain amount of affordable housing to be made with each housing development.'
p22035
aS'Developers do it because they can still turn a profit off the aggregate even with the affordable housing, which comes at a loss.'
p22036
aS'But people who demand development be "100% affordable" essentially ensure no developer will build it because the entire project will be a financial loss.'
p22037
aS'So a demand that something be "100% affordable" is really a demand that nothing get built at all.'
p22038
aS"Oh okay that's more clear."
p22039
aS'Yeah 100% affordable housing is not reasonable.'
p22040
aS'I also think that it is the opinion of a small but vocal minority.'

aS"Sure, billionaires are going to be interested in them more so than modest apartments with barebones amenities, but if we limit it to one unit per billionaire (because if they don't live in them then they must rent them out to non-billionaires), I can't believe there would be so many billionaires who wants to live in SF for it to be a big problem."
p22127
aS"And the argument that a vacancy tax won't do a thing to deter billionaires from leaving them vacant because billionaires are billionaires don't sound convincing to me either, because if that turns out to be true, then we've just discovered a great new source of city income that has been previously untapped."

p22137
aS'Homeowners already pay property taxes, so from my own naive imagination, vacancy tax can be built into that system.'
p22138
aS'When people pay property tax, people would also be asked to pay a vacancy tax or declare themselves as exempt through some paper/electronic form to be filled out (with clear definitions of what constitutes vacancy, and scary sounding warnings regarding fraud).'
p22139
aS'This makes it so that any fraud cannot be attributed to negligence or ignorance and is solely the result of dishonesty.'
p22140
aS'From there, we could have semi-random inspections (perhaps based on patterns of where fraud happen, e.g.'
p22141
aS"inspectors might target superluxe buildings and units with foreign owners more so than modest lower income homes), where if someone is discovered to have lied and sufficient proof is gathered, then there would be a hefty fine that is much greater than what the tax would've been."
p22142
aS"The point isn't to catch every fraud case, but to set the risk of fraud at a certain level where it works, and where you can't increase that risk through increased coverage (maybe because you don't want to spend a lot of city budget on inspectors), you can always increase the risk through increased penalty."
p22143
aS'I think as long as we make the both the risk of fraud and the cost of the tax greater than the cost of simply renting out the apartment, then the owners would choose to rent out the apartment.'
p22144
aS'Doing so can only be financially positive to them, and to minimize hassle, they can always use the profits to pay for a manager.'
p22145
aS'Of course there are other reasons why they might not want to rent them out, such as wanting the space to be flexibly available for themselves once in a blue moon, in which case they would have to either pay the tax or risk the fraud.'
p22146
aS"They can choose to do that and pay any tax or fine that comes their way, I'd be okay with it because it would be like compensating back the damage their practice is doing to the city's housing market."

aS"Assuming I agree with vacancy tax as an idea, then I personally think surprise inspections for such a purpose would be acceptable, and I'm not quite understanding why other people would agree with the idea but feel averse to inspections (if people don't agree with the idea to begin with, then it would be shut down before we even consider enforcement)."

aS'The market for that is basically limitless when you add in the tech and Chinese money, and it makes no sense for a developer to build middle-class housing when they can pay a bit more for better architecture and finishes and sell or rent for a vastly higher price.'
p22296
aS'The best one can hope for is that luxury tenants move out of their crummy 1 bedroom in a vintage Victorian fourplex and move into a newer high-rise in the same neighborhood, but that will, at best, slow the increase of housing prices, not bring them down.'

aS"Just because a model exists, it doesn't mean that it's at all remotely applicable."
p22321
aS'It\'s obvious that Econ 101 doesn\'t provide the exact answers, but conventional ideas of supply and demand are pervasive in all levels of Economics, and suggesting a fringe scenario (where the "new demand" exceeds the "new supply") that has almost no real-world examples (including the traditional example for induced demand: traffic) is far less credulous than conventional thought, especially without evidence and studies.'

aS'My view is that there is a huge housing problem.'

aS'The average rent for a 1-bedroom in Toronto is around $1k.'
p22553
aS"If people were moving to Toronto like they're moving to the Bay Area, you'd understand: building more apartments to house all those people, instead of having them displace others, is the only way to *save* the neighborhood."

p22594
aS'I realize Castro is a larger neighborhood, and there are probably loads of places that are well off the beaten path of where people head when the bars close.'

aS'Good point.'
p22640
aS"And I'm saying if there's going to be more density, it should be affordable, because otherwise why build new housing if you're just going to appeal to rich tenants who don't mind paying 1/2 of their paycheck on rent?"

aS'Yeah and Prop 13 artificially lowers supply by creating a massive disincentive to ever sell thus artificially increasing demand and artificially raising prices.'
p23636
aS"And the best part Prop 13 tax protections are distorting real estate for the entire state, covers commercial as well as residential property, it results in empty store fronts and empty rental units as 'locked in' owners wait for some sucker to agree to their fantasy rent request, and can be passed on to kids and grandkids or in the case of businesses (which never die) means the property tax value never resets."

p23638

p23641
aS'The property\'s "owner" never changes, and their property taxes never go up.\n\n '
p23642
aS"I am not sure if that exact loophole is true but buyouts/mergers are frequently designed to avoid triggering 'a change of ownership' that would reset the property tax valuation of any property."
p23643
aS'The exact mechanism used to achieve this end can vary.'
p23644
aS'The CA legislature has tried to modify Prop 13 but for the most part this seems to lead to a cat and mouse game between the business and the legislature with businesses adapting to the new rules and finding new ways to structure the deals and the legislature attempting to update the law.\n\n'

p23646
aS'How so?'
p23647
aS'Prop 13 limits how much property taxes can rise, except in the case of a sale.'
p23648
aS"In theory, it removes incentive to buy, but even that isn't happening in the Bay Area right now, with houses routinely selling for more than asking price."
p23649
aS"Right so say you bought a place for $500k in 2000 and it's worth $1.5 Million today."
p23650
aS'But for tax purposes your place is valued at $673k.'
p23651
aS'Your property tax bill is $6,730, despite the fact that your home is worth $1.5 Million\n\nSo your thinking about selling and want to buy a new place in SF.'
p23652
aS'Of course you want to buy a place that is equal or nicer which means spending at least $1.5 Million but realistically you are propably going to need to spend more.'
p23653
aS"Regardless that means you're new property tax bill is going to +$15k."
p23654
aS'So do you sell, get a new mortgage and more than double your annual property tax basis and now see your valution increase 2% on +$1.5 million or stay in your old place and see your property tax increase on 2% of $673k.'
p23655
aS'Everyone is going to answer the question differently but for many the answer is to stay, not see your property taxes double and not have to pay the annual increase on the valuation of the new property.'
p23656

aS"I don't know if I agree with this argument."

aS"If I'm renting out an apartment, I'm already going to charge as much as I can with or without rent-control: I mean, that's basic capitalism and economic theory."
p23703

p23704
aS'An apartment that is worth $1500/mo.'
p23705
aS'without rent-control is not magically worth $2000/mo.'
p23706
aS'when rent control is part of the deal, right?'
p23707
aS"There's a few effects going on here."
p23708
aS'The first one is for small property owners (say, an owner-occupied duplex with the second unit rented).'
p23709
aS'Under the no-rent-control condition, they know they can raise or lower rents to respond to current economic conditions, and rent it out at market rate.'
p23710
aS'Under rent-control conditions, they pad that rate to make up for their extra risk (risks such as a tenant who lives there for 15 years, a tenant who does a lot of damage, etc).'
p23711
aS'**If they are unable to get that padded rate, then they pull the unit off the market**.'
p23712
aS"You're right that an apartment is not magically worth more (to a renter) under the rent control condition."
p23713
aS"But it costs more to maintain for the landlord, and if the landlord doesn't think they can recoup their costs, they won't put it on the market\n\nThe second one is for large property owners (management companies)."
p23714
aS'They likely own a lot of housing, and a fraction of it is long term tenants under rent control with below-market rents.'
p23715
aS"In this condition, the value of individual apartments doesn't change, but the value of all of the apartments the company owns goes up."
p23716
aS'That is to say, they can afford to *lose* money on long term rent-controlled tenants, so long as they recoup it in other apartments.'
p23717
aS'So what they do, is **prioritize high end housing**.'
p23718
aS"If you're a property manager, and you already have large liabilities in the form of below-market rent control tenants, in order to balance your books you need equal amounts of above-market tenants."
p23719
aS"So you build high end luxury apartments, and attract rich tenants who don't care that your profit margin on them is higher than other renters."
p23720
aS"The price of individual units doesn't change much, but the average price of housing in the city goes up, as more housing gets converted into higher end, more expensive housing."
p23721
aS"The third one affects all rental unit owners, and it's that supply is so out of whack with demand that they can actually afford to do this."
p23722
aS"Let's say that an apartment is worth $1500 without rent control, but the landlord needs to charge $2000 under rent control to make it work."
p23723
aS'At competitive equilibrium, this would not be possible.'
p23724
aS'Everyone willing and able to pay $2000 already do.'
p23725
aS"But we're not there."
p23726
aS'In the San Francisco in which we live, dozens of people want each apartment.'
p23727
aS'These people are distributed across a spectrum of incomes.'
p23728
aS"If a landlord needs to charge $2000 for a $1500 property to make the books balance, he'll have an easy time finding a rich enough tenant who cares more about location (in SF!"
p23729
aS') than quality.'
p23730
aS'In this sense, rent control **forces the market price of available housing to increase in lock-step**.'
p23731
aS"It's not that one apartment magically becomes worth more."
p23732
aS"It's that the price of all of the units collectively increases faster than it otherwise would."
p23733
aS'----\n\nRent control is a solved problem in economics, so to speak.'
p23734
aS'There is a strong consensus amongst subject matter experts that it reduces the quality and quantity of available housing in the long term, while driving up prices due to lack of supply.'
p23735
aS"It's a short term fix with long term costs."
p23736
aS'Many people are hostile to anti-rent control arguments on intuitive levels: "How will letting my landlord charge me more lower my rent?".'
p23737
aS"***It won't***."
p23738
aS"Any end to rent control will, in the short term, fuck a *lot* of people who can't afford rent increases."
p23739
aS'The important part is that rent control creates perverse incentives that cause these problems *over the long term*.'
p23740
aS'Removing rent control will help solve these problems *over the long term*'
p23741
aS'That makes a lot of sense.'
p23742
aS'I appreciate the explanation via an economical perspective rather than libertarian/political one.'
p23743
aS"So often, it seems like I'm arguing about rent control with people who just feel more empathy for landlords than tenants, so it's refreshing that this argument removes empathy from the equation."
p23744
aS"I admit, I like the idea of rent control because on the surface it appears to help those in the most need of help (low income people that couldn't afford to live in SF)."
p23745
aS"I don't benefit from it myself, but I outright reject the notion that some people don't deserve to live here."
p23746
aS'However, it seems like rent control does much more harm than good, and it seems clear that it is not a long term solution.'
p23747
aS'And what do you think determines what you can charge?'
p23748
aS'What everybody else is charging.'
p23749
aS'There are a number of factors that determine how much people charge.'
p23750
aS'For example, if you got burned by having a tenant for too long you may decide not to rent the place again and sell it instead.'
p23751
aS'If you do decide to rent again, you may think "I was going to ask for 3k but you know what?'
p23752
aS"I'll try for 3.5 because who knows how long the new tenant will stay for."
p23753
aS"If I can't rent the place at 3.5 I'll just sell it."
p23754
aS'" As you know, this stuff happens every day.'
p23755
aS"About half of the rental stock in SF is rent controlled, and in some neighborhoods it's the majority."
p23756
aS'&gt;what do you think determines what you can charge?'
p23757
aS"What everybody else is charging\n\nSo we're in agreement that we both understand economics."
p23758
aS'I understand your argument but I think there are various confounding pressures at play when pricing an apartment, to simplify it to the point of saying "rent control = higher prices" seems to ignore that.'
p23759
aS'I do wonder if there is any data on rent controlled apartments being sold after tenant leases are up, or any related data.'
p23760
aS'Might give some greater insight on the matter.'
p23761
aS'Let us imagine a world where every home is occupied and has rent control but one...'
p23762
aS'Rent control discourages landlords from entering the rental market in the first place.'
p23763
aS'It also discourages those benefiting from below-market rents from moving.'
p23764
aS'These factors drive down supply, which drives up prices.'
p23765
aS"Both good points, but sometimes the market doesn't behave in predictable ways..."
p23766
aS"I'd be curious to know if there is any data that could illustrate the discouragement rent control creates for the market."

p23859
aS'While San Francisco has produced just 1,500 units a year over the past two decades, Seattle has averaged 3,000, adding them in a way that has improved the vitality of its downtown and kept prices from rising as drastically.'
p23860
aS'The lesson is clear: making it easier to add housing supply keeps rents lower than making it hard to add supply.'
p23861
aS'Kind of a weird comparison since SF is approx 49 sq miles while Seattle is 142 sq miles.'

aS"That is why rent isn't outrageous there. "
p23877
aS'Good catch.'
p23878
aS'I guess I meant SF is constrained by the geographical size/pop density and that per mile they have introduced more units than Seattle... which could also be a reason why rent is outrageous here.'

p23911
aS'&gt; If you start from the premise of, "Manhattan-like is unfavorable"\n\nWhy not start from the premise of "Manhattan-like is great"?'
p23912

p23913

p23923
aS'Just trying to read between the lines here.'
p23924
aS'What exactly about Manhattan is unfavorable, and is that really enough to justify less development in the face of such crippling supply problems?'
p23925
aS"Rather, what's the point in supporting policy that will make the city less desirable than it is now?"
p23926
aS'People vote in their own interests, and yes, the character of the city is worth more than dropping the cost in rent by 10%.'
p23927
aS'Truth is, if 10,000 new units were available today, an additional workforce of 10,000 would show up tomorrow.'
p23928
aS'The cost of rent _is_ a problem.'
p23929
aS'But there are two sides to a supply and demand problem.'
p23930
aS"Everyone parrots the line that we need additional housing, but easily effective would be to limit the number of jobs which do nothing for the existing population, and only result in the importing of an additional workforce the city can't support."

p23949
aS"Currently, what's breaking is the price."
p23950

aS'&gt; One of these three has to break.'
p23953
aS'I agree.'
p23954

p24047
aS'But do you know why rents are so astronomically high in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties?'
p24048
aS'Because of runaway job growth and a de-facto moratorium in infill development.'

aS'Perhaps some percentage of people chose SF strictly for lifestyle reasons with no consideration of rent.'
p24056
aS'But as long as there are a substantial number of people who _do_ consider rent, which there certainly are, then adding supply to the South will reduce strain on SF - not because of people like you but because of the rest.'

aS'The Santa Clara county has a bunch of houses with very low demand.'
p24058
aS"If it wasn't the case the house prices in the county would be higher as more and more people fight to live in there."

p24062
aS"Building more housing in SF will only make it more attractive (because it'd be cheaper), driving the prices for housing up again."

aS'All the bay area is increasing in demand because of how things are.'

p24072
aS"Well Santa Clara county extends all the way down to Gilroy, which is pretty far from the Bay Area, and I've only heard about it because they have the Gilroy Garlic Festival there."

aS"The thing is that demand is not how full somewhere is, it's how much people want to live somewhere."
p24082
aS"If one hotel is full and the other is half-way full, it might be that the full hotel is offering it's rooms at a quarter price, but most people (if money weren't an issue) would choose the half-empty hotel's rooms."

aS"You can't ignore price when using these data."
p24084
aS'A better way to think of this is in matter of economy.'
p24085
aS'If the price is "ideal" full consumption is done.'
p24086
aS"If the price is too low, then there won't be space left, if the price is too high then there'll be vacancy."
p24087
aS'So we can say that occupancy is directly proportional to demand, but inversely proportional to the cost of living in somewhere.'
p24088
aS'This means that we would see something like:\n\nO = D/C\n\nNow this is an oversimplification, both Demand and Cost have more complex relationships to occupancy, but it generally would look to something like the above.'
p24089
aS'So if San Jose and San Francisco had the same demand and the same rate of occupancy, they should have similar prices.'
p24090
aS"San Jose's average rent is [$2565](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-san-jose-rent-trends/), while San Francisco has [$3002](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-san-francisco-rent-trends/)."
p24091
aS"Again these numbers don't really prove beyond any doubt anything."
p24092
aS"But they do strongly hint that, since the price is so different in ways that occupancy wouldn't justify alone, the unknown variable (demand) must also be different."
p24093
aS'Since higher prices sustain themselves with higher demand, it only makes sense that demand is higher to live in San Francisco than to live in San Jose.'
p24094
aS'With that said, all the bay area is booming and has to deal with tough rental markets.'
p24095
aS"This is because there's such a high percent of occupancy that there are few suppliers that can collude and demand absurd things."
p24096
aS"It's a seller's market: people are more tolerant of shitty offerings due to lack of choice."
p24097

p24281
aS'These are the people that make me most nervous about my safety.'
p24282
aS'The roads are car friendly first, there is no doubt about that, and if we cyclists want to be treated as equals on the road, we need to obey the rules and ensure that cars can see us by using proper reflective gear and front/rear lights. '

p24285
aS'I feel like an unsafe cyclist makes the situation much riskier for themselves, but also would probably have a traffic calming effect.'
p24286
aS'I have seen some drivers respond with increased caution and yield to the cyclist.'

aS'Being calm while driving is something that eludes a lot of people!'

aS'Dumbasses that do dangerous things are generally putting themselves in danger, not you.'
p24304
aS'If your point is that the few blatantly dumb riders are causing drivers to act more aggressively towards you then I assure you that this effect is far outweighed by the increased awareness of cyclists on the road.'
p24305
aS'If anything, people doing dangerous things on a bike will make drivers even more aware of cyclists, just like if you were to suddenly drive/ride through a bunch of pedestrians that were all carelessly running in the street.'

p24311
aS'I am not trolling, merely stating what I see on the road every single day. '
p24312
aS'But like I said, the amount of risk that the small percentage of reckless riders are adding to the equation does not outweigh the benefit of increased awareness of more cyclists being on the road.'
p24313
aS'I\'m not sure what your definition of "reckless" is but it probably differs from mine.'

p24318
aS"When for some reason a cyclist isn't visible to the driver is when it's MOST critical for a cyclist to know ahead of time what the car is going to do so they can anticipate and adjust accordingly."
p24319
aS"Even use it when stopped in a clearly marked turn lane, because many people really are stupid enough to try to go straight from a turn lane and it's good for other road users to know what you intend to do."
p24320
aS'So yeah, not only be contentious and aware, but also be predictable.'
p24321
aS"Even if you never see me, if I'm paying attention like I should and I can tell where your car is going, we can avoid an accident."
p24322
aS"Don't attempt to cross a bike lane to make a right turn without first checking carefully and merging into the bike lane."
p24323
aS'This is actually part of the state vehicle code.'
p24324
aS"If you see a green light and just turn without keeping the bike lane in mind there's a good chance of cutting off a cyclist who was attempting to go straight through the intersection."
p24325

p24326
aS"Don't get impatient when behind a cyclist."

p24329
aS"Don't double-park in bike lanes!"
p24330
aS"You think you're pulling out of traffic, but now you're simply blocking two lanes of traffic."
p24331
aS"It's much harder for a cyclist to move around a parked car and requires merging into another lane where you won't be expected, often without a lot of advance warning."
p24332
aS"You shouldn't be double-parking to begin with, but if you do stay outside of the bike lane when you do so in order to keep it clear and allow cyclists to pass safely."
p24333
aS'As a motorcyclist, how about using your mirrors and checking your blind spots?'
p24334
aS"Don't drive with your headphones in, or your music so loud you can't hear the engine roaring 15ft away."
p24335
aS"Triple check before you make a left turn through a lane of traffic that there isn't a several hundred pound vehicle driving down that lane towards you."

aS'Fortunately the cyclist hopped off the bike without injury.'
p24345

p24350
aS'This study showed the drivers on their phones angle.'
p24351
aS'It would be interesting to measure the risk due to cyclists blowing through red lights/stop signs and compare the two maps!'
p24352
aS'The four-way stops in SF are absolutely brutal on a bike.'
p24353
aS'In my limited experience, a lot of the drivers try to be "nice" and wave through bikes instead of taking their right-of-way.'
p24354
aS"This leads to the situation where the car comes to a stop, you come to a complete stop on your bike, then you're waved through."
p24355
aS'If the car had just taken their right-of-way, you could have just slowed down and rolled through the stop after them, maintaining a little of your momentum.'
p24356
aS"I don't know whether bikes blow through stop signs because they're used to being waved through, or cars wave them through because they're used to bikes blowing through anyway."
p24357
aS"I'm sure it's so ingrained at this point, the only way I can think of to change things is to invest in better traffic control infrastructure."
p24358
aS"I'm not sure what that would cost, but I bet it's not cheap. "
p24359
aS'I bet better education would help too.'
p24360
aS"My driver's ed had pretty much no info about how to deal with cyclists."
p24361
aS'Maybe not an immediate solution, but at least the next generation of drivers would know what to do. '
p24362
aS'I absolutely agree.'
p24363
aS"It's practically an epidemic of misunderstanding between cars and bikes."
p24364
aS"When I drive, I usually try to defer to bikes that haven't fully stopped to let them roll through a stop sign because I know how beneficial it can be to maintain that momentum."
p24365
aS'But when I bike, it can be annoying when I do come to a full stop for a car and then they wave me through the intersection.'
p24366
aS'The only real solution I see is for California to adopt the ["Idaho Stop law,"](http://sf.streetsblog.org/2012/07/20/bikes-are-not-cars-why-california-needs-an-idaho-stop-law/) which alas, I\'m not holding my breath for.'
p24367
aS'Huh, that law makes a ton of sense.'
p24368
aS"Even respectful cyclist who correctly yield the right-of-way will still usually roll through a stop sign if it's their turn, so why not make it legal?"
p24369
aS'Because pedestrians?'
p24370
aS"Pedestrians should certainly be protected and have priority, but it's perfectly simple to do an Idaho stop and still look out for pedestrians."
p24371
aS"But cyclist don't."
p24372
aS'On market every day cyclists will sit in the middle of a crosswalk or roll through one where pedestrians have the right of way.'
p24373
aS'The wiggle is even worse. '
p24374
aS"I agree not all do, and those that don't should be persuaded to give way to pedestrians, but a minority being assholes is no reason not to fix a broken law. "
p24375
aS'I cycle commute on lightly trafficked roads for the most part and would love to have Idaho stops.'
p24376
aS'I am just so pissed at the scofflaw entitled attitude of so many other cyclists. '
p24377
aS'Yeah it pisses me off too when people mess with pedestrians.'
p24378
aS"In the same way I would like people driving cars to be polite and give me some space since I'm more vulnerable and take up less space on the road, people riding bikes should give the same courtesy to pedestrians."
p24379
aS"Still I do believe it's a minority and it doesn't help to tar all people riding bikes with the same brush."
p24380
aS'Most people I see (including car drivers) who go through stop signs are being pretty careful about it.'
p24381
aS'This is covered in the link diggaslidwell provided.'
p24382
aS'Pedestrians still have their regular right of way.'
p24383
aS"Yes, it's covered, but what is the population density in Idaho compared with San Francisco?"
p24384
aS"I don't really picture Idaho with anywhere near our level of congestion."
p24385
aS"It's an interesting idea, but you'd have to be OK with essentially giving bicyclists carte blanche to run stop signs."
p24386
aS'Well, since about 90% of them already feel they have carte blanche...'
p24387
aS'Or just obey the existing law. '
p24388
aS'Just stop at stop signs.'
p24389
aS"That's pretty much what I do."
p24390
aS'Was getting waved through so often that it seemed like everyone would be getting through the intersection better if I just went through after slowing to check.'
p24391
aS"'Blowing through' isn't the right description though, I'll always have checked enough and be going slow enough to to stop if needed."
p24392
aS'This is in a public space, why do you have to be discreet?'

aS'Why did you need to be "discreet" about it?'
p24397
aS"Maybe it's a joke about how OP's finger is partially covering the lens?"
p24398
aS'Presumably due to rushing the picture to be discreet?'

aS'This has to do with the sloshing that occurs in half full tanks.'
p25197
aS"One tight turn with a half full tank will cause the water inside to 'slosh' and generate enough force to roll a tank."

aS'Gas tankers usually only travel when completely full, so they avoid this sloshing problem.'

aS'For roughly a billion dollars, the plant will produce **7 percent of San Diego County\xe2\x80\x99s water**.'
p25223
aS'In Santa Barbara, a plant built amid the drought of the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, and idled by the return of rain, could come back online soon and provide 30 percent of the community\xe2\x80\x99s water.\n'
p25224
aS'I believe you.'
p25225
aS"It's a start."
p25226
aS"Edit: And if you think about it, the 'area' currently gets 100% of the water it needs from the current infrastructure."
p25227
aS'A 10% reduction in use is *huge*.'
p25228
aS'I agree.'
p25229
aS'I have faith that while there are some stubborn people in this state burying their heads in the sand, I know we have some awesome people who are working hard to keep us going.'
p25230
aS"I just hope some smart engineers somewhere can find a way to create a desalination solution that's efficient enough to reach an equilibrium with renewable power sources."
p25231
aS"Doesn't that seem like a lovely thought?"
p25232
aS'I have faith we will.'
p25233
aS'In the meantime, we have 14 plants in planning.'
p25234
aS'That should make a dent:)'
p25235
aS'Residential users just have to be willing to buy water rights from farmers.'
p25236
aS'Lets say farmers sell almonds in bulk at $5/lb, and there are around 100 almonds per pound, which is around 5 cents per almond.'
p25237
aS'It takes about a gallon of water to create one almond.'
p25238
aS'So farmers should be willing to sell their water rights around 5 cents per gallon (this is around 10x the current cost of EBMUD water).'
p25239
aS'Average residential water use is 100 gallons per day per person, so if people are willing to pay a water bill around $150/month (per person) there is plenty for residential use.'
p25240
aS"Almond farmers would even come out ahead in this deal because they'd get the same revenue without doing any work."
p25241
aS'edit: Of course, the price of almonds could then skyrocket and farmers could demand higher prices for water, but I suspect an equilibrium would be reached that can sustain residential use at affordable (but hardly painless) rates.'
p25242
aS'We need more than that.'
p25243
aS'If we move to fully contract buys that would only reduce usage to 80% of today.'
p25244
aS"I couldn't quickly find a source but that's just not enough of a cut."
p25245
aS'We are consuming a multiple of our rainwater.'
p25246
aS'We need more reduction.'
p25247
aS'It might be just enough though.'
p25248
aS'We have several desalination plants scheduled to come online in the next 5 years.'
p25249
aS'Combined with usage reduction, and rainwater it might just be enough.'
p25250
aS"I'm not sure though until I have a solid source."
p25251
aS"This is sensationalism at it's finest."
p25252
aS'The worst that will happen to California is the agriculture industry will go under.'
p25253
aS"Which really wouldn't be a huge loss considering that California is basically the world leader in multiple other industries (entertainment and technology to be specific)."
p25254
aS'Agriculture makes up ~2% of our GDP.'
p25255
aS"It's not essential."
p25256
aS"And that's where the bulk of the water is currently going."
p25257
aS'Well... California is the producer of a huge majority of many fruits and nuts (artichokes, walnuts, celery, spinach, carrots...) for the U.S. according to this article: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/07/california_grows_all_of_our_fruits_and_vegetables_what_would_we_eat_without.html  (which references this: http://www.motherjones.com/files/2agovstat10_web-1.pdf )\n\nThe OP article references this: http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/wheres-californias-water-going which additionally implies grapes, walnuts, broccoli at risk.'
p25258
aS'So it would seem the continuation of this drought might be a shock to the kind of year-round supply of certain foods that we are used to.'
p25259
aS'If there is a market for those vegetables and specialty crops *at the actual price it costs to produce them*, they will still be produced.'
p25260
aS"A large part of the money in our Ag industry is wine grapes, and at the margins they sell at, I doubt they're going anywhere."
p25261
aS'We do need to figure out how to give a soft landing to growers who have crops that are not easily replaced if they sell their land here and buy in another state, like olive and almond trees--these take years if not decades to fruit usefully.'
p25262
aS'The agriculture industry in California is a mortgage we took out on our future a long time ago and now we have to repay it.'
p25263
aS'It would make sense to use the additional dollars from tech.'
p25264
aS"It isn't the case that California has a unique climate which these things require to grow though."
p25265
aS'I imagine a drop in the supply of x crop would result in the crop being grown in larger numbers elsewhere - in places where it makes more sense.'
p25266
aS"It doesn't even have to be in the US."
p25267
aS'I was under the impression that the climate **is** pretty unique.'
p25268
aS'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Climatemapusa2.PNG'
p25269
aS'Unique for the US maybe, not for the world.'
p25270
aS'Sure, its called the Mediterranean climate ;)\n\nBut that would still be large shock for those items, right?'
p25271
aS'Since prices would include import costs and taxes.'
p25272
aS"I was just reading that the U.S. is 80% of the world's supply of almonds."
p25273
aS'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond#Production  And California is 99%-100% of the U.S. supply.'
p25274
aS'The other thing about almonds is that they consume a huge amount of water.'
p25275
aS"Maybe we sacrifice 80% of the world's almond supply to keep other California crops alive?"
p25276
aS"It definitely won't be a seamless transition, but there's no indication that almonds couldn't be grown elsewhere if the California almond sector dried up."
p25277
aS'Even if there are major shocks in the prices of food, "RIP California" is ridiculously hyperbolic.'
p25278
aS'California will be fine.'
p25279
aS'Give it 5 years, we can grow new almonds trees somewhere else. '
p25280
aS'But it will definitely hit the consumers hard though..'
p25281
aS'Why the hell are we using potable water instead of gray water to water them?'
p25282
aS'True title\n\nRIP Cheap almonds'
p25283
aS'Almonds so cheap we process a huge amount of them into almond milk.'

aS'Naw dude.'
p25286
aS"Coconut milk is where it's at. "
p25287
aS'You mean coconut juice?  '
p25288
aS'No - the stuff you get when you pull on the tit of a coconut. '
p25289
aS'Tot?'
p25290
aS'Coconut milk comes from the grated meat of a coconut, when you macerate it.'
p25291
aS'It is white, sweet, fatty and tends to come in cans.'
p25292
aS"You'd have to have quite a sweet tooth to drink much of it."
p25293
aS'But maybe you do.'
p25294
aS'Coconut water or juice is what you get when you break open a coconut.'
p25295
aS"It's mild in flavor and has vitamins and potassium."
p25296
aS"It's cloudy-clear and you can buy it in bottles at every supermarket around here."
p25297
aS'easy solution - individuals get some baseline amount of water that meets basic needs, like 10 gal/day or something.'
p25298
aS'After that, everyone, individuals, businesses, farmers, etc pays a floating rate by water which is raised by the state until consumption drops to a sustainable amount.'
p25299
aS"of course, CA won't do this."

aS'Lol no.'
p25313
aS"But, the rest of the country will be screwed because the Ag companies will have to shut and since California grows more, by far, produce (that isn't just corn or soy) the country eats and the prices will go way up."
p25314
aS'A lot of our fruits and vegetables already come from other countries.'
p25315
aS"If California shut down suddenly one day, yes, prices would go up a lot, but that won't happen."
p25316
aS'What will happen is that we will gradually phase out some of our agriculture and new supply chains will get it from elsewhere.'
p25317
aS"The ag industry is so universally messed up by the government it's astounding."
p25318
aS'We grow *rice* in California, in drought conditions, then the US sells a large amount of rice to Japan, based on economic treaties to stop Japan from only consuming its own rice.'
p25319
aS'Japan, in turn, takes the rice it is forced to buy and lets it rot in storage or feeds it to animals.'
p25320
aS"It's beyond ridiculous."
p25321
aS'The US only imports around 17% total.'
p25322
aS'Of the vegetables we actually eat, the VAST majority is grown in California.'
p25323
aS'I would imagine that almost all of that 17% is potatoes from Canada and Mexican produce in the off season.'
p25324
aS'Produce from Chile and other places are very small.'
p25325
aS'Also, how does the Government tell people what to grow?'
p25326
aS'As far as the rice in Japan thing, they must be throwing away a lot of rice because the market is huge.'
p25327
aS'As far as I know it is a fairly popular product.'
p25328
aS'Also, not sure why they would put tariffs on it if they are throwing it away, that just seems unnecessary.'
p25329
aS'The government tells people what to grow through subsidies.'
p25330
aS'More detail here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy\n\nIf you want to learn about the Japan thing, they are throwing away/feeding to animals the rice they are required to buy from the US.'

p26080
aS"I've noticed that what many people who criticize the sincerity of some philanthropists actually often says more about their own selfishness than their own philanthropic actions."
p26081
aS"Because anyone who's involved with charities knows that there are such philanthropists out there who give out millions out of sincerity - not just to avoid hitting a specific tax bracket before the end of the fiscal year."

p26106
aS'It probably will have the added benefit of being great PR, but his views on this, philanthropy, etc.'
p26107
aS"are very sincerely held personal beliefs that have been a core part of his company's beliefs since its founding."

aS"He's been a hugely outspoken proponent of philanthropy and civic efforts within SF and the SFBA as well."

aS'I have absolutely no doubt that his beliefs behind this action are sincere and, pun intended, "deeply held beliefs of the business owner".'

aS'If we could go back in time, and not change any actual good actions, but switch them all from being "sincere" to "insincere," nothing would actually change.'
p26123
aS"That's a fair point, I do agree we should generally judge people by their actions and it should go both ways even if the action is positive and the intent is questionable."
p26124

p26125
aS'You might be right that at the end of the day who cares as long as the insincere philanthropist is doing something good, but it feels unjust.'

aS"I also think there's a creeping double standard here that companies like Chick-fil-a shouldn't be allowed to have anti-gay policies but it's ok for Marc Benioff to enforce a heavy handed pro-LGBT policy for all of Salesforce."

aS'The rest of us would prefer not to make a small group of people who invested at the right time rich off of our hard-earned money, and absolutely do not agree with a business being shut down because of the greed of these landlords.'
p26548
aS"So, to be fair, this isn't fair."
p26549
aS"Hey, part of the reason I'm paying $2800/mo for a 1br is that because of rent control neighbors in my building are paying $1300 for the same place and have effectively pulled their apts off the market for well over a decade."

aS'I believe there will be a major change in how people perceive and view those who may be in different situations--both higher and lower "class"--and that together we\'ll create a system that\'s fair to all instead of those who are well-off at birth, businesses with limited regulations, and politicians whose power can be swayed by money.'
p26573
aS'These are simply my opinions and the opinions of quite a few others, a growing number of humanists eying how our socio-political-economic structure belies its main purpose--to fairly govern and provide communal services to our populace in a manner in which all available resources are applied to this goal.'

p26600
aS"Obviously, I'm not being lobbied by any corporations for this mindset, but I do think that most people will reach similar conclusions and come to the realization that the government has moved away from governing and protecting people to protecting the interests of its corporations, with social and economic reform being key points."

aS'What do you suggest we do?'
p26614
aS'If you are not wealthy, you probably did not purchase your house for an insane amount of money, and so you do not need to charge an insane amount of rent (highest rent in the most expensive city in the wealthiest country in the world, for instance).'
p26615
aS'Landlords in San Francisco can easily cover their expenses and still make a profit, hell even covering the cost of their mortgages is inherently profiting after expenses are covered.'

aS'Landlords shouldn\'t be able to evict residents under the guise of "moving in" only to turn around and turn the place into $3,000+ condos.'
p26627
aS'AirBNB rentals need to be regulated, at least in San Francisco, as we simply do not have the capacity to support turning housing into hotels.'
p26628
aS"Apathy to the plight of lower-income residents is pretty popular, because it's increasingly hard for even wealthy folks to find housing, but there is really no risk that the city will lose its wealthy class."

aS'And the wealthy class can take care of itself.'

aS"They're both human beings in need of housing."
p26639
aS'If every landlord asked themselves the question, "which tenant offers the most to our community (in the landlord\'s opinion) while still being able to afford a reasonable rent that supports my investment?'
p26640
aS'" then landlords could probably keep the city a reasonable mix of peoples and incomes.'
p26641
aS'But instead nearly every landlord asks "which tenant will pay me the absolute most amount of money and is risk-free?'

aS'"\n\nLandlords will generally, though not always, act out of greed and personal interest.'
p26643

p26662
aS'They have?'

p26676
aS'What a sad, simple mindset you have--this type of backwards thinking is exactly the cause of our issues.'
p26677
aS"Mutual benefit doesn't mean anything to you?"
p26678
aS'I\'m fairly certain you\'re conservative, and live under the guise of "keeping your money and what you worked for.'
p26679
aS'" The sad thing about people with that mindset is that they are unable to understand that people who champion these ideas and spread them to the masses are orders of magnitude more wealthy than those they tell to worry about their wealth, and it is they who stand to gain the most from convincing you to vote for politicians and representatives that favor their ideals.'
p26680
aS"Conservative ideals aren't there to help you; they're there to keep those in power wealthy, and in power."
p26681
aS'But, fuck that noise, amirite?'
p26682
aS"You get to keep your guns, and they've even convinced you that you need them to protect yourself from your neighbor!"
p26683
aS'In actuality, the right to keep and bear arms was created to protect you and your neighbor from the government, giving you a protected method of starting a revolution.'

p26685
aS"I would argue that it is irresponsible to start deciding how you're going to spend money with no consideration that it has to come from somewhere."
p26686
aS'Yes, it does have to come from somewhere.'
p26687
aS"Currently, citizens contribute about 91% of the US' tax revenue, with corporations contributing 9%."
p26688
aS"Personal gross income accounts for about 55% of the GDP, yet we're paying 91% of the taxes."
p26689
aS'The way it looks to me, there is already plenty of money being funneled into the hands of a few that can be reappropriated to pay for things that benefit people rather than corporations.'
p26690
aS"What we're doing now is irresponsible, whether you know it or not."
p26691
aS"It's very difficult to know exactly what corporations are doing with the money they earn from the US GDP pool, and there's a reason for that--more profit."
p26692
aS"That doesn't have people like you and me in mind, yet you're fighting to ensure a small group of already well-off people can remain so (unless you're actually a 100-millionaire or more)."
p26693
aS'Interesting.'
p26694
aS"PGI comes from corporations, too, so if you push down that road, they're just going to squeeze the balloon so corporations pay more taxes, individuals pay less, and salaries go down."
p26695
aS"I don't see how this works towards painting a perfect, selfless, socialist paradise."
p26696
aS'Like, you know, Cuba.'
p26697
aS'And what special right will you use decide that you get a nice apartment in the city and not me, a recent transplant?'
p26698
aS'Should landlords be forced to lose money also?'

aS'The landlord has no obligation to give away his property to tenants at the rate they deem fair.'
p26701
aS"He's not obligated to rent it out at all."
p26702
aS'This is YOUR greed and YOUR insane sense of entitlement, not the property owners.'
p26703
aS"If housing were regulated such that it couldn't be used as a profit cow for already wealthy people, this wouldn't be a problem."
p26704
aS'Housing wouldn\'t be "a risky investment", it would simply be housing, something everyone needs.'
p26705

aS'People need places to live, and major cities are national commodities.'
p26708
aS"I don't think our housing stock should be pimped out, otherwise we get the sorts of violent changes that San Francisco is experiencing."
p26709
aS'When only money offers entry to our cities, we lose collectively as a nation.'
p26710
aS"I still don't understand why anyone builds housing at all, where it comes from or how it is determined who gets to live where."
p26711
aS'Are transplants somehow treated differently than new comers?'
p26712
aS'Is there any new construction, and if so by whom?'
p26713
aS"Saying something is 'simply housing' does not create a functional model for the distribution of housing."
p26714
aS'I am open to alternatives, but frankly, I see the problem here as government interference in the market, If people were allowed to build in SF, this never happens.'
p26715

aS'No doubt I am missing something.\n'
p26718
aS"It would be great if landlords wouldn't charge the absolute maximum possible rent in situations like these, but the truth is, this is about greed."
p26719
aS"If I care about the community I live in, I don't gouge every inhabitant for far greater than the already respectable profit I was probably making."
p26720
aS'We could start by preventing "paying off" the requirements for low-income housing, to start.'
p26721
aS"Just like we have minimum wage laws to prevent employers from gouging their employees for maximum profits, we should guarantee that a certain percentage of low-income housing can't charge inhabitants $1,500+ per room."
p26722
aS'Unfortunately, these regulations are skirted more and more.'
p26723
aS'We should also limit the ability of landlords to leave units empty, or hold onto "vacation properties" that take up normal housing stock in our non-resort city. '
p26724
aS'SF is a unique city that requires unique solutions, and there are far more possibilities that others have mentioned beyond these.'
p26725
aS"I agree that we need more housing stock, but that hasn't saved New York City, and we can't build fast enough for it to save SF in even ideal circumstances."
p26726
aS"For now, it's important to protect the middle- and lower-classes."
p26727
aS"The first paragraph isn't policy and the second barely addresses the issue."
p26728
aS"Making low income housing cheaper is dandy, but doesn't impact market rates."
p26729
aS'Vacation properties might increase inventory to some marginal degree, although San Francisco is no doubt a vacation or summer spot for many people.'
p26730
aS'Most vacant homes are vacant because of some stupid local policy in any case, maybe a couple percent are vacation homes...most are left empty because of some cost associated with filling them imposed on them externally.'
p26731
aS'Forcing vacant homes to not remain vacant, regardless of why they are vacant, would solve the vacancy problem, period.'
p26732
aS'At this point, its inexcusable.'
p26733
aS"It's also not about making low-income housing cheaper, but enforcing a percentage of low-income housing city-wide, without the ability to skirt that law as many new developers are doing."
p26734
aS'Limit evictions and put into play some of the other suggestions people have mentioned and we are on our way to at least looking like we have a city government that cares about what is happening.'
p26735
aS'Charging people "market rate," which is at this point the absolute maximum that anyone would pay anywhere in the country, is unavoidable for many properties, but there are options to protect confirmed low- and middle-income individuals.'
p26736
aS'SF will continue to be an expensive place, but the way it is going, it will be **exclusively** for the very wealthy very soon if steps are not taken.'
p26737
aS'I agree there should be some easing of development regulations, but come on, developers would be chomping at the bit to build even if they were forced to provide some low-income units.'
p26738
aS"The only reason they don't is because of restrictions on development."
p26739
aS"Transplants would only be treated differently than current residents in that current residents couldn't be evicted for reasons of profit alone."
p26740
aS"Not everyone who wanted could live in SF, still, but the people living there wouldn't be allowed entry by merit of wealth alone."
p26741

p26742
aS'Unfortunately, it looks like city government is actively accelerating the turnover of the city.'

p26770
aS"Acting like we need some fundamental rights law when that does nothing to solve the problem that we as a society caused and could easily resolve is just a pointless exercise that let's the actual people stopping growth to continue to do so, and that is where the richest property owners are really spending their time."
p26771
aS"I guess I just think extra development won't improve our situation fast enough to make a difference, and in the case of Manhattan (similarly restricted due to water, but developed essentially to the vertical limit) ultimately did nothing to decrease rents."
p26772
aS"Thus I'm not sure demand will ever balance again with supply no matter how much we build."
p26773
aS"In that scenario, there's really no other option besides either watching the city near-permanently slide out of reach for so many people that it loses its social roots and sanctuary reputation for the conceivable future, or enact some limited but enforced social intervention from above, and trust that it's to preserve an important social element that keeps cities healthy."

aS'The latest cultural and economic shifts have really purged the area of a lot of good folks, and I just want to stop that bleeding.'
p26775
aS"Like I said, there's not much risk of losing a strong base of rich people, but I'm worried about everyone else."
p26776
aS'It would probably take the amount of development that you have in mind to fix this.'
p26777
aS'But you have to admit, that would be a pretty radical move for almost any city with as much irreplacable, beautiful historic architecture as SF.'

aS'That might actually work, but is far less likely, I think, than increased social protections.'

aS'The issue here is that but focusing on low income housing and statutory enforcement, everything you do squeezes the middle class.'

p26811

p26813
aS'No, just at the original offered price.'
p26814
aS"If charging whatever they'd like seems fair to you, you're shortsighted as you haven't thought of the end of that scenario--what happens when there is no land left to develop, or too many people for the available places?"
p26815
aS'Supply and demand has a limited ceiling as to what it can govern, as there will come a time when a resource runs out of availability.'
p26816
aS"Then they--in this case the landlords--can charge whatever they'd like and you'd be just fine with it."
p26817
aS'But the original offered price is arbitrary.'
p26818
aS"If you make a rule that the fist person to respond gets it, you obviously haven't thought of the end of that scenario -- landlords will just start with a much higher price, and slowly lower it until someone accepts."

p26834

p26862
aS"That's how housing should be--not a bidding war the unfortunate lose every time."
p26863
aS"The government shouldn't have had to buy housing if they considered these scenarios before, but they must derive a system to offset costs incurred by those who currently own houses when they do end up purchasing private property from individuals."
p26864
aS"The answer, I'm afraid, isn't complete and is far too complex to post here on reddit."
p26865

p26866

p26890
aS"You think you're special?"
p26891
aS'You sound like the greedy one to me.'
p26892
aS"No, I don't think I'm special--I simply think that people deserve better than being forced to pay market rate for a necessity such as housing."
p26893
aS"What I do know is that there are other ways to provide housing that cut out those trying to make a profit off of other people's living and working arrangements."
p26894

aS"&gt; [T]here are other ways to provide housing that cut out those trying to make a profit off of other people's living and working arrangements."
p26899
aS"Yes, it's called public housing, and it requires some of us paying taxes to subsidize the rent of the people who think they deserve it."
p26900
aS"That's the same argument conservatives use against a minimum income, even though the numbers suggest the cost would be equivalent to what we currently pay for social welfare."
p26901
aS'Your point is unfounded, and your tone sounds a bit classist to me.'
p26902
aS"Tell me, though--why don't people have the right to live in a shelter?"
p26903
aS"You mean: why don't people have the right to live in San Francisco?"
p26904
aS"Because it's not in the Bill of Rights."
p26905
aS'Feel free to get the ball rolling on a constitutional amendment that states we all have a right to live in San Francisco.'
p26906
aS'Or did you only want certain people who make less than a certain income to have that right?'
p26907
aS"You know, I didn't think of it that way, and you're right."
p26908
aS"People who have money should absolutely have the first choice in where they live--even if there's someone else currently living there."
p26909
aS'They have more money, right?'
p26910
aS"That means, in every case, they've put more work into making money, and thus should have first-rights to housing and numerous other things!"

p27345
aS"But there is a lot of truthiness to the idea that the reason vets don't treat a lot of cats that fall from 5-10+ stories high is because people don't bring those cats in to be treated."
p27346

p27353

aS'Better financed, so they only have a 30% chance of going out of business after 3 years.'
p28077
aS"Ignoring tax implications and the future value of money, we'd have expected values of \n\nOption A (within 10 years): 3years @$5k + 60% chance of 7 years @ $5k = (3*12*5,000)+(.6*7*12*5,000)= $432k\n\nOption B (within 10 years):2 years @$0 + 3 years @10K + 70% chance of 5 years@10K."

aS'"*) and liberal (*"open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values."*).'
p28287
aS"If, after reading that, you still think protecting the established store over giving a new store a chance is the progressive or liberal point of view, you're deceiving yourself to avoid having to confront a difficult realization."
p28288
aS"&gt;  Someone pointed out Libertarian is the proper term\n\nUm, no it isn't."

p28294
aS'As far as the topic on hand.'
p28295
aS'People are upset because they see a long established store that has been a fixture to the area closing because of the perceived greed of the land lords.'
p28296
aS"It isn't like they have any power to stop it from happening but that doesn't mean the have to be happy about the closing."
p28297
aS'You may not agree with it, but many people do. '
p28298
aS"It's your right to express remorse over the old establishment being replaced by a new establishment."
p28299
aS'What I object to is when you apply the "conservative" or "libertarian" label to anyone who dares think the new establishment might add as much to the city\'s culture as the old one did.'
p28300
aS"To the extent that such a point of view even fits the conservative-liberal scale, it's clearly on the *liberal* side."
p28301
aS'Warehouse worker here.'
p28302
aS"I don't see why the landlord shouldn't be able to make market rate on his property just so an overpriced novelty toy store can stay afloat."
p28303
aS"It's more like we are sad that non-chain places that everyone can afford are closing, replaced by either chain stores that can operate at a loss (because the value of branding in a world renknowned city is worthwhile) or by luxury service stores that only rich people can afford."
p28304
aS'Seems like a reasonable thing to be bummed about.'
p28305
aS'EXACTLY!'
p28306
aS'Thank you, someone finally gets it. '
p28307
aS"But again, that's not what's happening here."
p28308
aS'I suppose *some* restaurants might fit the bill of a "luxury service store that only rich people can afford", but you\'re jumping to conclusions if you assume that\'s the case here.'
p28309
aS"Much more likely, it'll just be, you know, a regular restaurant."
p28310
aS'Certainly there are no absolutes, exceptions exist all around.'
p28311
aS'But, I would image, places that can afford big lease increases over previous tenants are more likely to sell more expensive thing.'
p28312
aS'Even most "regular" restaurants are much more expensive than they were a few years ago. '
p28313
aS"When some other business moved out 40 years ago to make room for Jeffrey's Toys to first open, did that make the city better or worse?"
p28314
aS"I can't say, and I certainly am not against change by default."
p28315
aS'But the rate with which change is happening now seems to be accelerated, and the target of new places seems to be way more upscale than things in the past.'
p28316
aS"I am not sure if there exists a perfect happy-medium of organic turnover in retail spaces that would please everyone (the 'forward thinking' change-o-philes AND overly nostalgic sticks in the mud)."
p28317
aS'One analogy I sometimes think about that might get to the heart of your question is how did people feel when gay bars popped up all over the place in the 60\xe2\x80\x99s/70\xe2\x80\x99s/80\xe2\x80\x99s?'
p28318
aS'Surely there were previous owners/management with an established clientele, and I am sure plenty of folks were none too happy when their haunts turned into gay bars.'
p28319
aS'Yet now that most of those places have closed, or turned back into straight bars (if that is even a thing anymore), the gay community is sad and frustrated.'
p28320
aS'Same thing with the Mission.'
p28321
aS'It was something, then it was Irish, then it was Latino, then it was whatever it is now.'
p28322
aS'So what makes one change OK, and others not OK?'
p28323
aS'Probably nothing.'
p28324
aS'BUT, again I go back to my gut feeling that the change seems to be accelerating and creating a more homogenous flavor to the city (whereas it could be argued previous changes created diversity).'
p28325
aS'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the rate of change that is bumming people out, it\xe2\x80\x99s also that most new establishments are 10-20-30++++% more expensive than what they replaced.'
p28326
aS'It would be one thing if every Jeffrey\xe2\x80\x99s that closed was just replaced with some other mom and pop, middle class establishment.'
p28327
aS'San Francisco has been expensive (relative to the rest of the country) for a long time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been getting worse for my entire lifetime, but it seemed to follow a fairly gentle, if irreversible, path.'
p28328
aS'But the past 5 years, the change has gone off the charts.'
p28329
aS'So, while it makes sense that retail spaces are changing to match this new demographic (just like the previous changes did), the cost component seems to be drastically more intense this time around.  \n'
p28330
aS"That's absurd."

p28432
aS"If the answer to both questions is no, then the service shouldn't exist."
p28433
aS'Simple as that. '
p28434
aS"But on the other side there's a clear reason why this services were born: because there are unnecesary regulations, politics and corruption evade the system."
p28435
aS"Leap covers routes that Muni doesn't do well, and that's its main attraction."
p28436
aS"Uber is very simple to use, and part of the reason is that it's easy to be a driver, the system cabs used may have been the safest and most efficient in the 40s but it clearly isn't the case now."
p28437
aS'The limitation is clear, back in my hometown, in my college, I met some guys who had made this route between the college and the bars/clubs.'
p28438
aS'The route was extremely critized because it promoted people getting drunk.'

aS'It was political suicide to try to push something like that even though there was a need for it.'
p28440
aS'The irony was that the creator had created that private bus route in order to reduce the negative effects of alcohol: with buses as a cheap alternative to cabs, students would be more willing to ditch their car for the night and not drive drunk.'

p28459
aS"I don't want to use my personal insurance if someone else is at fault, why would I want to do that?"
p28460
aS"I agree, but it's a sliding scale of risk versus reward."
p28461
aS"While riding a traditional cab, you're likely to be fully covered in an accident, but at the same time, you're at higher risk of getting into one in the first place."
p28462
aS'In an Uber/Lyft, you may have a more difficult time getting covered in an accident, but the likelihood of getting into an accident is much lower.'
p28463
aS"For the latter, at least there's that safety net of having personal insurance which tips the balance in favor of Uber/Lyft for me."
p28464
aS'The regulations exist to solve a problem, but they often create more problems than they solve, making it harder to be competitive, to enter the market at all, and to run a business that benefits both the customers, the employees/contractors and the company itself.'

aS"I guess tearing apart four person startups is more satisfying than other internet activism, but if you're going to keep posting a few articles a day, I'm OK with this. "
p28482
aS"While I did post this I don't have anything against Leap or any of the other private transit options in SF."
p28483
aS'Mostly I found it a bit humorous.'
p28484
aS"However, the history of public transit in most cities is that it started as a private venture and was eventually a money losing proposition and the light rail and bus lines were 'sold' to the individual cities and expanded to serve the entire populace not just a select few neighborhoods."
p28485
aS"Unfortunately for Leap, and the others, since extensive public transit options already exist in most major cities if they fail the local government isn't going to buy them out."
p28486
aS'They probably would have been better off starting up routes in Marin or on the Peninsula, areas with high net worth, disposable income, and limited transit options.'

p29917
aS'In particular, we all tried not to break the law.'
p29918
aS'From time to time, I and others would encounter a moral dilemma and the way to deal with it was to let someone else work on the immoral part of the business and make sure that we were not personally doing the work that might not be legal.'

aS"But I will claim based on my experience that all these people thinking about the narrative of progress and improvement are likely to consider whether what they're doing is morally correct."

aS"it's gonna set you back $70."
p30024

p30025
aS"- California's current case law still allows cities and counties to regulate growing, and even pass ordinances banning growing altogether (see the Live Oak case)."
p30026
aS"There are challenges to this state of affairs, but it's unlikely they will go anywhere."

p30032
aS'- There is a strong opposition to growing in many rural communities, even in areas that are politically liberal.'
p30033
aS'Why?'

p30451
aS'As average incomes rise, so does cost of living.'

p30457
aS"But I just wish people were able to look past their own biases and put themselves in other people's shoes."
p30458
aS"A few people here are callous and indifferent, but the argument you'll hear more is that the city and area brought these problems upon themselves through years of refusing and red taping development."

p30468
aS'Of course, activists say that their donations might not directly alleviate the problems of those in the Bay Area, but why are they more deserving of assistance than, say, children starving in Africa?'

aS'Throughout history, it has never been the responsibility of public companies to look after the citizens of the communities out of which they operate - and for people to demand that now is, frankly, ridiculous.'

p30474
aS'&gt; do you think they prefer paying very high salaries?'
p30475
aS'Actually I kinda do.'
p30476
aS"Your point stands that it's silly to think these companies are overpaying employees (particularly with the intention of wreaking havoc on the local economy), and we even have evidence from the Apple/Google/Pixar/... wage-fixing scandal that tech companies try hard to underpay employees."
p30477
aS'But remember that Silicon Valley originated the fad of widely distributing stock options beyond the C-suite to regular (individual contributor) employees.'
p30478
aS"It's part of the Silicon Valley ethos to maximize long-term value and growth by giving everyone in the company significant equity participation."
p30479
aS"If tech companies were run in the traditional way, wherein all the benefits go to the execs and investors, and if these companies succeeded to the same extent despite this old-fashioned comp structure, then you'd just have a few billionaires with giant fortunes and not much real impact on local prices."

aS'There are only so many houses demanded by a few dozen individuals.'
p30481
aS'Instead we have the same number of (somewhat poorer) billionaires and a great many multi-millionaires demanding scarce resources.'
p30482
aS'In a way, the fact that tech companies actually distribute earnings more widely than old-fashioned companies makes daily life harder for those who are not a part of this prodigious creation of wealth.'
p30483
aS"It's also a way of hedging for the companies - if they don't take off, they end up burning less cash on employees."
p30484
aS"It's easy to forget that for every employee #50-500 at Facebook, there are probably 10 people that took below-market pay at a failed startup. "
p30485

p30501
aS'There is a lot of money here.'
p30502
aS'If you look at the chart in the article, the lowest 20% in SF make ~$25k/yr.'
p30503
aS"That's a good deal more than in any of the other top 10 most unequal cities."
p30504
aS'Only DC is really close with ~$21k/yr.'
p30505
aS"So the inequality isn't the result of the poor being worse off here, but the top 5% is just so incredibly rich."
p30506
aS'Look at some of the "most equal" places like Albuquerque, NM or Mesa, AZ.'
p30507
aS"The poor people there aren't materially better off than they are in SF, it's just that there aren't many rich people around."
p30508
aS'Is that equality or  is it segregation?'
p30509
aS'But is someone making $24k in San Francisco really better off than someone making $18k in Columbus, OH?'
p30510
aS'Housing costs will more than make up for that since there is so much money at the top of the income distribution pushing prices up.'
p30511
aS'Because of that they *are* materially better off, despite a lower income. '
p30512
aS'SF has great social services and abundant public transit.'
p30513
aS"Many other cities and metro areas can't say the same thing."
p30514
aS'There are additional costs to live in SF, but also valuable benefits'
p30515
aS'San Francisco has a higher concentration of high net worth /earning individuals than most other parts of the country skewing the data.'
p30516
aS"It's not that the poor people here are worse off than other places (could probably be argued either way) it's that the rich people here are richer and there's more of them than other places.  "
p30517
aS"So... you're saying there's a wider income gap in San Francisco. "
p30518
aS'Yes, just like the title, what I said is obvious and pointless.'
p30519
aS"While obvious, I would not agree that it's pointless. "
p30520
aS'Tell us what the point is.'
p30521
aS'Should everyone earn the exact same income?'
p30522
aS'Do the high income people need to start giving away their money to the homeless for their wonderful contributions to San Francisco culture?'
p30523
aS'The point is that this city is very economically stratified and those in the lower and middle incomes are particularly squeezed by the money pouring into the bank accounts of the top quartile and the impact that has on the cost of living.'
p30524
aS"I'm not trying to say that everyone should make the same amount, but I do think society would be well served by a flatter distribution of income."
p30525
aS"I don't really see what's so offensive about saying that there's a point to recognizing the economic inequality that exists in SF.  \n\n\n\n"
p30526
aS'Well put.'
p30527
aS"I wish they'd pay me more for polishing their monocles. "
p30528
aS'Having a ready, defensible solution should not be a prerequisite for acknowledging there is a problem'
p30529
aS'I think /u/anotherparasite is asking for an explanation of why income inequality is a problem.'
p30530
aS'That was the first sentence of his comment.'
p30531
aS'The rest were demands for what we propose doing about it.'
p30532
aS"It's a problem because cost of living scales with average income, so if substantial segments of the population remain at stagnant income levels while the average income level increases steadily, due to the highest incomes increasing rapidly, those segments of the population are worse for the wear as they have a harder time paying for goods and housing."
p30533
aS'True, but then I think the problem is best described as a quality of life gap instead of an income gap.'
p30534
aS"I think it's actually a pretty nuanced issue, since some people with low incomes in SF might actually have a high quality of life if they're in a rent controlled apartment.  "
p30535
aS"But the metric being accounted for is not a measure of quality of life, it's a measure of income inequality."
p30536
aS"Why would you call it something it's not?"
p30537
aS"The metric itself isn't the problem, it's the implications of the metric that are."
p30538
aS"I don't think we actually disagree."
p30539
aS'The metric is income inequality, which is an imperfect measure of the problem, which is a quality of life gap.  '
p30540
aS"You need to be specific about what the problem is or else we get solutions that are not fully thought out or don't target the actual problem but rather a symptom of the problem."
p30541
aS'For instance, is the problem income inequality or is it a lack of housing supply?'
p30542
aS'Are you an assholes IRL too, or just on the Internet? '
p30543
aS'You seem to believe the rich being rich and the poor being poor are two totally unrelated phenomenon.'

aS'in case the paywall starts working for you guys (I was able to access it for some reason):\n\n&gt; Though the idea of a second BART tube has been discussed over the past 25 years, in just the past few months it has assumed a striking new momentum.'
p30633
aS'&gt; A front-page article in The Chronicle on a second tube early this year has been followed by several opinion pieces in favor of the idea, blog postings and declarations of support from Mayors Ed Lee of San Francisco and Libby Schaaf of Oakland.'
p30634
aS'San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener is actively pushing the idea, as are Lee and his staff.'
p30635
aS'In April, the BART board will be asked to support a major study of planning and evaluation.'
p30636
aS'&gt; So, as the momentum develops, it is time to briefly note the changing travel dynamics driving this momentum, where the funding might come from, and whether the project may finally have reached a tipping point.'
p30637
aS'&gt; Travel patterns in the Bay Area have been evolving since the opening of the BART system 43 years ago, and continue to evolve.'
p30638
aS'One of the central principles on which the BART system was built, that of commuters coming from housing in the suburbs to the central cities of San Francisco and Oakland, was already out of date when BART opened in 1972.'
p30639
aS'And the dispersion of jobs throughout the region and multiplicity of commute routes has only grown since.'
p30640
aS'&gt; What has changed in the past few years, though, are several dynamics of system capacity and backup.'
p30641
aS'First is the heightened concerns about the fragility of a single tube: The tube is in need of repairs and has no backup if there is a breach, through intentional act or accident.'
p30642
aS'Second, the intense residential and commercial development pattern of South of Market has generated demand for direct transit service to that area, as well the growing interest in infill stations in the East Bay and San Francisco.'
p30643
aS'Third, and perhaps most important, is the lack of capacity.'
p30644
aS'As any BART rider can attest, the system is overloaded, as demonstrated by standing-room-only during rush hours, more frequent delays and breakdowns.'
p30645
aS'&gt; Several options for a second tube have been presented that would bring major transit gains.'
p30646
aS'One option is for a line from the MacArthur Station that would go south, with stations at Lakeshore/Grand and Ninth/Laney in Oakland, a station in Alameda, and then a second BART crossing to Mission Bay, with several stations in Potrero Hill and the Bayview.'
p30647
aS'A second option is to cross from Alameda to Mission Bay, continuing to Civic Center and then out to the west side of San Francisco.'
p30648
aS'&gt; From the start, two central issues of cost and timing must be addressed.'
p30649
aS'Major infrastructure projects almost always achieve high positive polling numbers when they are described in the abstract.'
p30650
aS'Enthusiasm wanes when cost is introduced.'
p30651
aS'The early, rough estimates for a second tube are in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion.'
p30652
aS'Funding suggestions have revolved around using state cap-and-trade money, federal and state transportation funds, parking fees and vehicle license fees.'
p30653
aS'Even if possible, these would not be sufficient.'
p30654
aS'From the start, it should be clear that some new source of dedicated revenue will be needed requiring a Bay Area vote.'
p30655
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it should be.'
p30656
aS'&gt; Second, if business-as-usual is followed, a second tube can take two decades or more (some estimates are for 30 years).'
p30657
aS'Any project approach must include a sense of urgency and willingness to expedite processes, before any implementation funding is committed.'
p30658
aS'If on a small scale, the rebuild of the Santa Monica Freeway in Southern California in 1994 and the rebuild of the MacArthur Maze in 2007, both completed months before the most optimistic projections, show the possibilities when a sense of urgency is present, and expedited processes are employed.'
p30659
aS'The rebuilding of the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge, years behind schedule, shows the opposite.'
p30660
aS'&gt; Large-scale California transit projects nearly always have required a long period of gestation, in which concepts are presented, discussed, dismissed as impractical or too expensive, then set aside.'
p30661
aS'But they may not be forgotten, and a combination of forces come together to achieve a type of tipping point in implementation.'
p30662
aS'Traffic gridlock significantly worsens, or technological advances increase feasibility or reduce costs, or new funding becomes available, or usually a combination of these elements, combined with one or several project champions.'
p30663
aS'This is the arc largely followed by the fourth bore of the Caldecott Tunnel, the Highway 4 widening, the BART extension to San Jose, and even for the basic BART system itself \xe2\x80\x94 which was first seriously discussed in the late 1940s.'
p30664
aS'&gt; It may be that the second tube is reaching its tipping point.'

aS"I don't think that's the smartest plan for a few reasons:\n\n[Ridership Report from BART](http://64.111.127.166/ridership/)\n\nI filtered it out and learned that Hayward, South Hayward, Union City, and Fremont totaled fewer than 20,000 boardings on an average weekday."

p30706

p30713
aS"Adding capacity to San Mateo County from Alameda County via rail would be awesome and something I support, but that's solving a totally different problem than the problem a second Oakland/Alameda to SF tube would be trying to solve."

p30716
aS'There have been plans to revive the decades old rail connection over Dumbarton Bridge to connect Redwood City to Fremont/Union City by rail.'

aS'But again, that part of the Peninsula is NIMBY paradise who will go jumping to court at even a mention of a new public transit project "that will ruin our lifestyle". '
p30718
aS"Alameda to Mission Bay is an interesting idea, as it's basically a parallel track to the existing one."
p30719
aS"The problem is cost, cost, and cost, since this project is going to cost a LOT of money, and it doesn't need that many stations in the area where you already have Muni surface light rail and such."
p30720
aS'What it needs is a convenient "hub" near AT&amp;T park (i.e.'
p30721
aS'link up to Caltrain) and downtown (like Montgomery or Embarcadero station) and digging through from Montgomery or Embarcadero to Mission Bay is going to require a LOT of geological studies.'
p30722
aS'May be easier to lay down a parallel tube next to the existing one. '
p30723
aS'By the time this is operating, Caltrain should run to the Transbay Terminal, and have a walking corridor to a BART station (not sure whether that will be Montgomery or Embarcadero).'

p30725
aS"Though with how much SF is growing in that corridor, I agree that it's a decent alignment."

aS'For what ever inane reason, Caltrain and CHSRA do not believe that they will have the space in the New Transbay Terminal to terminate *most* Caltrains.  '
p30727

p30728
aS"I think the idea is that if it came out at 4th &amp; King it wouldn't have to extend downtown because it would meet up with the new central subway (and the N)."
p30729
aS"Yeah, but that means it's not really a backup to the 'tube, but a different route altogether, since you can't really go from, let's say, Montgomery to AT&amp;T Park without going to West Oakland first."
p30730
aS"And BART and Muni light rail don't share tracks (side rail vs. top line for power)."
p30731
aS'In event of problems in the tube, there\'s no place to re-route the cars through the "2nd tube".'
p30732
aS'They pretty much have to build a new marshall yard in the Mission Bay for turnaround / holding.'
p30733
aS"They have to connect that line to SOMEWHERE on both sides of the bay for it to be a proper backup to the 'tube."
p30734
aS"I can see they try to connect BART to the new Transbay terminal via both tubes, but they'll need to connect it on this side for it to be used as a secondary route. "

aS'The need may be there for a second crossing, but do we have the ability to deliver?'

p30742
aS"Considering 400,000 people per day use the existing tube, I don't believe most commuters in the East Bay share your line of thinking."

p31393
aS"Most UberX drivers ask me what my name is, to make sure someone isn't stealing my ride."
p31394
aS'This, and asking for their name (rather than asking them to confirm the name you have, as OP did), seems like common sense security to me.'
p31395
aS"I'll be sure to do this in the future."
p31396
aS'I think that was my mistake by asking if he was Marcus with Lyft, all he had to do was answer in the affirmative.'
p31397
aS'why would he have done this?'
p31398
aS"You don't pay him in cash so what was his plan?"
p31399
aS'I guess to drive you to an alley and rob you?'
p31400

p31425
aS"I've had to report 2 drivers over the years (one for starting the clock before he picked me up, dumb because the map showed where he started it) and the other for having a dash cam that was recording passenger audio, and not turning it off when I called him on it."

p31723
aS'Instead it is an investment vehicle, and buying and particularly selling is driven by investment considerations.'
p31724
aS'Proposition 13 is the fundamental reason.'
p31725
aS'All of CA suffers from under-development and chronic housing shortage due to the tendency to treat residential units as investments, encouraging owners to lobby for anti-social restrictions on housing supply to protect the value of their investments.'
p31726
aS'Add to the mix SF geography which some real geographical constraints, and a political culture with sees anti-development as a liberal virtue.'
p31727
aS'Prop 13 should be limited to primary residences only.'
p31728
aS"That's really what drove its creation.  "
p31729
aS'Even more so, Prop 13 should be rewritten as allowing seniors/disabled to defer their property taxes against the value of their primary residence.'

aS'I support rent control, *and* I also understand that housing is a market.'

p31740
aS'How does moving into an old building determine my need for rent control?'

p31742
aS"Well, the 1979 cutoff isn't a San Francisco thing."
p31743
aS"That's due to state law."
p31744
aS'For me the irony is that the people who vehemently decry rent control also tend to be the people that staunchly defend Prop.'

aS'13 (which is essentially just rent control for owners).  '
p31746
aS'Is that true? '
p31747
aS'Which part, the 1979 thing?'

aS"Yeah, state law trumps local law which is why every building built after 1979 isn't subject to rent control.  "

aS'sorry, non-clarity to due to internet commenting.'
p31750
aS"I don't necessarily believe that the prop-13 people and the anti-rent control people are the same"
p31751
aS"What I don't understand is why a pro-development renters group such as SFBARF would oppose rent control?"
p31752
aS'I thought they represented renters?'
p31753
aS"The BARFers consider themselves (I'm using this language to remain neutral, not comment on this group) pro-renter by virtue of being pro-market, the idea being if you allow the market to develop reasonably, prices will fall on their own. "
p31754
aS"I've read that they would prefer to demo rent-controlled units and replace them with new market rate ones."
p31755
aS'It just seems they are more concerned in housing new arrivals than protecting existing tenants. '
p31756
aS"There's an argument to be made that protecting existing tenants is what created the current mess."
p31757
aS"It's not an unreasonable one."
p31758

p31767
aS"An example would be Prop B 'no to wall an the water front'."
p31768
aS'The people who funded that initiative to ax 8 Washington development and were most vocal were conspicuously property owners in the area.'
p31769
aS"At the least it can be said that Prop 13 creates a strong financial incentive for property owners to resist development, particularly of market rate units, and it's human nature to to cast around for self justification that that such resistance is actually based on something other than self interest and financial greed."
p31770
aS'No question that property owners supported Prop B but I would argue that they were more invested in the quality of life (and views) in their neighborhood because they are there for the long haul, rather than looking for return on investment.'
p31771
aS'Prop 13 is an incentive to stay put rather than to cash out and face higher property taxes for an equivalent piece of property elsewhere.'

aS'While urban-type densities can pay their infrastructure bills in as little as 4 years, often times timelines of 40 years are necessary to fund suburban densities.'

aS'Yeah, they are missing out on riding bikes around every day after school, but they get Sunday streets, the exploratorium and Academy of sciences (we practically live in museums that other kids get field trips to every other year) , soccer games on the marina green with the GG Bridge over their shoulder, diversity (there was ONE Korean kid in my high-school in rural IL), we walk everywhere, my kids eat everything, when we spend time at grandma\'s house in the country, I have to play "city sounds"  to get them to fall asleep (they like "busy city playground"), there\'s mission cliffs, rec and park camps (Silvertree Camp in Glen Canyon is everything summer camp is supposed to be, including the roasted weenies, digging in the creek and dirty campfire songs).'

p32098
aS'No one I know was trapped in a shitty school.'
p32099
aS'I have seen people move to private schools for lots of reasons, but typically not due to general school concerns - usually it has to deal with their kids requiring special treatment (either extra help or being too advanced), which I admit is where this district falls drastically short.'

p32101

aS'What it comes down to is this (and SF proves it perfectly):\n\nPeople who care about educating their kids congregate.'
p32103
aS"People who don't place an emphasis on education tend to get swept together as a result of this."
p32104
aS'And when you look at demographics, people who value education tend to have more money.'
p32105
aS'And being poor is a proxy for race in our country.'
p32106
aS'So in the end, the lottery, while attempting to be an equalizer, is only an equalizer for a small minority:  Those poor enough to qualify who still value education and are willing to send their kids to a school with a population that has a difference socioeconomic background than their own and a community foreign to them.'
p32107
aS'My feelings about it are tbh somewhat mixed as I agree about the self-segregation and other population dynamics that create wide variations in the schools.'
p32108
aS'I also think that the lottery has gone the way of most things in SF and become overly politicized.'
p32109
aS"It used to be strictly based on background; now it's based on address, with the CTIP preference which basically gives an opt-out to middle class people in nasty areas, and the neighborhood schools preference which locks many people in undesired schools.  "
p32110
aS'The CTIP is supposed to be a strong factor, but in my experience, the people in CTIP areas are usually not those that value education, and tend to forgo that advantage.'
p32111

p32112

aS'**\n\n&gt;We create attendance areas so there can be a system of helping you get placement in your attendance area school if you wish.'
p32121
aS'**You are not required to choose your attendance area school, nor can you be guaranteed a placement at your attendance area school**.'

aS'Middle school students get an initial placement offer based on the elementary school they attend, regardless of where they live.'

p32125
aS'Out-of-neighborhood applicants are last in line.'
p32126
aS"Ironically the example they give here is McCoppin which IIRC was a perfect example; almost no one in McCoppin's attendance area got their first choice, which wasn't McCoppin:  http://www.sfusd.edu/en/assets/sfusd-staff/enroll/files/2012-13/Assignment-Transfer%20process%20explained.pdf"

p32141
aS'I am aware that this process is not perfect and not fair to everyone.'
p32142
aS'However, the CTIP is a good way for people in poor areas to get their kids out of bad neighborhood schools.'
p32143
aS'My biggest complaint with CTIP is that there is not enough support to help kids get to other schools (buses, etc).'
p32144
aS"However, they still have to take advantage of it, and many don't."
p32145
aS"But no matter what you do, you will have situations of bad local schools when they are located in areas where there are a high density of families who don't value education."
p32146
aS'This is true for SF or any other method of placing schools.'

p32170
aS"You think that's a weakness?"
p32171
aS"My point is not that they want the nicer schools, it's that there is a significantly large portion of parents who look into all the *perceived* excellent schools, the ones with high demand and do all that homework, but don't even bother to look into the ones not on that list."
p32172
aS'You say they *toured a bunch* of schools?'

p32180
aS"That's lazy."
p32181
aS"But I have talked to many people, especially those who chose to move or go private, who didn't bother to even look at anything but the high demand schools, who put down 7 schools that were mathematically 1/5000 to get into."
p32182
aS'These were parents who cared very much, but were too stupid to understand the math, too lazy or too pompous to consider anything but what they *had heard* was the top tier.'

aS"And I can assure you, plenty of poor people lived in San Francisco in such unthinkable conditions; it wasn't just a city for the rich when the workforce levels were pegged to the slow but steady residential development growth."
p32443
aS'And trust me, SF was just as much  the place to be then as it is now.'

aS'If in ten years, and the number of employees living in SF doubles, Studios cost twice what they do now, and are typically doubled up on, are you really going to stick to your argument that reverting to the level ten years ago (ie today) would destroy local business, see a rampant rise in crime, and hurt quality of life?'
p32450
aS'Surely not.'

p32807
aS'Is there something inherently wrong with building tall and becoming a Manhattan?'
p32808
aS'The number of people who would abandon their small town to live in the glamour of NY, SF, London or Hong Kong is probably pretty significant... but before you can do that, you have to have a job.'
p32809
aS'So by reducing the workforce requirements to levels that the residential capacity can support, you also solve the "demand" for the same reasons why any random whomever can\'t simply move to Paris.'
p32810
aS'Demand that can\'t afford it isn\'t "demand".'
p32811
aS"And whether you can't afford it because your career doesn't make enough or because you can't out compete any of the local positions, the result is the same."
p32812
aS"I'd like to move to Tokyo, but I couldn't get a job there, so I can't afford it, so I don't count as demand."

aS"And it isn't the only solution to a housing supply issue."

aS'&gt; driving some, and their employees to other locales\n\nWhy are you more entitled to live here than the employees in question?'
p32821
aS"It's not a question of entitlement, it's about not laying out the red carpet for new residents to cramp out the current ones. "
p32822
aS"That's a big backpedal from ~~your~~ the initial comment that I quoted, which clearly called for driving existing people away."

p32830
aS'-----------\n\nThat being said, as a separate and entirely unrelated discussion we can broach the idea of entitlement.'
p32831
aS'Who is entitled to live here?'

p32833
aS'If I sit down at a restraunt, I expect not to be kicked out simply because the owner feels the next patron would spend more than I intend to.'
p32834
aS"But, at the end of the day, what it's really about is a democratic representation and the prevailing culture setting policy in their own self interest."
p32835
aS'Right now, the people who have lived in the city for a long time, either because they grew up here, or moved a long time ago have come to share similar values, and they outnumber those new to the scene.'
p32836
aS'This collective of sufficient like minded individuals is voting and demonstrating in their own self interest.'
p32837
aS'Nothing wrong with that right?'
p32838
aS'The prevailing culture of the city is one that seems to prefer a balance that skews towards things moving slow, with a deep appreciation for open space and open sky over their need for progression and growth, which believe me, exists.'
p32839
aS'But typically, they view growth and change not by population density and size, but in the transition from a vibrant maker culture surrounding radio shack into one furiously typing away in a coffee shop.'
p32840
aS'They are in the majority, they hold back growth because pace matters to them, and they are entitled to their preferences.'
p32841
aS'They may not be entitled to live here over you, but they are entitled to supporting policy decisions that cater to their values, which indirectly keep them in and others out.'
p32842
aS'Is that useful perspective?'
p32843
aS'Sure, as long as they own up to being the cause of eviction, displacement, and skyrocketing housing prices because they care more about "open space and open sky" than the plight of the less-fortunate.'
p32844
aS"Edit: But honestly, I'm having a hard time having any respect for someone who would put their own aesthetic preferences over someone else's living here *at all."
p32845
aS'* It just seems heart-achingly selfish.'
p32846
aS"That's insulting, unfair, and to be frank, unintelligent."
p32847
aS'There are multiple factors that are contributing to the housing issue.'
p32848
aS'The desire not to build up is one.'
p32849
aS'The desire to bring in a larger workforce is another.'
p32850
aS'I imagine there are half a dozen others.'
p32851
aS'Calling _them_ the cause is absurd.'
p32852
aS'Each of those components is a factor.'
p32853
aS"These issues are not on their heads, they aren't responsible."
p32854
aS"Your solution isn't a solution, it's economic suicide and not even fundamentally sound."
p32855
aS'Google and Facebook and Yahoo and Apple are miles the hell away.'

p32857
aS'Specific exceptions to a general proposal do not invalidate it.'
p32858
aS'This is more than an SF problem, solutions to your specific examples could include broader support from neighboring cities, or any variety of limitations or conditions of residency based on location of employment.'
p32859
aS"And that's presuming that your exceptions are sufficiently significantly to make a difference."
p32860
aS'Most of these are in the city.'
p32861
aS'&gt; or any variety of limitations or conditions of residency based on location of employment.'
p32862
aS"You already disrespect property rights, now you're disrespecting freedom of movement and residency--unfuckingbelievable."
p32863
aS"There's a precedent for this, however, it happened in Soviet Russia, to the Blacks in Apartheid South Africa, and continues today in North Korea.  "

p32870
aS"I asked for a solution about what could be done in Midmarket and you threw your hands up and threw out a bunch of red herrings that wouldn't work in that neighborhood."
p32871
aS"&gt; Now you're looking for something to disagree on just to disagree, and that's not a productive form of discourse."
p32872
aS"When you suggest banning people from living in certain places, that's not a solution."
p32873

p32878

p32879
aS"Let's say we want to make a sandwich."
p32880
aS'You say that only PBJ fits the criteria.'
p32881
aS'I say well, there are a shit ton of other sandwiches that worked in similar situations.'
p32882
aS'There are egg sandwiches, pastrami, ham.'
p32883
aS'You point out that none of these would work.'
p32884
aS'My point is that there are a ton of sandwiches.'
p32885
aS'One of them other than PBJ is likely to work.'
p32886
aS"Now, I don't know every single sandwich that exists, but it's absurd to suggest that PBJ is the only way."
p32887
aS"In fact, meatball would work, I just couldn't think of it."
p32888
aS"That doesn't make me wrong because I couldn't think of meatball."
p32889
aS"And because there are such a high number of sandwich varieties, the odds are in vastly in my favor there's a solution other than PBJ."
p32890
aS"The world doesn't exist in concrete realities, and if you can't come to grips with that, you're going to make mistakes like thinking PBJ is the only solution simply because the person you were talking with couldn't remember meatball."
p32891
aS"**If you're absolutely convinced that there's a ton of sandwiches that can be made to feed Midmarket, post the recipe for one already."
p32892
aS"**\n\nIf you don't know what that sandwich is, **quit thinking it exists."
p32893
aS"**  \n\nFFS, your *entire* argument about this is based on the non-existent solution that you're proposing which you  have no clue about to begin with.  "
p32894
aS'Yes, probability.'
p32895
aS"You're telling me that if you had to make a bet you would put your money on the _only_ solution to midmarket being twitter?"
p32896
aS"That you believe there isn't a single other solution?"
p32897
aS"The fact that I'm not a city planner is irrelevant."
p32898
aS'Your bet is dumb.'
p32899
aS'Mine is not.'
p32900
aS'Learn to think in the abstract.'
p32901
aS"You're not a city planner, but you're certainly acting like one elsewhere proposing the increase of business taxes to send them packing, suggesting limitations where people can live, and fighting new residential development, but when it comes to what to do with an actual disaster of an existing neighborhood, you have no idea."
p32902
aS'Makes plenty of sense.  '
p32903
aS"I'm as qualified to formulate an opinion as you are."
p32904
aS"Critical thinking allows one to approach a topic we don't have concrete, tacit, definitive or omniscient understanding of."
p32905
aS"Isn't the ability to abstract wonderful?"
p32906
aS"No, you're not qualified to formulate an opinion."
p32907
aS'Your ill-conceived suggestions for remediating the housing crisis are terrible for the City and are as unconstitutional as they are anti-American, your idea of the tech reality here is retarded by your personal convolutions and possibly-deliberate misunderstandings, and your contexts and examples to improve the built environment lack a basis in reality.'
p32908
aS'You have yet to post one single solitary source that justifies your wild opinions or propose any solution that is pragmatic and workable.  '

aS"&gt;The city's chief economist has said it will take 100,000 new units to impact the high cost of housing in SF."
p32918
aS'This amounts to doubling the number of units built since 1920.'
p32919
aS"Isn't going to happen."
p32920
aS'Not really much of an option at this point.'
p32921
aS'It can certainly be done over time, but residents are going to have to swallow that pill.'
p32922
aS"&gt;let's hear SFBARF advocate for some realistic polices that don't rely entirely on massive development to fill the gap."
p32923
aS"I'm sorry, but that's the only realistic option."
p32924
aS"I know it's not what you want to hear, but it's the truth. "
p32925
aS'OK, to recap, the only way to solve the affordability/housing crisis is to build 100,000 market rate units and wait for the trickle-down effect.'
p32926
aS"You're ruling out any kind of subsidy for middle and low income earners, any effort towards rehabbing existing housing, building public housing, supporting land trusts, etc."
p32927
aS"I'm sure the developers appreciate your perspective."
p32928
aS"Remind me, who's funding SFBARF?"
p32929
aS'?'
aS'Not all housing would be luxury housing if you built 100,000 units.'
p32930
aS"Not ruling out any kind of subsidy (though I'd think we'd like to encourage a situation where that isn't necessary, but again, not opposed to it)."
p32931
aS"You're assuming SFBARF, SPUR and other organizations that encourage growth aren't taking these factors into account."
p32932
aS'They are.'
p32933
aS'Stop demonizing developers.'
p32934
aS"Yes, they do shitty things, but they're only doing it because of an environment you've encouraged and an apparent nostalgia-preserving regulatory structure you've codified into law. "
