aS"I'm a registered republican, but Romney not telling us what he's actually trying to do is pissing me off. "
p142
aS"Why cut taxes if you're going to close loopholes?"
p143
aS'I think the goal is to give the middle class more money and making the upper class pay more.'
p144

p154
aS'"'
aS'That is a fact.'
p155
aS"Mitt Romney had no income, so he paid no income tax, but Rmoney did have buttloads of capital gains, which isn't taxed as income, but as carried interest."
p156
aS'In other words, Romney sits on ass, gets paid millions, and pays less than 15% while Average Joe works overtime, gets paid peanuts, and then has to pay on average a 25% income tax.'

aS'When the poor take money from the rich it is class warfare, but when the rich take money from the poor, its just business.'

p159
aS'So he is part of the 47% that "doesn\'t pay taxes"'
p160
aS'he pays taxes.'
p161
aS'Just at a lower rate.'
p162
aS'I think the 47% statistic is strictly about federal income tax, not any kind of effective tax rate.'
p163
aS'Pretty much the "third" kind of lie.'
p164
aS"He doesn't pay income taxes, which is what 47% of Americans also don't do, but for very different reasons."
p165
aS'He pays carried interest taxes, which are significantly lower than income taxes. '
p166
aS"Not at a lower rate, unless the first man doesn't take personal deductions and make over ~$50,000/year."
p167
aS'The effective tax rate on the first $10k you make is 0%.'
p168
aS'The next $10k is about 10%.'
p169
aS'The next $35k is 15%.'
p170
aS"It's only when you surpass median income that your marginal rate goes over 15%."
p171
aS'But Mitt already got taxed on the money he invested, when he earned it though income.'
p172
aS'Just his initial investment.'
p173
aS'No one is saying he should pay double taxes on that initial investment, just pay equal taxes on the money he made from his investment.'
p174
aS'Lower tax rate on capital gains is a big factor on whether or not to make the investment.'
p175
aS'If we dis-incentivize people putting money into businesses it will go elsewhere, and that may not be a good thing. '
p176
aS"Honestly, I'm inclined to think that's bull-shit."
p177
aS"The incentive to invest already exists, it's the profit made."
p178
aS'Why do you need more incentive?'
p179
aS"It's The Cobra Effect."
p180
aS'Also, where is the "elsewhere" you speak of?'
p181
aS'Overseas funds for one, other investments.'
p182
aS'For example, if you can invest in a muni bond that pays 5% with no taxes, or you can invest in a corporate bond that pays 7.5% interest but costs you 40% in tax, you invest in the muni bond.'
p183
aS'5% vs (7.5%*60%) = 4.5%.'
p184
aS'Taxes clearly influence decision making.'
p185
aS'Please ignore the rates and tax implications in the example but the point remains.'
p186
aS"I'm not talking about retail investors, I'm talking about huge funds who manage billions of dollars."
p187
aS'To this investor a 1% tax rate is significant.'
p188
aS'Tax implications are direct inputs to the decision making process. '
p189
aS'If you over-incentivise something that has a built in incentive, it leads to abuse.'
p190
aS'Capital gains taxes have been higher in the past, and the economy did just fine.'
p191
aS'Certainly there is a limit, but a gradual, well defined plan to raise taxes would unlikely hurt America in the long run.'
p192
aS'A great book, The Birth of Plenty, goes into this in more depth.'
p193
aS'Basically, you can go up to taxes being 50% of GDP and really not see any drop off in growth (other factors are more important).'
p194
aS'Conversely, Its not as if raising taxes will really solve any problems in the very long.'
p195
aS"Basically doesn't really matter if taxes are anywhere from 10-50% of GDP...in the very long run."
p196
aS'I don\'t think raising cap gains taxes solves very much, but am in favor of just for a sense of "fairness". '

aS'&gt;I don\'t think raising cap gains taxes solves very much, but am in favor of just for a sense of "fairness".'
p198
aS"It helps to close the government budget gap and the wealth gap at the same time, but it doesn't really solve the wealth gap problem."
p199
aS'The widening wealth gap is a *structural* economic problem that can only be solved by completely rethinking private property and its accumulation.'
p200
aS'Anything less than that is just status quo plus a constant stream of quick-fix band aids.'
p201
aS'yeah, when i said it doesn\'t help much, i was referencing the fact that the "Buffett Rule" (essentially raising Cap gains taxes) wuold only plug something like .24% of the budget (i forget the exact #, but something like that).'
p202
aS'I completely agree with you on wealth gap being a structural problem, not solvable in any tax system remotely resembling todays US tax system.'

aS'Globalization has seen much of the rest of the world start catching up to US income levels, and companies are now global.'
p204
aS'The leaders of those companies, many of which are in the US, have reaped huge rewards b/c of the vast new markets for their companies.'
p205
aS'However, the same menial laborers whose jobs have been lost to globalization have gone no where.'
p206
aS'Its almost as if Menial laborers have now a few billion more people to compete with (and wage competition/living standard abroad mean their former payscales will never come back for high school grads, etc).'
p207
aS'Meanwhile the CEOs etc may have slightly more competition, but certainly the rewards have drastically increased.'
p208

p209
aS'Globalization is irrelevant.'
p210
aS"The wealth gap was huge in 1920's too, well before the globalization movement."
p211
aS'The point is, widening wealth gap is a naturally occurring, predictable phenomenon in a capitalist economy.'
p212

p216
aS'In general would you agree with the following simplistic narrative (critiques welcome, again, i\'m no expert on this):   During the robber Baron era, taxes were low, so the natural "evening out" of wealth that progressive income taxes bring about, was not in existence.'
p217
aS"After 1930 as income taxes became more progressive, income gaps came down...as globalization started (70's/80's), the same progressive income tax was not enough to counter the growing in balances."

aS'hence wealth gap has widened since early 80s\n\nI think taxation is an important policy lever that can certainly level the playing field if the level of taxation is high enough and progressive enough.'
p237
aS'However, that leveling happens against the natural grain of the capitalist forces which always seek ways around such leveling.'
p238
aS'Capitalists adore income inequality and while people like Adam Smith used to know that too much is too much, there is no such concept as "too much" in modern capitalism which has become completely divorced from ethics.'
p239
aS'"Too much" is an ethical concern, and in modern government and elite thinking ethical concerns have no place in the market.'
p240
aS'The point I was trying to make is that unless we understand what capitalism is and how it works, how the game works, we will always be playing catch up with it.'
p241
aS'Fiddling with taxes to level the income gap is at best playing this game of catch up.'

aS"If you look at the entire economic history from 1800-present day, the US has grown at about 2% per year...even during the depression their was a dip, but we caught back up to the trendline by the 60's (like the depression never happened)."

aS"There's benefit in people buying newly-issued stock, because those funds go into capital investment, but stock *trading* does nothing directly for the GDP, and has a pretty shaky history in terms of equalizing and stabilizing prices (which is what arbitrage is supposed to do)."

p311
aS'All of the sudden, people wanted to be involved, and when their stock price goes up, their cost of capital goes down dramatically, thus allowing for future investment.\n'
p312
aS'Stock trading literally contributes nothing to GDP, or at least not directly.'
p313
aS"It's not a productive activity (in the sense of producing goods or services) and it's explicitly excluded from the calculation."

p323
aS'You may buy put options in the commodity, with the right to sell the commodity for $100 in 6 months that costs you $10.'

aS'They are job creators after all!'
p327
aS'says who?'
p328
aS"That money you hand over to the racetrack if you lose goes to pay people's salaries, upkeep on the property, business taxes, savings for future growth of the racetrack."
p329
aS'It goes to pretty much the same thing that an investment in that racetrack would go to, had it been traded on the market.'
p330
aS'The money that the race track makes off of bets that they win is not equivalent to money invested by shareholders--it is operating revenue instead.'
p331
aS'The excess of that revenue (over expenses) will likely be reinvested in the track, yes, but it is disingenuous to claim it as the same as purchasing stock in the company.'
p332
aS'An investment in the racetrack on the open market would have gone strictly to capital improvements, as no company that is going to be in business for long will issue stock to pay their workers/variable expenses.'
p333
aS'Yes, when you buy a stock in the secondary market, you are not investing capital to companies looking to expand their business.'
p334
aS'However, without these secondary markets, very few investors would take the risk on small startups, and they would never make it past the initial stages of growth.'
p335
aS'Even after your explanation, I feel like it was still a very valid analogy, and fairly close to the mark, if nowhere near directly equivalent (as most analogies are like to be)'
p336
aS"It's not a valid analogy."
p337
aS"If you buy 123 shares of XYZ, you're buying a small part of XYZ."
p338
aS'If XYZ is profitable, you make money, if XYZ is not profitable, you lose money.'
p339
aS"That happens to be the way it works most of the time, yes, but that's not even *really* the most important part of the analogy."
p340
aS'Most people who put money into stock could hardly care any less whether the company itself is successful or not -- it just happens to be the case that the success of the company is directly tied to a return on investment.'
p341
aS'If you remove the process of how the return is generated, the stock market is essentially the same as gambling.'
p342
aS'You put money in, and hope to get more money out.'
p343
aS"One might be a *smarter* play, but that doesn't really change anything."
p344
aS"Also, there's such a thing as selling short, and betting on failure in the first place, even in the stock market.\n\n"
p345
aS'Short selling is important to stabilizing the stock market, when stocks take a dump and start to plummet, the only people who are buying, are short sellers... take a look at how the financials traded after short selling was removed.'
p346
aS'Not even the slightest.'
p347
aS'There are magnitude differences in the amount of investment that comes from betting vs stocks.'
p348
aS'the 1k that you invest is 1k (give or take) that the company gets as capital.'
p349
aS'Something like 9.1% of bets are juice, then like a % of that is actual profit and a % of that is actually invested... i might be something like &lt;1 dollar from that 1k.'

aS"He can't just bet it and take it out, it has to sit for over 1 year."
p351
aS'Sure, but a guy like Romney is liquid enough to not need that cash for a year.'
p352
aS'No, stock market is the small part that is not gambling.'
p353
aS'When you invest in stock market, you are buying shares of companies that do make actual profit.'
p354
aS'Fair enough.'
p355
aS'What about trading on the Forex market?'
p356
aS'(you get to count 60% of the profit as capital gains)'
p357
aS"That's gambling, of course."
p358
aS'And then he gets more income through the investments.'
p359
aS'That income should also be taxed at normal income rates.'
p360
aS"Right now, it's taxed at substantially reduced rates."
p361
aS"It's not income if its made though investments.\n"
p362
aS"It's still income."
p363
aS"It's investment income."
p364
aS"I believe it shouldn't be taxed at a lower rate than non-investment income."
p365
aS'That is double taxation, and many people share your belief.'
p366
aS'This is why it is a current issue.'
p367
aS'There is no right side of the issue, it is just two different perspectives.'
p368
aS"Like estate tax, people that make money and die can't pass the home over to their children because the estate tax is too high of a burden to the child."
p369
aS'Many people are against that, however this is taxed at a high rate.'
p370
aS"It's no more double taxation than any other form of income is double taxation."
p371
aS'Every single bill gets taxed over and over again as it travels through the economy, and I don\'t see why a transaction of buying shares of company X from person A, then later selling them to person B, is any more "double taxation" than, say, charging taxes to purchase goods, on money that has already been taxed through income.'
p372
aS'If anything it seems *less* like double taxation.'
p373
aS'But taxing those capital gains and dividend payments as regular income will invariably discourage investors from investing in them.'
p374
aS'In an open economy, such as almost all economies today, investors will simply move their investments to countries with lower tax rates, which will damage the American economy in the long rum.'
p375
aS"No they don't."
p376
aS'They move it to where profits are highest. '
p377
aS'True, good point.'
p378
aS"Wouldn't another possibility be that there is a movement away from equity markets to bond markets, which are generally considered safer?"
p379
aS'Since the reward is now lower (due to higher taxes), risk would need to drop in a similar manner.'
p380
aS"This would decrease the amount of capital available to start-ups, which I don't see as a good thing."
p381
aS'Logged in to upvote this comment.'
p382
aS'All the hullabaloo about people moving overseas is overblown.'
p383
aS'The US economy is still the biggest and most productive economy, with the greatest profits.'
p384
aS'And people who can even consider investing in low tax markets overseas are already doing it while they are investing here.'
p385
aS'Fact is that our middle class drives enough profit that raising capital gains taxes would still generate beaucoup money for investors even if the tax rate is a bit higher.'
p386
aS'You could say this about every tax.'
p387
aS'The question is whether this specific form of profit deserves to be exempt or not.'
p388
aS'I see no reason why *this* form of profit is somehow more valuable than the other forms of profit.'
p389
aS"this is true, but can't be taken to an extreme."
p390
aS'If were true in all cases, then all money in the world would be in Singapore or some other low tax country.'
p391
aS'Other factors come into play.'
p392
aS'However i agree with the general idea of trying to keep taxes low.'
p393
aS'However I am against having a discrepancy between capital gains(especially in extreme scenarios...say over 1 Million a year) and income.'
p394
aS'In an ideal world, both income taxes and capital gains would move to a lower, but equal level.'
p395
aS"Having the discrepancy creates division in the country and while it won't really solve anything, i think the rates should be made equal just to remove the debate and create a sense of fair play/working together/everyone doing their part, etc"
p396
aS"No it doesn't."
p397
aS'The rich will always invest because investing is still better than doing nothing with your money.'
p398
aS"And if the rich are such crybabies that they take their money and leave I won't weep."
p399
aS'Let them go.'
p400
aS"We don't need such selfish fatcats calling the shots around here anyway."
p401

aS'Then sell the company in a year for $250,000.'

p408
aS"Let's say he invests that in a company (hell, my company) and that share of stock is worth $250,000 in a year."
p409

p410
aS'" - well, so was I).'
p411
aS'Does Romney get taxed on the $250,000 as regular income if he decided to sell his stocks?'
p412
aS"(I honestly don't know - if he does than my entire post is bunk and I stand corrected."
p413
aS'But if he could invest $50,000, have it increase to $250,000 and only pay taxes on that increase then there is, in my opinion, a very unfair problem with that).'

p427
aS"No he didn't, not as income, at any rate."
p428
aS'"Carried interest" is not actually interest on actual capital he earned and subsequently put at risk.'

p446
aS'Capital is very liquid, mobile, and fungible.'
p447
aS"If you tax it at a high rate, no one invests because they can just move their capital to somewhere that doesn't tax it as highly."
p448
aS'This is partially why, when we lowered the capital gains tax a few years back, tax revenue actually went *up*--because so much more money was invested that the lower rates were offset by a broader taxable base.'

p458
aS"But at the same time, for someone who is at the top of that system and making bank like that, has no right telling me, or the rest of America how they don't need all the programs that help keep them above poverty."

aS"Your liberal supreme court that upheld Obamacare also said the corporate fat cats were acting legally as SuperPAC's."
p468
aS'yeah both sides are to blame'
p469
aS'Nope, because our tax code isn\'t "oh you\'re rich?'
p470
aS'TAX!'
p471
aS'" Rather, our tax code doesn\'t even consider human beings or total income; it simply treats every dollar the same.'
p472
aS'source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_schedule_(federal_income_tax)\n\nSo your first $8,500 is taxed at 10%.'
p473
aS'Then if you make more than $8,500, your income between $8,500 and $34,500 is taxed at 15%.'
p474
aS'If you make more than $34,500, then your income between $34,500 and $83,600 is taxed at 25%.'
p475
aS'So each person is actually taxed at multiple different rates.'
p476
aS'The rich are taxed on their first $83,600 dollars at the same rates that a person who only makes $83,600 is taxed at.'
p477
aS"It's just that the rich generally have more income than $83,600, and so they continue to have additional income taxed at additional rates."
p478
aS"But they're still getting taxed at the same rates as everybody else for the same amount of money."

p494
aS'I was just demonstrating why a progressive income tax is in no way class warfare.'
p495
aS"But yes, you're right."

p497
aS'No.... every single person pays the exact same tax rate for the exact same amount of money.'

aS'The fundamental problem I find with his policy is that [according to Libertarian Philosophy](http://www.lp.org/platform), he empowers the very corporations he does not believe in dictating policy; lack of a federal government leaves too many opportunities for abuse of power by businesses.'

aS"If Paul's outside of that sphere of thinking, that's fine, but I haven't seen things to indicate that."

aS'Link me if you have something to the contrary?'
p1317
aS"Free markets regulate themselves,  if the federal government didn't have power to lend out so corporations and lobbyist couldn't buy it and use it to there advantage by writing policies to kill there competitors there would be more strict regulations on corporations,  Ron Paul is against corporation welfare and he has said he would gladly have regulations to monitor and keep track of fraud and those sorts of things as long as they didn't affect the markets."
p1318
aS"So just because us libertarians say we want less regulations or no regulations,  that just means we don't want the government and corporations regulating themselves,  we want a fair system that everyone plays by the same rules,  the constitution and the agreement contracts."
p1319
aS"Explain the theory of more strict regulation on corporations with no one there to enforce those laws?I'm not saying our system is perfect, but if you remove the feds, who enforces this?You can go with the theory that people won't buy from a dishonest corporation, but how many people as we type are buying gas from BP, or shopping at Walmart?How many are even aware of their corrupt practices based on a healthy dose of propaganda and suppression?"
p1320
aS'BP gets billions in uncontested, unconstitutional subsidies.'

p1322
aS"That's why trains and other forms of public transportation are more prevalent over there."
p1323
aS"What's wrong with Walmart?"
p1324
aS"Right, but lifting regulation is only going to help them hide-if they're getting Billions, and they haven't created jobs or cleaned up their act on their own, how is taking away any sort of check on their power going to help?"
p1325
aS'Walmart actually runs the same game you just mentioned-that is, getting uncontested subsidies for setting up their business-except they engage in it on a local level.'
p1326
aS"If you don't agree with subsidizing business, you probably won't like their behavior once you look below the surface..."
p1327
aS'Walmart is basically an importer of Chinese goods.'
p1328
aS'Chinese labor is often exploitative.'
p1329
aS"The average American doesn't care about this, but they should."
p1330
aS"I'm not saying get rid of the government,  i'm saying if the law was the constitution and the agreement contract of corporations then it would be more strict,  for example,  if a corporation polluted someones land they could get sued and lose there business,  instead they get fined by the government who let them rent federal land to pollute on and actually make a profit,  instead of all these incompetent corporations getting bailed out and tax breaks,  they wouldn't receive them,  the only way they could out beat the competition is by having a better product,  the lying cheating stealing that corporations do is going to happen whether there is regulations there to try and prevent it or not,  and we have no problem with punishing those who do those things,  it's not like corporations can run around and abuse people and commit fraud freely with less regulation."
p1331
aS"So, instead of having corporations buying out government and having a federal protections, we'd have people buying out judges directly and we'd be empowering corporations to hire it by having less oversight, which they're already doing.....I don't see how this is helping. "

aS"Since neither of these actually exist in reality, neither will a 'free market' regulate itself."
p1348
aS'The free market in your fantasy libertarian world would instantly become a market of either monopoly corporations, or the iron law of profits would take over, as profit margins drop to zero because of competition, and all long-term detriments go unchecked (see the tragedy of the commons).'
p1349
aS'Sorry to burst your libertarian bubble.'
p1350
aS"It's kind of funny that you say for a free market to work you need honest people to make it work and since that is impossible a free market is impossible,  yet Keynesian economist like to say they use empirical studies and know economics,  but they miss the same point you just made,  you cannot predict what humans needs and desires are,  that is why economics is a soft science,  and truly the scientific method cannot be used to prove a theory until you can predict human behavior."
p1351
aS'You simply cannot regulate a market,  no one is smart enough to play god with the economy,  and free markets are all for punishing those who abuse the market like lying cheating stealing fraud etc.'

p1353
aS'You can absolutely predict human needs.'
p1354

p1366
aS'Libertarians pretend that all social relations are equal to all business relations, and all business relations are equal.'
p1367
aS'But they are not.'
p1368
aS"We allow limited liability corporations to count as a person, but only with understanding that they do for the public good, and that last part isn't really defined our enforced."
p1369
aS'Consequently they get protections and no obligations, and without public regulation, they would not function as anything but a more powerful de facto government than the one we grant the enforcement of a vote with recourse to courts. '

p1374
aS'Part of the problem is referring to regulations in terms of quantity instead of quality.'
p1375
aS'When someone a little less knowledgeable talks about "more regulation" they don\'t necessarily mean more unnecessary regulation on smaller businesses that provide a barrier to entry, merely that safeguards should be in place so that the market is less likely to cause tremendously hazardous effects.'

p1383
aS'The government would still enforce what ever laws it passes, of course.'
p1384
aS"Right, but it sounds like he's depending on local level governments to defend their rights against multinational corporations; IMHO, while you may get a quicker reaction time out of that, it still sounds imbalanced."
p1385
aS"I'm also concerned about him wanting to revoke Dodd-Frank-it sounds like he's just giving power to the banks to repeat the process."
p1386
aS"I'm not trying to change the subject o nyou, but I think it does speak to his desire to give more power to the very corporations he says he abhors for their practices; it just removes any checks anyone could make on them. "

aS'Despite their buzz word talking point mantra bullshit about "creating jobs!'

p1493
aS'This is my personal beef with the issue-when this conversation comes up, the defense that\'s always put forth is "Well, the Dems are doing it too".'
p1494
aS'Meanwhile, this is coming from the same party that speaks of personal accountability as a solution for most problems-why aren\'t they exemplifying that?They certainly love to state that as a solution for the poor that are dealing with trying to eke out an existence with no medical care, jobs that are being traded to line the pockets of a few who don\'t care about using that power to better the system, and a college system that the GOP hasn\'t given a shit about in years while speaking of "hard work" this and "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps" that.'
p1495
aS"I can name three issues I have with democrats on the issues, but at least they're not trying to take my rights or my opportunities to self-actualize based on who I am, and if that's the choice other than a person who wants to take off all of the regulatory bodies to supposedly fix things and a party that doesn't consider me human by long standing mantra, I'm voting for Obama, thank you."
p1496
aS'\\Additional note-I also tend to hear corny defenses of the GOP, that speaks of a glorious past in which "Martin Luther King was a republican!'
p1497
aS'", and "The republicans fought against prejudice!'
p1498
aS'"-that\'s cute and all, but when there\'s been several cases that have shown that they don\'t hold any values of equality for citizens of the US(including Nixon\'s Southern Strategy, Trent Lott\'s statements on Strom Thurmond, Strom Thurmond\'s illegitimate black daughter(funny, no one ever critiqued or stereotyped white people for abandoning their children over that one...?'

aS'So although it uses facts and makes valid points in a concise way, having a humorous tone disqualifies it?'
p2132
aS'You\'re right that this sort of thing is likely counterproductive to wining the hearts and minds, and also borderline bigoted against the "rednecks" it targets.'

aS'I just add the extra dimension of the complexity of the issues themselves.'
p2266

p2270
aS'What also should be acknowledged is the extent to which irrational biases also impact issues like economics.'
p2271
aS'Many people react to the complexity of such issues by relying of snap judgements and gut instinct (i.e.'
p2272
aS'irrational subconscious biases) rather than applying much thought to the matter.'
p2273
aS'Precsiely because in depth thought takes time and effort to formulate.'

p2278
aS'It is true politics played a much greater role in day-to-day life, in particular during the mid-to-late 19th century, but this was often a more single issue thing, and varied.'
p2279
aS'In a territory, *of course* politics was of import, but the politics of import were questions of whether you wanted to become a state or split into multiples (The Dakota Territory &amp; mountainous west deliberately split up into more territories/states to give greater Republican representation in Congress and the electoral college) or become independent.'

aS'When parties were less uniform, it became necessary to educate yourself who advocated what if you wanted to see your politics in government.'
p2283
aS'A Democrat in Georgia was radically different from a Democrat in New York, and a Republican from Pennsylvania was different from a Republican in California.'

p2589

p2591
aS'There were scare stories that it would lead to a continual hung parliament, and so on.'
p2592
aS'The flip side is that the "yes" campaign was run in a hopelessly incompetently way.'
p2593
aS'While the "no" campaign drew together politicians from across the spectrum to tell a consistent message, the "yes" campaign was only really liberals and leftists.'
p2594

aS'Basically the people running the campaign ran a campaign that appealed to their own small section of society, and nobody else.'

aS"I think it's become really obvious over the pay decade or so that neither the two big parties nor the media wants a strong third party."
p2604
aS"Their current scheme is to enact laws whereby only the two highest vote-getting party's candidates in the *primary* elections are permitted to stand in the *general* election."
p2605
aS'Therefore, the general election is almost 100% likely to be a contest between the most popular Republican party candidate and the most popular Democratic party candidate, *with all other candidates excluded by law.'
p2606
aS'*\n\nAfter the success of the Perot and Nader campaigns, the two parties seized control of the presidential debates from the League of Women Voters and changed the rules to exclude third-party candidates from participating.'

aS'If you watched the third party debates last year, you would have seen many people advocating for voting-reform from all sides of the "aisle".'

aS"I'd like to see a genuinely successful implementation of democracy, where all citizens' needs are represented by the state, and the rule of the majority ends up always working out in the long run."

p2690
aS'We\'d also have to figure out some way to police non- monetary "gifts" as is common between lobbyists and politicians.'

aS'Also in regards to the whiny bs I hear non-stop about making people pay their fair share.'
p2712
aS'The problem is not the tax system is unfair.'
p2713

aS'Duh.'
p2727
aS'No, government is a proven system, there are plenty of examples of people who lived as anarchists, the only problem is that they were all killed by others who were better organized (via governments).'

aS'What is proven about it?'
p2730
aS'I keep hearing people assume I said something about anarchy just because I pointed out that government is flawed.'

aS'an 80K max total pension per year no matter what was agreed to) or changing future agreements, or increase revenue.'
p2934
aS"I'm not interested in which solution is chosen and after crunching the numbers there is really only a couple that will actually work instead of kicking the can down the road."
p2935
aS"In that example, I don't really care which one you chose (within reason--there is obviously abuse in the pension system and if you gamed the system and have 3 pensions cutting you a large monthly check, I'm good with reneging on the deal...I'm also good with increasing taxes on the wealthy, property taxes, whatever, just fix it)."
p2936
aS"Until we're willing to make hard decisions (e.g."
p2937
aS"compensate doctors less, not spend &gt; 50% of medicare on a patient's last 6 months of life, provide free preventative care for everyone) a reasonable fix to the US health care system isn't going to happen."
p2938
aS"In some ways Obamacare is worse than having done nothing--many people now think the health care problem is 'solved' and thus the issue can be safely ignore for a few years."
p2939
aS"Those who don't are either still against it or in a smaller minority."
p2940
aS'If Obamacare had not had happened there would still be fight in people.'
p2941
aS'As for scale, I certainly understand the difference between 20K and 20.'
p2942
aS'Do you?'
p2943
aS"Obamacare provides, if you're willing to spend up to 10% of your income on premiums alone, a health plan.....which still requires all the copays, deductible meetings, etc....all of which rack up really quickly with any kind of a health problem."
p2944
aS'So what has really been fixed other than the Republicans are tickled that they think the issue is now closed and done and that they paid almost nothing for it?'
p2945
aS"I can't say that voting for a 3rd party will end up fixing more problems with this, but I'm completely appalled with the lack of progress towards fixing problems over the last 25-30 years I've been watching politics in this country."
p2946
aS"Last thing I'll comment on--agreed, Obama isn't an 'unlimited dictator,' however, I didn't vote for any of the guys/gals in congress either....and who do you think we should hold accountable for our governments' public policy?"
p2947
aS'Certainly one of those branches or the other.'
p2948
aS'&gt;no one wants to do it this way\n\nNo.'
p2949
aS"*Republicans* don't want to do it this way."
p2950
aS'This attitude is quite possibly the biggest single problem in American politics today, right up there with corporate influence.'
p2951
aS'People who talk like you, especially those in the media, who are so committed to appearing above petty partisan politics that they cannot ever admit that one party is worse than the other, are exactly what lets the Republicans get away with all the shit they pull: the bullshit, the unreasonable demands, the lies, the unwillingness to compromise, the demanding benefit cuts as part of a deal then turning around and blaming Democrats for cutting benefits, all of that is only possible because they know nobody will call them out on it.'
p2952
aS"Because that's the thing: by refusing to distinguish between the two sides, you remove any incentive not to be the worse of the two."
p2953
aS'And yes, Obamacare is nowhere near as good as it should be, but it still makes a lot of people a lot better off.'
p2954
aS'You say it distracts from establishing a better system, but what better system is remotely possible, politically?'
p2955
aS"There's only so much that can be done when Republicans are willing to vehemently oppose the same solutions they were proposing last year."
p2956
aS"And finally:\n\n&gt;who do you think we should hold accountable for our governments' public policy?"
p2957
aS'Certainly one of those branches or the other.'
p2958
aS"Is there a reason we can't say both?"
p2959
aS"Failing that I'd go with whoever's worst."
p2960
aS"Maybe that's the problem--maybe the problem is all the Republicans."
p2961
aS'Your argument would be far more persuasive if, about the things the president has nearly 100% control (see half the items on this list), he acted less like a Republican, I could even see the problem was clearly the Republicans.'
p2962
aS"However, his policies (note, again, I don't mean laws....I mean things solely decided by the commander in chief of the military), you could convince me."
p2963
aS"Until then, however, I'm stuck where I think things are--the democratic party is just a slightly better Republican party, their platforms are nearly identical, and to vote for one or the other is throwing away my vote anyway, so why not at least vote for a political party that closely represents my views?"
p2964
aS'Yes.'
p2965
aS'You might get four years of someone just barely slightly worse if you voted that way.'
p2966
aS'But if you vote for the lesser of two evils, then we end up in this situation where both of the candidates suck, and we\'re stuck there for decades at a time thanks to "logic" like yours.'
p2967
aS'Plus, to quote someone else:\n\n&gt;Besides, if you\'re going to apply game theory to the situation in a shortsighted local fashion - not taking into account others thinking similarly, and not taking into account the incentives you create for later elections based on what potential future candidates see you doing today - if, I say, you think in such a strictly local fashion and call it "rational", then why vote at all, when your single vote is exceedingly unlikely to determine the winner?\n'
p2968
aS'The quote misrepresents me.'
p2969
aS"I made it clear that I'm aware of the benefits of voting for a third party candidate."
p2970

p2971
aS'(If you live in California, go ahead and vote for whoever you like best).'
p2972
aS"I think the larger problem is that our population doesn't know how to vote properly."
p2973
aS'That is, the perfect candidate (the one who the most people would vote for) would be pretty bad.'
p2974
aS"Third party candidates lose partly because they aren't treated as legitimate candidates, but mostly because people just don't agree with them, however unfortunate that may be."
p2975
aS"&gt; I just don't think it's worth it yet\n\nAnd what would make it worth it?"
p2976
aS'If everyone else voted third party first and then you jumped on the bandwagon?'
p2977
aS"Before I respond, I want to say that I think it's hilarious how reactionary this subreddit is."
p2978
aS"I'm presenting a contrary opinion (about a specific detail no less) and I'm being downvoted and am met with Ad Hominem attacks."
p2979
aS'Anyway, it will be worth it for swing state voters to vote for third parties when third parties begin to have considerable presences in other states.'

p3327
aS"That is not just a superficial difference, it's fundamentally different. "
p3328
aS'If that were true, then the term "[representative democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy)" would be an oxymoron, yet there it is.'
p3329
aS'One is a system where representives are either elected, purchased or given royal appointment to represent a portion of freemen in the decision of matters of state.'
p3330
aS'The other is a system where every freeman is given a vote on every decision in matters of state.'
p3331
aS'Simply because a republic holds votes, does not mean it is democratic, it simply means it is being a re*present*public.'

p3336
aS'The common meaning only exists to give republicanism an air of authority in legislature.'
p3337
aS'Trumpeting an innate function of a republic as being democratic is an attempt to sustain the system, and to convince citizens that elected representatives hold their interests at heart.'

aS'Words and ideas have all sorts of interesting origins, but it is not only pedantic, it is harmful to insist upon thinking in those terms.'

aS'If you insist upon using his ideas, you are going to come to a lot of silly conclusions about the world.'

aS'Republics are democracies?'
p3350
aS'Democracy stems from the words "demos" (common people) and "kratic" (rule/power).'
p3351
aS'This was at a time of kings, queens and emperors.'
p3352
aS'Even by electing a representative that acts on your behalf makes you a democracy, as your elected representative is, by it\'s original meaning, a "common person".'
p3353
aS'You could argue that all the elected representatives in the US are rich as fuck, and therefore not common at all.'
p3354
aS"However there's nothing actually stopping common people from running or being elected, it's just Americans *vote* for the ruling class every time instead of the common people."

aS"Literally the first section:\n\n&gt; Switzerland's voting system is unique among modern democratic nations in that Switzerland practices direct democracy (also called half-direct democracy)\n\nWhy is it half?"
p3373
aS'Because direct democracy is rule directly by people of the state, however in Switzerland the average citizen cannot propose a law, merely challenge one that has been passed through the legislature.'
p3374
aS'Plus it *has* a legislature where representatives are elected to, so therefore is not "direct" in that regard.'
p3375
aS"Meaning of democracy has changed, from the older technical term (relegated to using the qualifier 'direct democracy') to the more commonly used meaning, what fokoffmate meant in the first place."
p3376
aS'Whether a "federal constitutional republic" or a "unitary constitutional monarchy," the umbrella term is now \'democracy\'.'

aS'Other than that yeah just about spot on.'
p3518
aS'But there is a huge difference between deliberately targeting an American citizen and an American citizen who was traveling with known terrorists being killed in an Air Strike.'
p3519
aS'For you to believe that they targeted Abdulrahman you have to believe that they would waste a few hundred thousand dollars targeting a 16 year old with no skills or importance rather than the operational leader of Al Qaida who he was traveling near.'

aS'Guilt by association is an extremely poor justification for the execution of an American citizen, and a logical fallacy to boot.'
p3555
aS'American citizens abroad are still American citizens no matter who they are travelling with.'
p3556
aS'To say that the state is justified in executing a citizen because of who they were travelling with at the time sets a very dangerous and frankly undemocratic legal precedent.'
p3557
aS'The fact that the Obama DOJ has basically claimed that it cannot be held culpable for the death of an American citizen that it had executed without due process puts the Executive Branch of the United States Government on moral ground roughly the same as that of al-qaeda, at least as far as this issue is concerned.'

p3584
aS'The kid died as the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n'
p3585
aS'The fact of the matter is that whether or not the US military "deliberately attempted to kill him" ought to be a matter for a court to hear evidence about and decide upon.'
p3586
aS"That's one of the benefits of being an American citizen, you have redress through the courts when your government tries to kill you (whether or not it meant to)."
p3587
aS'Your line of argument serves to erode the rights of American citizens, and democracy itself.'
p3588
aS"Which is much more bullshit than anything I've said."
p3589
aS'Your analogy and analysis are straight-up wrong.'
p3590
aS'If the police kill a child in a shootout, the individual officer may not be criminally liable, but the police department is open to being prosecuted both in both civil and criminal proceedings.'
p3591
aS'Just as the Executive ought to be open to court challenges when it decides to kill Americans without due process.\n'
p3592
aS'No you do not have a right as an American citizen to not be killed in attacks in a war zone.'

aS"If you're standing in the blast radius of a known military target you are putting yourself at risk."
p3594
aS"The Government doesn't have a responsibility to avoid killing Americans who have placed themselves in close proximity to leaders of terrorist organizations."
p3595
aS'There is no erosion of Democracy here, there has never been a time in our countries history where the Government would avoid attacking a military target because their might be an American citizen there.'
p3596
aS"You can't even prove they knew he was there in the first place."
p3597
aS"But somehow you're convinced the US Government deliberately targeted a 16 year old kid who was no more dangerous than any other unskilled and uneducated member of Al Qaida. \n\n"

p3746
aS'If everyone were paying for government, everyone would be interested in having services that benefit society.'

p3758
aS"Progressive taxation doesn't make for a more equal society, the more equal societies don't actually have as progressive of taxation as the US does (except Japan which is a very recent development)."
p3759
aS"Simply put, if you want everyone to value government AND have a disciplined view of what it should or shouldn't do...you should make everyone pay for it as equally as possible."
p3760
aS'So the federal government is a terribly inefficient system that should just get out of the way and let the private sector work its magic, but it also is so perfect that it should be immune from scrutiny and we should just trust that it wont abuse its power to make decisions about who lives and dies, who goes to jail indefinitely without so much as a charge, who gets tortured and who gets spied on, in complete secret?'
p3761
aS'Got it.'
p3762

aS'I\'m not sure what you were implying with your creepy "cupcake" remark.'
p3770
aS"I'm saying that decades of restatement of Civil Rights laws have created the organizational strength necessary to enforce federal law over state law, even when those laws have nothing to do with Civil Rights law."

p3774
aS"&gt; No, I'm not against civil rights, but thanks for impugning."
p3775

aS"Who's the cupcake?"
p3785
aS'Why are you condescending to this person?'

aS'On purpose.'
p3788
aS"This whole time, when those of us on the Right have been warning you guys about States' Rights being eroded...and suddenly NOW, when you want a joint, you're concerned....\n\nWe weren't rabbling about States' Rights because of some racist banter, but because of a belief that people in states should have a hell of a lot of leeway in deciding how their state and local governments are organized."

p3796
aS'Just libertarians and a few more liberal Republicans.'
p3797
aS"&gt; Blacks can't come to southern colleges, go to your own = state's right to force separation between races\n\nExcept that wasn't actually a state right...not since the adoption of the 14th Amendment and its restatement in *Brown v. Board*."
p3798
aS"&gt; Except that wasn't actually a state right\n\nI know that, but it was claimed to be."
p3799
aS"So therefore ALL claims of states' rights are erroneous because one of them turned out to be?"
p3800
aS'This logical fallacy thing, do you understand how it works?'
p3801
aS"It doesn't mean someone is wrong for using an argument that is a fallacy (fallacy of fallacies)."
p3802

p3809
aS'Has EVERYTHING to do with Commerce Clause.'
p3810
aS'Stop trying to scapegoat civil rights. '
p3811
aS'Has everything to do with an expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, and that the apparatus to enforce such laws against the will of the states was IN FACT built up in part to enforce Civil Rights laws.'
p3812
aS'Once the FBI and several other law enforcement agencies got their funding, it was impossible to take it away.'
p3813
aS'Nonsense.'
p3814
aS'Commerce Clause interpretation became expansive half a century before the civil rights movement. '

aS"Basically this ideal you imagine doesn't exist."
p5011
aS'It could be created if competition was *mandated* into law.'

p5013
aS"It's sporadic."
p5014
aS'Sometimes businesses compete.'
p5015

aS'Brutal is when you are orphaned at birth, then you huff glue on the streets, get raped every day, and die at age 10.'

p5045
aS'Thanks for the replies.'
p5046
aS'They colluded not to poach top employees from each other.'
p5047
aS'This suppresses the upper wage this talent should generate.'
p5048
aS"Just because the wage isn't low doesn't mean it's not suppressed."

aS'Your stat is useless.'
p5056
aS"It doesn't matter if they made 100k or 150 million, the fact is that the demand for their labor would have driven that wage higher if the big tech companies weren't colluding. "

aS"Sometimes they're posting it like that so they can convince their internal hr that they should go through the trouble of sponsoring someone."
p5087
aS'Sometimes it is a manager that blew the budget early on in a project or had something go really wrong and now he has to try to find extra help without enough money to actually get it.'
p5088
aS"It all depends, but there's usually a story that I can suss out from a ten minute conversation with the manager on a certain job when their price is ridiculously low."
p5089
aS"Sometimes I can convince them that they know they're not near the market rate and get them to be reasonable."
p5090
aS"Sometimes it really is just the best they can do and they're hoping to get someone."
p5091
aS'I can say, with unemployment so low right now, gone are the days when they can open a req and get a bunch of resumes to leisurely look over and get back to you when they want.'

p5094
aS"If you're an early adopter of the angular.js framework, you can get a great rate, anywhere from $70 per hour all the way up to $90-100 depending on the location and client."
p5095
aS"The 90-100 range I don't see often, but it happens and I know people are out there getting those jobs."
p5096
aS"If you're more vanilla flavors of java I see it anywhere from 60-80ish or even more depending on where you live."
p5097
aS'It all depends.'

aS'They might be able to get you a little more or a little less at each job, but you get the drift.'
p5102
aS'The best recruiting firms try to make everyone come away from the deal happy including the contractor, the client, and themselves.'
p5103
aS"It's always great when a client calls back and asks if a certain engineer is free and can we arrange for them to come back for a while."
p5104

p5105
aS'For the 70-90 rate, are you talking a consultant or an employee rate?'

aS"It's pretty good coverage."
p5113

aS'Plus, as you know there are a lot of different kinds of java coders. '
p5115
aS'Thats half of it right there.'
p5116
aS'I think the difference in cost is half taxes,  which would be in the W2 and half health care.'
p5117
aS"I've seen the multiplier for the charge rate to be between 2-3x the wage."

aS'Well, the taxes on your w-2 would be in line with what you paid on a w-2 as a fte.'

p5224
aS"That the bulk of active Libertarians in America are deluded half-anarchists and sometimes it's not about disagreeing because you're different it's about disagreeing because your ethics have been historically dismembered. "

aS'Think about the framework set forth by the Constitution compared to the overwhelming and voluminous amount of laws and regulations we have today.'
p5236
aS'The proper role of government includes national defense, a civillian police force and courts, all for the purpose of maintaining maximum personal freedom.'
p5237
aS'This means establishing rights codified as law and taking appropriate action to defend those rights when necessary.'

aS'Progressives seem to prefer getting their people into positions of power where they can dictate their preferred terms to everyone.'
p5284
aS'So strawmen are okay when Libertarians use them? '
p5285
aS"To be fair, that's what government does; dictates terms to the people (through laws backed by threat of force)."
p5286
aS'And you must admit, Progressives would rather have their own people in power than, say, Conservatives.'
p5287
aS'This is mentioned by contrast with the Libertarian perspective that there is already too much government dictating to people and we need to scale that back sharply.'

aS'Why would an ethos that says you are beholden to nothing but what people are willing to pay you say that there have to be rules?'

aS'A core tenet of Libertarian thought is the "Non-Aggression Principle," which would assert that intentionally poisoning someone (or an entire population through toxic chemicals in a river) is an act of aggression and therefore immoral.'

p5298
aS'It is not a matter of "fuck you, got mine.'

aS'Competition among providers always benefits the consumer by allowing alternatives.'
p5305
aS'For a long time,  television companies fought cable and manipulated the FCC to prevent competition.'
p5306
aS'Then consumers got a choice.'
p5307
aS'Then cable companies fought satelite (and still do) but that too has become more common.'
p5308
aS'The result is now these companies are forced to appeal to consumers by offering improved service and lower prices, all thanks to competition among providers.'
p5309
aS'With government enforced monopoly, they could charge anything they want and provide shitty service because there would be no alternative.'
p5310
aS'This principle applies to every business; it only gets better when consumers have more freedom of choice and worse when there is no freedom to switch to another provider.'
p5311
aS'The idea that Libertarians are "beholden to nothing but what people are willing to pay" is nothing more than demonization intended to cast them as "greedy monsters," or simply ammoral.'

aS'Libertarians are people too, with compassion and a desire to help others succeed as much as they hope to succeed themselves, just like everyone else.'

p5325
aS'All of this is fully consistent with Libertarian ideals.'
p5326
aS'As for "school indoctrination," this is a more difficult argument to make.'
p5327
aS'But, again imho, the evidence is there.'
p5328
aS'The schools are run by the government and are heavily biased towards teaching that government is the only valid solition to a variety of social, moral and personal ills.'

p5331
aS'It is an appeal to incorporate alternative ideas with equal or superior validity into the curriculum.'
p5332
aS'It is also an appeal to allow and in fact promote more alternatives to state-run schools with the purpose of improving education through competition, allowing people more freedom of choice so that they can switch educational providers if they wish.'

aS'The government monopoly on education has degraded the quality of education overall and prevents necessary and proper improvement.'

p5337
aS'You always have to accept a lesser of two evils and more often than not the Libertarian Party offers up peacemeal solutions that improve "liberty" in one regard while committing an aggressive act towards others, i.e.'
p5338
aS"laws that cripple social safety nets without creating any transition to stabilize the lives and health of thousands before the free market does it's undeniable and completely sacred magic and fixes everything."
p5339
aS'There is a philosophical validity to Libertarianism, and the idea of preesrving freedom.'
p5340
aS"There is little to no validity in the established Libertarian Party, and I don't really have to prove that because even if I'm wrong they'll never win an election to prove me so."

aS'Would you support regulation to prevent oligarchy, like heavy restrictions on Lobbyists and Public Campaign funding?'
p5342
aS'The re-establishment of the estate tax Pre Bush Era?'
p5343
aS'The closing of a majority of tax loopholes that ensure that our GDP decays from within?'
p5344
aS'Because every \'Libertarian" solution I\'ve heard has a glaring issue that will likely make things worse, e.g.'
p5345
aS'kill school funding because if there is a demand for schools they will be built and everyone will have the chance to go to them which will prevent us from sinking back into an era where only wealthy white males were educated enough to become policy-makers...wait...'
p5346
aS'I just want to know why you think the Libertarian Party as it exists will ever be able to do any better given its constituents than any other political ideology that inherently creates a platform for the regulation of trade of goods and services?'
p5347
aS"Just like Socialism, there don't have to be issues with the ideology for there to be massive pitfalls in its implementation."
p5348
aS"If you're not a Libertarian Utopian, why bother aligning yourself with the actual Party as it is a failure?"
p5349

p5351
aS'Before I address this current missive, lets establish that you have no objection to the rest of my statement (outside of the one area quoted that I admit needs careful consideration)? '
p5352
aS"Please don't tell me you advocate charter schools."
p5353
aS'What do you see as the problem with charter schools that might make them an unworthy or unworkable alternative to government-run education?'
p5354
aS'Because in real world examples they are utter shit.'
p5355
aS'Thats why. '
p5356
aS'Actually, they tend to do very well.'
p5357
aS'Can you link me to some information to the contrary?'

p5363
aS'Those are good links, and I see why you might tend to draw your previously stated conclusion.'
p5364
aS'But, two things come to mind.'
p5365
aS'First, a charter school failure is good thing.'
p5366
aS'It means that customers tried that "brand" and found it didn\'t meet their needs so they switched.'
p5367
aS"That's a total free market win."
p5368
aS"I feel bad for the school and the teachers, but I wouldn't argue for keeping them open if they can't deliver a good product."
p5369
aS'Second, public schools can\'t "fail.'
p5370
aS'" No matter how bad they are at doing their job, the government keeps giving them tax money.'
p5371
aS'Recent proposals to give parents "vouchers" from tax money that they could use at private and charter schools were shot down (some states or counties do allow this but it is a very small amount).'
p5372
aS'To send your kid to a private or charter school you must be able to afford it in addition to paying taxes to fund public schools, rather than instead of paying for public schools.'
p5373
aS'So the government protects its monopoly on education even when competition would be better.'
p5374
aS'Its really sad that this ideology that "only government can do it right" over-rides what is actually good for kid\'s education. '
p5375
aS'That is a fair enough argument, my only concern regarding charter schools in on the provision that they may not be put to the same rigors as state schools.'
p5376
aS'I really hate doing this but and it is kind of lazy of me but have you heard of waiting for superman?'

p5403
aS'Regardless of this, you tell me that "anarchism" or any kind of alternative is utopian -- frankly, to think that the current system can function for much longer is *the* utopian position, not the alternatives that have been proposed.'
p5404
aS"I think the one argument point you'll get in response to your 'certitude' (I think you're pretty much dead on, personally) is that hypothetically, in a sufficiently advanced and educated society (built out of a heavily governed one mind you) individual citizens could be held responsible for their own actions by themselves."
p5405
aS'Libertarians seem to think that the human race is always on the verge of this kind of blissful society full of philosopher kings (obviously facetious, pretty much every Libertarian I\'ve met is a "Fuck You, Got Mine" type deep down and that\'s why they subscribe to the ethos) and that it\'s this horrible wall of regulation that\'s preventing us from being what we truly are.'
p5406
aS"In actuality, our manufactured 'rules' are the only thing keeping most people from allowing their animal nature to subsume them, and even so many arrive there through slow, steady habituation. "
p5407

p5409
aS'Assumes Libertarian ideals have no room for actual rule of law and that the law as we know it does not already function by holding individuals accountable or that this would evaporate if Libertarian ideals were implemented as law...\n\n&gt;Libertarians seem to think that the human race is always on the verge of this kind of blissful society full of philosopher kings \n\nAssumes Libertarian ideals need some utopia within which to become suddenly valid (also a Straw Man argument about Philosopher Kings, BTW)...\n\n&gt;(obviously facetious, pretty much every Libertarian I\'ve met is a "Fuck You, Got Mine" type deep down and that\'s why they subscribe to the ethos)\n\nAssumes Libertarian ideals have no room for charity and moral obligation to care for the less fortunate.'
p5410
aS'Also a gross demonization predicated on the mischaracterization of the ideal "What makes you think you have the right to take what is mine by force?'
p5411

p5414
aS'So many unproven, baseless and outright confabulated assertions without any resemblance to the truth,  lol.'
p5415
aS'Shall I go on?\n\n'
p5416
aS"The problem with attacking the way an argument is presented instead of the argument itself (which, by the way, is a form of the ad hominem) is that it leaves you open to this:\n\nJust because someone makes an assumption (implicit or explicit), it doesn't mean the assumption is wrong."
p5417
aS'I *assume* my bank has the cash on hand to honor a withdrawal.'
p5418
aS'I *assume* my drinking water is safe.'
p5419
aS'I *assume* if I called the police, they would come to my house.'
p5420
aS'Am I wrong for holding those assumptions?'
p5421
aS'Of course not.'
p5422
aS"While you're busy attacking the argument itself instead of the content, you've already lost the audience, made your own argument weaker and and did not advance the discussion."
p5423
aS'You could have avoided it by pointing out the assumption then commenting on *why* that assumption is wrong.'
p5424
aS'That latter bit is the important part.'
p5425
aS"But you didn't do that because many of those assumptions are spot on and not far from the truth.\n\n"
p5426
aS'You make a fair point about the potential to succumb to the Fallacy Fallacy.'
p5427
aS"Just because someone's logic is faulty that doesn't mean their conclusion is automatically wrong."
p5428
aS'They could be accidentally or intuitively correct.'
p5429
aS'However, I assumed that by describing the nature of the assumptions in such a brief way this would demonstrate why they are false without need for a lengthy explanation of each.'
p5430
aS'The general nature of my critique was to point out that this writer was attacking his/her own distorted perception of Libertarian ideals rather than actual Libertarian ideals (Straw Man), and then asserting unproven conclusions based on these distorted ideals and misunderstood desired outcomes (Begging the Question).'
p5431
aS'These logical Fallacies are intended to give us tools by which to judge the validity of an argument.'
p5432
aS"When the entire argument is one big run-on Fallacy, that's a huge red flag."
p5433
aS'In this case, he/she was not even close to accurate, by accident or otherwise.'
p5434
aS'&gt; So many unproven, baseless and outright confabulated assertions without any resemblance to the truth\n\n\nSounds like a Libertarian Party meeting.'
p5435
aS'You even managed to quote Star Trek. '
p5436
aS'You respond with yet another unproven and baseless opinion, not even bothering to support it with an argument.'
p5437
aS"It's not baseless, and the proof will come in the next ten elections the Libertarian party completely fucking bails on...a la the last ten."
p5438
aS"I've been to several in several different contexts and states."
p5439
aS"My argument against Libertarians efficacy and intention is that I've seen them at work and no matter how much Von Mises they quote they're either deluded into thinking they aren't being used by the Koch Brothers or they know how selfish and narcissistic they are and try to pass it off as amicability and wisdom (Penn Gillette). "
p5440
aS'Sadly, this is more Begging the Question.'
p5441
aS'It is not a given that Libertarians are being manipulated by the Kochs.'
p5442
aS"In fact, it isn't true at all."
p5443
aS'Therefore, your accusation of delusion is wholly innacurate.'
p5444
aS'One cannot ascribe characteristics to an entire group based on the perception of a mere handful of supporters.'
p5445
aS'A better benchmark is the vast population of non-rich, lower/middle class individuals who espouse Libertarian ideals.'
p5446
aS'Likewise your mischaracterization of Libertarian ideals as "greedy" or "selfish" is innacurate, though this is a more forgivable misattribution.'
p5447
aS'This is primarily a matter of misunderstood definition (see my prior posts about the Myth of Altruism).'
p5448
aS'All humans act in "self-interested" ways, which includes expressing the desire to help others and to see them succeed, along with wanting fair value exchange in business dealings (you might be suprised to know that a "living wage" is entirely consistent with Libertarian ideals).'
p5449
aS'Just because I recognize I do charitable works to make myself happy, is it any less valuable, good or right?'
p5450
aS'Who defines the rules?'
p5451
aS'The ruling class and the overarching cultural hegemony, no?'
p5452
aS'Our "rules" are in the interests of profit and capitalists.'
p5453
aS'The point is to break this mold. '
p5454
aS'We define rules because as of yet our species lacks the individual autonomy to survive alone or in significant isolation relative to the status quo.'
p5455
aS'"Rules" are arguably not totally necessary, but as a means of convenience and talent humans are able to establish language and shared terms for things (using a language is technically following a rule, and personally in the midst of existential fuck-all I\'m glad to be a slave to my words sometimes) and this evolves into systems.'
p5456
aS'The systems are not perfect and perhaps our greatest flaw is our willingness to buy into our own BS and believe that the rules are perfect simply because they are intended to be common.'
p5457
aS'Upon basic logical examination we know that just because something is law does not make it right, but we also operate on a day to day basis with a very strong sense of our own moral guidelines and regardless of our level of self-awareness or the context in which we formed them.'
p5458
aS'Most often (the majority of differing cases being considered abberations, perhaps unfairly) these moral codes, no matter how nuanced they become, hold some common elements from the society and thus we find that though rules are fallible and must be allowed to change they are also a powerful way to communicate the experience of time to young generations without requiring them to know every hour of the past.'
p5459
aS"Breaking the mold is important for testing our ontological limits, but I'm uncomfortable with anyone who says that suffering and immensely wasteful loss of life is acceptable in the pursuit of anything man wants to create or build or invent or whatehavyou, conceptual or otherwise."
p5460
aS"I see the cold logic in saying that at the cost of millions of people's well-being we can have a pretty good mock-up of Utopia...but the human in me just wants to keep everyone alive and reading, and that takes less money and effort than we're all expending in the rat-race right now. "
p5461
aS'Nothing in particular.'
p5462
aS'I was just pointing out that libertarians are not always anarchists. '
p5463
aS'I would argue libertarians are never anarchists, since libertarianism has nothing to do with the anarchist tradition, which is historically far-left.'
p5464
aS'Other than that it *was* synonymous with anarchism(including the leftism) from the 1850s to the 1950s.'
p5465
aS'Well yes, far-right capitalists have stolen the term "libertarianism" and now  they\'re trying to steal the word "anarchism" from the leftist lexicon.'
p5466
aS'But it has since been coopted by capitalists who are generally who Americans are referring to when the talk of libertarians and certainly who PZ Meyers was talking about.'
p5467
aS'Hence past tense.'
p5468
aS"It's a reminder that these people have coopted philosophies they do not understand, particularly the AnCaps."
p5469
aS'For the most part I simply write off libertarian beliefs because they have no foundation in any sort of reality.'
p5470
aS'If you look at their makeup, the "libertarian" movement is largely made up of privileged middle-class whites. '
p5471
aS'This.'
p5472
aS'I feel like their party is simply a bunch of kids trying to protect their parents wealth. '
p5473
aS'You could likely count the number of minorities in their little "Free State Project" with just your ten fingers alone.'
p5474
aS'Therefore, libertarianism has *everything* to do with the anarchist tradition--both are historically far-left.'
p5475
aS'Libertarianism is, and always has been, fundamentally anti-capitalist in orientation.'
p5476
aS'Left-leaning people are generally too smart to be anarchists beyond the age of 21.'
p5477
aS'If you look at what self-identified anarchists have to say, it tends to be about smashing the welfare state, not smashing any real apparatus of power or privilege wielded by the state.'
p5478
aS"That's completely false."
p5479
aS'I have never heard an anarchist on the Left discuss "dismantling the welfare state" in the context of contemporary capitalism.'
p5480
aS'That would be societal suicide. '
p5481
aS"And there's a whole history of rich literature discussing anarchism and its methodology."
p5482
aS"I would advise you look through some of it, rather than thinking you're clever while actually coming across foolish. "
p5483

p5746

p5748
aS'which years?'
p5749
aS"they were around in the 1500's right?"
p5750
aS"so youre talking pre 1500's and post roman empire."
p5751
aS'in the past 2000 years the only time there havent been corporations were in the dark ages.'

p5755
aS'This is a libertarian position.'
p5756
aS'Corporations are a legislative entity that reduce the personal liability of their stakeholders. '
p5757
aS'Restricting the right of free individuals to form corporations is not a Libertarian ideal. '
p5758
aS'Libery to form contracts among themselves freely is a libertarian idea, however, the legislative entity that is the American corporation is not a contract exclusively between individuals.'
p5759
aS'It\'s a contract between individuals and the state wherein stakeholders are protected against legal liability resultant from the actions of "the corporation.'
p5760
aS'" Corporations don\'t commit crimes, people commit crimes, and it\'s very libertarian to hold people responsible for their actions.  '
p5761
aS'I believe you are confusing state sanctioned rules for the formation of a corporation with the implicit sanction of that corporations activities.'
p5762
aS'Such sanction of activities can only occur in a regulatory form biased towards (and protective of) corporations that must be (and is) separately encoded as law.'
p5763
aS"Libertarian ideals include holding both corporations and individuals accountable for their actions, rather than what we have today which is innapropriate collusion between government and business to the detriment of individual citizen's rights and freedoms."
p5764
aS"I'm not confusing anything, I think we're just using language differently."
p5765
aS'When I say "(the dissolution of the corporation) is a libertarian ideal" I don\'t mean any type of bound legal entity, but rather the *pro tempore*  American "corporation.'
p5766
aS'" I figure that\'s a bit cumbersome to say, but you\'re right, I did mischaracterize the libertarian position. '
p5767
aS'As with most "political debate" I think we are all a lot closer in "ideals" than the "extreme positions" would lead us to believe.'
p5768
aS'Part of that problem is agreeing on the meaning of the terminology and the default conclusions about specific actions necessary to accomplish those goals. '
p5769
aS'I think most people are consequentialists with similar goals.'
p5770
aS"Even if we're deontologically disparate, we all want people happy, healthy, well educated, not murdering each other."
p5771
aS'Turning discussion political, dialectic, theoretical allows people to polarize and dehumanize even when the vast majority want the same positive things for one another.'
p5772
aS"It's bizarre in a way. "
p5773
aS'Yeah, the accusations about "wrong intent" are often nothing more than an assumed "bad end" based on assumed "broken means.'
p5774
aS'" We would surely make more progress towards fixing problems if we spent more time assuming people were *not* sociopaths intent on fucking each other over and really listened to why they desire a given outcome and why their chosen method appeals to their personal code of ethics. '
p5775
aS"I'm confused, are you attacking me or not?"
p5776
aS'You can do this now, the state lets you.'
p5777
aS'The libertarian / Austrian position is that limiting liability is an unnatural distortion of the marketplace and causes malinvestment / subverts the process of law, and should be done away with.'
p5778

aS"Unless you're the outpost nine guy, in which case we exchanged a few emails about a decade ago. "
p5780
aS'Libertarian ideals do not allow for child labor, pollution or assaulting anyone.'

p5782
aS'There is no way to amass capital like limited liability corporations do.'
p5783
aS'Investment as we know it would end. '

aS"The rich people weren't quite as rich."
p5786
aS'Life as we know it is completely fucked and unsustainable.'
p5787
aS'It will either end in controlled circumstances or due to the disasters that it causes.'
p5788
aS"There's an economy of scale for the amassing of capital."
p5789
aS"Investment that creates more marginal liability than the marginal benefit of that particular investment against it's opportunity cost is capital that would have been more beneficially invested elsewhere. "
p5790
aS'So you want to prevent people from selling goods they have produced to their neighbors?'
p5791
aS'Or is it that you want to prevent a group of people from pooling their resources for a common goal?'
p5792
aS' I want to eliminate **greed**.'
p5793
aS'How do you propose to do that given that humans are flawed and greedy?'
p5794
aS"What is it that you don't like about corporations?"
p5795

p5799
aS'This.'

aS"I don't like how certain entities can hide from retribution if they do something wrong, simply because of a legal term."
p5801
aS'I apply this to LLC AND PACs.'
p5802
aS'I don\'t believe that "anonymous" political contributions have a positive impact on our society.'
p5803
aS'I agree.'

aS'We would have better off if even the Federalist papers had their names published, rather than arguing about just their ideas.'
p5805
aS'Contributions, NOT speech.'
p5806
aS'Money is not speech.'
p5807
aS'Contribution is speech.'
p5808
aS'We should know who puts up every single tv commercial, radio ads and date I say newspaper ad.'
p5809
aS"It's the same all around."
p5810
aS'Would you say that we can have people posting newspaper articles knowing who "paid" for it but not who wrote it?'
p5811
aS'We have that now.'
p5812
aS'Welcome to the internet!'
p5813
aS"I just don't want Corporations telling me how to live my life, and I certainly don't want some company telling me who to vote for."
p5814
aS'I want to know if Monsanto is running that anti-GMO ad, but as it stands now, all I see is "Funded by Americans for less regulation PAC" or some other such nonsense.'
p5815
aS'Agreed.'
p5816
aS'But we must know who writes everything.'
p5817
aS'No anonymous comments about politics either. '
p5818
aS'Then tell us your real name.'
p5819
aS"Otherwise you're just another hypocrite troll... "
p5820
aS'that has nothing to do with greed.'
p5821
aS'if a corporation of 1000 stock holders accidentally kills someone, does everyone go to jail for a few hours?'
p5822
aS"It's called a conspiracy and everyone should be punished the same "
p5823
aS'so thats a thousand people in jail because a worked failed to check something correctly?'
p5824
aS'Makes the rich pay more attention.'
p5825
aS'no, its unreasonable.'
p5826
aS"I'm all for eliminating limited liability."
p5827
aS"It's a very anti-capitalist thing that I hope we do get rid of some day."
p5828
aS'Limited liability is fascism.'
p5829
aS'And the little guy gets screwed because of it.'
p5830
aS'So when you get company stock you want to lose your house when the company goes bankrupt?'
p5831
aS'Better you than the employees.'
p5832
aS'If you can afford to buy stock, you can afford to lose a vacation house or two.'
p5833
aS'How would you suggest a normal person making 40k a year gain wealth?'
p5834
aS'Traditionally it has been through investment.'
p5835
aS'My retirement is also in company stocks.'
p5836
aS'Where should I invest my retirement if not in company ownership stake?'
p5837
aS'A pension plan.'
p5838
aS'The way things **used** to be (and still are for people who will sacrifice for the public good).'
p5839
aS'Where the heck do you think pension funds sit?!?'
p5840
aS'They are invested in company stocks!'
p5841
aS'I invest about 15% of my income, none of it in company stock except what came with the job. '
p5842
aS'If I own 1% of a company that is 1 billion in the hole (meaning I likely invested $1mil at least), then yes, I would expect to risk losing my house.'
p5843
aS'That would be the risk of owning that much stock of a large company.'
p5844
aS"But it's much more likely that if I invest $10k into a company, my risk of loss is more akin to the $10k."
p5845
aS'It would be extremely rare for a company to owe orders of magnitude more than it was worth unless there was fraud involved.'
p5846
aS'However, that is mitigated in that if the fault of the bankruptcy is the board and/or the CEO, the responsibility for payment would be theirs, not the stockholders.'
p5847
aS'The argument that humans are innately greedy is foolish on its face.'
p5848
aS'"Greedy" is only meaningful as a relative term.'
p5849
aS'There is no divinely-ordained standard of avarice.'
p5850
aS'We have only our own norm, and by definition a totally normal person will possess a normal level of greed.'
p5851
aS'The same misguided argument, turned to violence rather than greed, justified generations of foot-dragging in the ongoing effort to purge the world of organized military aggression.'
p5852
aS'If the "people are inherently violent" crowd did not get loads of entirely undeserved academic approval, current levels of nation-on-nation violence might have been achieved a century earlier, and today we might have entirely outgrown the murderous petulance of war.'
p5853
aS'That actually sounds great.'
p5854
aS'That is exactly what libertarians are suggesting (including me).'
p5855
aS'Pooling their resources to influence politics to the degree that they do needs to stop, because they are abusing it.'
p5856
aS'You mean like how reddit pooled its resources to stop SOPA?'
p5857
aS'The only reason lobbyists are a problem is because of the amount of favoritism the federal government can grant.'
p5858
aS"In a libertarian government, the central government cannot grant favoritism to any particular company and so you wouldn't have much in the way of lobbyists, either."
p5859
aS'Well, you know SOPA was not good for anyone.'
p5860
aS'How I probably should have phrased it is corporations often use political influence that winds up harming people (oil companies for example).'
p5861
aS"I don't know that a libertarian government would necessarily solve this."
p5862
aS'But there is something wrong when big corporations run over the people.'
p5863
aS"&gt; I don't know that a libertarian government would necessarily solve this."
p5864
aS'But there is something wrong when big corporations run over the people.'
p5865
aS'There might be some flaws about a libertarian government which you could level, but this would be one of the strong suits.'
p5866
aS'There would be no incentive to lobby because the centralized government would not have much power in terms of granting favors for one company over another.'
p5867
aS'The federal government would be prohibited from infringing on personal property rights.'
p5868
aS"It's simple, but the implications of that are huge."
p5869
aS'This would probably take too long to write out at the moment, but if you work that out in your mind a bit, you will see that if the government is limited in that way, there is barely any reason left to engage in lobbyism for big corporations.'
p5870
aS'What IS the solution?'
p5871
aS'Sounds to me like the solution to regulatory capture is to strip the regulator of the power that is being abused in the marketplace.'
p5872
aS'Seeing as regulatory capture usually involves allowing businesses to avoid regulations, deregulation is merely giving them what they want and hardly a improvement.'
p5873
aS"That's one side, sure."
p5874
aS'The other side is that regulation is used to prevent competition in the market place, either through barriers to entry, prevention of mergers, or sweetening sell-out deals so larger fish can acquire smaller competitors more easily.'
p5875
aS'The problem with most regulations is often that they prevent the market from operating efficiently to the benefit of the entrenched party.'
p5876
aS'If this were not the case, the entrenched party would be under competition and forced to change its behavior.'
p5877
aS'I see this problem most poignantly in telecom and media.'
p5878
aS'Others may have experiences that see it in other sectors.'
p5879
aS'Interestingly, the power to write rules entails the power to make exceptions.'
p5880
aS'If the power was stripped to do this, there would be lest power to create loopholes.'
p5881
aS'But as you say, how do we prevent something like fracking with poisonous materials.'
p5882
aS'The answer the libertarians give is that the people who are affected by the behavior should be able to sue the responsible party, up to and including shuttering them.'
p5883
aS'Currently, many regulations actually strip the ability of citizens to sue for damages, and if they can sue, the damages are capped to protect the companies.'
p5884
aS'The libertarian position is that all of this needs to go a way and more general power must be granted to citizens to sue.'
p5885
aS'Without this extra power, I agree with you, deregulation just means wanton destruction without consequence.'
p5886
aS'With this extra power, we would have to go through scenarios and formulas to determine if private citizens could sue hard enough to matter.'
p5887
aS'So well-written, so many unwarranted downvotes...'
p5888
aS'Quite few regulations are aimed at limiting competition.'
p5889
aS'If you look at the financial crisis, this was a prime example of regulatory capture allowing banks to avoid regulations.'
p5890
aS'Dereguation would have made the process much easier.'
p5891
aS'&gt; The problem with most regulations is often that they prevent the market from operating efficiently to the benefit of the entrenched party.'
p5892
aS'Who is the entrenched party regarding health and safety laws or environmental regulation?'
p5893
aS'How do these prevent competition?'
p5894
aS'&gt; The answer the libertarians give is that the people who are affected by the behavior should be able to sue the responsible party, up to and including shuttering them.'
p5895
aS"But what about issues where people aren't aware of the damage that is being done to them or can't prove it?"
p5896
aS'Can ordinary people really match the resources of big business?'
p5897
aS'What about issues like air pollution where the health damage is long term, spread across a huge number of disorganised people?'
p5898
aS'Leaving everyone to sue each other would be fantastic for lawyers but a nightmare for everyone else.'
p5899
aS"You do realize that the vast majority of Libertarians (minus a very small fringe) don't advocate for removing regulations that protect health and safety, right?"
p5900
aS'Libertarian ideals do not equal "no rule of law.'
p5901
aS'" This is a common mischaracterization.'
p5902
aS'Really?'
p5903
aS"Most of the ones I've come across do (or at least greatly reduce them)."
p5904
aS'Its a pretty common claim that regulations are strangling private business or something.'
p5905
aS'Some regulations do, and others are entirely appropriate.'
p5906
aS'There is an active debate in the Libertarian community about where to draw the line, though the general trend is towards vastly reduced amounts of regulation overall.'
p5907
aS'It is pure demonization to say that Libertarians are only for pro-big business deregulation.'
p5908
aS'This grossly mischarachterizes the actual stated position in the party platform the majority opinion of self-described Libertarians.'
p5909
aS'Ask any Libertarian if he/she would advocate that the law allow nuclear waste to be burried or dumped in the city center and you will find almost every single one of them say no.'
p5910
aS'I think Libertarians have failed to adequately address the problem of common resources like air, water, and land.'
p5911
aS"Their fallback for land is private property, their fall-back for water is that there's an upstream and a downstream so you can trace the misdeed (but they're wrong), and they have no answer for air."
p5912
aS'I believe this to be one of the greatest failings of their political philosophy.'
p5913
aS'&gt; Who is the entrenched party regarding health and safety laws or environmental regulation?'
p5914
aS'How do these prevent competition?'
p5915
aS"If you've never tried to start your own business you probably wouldn't have run into this."
p5916
aS'If you have, you may have not run into this.'
p5917
aS'But many businesses have to spend a lot of money to get over regulatory hurdles to even begin operation, even if their business is not really presenting a risk.'
p5918
aS'This is the way bureaucracy kills things.'
p5919
aS'Regulations are wide reaching and open to interpretation and the interpretation generally is done by the government agency and creates costs for private business.'
p5920
aS'A friends NYC restaurant was inspected and docked heavily because of an unwashed cheese grater.'
p5921
aS"The problem is that the cheese grater was hanging from the ceiling of the kitchen and never used by the cooks, it wasn't a tool used to prep food, but it was present in the kitchen, suspended by a wire."
p5922
aS'The cost for re-inspection was several thousand dollars.'
p5923
aS"Another friend's restaurant was told he MUST have a hand-washing sink at the counter where sushi was being prepared, but the place was so tiny all the chef had to do was turn around and take 2 steps (or 1 large one) and he'd be at the sink."
p5924
aS'In order to satisfy the regulation, the owner had to take a saw to the counter, cut a hole in it, insert a sink basin, and since there was no plumbing at that precise spot he had to run hoses from the old sink to the new one just to satisfy the regulation.'
p5925
aS'These are relatively common and simple in NYC restaurants.'
p5926
aS'Bigger problems arise when $10k pieces of equipment are the only things that satisfy a particular regulation when business is barely clearly that much in revenue, or when the documentation requirement is so large you need to retain a consulting firm for 50-man hour a quarter, just to process 150-page regulatory compliance documents.'
p5927
aS'All of these things cost money.'
p5928
aS'Competition only works efficiently when little guys can get started and turn into middle-sized guys and, in the aggregate, serve enough customers to provide price and quality competition to the big guys.'
p5929
aS'Small things like going from an A to B in health department grading over a cheese grater and a single tomato wrapped in saran wrap but not in the fridge (btw, refrigerated tomatoes are terrible) can be enough to drive a NYC restaurant out of business in under 6 months.'
p5930
aS'The requirement to buy $10k pieces of equipment are often far too much to bear and require either a bank loan or cause the entrepreneur to not even attempt it and move on to another project.'
p5931
aS'But the most important question you raised:\n\n&gt; Can ordinary people really match the resources of big business?'
p5932
aS'This is a major problem with our judicial system, no matter what political ideology or philosophy we are talking about.'
p5933
aS'For the Libertarians to even have a chance at making their position tenable, we have to reform the judicial system to make it easier citizens to have their grievances redressed and harder for well-moneyed defendants to escape unscathed.'
p5934
aS'I actually like that this is the linchpin for Libertarians because it gives me a focal point for actionable change.'
p5935
aS'They HAVE to fix the courts before they can start deregulation, and any improvement in the courts is going to help every movement for political justice.'

aS'Socialism, libertarian, progressive, etc.'
p5941
aS"I attribute it to the fact that there is virtually no mass media aligned with these political stances, which means there are no reinforcements of people's belief systems if they fall outside the standard political positions."
p5942
aS'People crave this sort of reinforcement (citation: for-profit news channels behaving optimally) and they find it in the sub with the right name for them.'
p5943
aS'So, it becomes an echo chamber, reinforced by counter-point comments being hidden once they get down-voted enough.'

aS'No, that was my point.'

aS"It doesn't."
p6062
aS"You're starting from flawed premises: the decentralized government (A) isn't a singular thing that controls something and (B) isn't intended to *control* corporations."
p6063
aS'A "decentralized government" is a system of multiple independent governmental bodies working in parallel.'
p6064
aS'Governments are generally the only entity in a society that has legitimate claim to the use of violent force.'
p6065
aS'Regulatory capture by corporations effectively transfers the power to use such violent force from the government to the corporation.'
p6066
aS'The goal of a decentralized government is to spread control of violent force over as many independent bodies as possible, making the task of usurping that power for corporate gain more difficult and the task of maintaining control over that power more cumbersome and vulnerable to collective opposition from the members of society.'
p6067
aS"In this way, the decentralized governmental structure isn't intended to control a highly centralized corporation but instead to (A) mitigate the damage it can cause and (B) create a plethora of avenues for adjustment and response to bad behavior."
p6068
aS'In contrast, a highly centralized governmental structure aggregates violent force in such a way that (A) the stakes of regulatory capture are MUCH higher and (B) the avenues for adjustment and redress are highly constrained.'
p6069
aS"&gt; isn't intended to control corporations\n\nYes, it is totally, as corporations are conventions born of government."
p6070
aS'Nothing more.'
p6071
aS'Just because we have created a concept of "corporations" and enabled their creation through legislation and government bureaucracy doesn\'t mean the government intends to *control* them in the sense of dictating what actions they can and cannot do.'
p6072
aS'That would be nigh impossible as the domain of action is practically infinite.'
p6073
aS'Again, I contend that governments seek to *mitigate damage* not directly control.'
p6074
aS'Both centralized and decentralized governments can achieve this goal.'
p6075
aS'&gt; Governments are generally the only entity in a society that has legitimate claim to the use of violent force.'
p6076
aS"Okay, let's start here."
p6077
aS"It's a false statement."
p6078
aS"I am permitted to use violent force against a mouse that's invaded my home."
p6079
aS'I am permitted to use violent force against anyone trying to use force to kill me.'
p6080
aS'Our government has agents; agents we authorize to use force *on our behalf* for the same things.\n\n '
p6081
aS'&gt; generally\n\nIn special cases you are allowed to wield violent force: sport, self-defense.'
p6082
aS"That's pretty much it."
p6083
aS'You cannot be a vigilante.'
p6084
aS'You cannot premeditate the use of violence against criminals, etc.'
p6085
aS'The standard social contract, world-wide at this point, is such that you give up your rights (or the vast vast majority of them) in your exercise of violent force in exchange for participation in the society.'
p6086
aS'Hence, the government has a functional monopoly on the use of violent force.'
p6087
aS"To be fair, most of the time we also don't allow governments to use force in anything other than a defensive manner, the idea that a proportional response is the only acceptable one is pretty ingrained in most national legal systems and indeed somewhat in international law (wars of aggression are not lawful, defensive actions are etc.. its only recently that the idea of a pre-emptive defence has really come into its own..)."
p6088
aS"If we include imprisonment as a violent act (which lots of people do...) it again is something that we regulate with due process and (with a few notable exceptions) generally don't overuse in terms of either lengths of detention or conditions in detention."
p6089
aS'People have most of the same rights, we can act in self defence, we can arrest someone and cause them to be incarcerated and we can generally bring private criminal and civil prosecutions.  '
p6090
aS'While I understand the metaphorical similarities, I believe it is the actual difference between individual and state that the Libertarian uses to argue for the damage of any government larger than minuscule.'
p6091
aS"By way of easy example, let's look at regulatory capture."
p6092
aS'A regulatory body, influenced by a large and old business entity (Big W), unilaterally uses the powers of regulation granted to it by the Congress to determine that selling used Widgets requires a license.'
p6093
aS'The justification is cited as being that old Widgets can potentially be dangerous to consumers.'
p6094
aS'However, the true economic impact is that many of Big Ws competitors go out of business due to the cost of compliance, future potential competitors have a larger barrier to entry, and consumers have reduced choices in where to go to buy Widgets.'
p6095
aS"Now, let's say I open a used Widget shop and begin selling without a license."
p6096
aS'What will happen?'
p6097
aS"My neighbors won't confront me."
p6098
aS'Big W has no recourse.'
p6099
aS'Instead, armed officers will approach me at my place of business or my home.'
p6100
aS"They will most likely not be violent, though given the use of [force](http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/tarrant/Owners-irked-after-raid-on-Arlingtons-Garden-of-Eden--219354841.html) against this [organic farm](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/texas-swat-team-conducts-_n_3764951.html) in Texas, I'm no longer sure it will be a calm visit."
p6101
aS'Regardless, failure to comply with the demands to stop selling Widgets will result in armed officers physical detaining me and imprisoning me.'
p6102
aS'To recap, people elected officials, elected officials appointed trusted officials, trusted officials acted without direct elected official influence (therefore the action was not directly approved by the "will of the people") but with the direct influence of a business entity seeking to use violence to improve its business prospects, the threat of violent force is used to enforce a regulation that harms many and benefits few.'
p6103
aS'This is not a situation where there would be equivalence.'
p6104
aS'I think anyone would be hard pressed to find an equivalent individual use of force that mirrors this scenario.'
p6105
aS'Thus, I contend that the governmental use of force is not identical to the limited use of force afforded citizens.'
p6106
aS'Citizens may use force only for self preservation against a clear and present danger.'
p6107
aS'Government may use force in the interest of long-term self-preservation, the maintenance of behavioral codes, and any other interest it may seek to promote.'
p6108
aS'So while I agree that there exist checks and balances, due process, and the rule of law, I believe that the entire point of contention between political philosophies is whether or not the current implementation and surrounding foundation are the most just.'
p6109
aS'Libertarians argue that the problem is precisely that government has an influence over so wide a playing field that the defenses we have for self-regulating are insufficient to ensure a just society.'
p6110
aS'They argue that we must fundamentally limit the scope of government to have any hope that our tools for self-governance are effective.'
p6111
aS'In contrast, people who push for greater government power believe the problem is that governments are powerless to stop the constantly growing influence of purely economic entities and that government must continue to grow and evolve much as the corporate entity does.'
p6112
aS'So, how do you see it?'
p6113
aS'Have I argued sufficiently that governmental use of force is categorically more expansive than the use of force by the individual?'
p6114
aS"&gt;By way of easy example, let's look at regulatory capture."

p6124
aS'Regardless, failure to comply with the demands to stop selling Widgets will result in armed officers physical detaining me and imprisoning me.'
p6125
aS"I don't believe one has to be a Libertarian to look at fixing a situation like this."

aS"I'm a very left-leaning individual, and I see the value in observing these types of regulations and figuring out which ones are necessary and which ones need to go."
p6127
aS"I don't agree with permits just for the sake of collecting taxes."
p6128
aS'Permits should be required only to keep a business from harming its employees or customers, either through rotten food or shoddy construction, etc.'

aS"We've established that you or I can't call elections to replace the ASCAP executives and change the system, so we have to look elsewhere to help local businesses with their ASCAP fees."
p6178
aS'What in the FCC allows ASCAP to charge these fees?'
p6179
aS'Is there a specific rule that we could look at?'
p6180
aS'From what I can tell, the main reason that agencies like ASCAP and the MPAA can act as they do is because of Copyright Law.'
p6181
aS'I see a possible solution to this issue being to change Copyright legislation to expand the definition of "fair use" to allow playback in commercial venues as long as music/movies aren\'t the main profit centers for the business.'
p6182
aS'For example, if a local bar wants to play CDs or have a cover band come in once a month, that should be fair use.'
p6183
aS'If a local bar has a DJ on every night, and the DJ is the primary profit center that bar, that might be different.'
p6184
aS'If a non-profit group wants to show a movie or clips as part of a presentation, that should be allowed.'
p6185
aS'If that same group charges $5 to see said movie, then a licence fee should be paid up to the content owners.'

aS"I'm all for advocating for ANY governing oversight body to have an elected official at the helm."

aS'The FCC deals with radio stations, mergers of communication companies (like Pandora, FM radio stations, ISPs, etc), broadcast media, profanity regulations, etc.'
p6198
aS'Do I know of a particular regulation that the FCC should drop related to the problems of culture abuse?'
p6199
aS'No.'
p6200
aS'I do know that the FCC has a problem with corruption, terrible decision making, failure to protect the American people from price gouging to the tunes of multiple billions of dollars, and a never ending trail of over-reach, under-protection, revolving-door politics, and resistance to reform.'
p6201
aS'I do not believe the FCC is structured in any way, shape, or form that would allow for incremental reform.'
p6202
aS'I think instead of trying to race special interest in the reform game (a race we have all been losing for decades) that we need to review what regulations exist the FCC have enacted that are worth keeping, abolish the FCC completely, and either (A) devise a new agency with a totally new structure to start from the best regulation we selected or (B) move the responsibility of those regulations to an existing agency that has the power to enforce and the structure to resist capture.'
p6203
aS'And this is where I think we differ.'
p6204
aS"We both want reform, but you think I'm being rash for wanting somethings razed to the ground and I think you're woefully ignorant of the level of corruption of your up against if you think incrementalization will work."
p6205
aS'I have observed, worked towards, and collaborated with many efforts at incremental reform and the pace at which corruption in the FCC over-reaches outstrips every effort I have ever seen to make things better.'
p6206
aS'Every gain is so rare and so hard-fought that 4 - 8 losses occur before the gain is enacted.'
p6207
aS'Often, gains are bundled with additional losses or are subverted by loopholes and the process of fighting for the next reform begins.'
p6208
aS"At some point, you realize the problem isn't the individual regulations, it's the governing body."
p6209
aS"And since you can't vote them out, you've got to kick them out."
p6210
aS"Since you can't directly change regulation, can't vote on regulation, and your elected congresspersons are outnumbered by political appointees, you really don't have much hope of reforming when corruption becomes so thoroughly entrenched."
p6211
aS'Grassroots reforms are public, the corrupt are watching and establishing defenses very early, they have more lawyers, more money, and more influence, and they begin their chess game before you even get your movement explained well enough to get support.'
p6212
aS'By the time you\'ve got something before the Congress, you\'ve more than likely lost the battle for hearts and minds, and the reform you\'re seeking to enact is based on your limited knowledge of the regulatory regime which has already changed slightly, but enough to absorb your reform in the worst case (for them) or demonstrate "good faith" to Congress and get it killed before it gets any teeth in the best case (for them).'
p6213
aS'So I empathize with the "burn it down" mentality because I\'ve seen the futility of fighting entrenched interests and I\'ve seen the problems of having so large of a government that Congress can barely keep up.'
p6214
aS"The appointees are operating without sufficient government oversight because we'd have to increase the number of elected officials just to get the oversight in the first place, and by the time that happens the size and number of agencies will continue to grow and outstrip our ability to oversee them, yet again."
p6215
aS'&gt;And this is where I think we differ.'
p6216
aS"We both want reform, but you think I'm being rash for wanting somethings razed to the ground and I think you're woefully ignorant of the level of corruption of your up against if you think incrementalization will work."
p6217
aS'I want major reform, not small reforms...'
p6218
aS'Most "reforms" fail because they miss the big picture.'
p6219
aS'As a result, loopholes are present.'
p6220
aS'The reforms and new laws have to be rigid, broad, and precise.'
p6221
aS'The lawyers and CEOs that make up our current Congress write laws that read like legal briefs.'
p6222
aS'They are too long, too convoluted, and contain too many caveats.'
p6223
aS'Because the Congress is split, people from both parties add a bunch of Amendments to these bills that turn them into messes, and then corporate interests take advantage of the legalize to find ways to get around laws and regulations.'
p6224
aS'Laws would work if they were written by normal, everyday people instead of lawyers.'

p6243
aS"I fear I'm in danger of losing the thread of your argument and you've only just begun to explain it."
p6244
aS'My statement is that governments are, in general, the only entities with legitimate claim to using violent force, also reformulated as physical violence.'
p6245
aS'This can entail physical harm, physical restraint, deprivation of air, water, or food (generally a derivation of physical restraint), and death (generally a derivation of physical harm).'
p6246
aS'Your statement is that force and property go hand-in-hand.'
p6247
aS'I can imagine a society without property as such that still must make decisions on the legitimacy of the use of violence.'
p6248
aS"I'm hoping you can clarify your position so that I might be better able to participate in this argument."
p6249
aS'&gt; My statement is that governments are, in general, the only entities with legitimate claim to using violent force,\n\nThe government gets this right from the people, with their consent, for their *mutual* benefit.'
p6250
aS'What are you opposed to?'
p6251
aS'Force?'
p6252
aS'Violent force?'
p6253
aS'The people?   \n\n'
p6254
aS"I'm not going to allow you to steer this discussion through sophistry."
p6255
aS"Either engage in Logos, Pathos, or Ethos, or we're going to get nowhere."
p6256
aS'The people of the US have consented to a form of government that changes over time via representative democratic rule.'
p6257
aS'One of the core assumptions of this government is that "the people" give up their rights to exercise violence in society for the mutual benefit of a safe and stable society, enforced by violence conducted by the government.'
p6258
aS'This nigh universal tenet of self-governance comes with an inherent risk: that those entrusted with wielding violence justly behave unjustly.'
p6259
aS'This risk is mitigated by various structures within the rule of law: elections, term limits, a constitution, "checks and balances" between various governmental structures.'
p6260
aS'My claim is that both a centralized and a decentralized governmental structure can mitigate the damage caused by so-called (by you) "centralized corporations".'
p6261
aS'(which, by the way, they are not.'
p6262
aS'Each corporation wields power independently of each other and therefore private sector corporate behavior is decentralized).'
p6263
aS'Further, my claim is that of the risks inherent in both strong central and weak central governments, their are unique risks of regulatory capture and the unjust wielding of violence by a central government that are absent or lessened by many smaller governments with smaller geographical domains of influence (as in a federation).'
p6264
aS'You came into the discussion to argue an early premise about the monopoly of force, which I attempted to refine to mutual satisfaction.'
p6265
aS'You then moved on to what seemed like a grievance in my refinement that omitted something specific about property and its connection with violence.'
p6266
aS'I asked for clarification on this point and attempted to demonstrate a little bit of my familiarity with the problems of property in an attempt to help you help me understand.'
p6267
aS'And now a woefully sophistic false choice and leading question.'
p6268
aS'I worry this is going nowhere.'
p6269
aS'&gt; My claim is that both a centralized and a decentralized governmental structure can mitigate the damage caused by so-called (by you) "centralized corporations".'
p6270
aS'How can a decentralized governmental structure mitigate the damage caused by so-called "centralized corporations".'
p6271
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p6272
aS'&gt;  unjust wielding of violence by a central government that are absent or lessened by many smaller governments with smaller geographical domains of influence (as in a federation).'
p6273
aS"You intermix positive and normative statements so much it's difficult to argue."
p6274
aS'"violence" is an emotional term.'
p6275
aS'&gt;  I worry this is going nowhere.'
p6276
aS'And it will go nowhere so long as you mix emotional with factual.  \n'
p6277
aS"&gt; You intermix positive and normative statements so much it's difficult to argue."
p6278
aS'"violence" is an emotional term.'
p6279
aS'Then let us define it.'
p6280
aS'I have been using violence to mean "the use of physical force to cause injury, damage, death".'
p6281
aS'Will that enable us to continue this discussion?'
p6282
aS'&gt; How can a decentralized governmental structure mitigate the damage caused by so-called "centralized corporations".'
p6283
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p6284
aS'A "decentralized government" is one in which there are many entities with smaller adjacent domains of jurisdiction, as opposed to a "centralized government" where a single entity covers all domains of jurisdiction within state.'
p6285
aS'Corporations, I argue, are more akin to decentralized governments.'
p6286
aS'There is no single corporation with control over the economic activity of their entire market (unless you have a monopoly or cartel).'
p6287
aS'Instead, you have many corporations, each with their own governing body, own decision making process, and their own domains.'
p6288
aS"But, without even going into the terminological argument here, let's talk about the operative portion of your question: mitigating damages."
p6289
aS"Let's discuss some of the types of damages a corporation can cause."
p6290
aS'Environmental (commons) damage, direct application of physical force (including imprisonment, harm, and death) against 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons), and direct application of physical force (including destruction, damage, and theft) against property claimed by 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons).'
p6291
aS'A government with jurisdiction over any entity can take punitive action against said entity for violating the code of behavior enforced by said government.'
p6292
aS'The government must therefore have sufficient power to become of aware of these violations, enforce the punishment, and to construct and maintain a just code of behavior by which to govern.'
p6293
aS'In a decentralized government, the existence of many government entities may increase awareness of violations by virtue of the larger aggregate volume of information flowing through the whole system.'
p6294
aS'All violations occur at specific locations and at specific times, therefore stronger relationships between governing bodies and multiple locales enables a distributed information gathering system to be maintained.'
p6295
aS'In a centralized government, bureaucracies are used to create the same level of awareness, but I propose that the evidence is such that reliance on local government has not been supplanted by these bureaucracies.'
p6296
aS'In a decentralized government, resources may be more constrained in any given governmental body than they would be in a centralized one.'
p6297
aS'This may negatively impact the ability of a governmental body in a decentralized system to enforce punishment on larger actors.'
p6298
aS"I don't readily see why this would be the case."
p6299
aS'Given that private entities are not permitted to maintain their own militias, a decentralized government would still maintain a monopoly on the use of physical violence for the purposes of regulatory enforcement.'
p6300
aS"A corporation, despite it's larger economic capacity, would still be unable to resist arrest."
p6301
aS'If this point is contended, we would be in the realm of pure speculation as in the US we have never seen a corporation raise a mercenary army to opposed state forces in the enforcement of regulation.'
p6302
aS'Lastly, we come to the ability to construct and maintain a just code of behavior.'
p6303
aS'In a decentralized government, we would be most assuredly be in a situation where there were differences across any given state in the code of behavior.'
p6304
aS"A modern example would be California's laws regarding labeling of products as well as emission standards for cars."
p6305
aS'The people that are represented by that governing body ostensibly have different ideas for the optimal definition of justice than their neighbors.'
p6306
aS'In a centralized government, there is one behavior code.'
p6307
aS'As seen by the implementation of centralized decision-making systems, this behavior code changes much more slowly.'
p6308
aS'This means injustices are introduced more slowly and injustices are resolved more slowly.'
p6309
aS'It\'s not clear that centralization or decentralization presents the better system for maintaining a code of behavior until we look at the concept of "regulatory capture".'
p6310
aS'Through this mechanism, the power of the government to apply punishment can be directed to the benefit of few to the detriment of the many.'
p6311
aS'This is generally assumed to be something that cannot happen given a well functioning government with checks and balances.'
p6312
aS'However, in existing implementations of government, we see that special interest is able to bypass the inertia of centralized government to enable injustices to be added to the code of behavior more quickly than they can be removed.'
p6313
aS'Further, it has been demonstrated that these injustices can be defended through further manipulation of the code of behavior, enacted quickly by special interest.'
p6314
aS'It is the claim of Libertarians that the situation is such that the citizenry will always lose this race so long as the ability of the governing body to modify the code of behavior is unfettered.'
p6315
aS'Therefore, the claim is that many codes of behavior allow for 2 things: 1) more work for a special interest due to needing to manipulate hundreds of entities instead of one and 2) greater redress of injustice due to smaller domains more responsive to their constituents.'
p6316
aS'Sorry, too long.'
p6317
aS'Honestly, how can I reply to that manifesto?'
p6318
aS"Please tell me it's a copy &amp; paste. "
p6319
aS"It's not."
p6320
aS'I expected you to deconstruct the points and make counterpoints.'
p6321
aS'Allow me to make it easier for you:\n\nGiven:  \n"Violence" is defined as "the use of physical force to cause injury, damage, death".'
p6322
aS'"Decentralized government" is defined as a system of government characterized by the existence of many individual governing bodies, with individual jurisdictions, each having both a common set of rules regulating their operations as well as individual bodies of legislation reflective of the will of the subset of the governed represented by said individual governing body.'
p6323
aS'"Centralized government" is defined as a system of government characterized by a single governing body with a comprehensive jurisdiction and one body of legislation reflective of the entirety of the citizenry of the state in question.'
p6324
aS'"Centralized corporation" is defined as a corporate entity with a decision making body.'
p6325
aS'"Decentralized corporation" is defined a corporate entity with multiple decision making bodies that act independently over some aspect of the corporation\'s behavior.'
p6326
aS'Do you accept these definitions for the sake of our current debate?'
p6327
aS'Current question, posed by JohnnyBeagle:  \n&gt; How can a decentralized governmental structure mitigate the damage caused by so-called "centralized corporations".'
p6328
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p6329
aS'First, we must identify the potential damages caused by corporations.'
p6330
aS'* Environmental (commons) damage  \n* direct application of physical force (including imprisonment, harm, and death) against 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons)  \n* direct application of physical force (including destruction, damage, and theft) against property claimed by 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons)  \n\nDo you accept that these are types of potential damages caused by corporations?'
p6331
aS'Do you have any others you feel need to be added for the sake of argument?'
p6332
aS'We may amend this list later as the need arises.'
p6333
aS'Having defined the types of damage that may be caused by a corporation, we must now move on to how any government may mitigate these damages.'
p6334
aS'I propose that there is really only one way: *punitive action*.'
p6335
aS'I further propose that while prior restraint may be posited as a second technique, it is wholly reliant on punitive action to enforce and therefore may be reduced to punitive action for the sake of argument.'
p6336
aS'Would you agree that punitive action is the only mechanism by which a government may mitigate the damage caused by a corporation (enumerated above).'
p6337
aS'At this point, we have:\n\n1) Definitions  \n2) Enumeration of the types of potential damage caused by a corporation.'
p6338
aS'3) Specified the mechanism by which a government may mitigate such damage.'
p6339
aS'Barring modifications based on your objections, we must further elucidate the problems indicated by your question:\n\n&gt;How can a **decentralized governmental structure** mitigate the damage caused by so-called **"centralized corporations"**.'
p6340
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p6341
aS'[Emphasis mine]\n\nI will take the liberty of reforming your question into a conjecture: Centralized governments are more effective at mitigating the damage by centralized corporations when compared to decentralized ones.'
p6342
aS'So, how about I let you get a word in edgewise here, determine if our definitions and enumerations are common, and determine if my formulation of your conjecture is in fact accurate.'
p6343
aS'If so, we can then proceed to deconstruct my above screed to a more formal argument as to why a decentralized government would have the same or better capacity to mitigate the damage caused by ANY form of corporation when compared to a centralized government.'
p6344
aS'Nothing controls big corporations, but big government makes big corporations.'
p6345
aS'&gt; but big government makes big corporations.'
p6346
aS"So you're trying to tell me that absent big government, the wealthy will not cooperate for their mutual benefit?  "
p6347
aS'Its a pretty common libertarian trope. '
p6348
aS"I can conspire with my buddy to make everyone in the neighborhood pay me to keep the air oxygenated, but it's a hell of a lot more work to do so if there isn't a bribable gang in the neighborhood willing to use violence to enforce it."
p6349
aS"If you aren't aware that billions of dollars go missing in the Pentagon, and that a majority of no-bid contracts are handed to the politically connected (and never completed), it may be time to educate yourself about what the Federal government is actually doing with your money."
p6350
aS"And before you start: it's not the GOP."
p6351
aS"Look at the bipartisan support for TPP, NDAA abuses, PATRIOT, PIPA/ACTA, etc., and you'll see that the Rs and Ds play for the same team: team corporation."
p6352
aS'The veneer of animosity is only about who gets the bigger bone at the next mealtime, not about ideology.'
p6353
aS"&gt; If you aren't aware that billions of dollars go missing in the Pentagon, and that a majority of no-bid contracts are handed to the politically connected (and never completed), it may be time to educate yourself about what the Federal government is actually doing with your money."
p6354
aS'Making perfect the enemy of the good is not a solution I favor.'
p6355
aS'And it\'s not "my money" once it\'s been paid to my government.'
p6356
aS"&gt; And before you start: it's not the GOP."
p6357
aS"Look at the bipartisan support \n\nSo you're trying to tell me there is no difference between the parties?"
p6358
aS'Yeah, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Rand Paul are two peas in a pod... '
p6359
aS'&gt;Making perfect the enemy of the good is not a solution I favor.'
p6360
aS'And it\'s not "my money" once it\'s been paid to my government.'
p6361
aS"So you're willing to accept drone strikes and illegal wiretaps in your name for ... what?"
p6362
aS'What are you so proud of that these abuses and the thousands of others are palatable.'
p6363
aS"It's not about my tax money, I'm happy to pay taxes to support an egalitarian, free society."
p6364
aS"I just don't see that's what my taxes are paying for, and have not for a very long time."
p6365
aS"&gt;So you're trying to tell me there is no difference between the parties?"
p6366
aS'Yeah, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Rand Paul are two peas in a pod...\n\nAnd neither has any power, and never will.'
p6367
aS'They are the players on the field to keep you in the stadium cheering while the world is sold for a song in the parking lot.'
p6368
aS"&gt; So you're willing to accept drone strikes and illegal wiretaps in your name for ... \n\nYeah, that's exactly what I said."
p6369
aS'Again, making perfect the enemy of the good *and not offering anything in its place other than Utopian dreams* is not something I wish to discuss.'
p6370
aS"&gt;  I just don't see that's what my taxes are paying for, and have not for a very long time."
p6371
aS'When I was unemployed and had a wife diagnosed with cancer, I saw what my taxes were paying for.'
p6372
aS'When I see my children entering adulthood, educated, healthy, and enjoying life, I see what my taxes are paying for.'
p6373
aS'When my 95 year old mother was dying in a hospital in Florida and Medicaid was paying the bills, I saw what my taxes were paying for.'
p6374
aS"You're just not looking close enough."
p6375
aS'You think Warren has no power?  '
p6376
aS"&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what I said."
p6377
aS'Again, making perfect the enemy of the good and not offering anything in its place other than Utopian dreams is not something I wish to discuss.'
p6378
aS"You don't want to discuss anything."
p6379
aS'The phrase "...the enemy of the good" is a way of not participating.'
p6380
aS'Everything you listed as benefits take at most a fraction of the money we pay to the Federal government.'

p6382
aS"Talk to a teacher about what happened after No Child Left Behind and Common Core and they'll tell you about how much Federal help they want."
p6383
aS'Unemployment insurance comes largely from States.'

aS"Medicaid/Medicare are not taken from income taxes - they're their own line item."
p6385
aS"It seems you've abdicated understanding of the issue in favor of saying the good things in you life come from the Federal government, but it's simply not true."
p6386
aS'Even if it were, nothing stops us from letting States / Counties / Municipalities collect those taxes and provide those services.'
p6387
aS"The benefits to that are that your State doesn't have an army that Haliburton would make a mint from seeing deployed to Iraq."
p6388
aS"Your County doesn't have a spy apparatus that needs corporate hardware to maintain."
p6389
aS'These governments are inherently immune to the most egregious corruption by their nature.'
p6390
aS'&gt;You think Warren has no power?'
p6391
aS'You think she does?'
p6392
aS'She has a lot of attention.'

aS'There is no "give", and therefore it is not valid to argue that there should be an equivalent "take".'

aS"It's not a direct argument at all."
p7126
aS'Are you saying the responsibility inherent to the human condition is adherence to the social contract?'
p7127
aS"I don't think any human MUST adhere to it as part of their condition, but I do believe that humans who don't adhere to the social contract are still afforded the rights enumerated in the Constitution."

aS'There is no tit-for-tat, no tradeoff, no give-and-take.'
p7141
aS'Rights are declared as inherent to the human condition and therefore anyone adhering to a given charter that declares such rights applies these rights to ALL humans regardless of any qualifying characteristics of the human, be it creed, fealty, or even criminal status.'

aS'Criminals still have rights and it is the domain of law to determine by what logic the collective is permitted to abridge the rights of an individual, the most obvious reasons being codified in criminal law.'
p7143
aS'But even criminal law is very careful and respectful of the rights of the criminal, because they are NOT goodies, they are not frivolities, and they are not whimsical privileges afforded individuals by their benevolent rules.'

p7172
aS"ADDITIONALLY, I have NO IDEA how ANY OF THIS is relevant to the conversation we were having just ONE FUCKING POST AGO about whether or not a declaration of rights shouldn't also contain a declaration of inherent responsibilities like adherence to the social contract of a particular state."
p7173
aS"I also am starting to worry that you won't even bother to explain yourself but instead will question me about some other non-sequitur that you feel vindicates your position but to the rest of us makes you look like someone who can't control their own thought process long enough to fashion a reasoned argument to engage in a debate."
p7174

p7437
aS'I would think that the existence of the word Libertarianism indicates a material difference between anarchists and Libertarians.'
p7438
aS'As far as I understand it, the difference is that the government does exist and it enforces contracts and defends against use of violence.'

aS'The mechanisms described are mostly market based but also include law suits as a means of redressing grievances.'
p7440
aS"I agree with you that Libertarianism doesn't need fallacious arguments to be undermined, but your straw man formulation doesn't help."
p7441
aS'Yeah, Okay, sorry for not being specific.'
p7442
aS'When I said "corruption can\'t take place if there isn\'t government there to corrupt" I meant that libertarians would like as little as government there as possible to minimize corruption, not that they would do away with government altogether.'
p7443
aS'See that I said "almost any government agency".'
p7444
aS'If I was referring to anarchist capitalists I would have said "all government agencies".'
p7445
aS'So I did not describe anarchism.'
p7446

aS"Based on what I see in this thread, and in this sub in general, I think that's generous."

aS'&gt; I said "almost any government agency"\n\n&gt; vapid notion that the free market can replace almost any government agency\n\nRight, that\'s what you said.'
p7450
aS"It would be interesting to figure out which ones they wouldn't think could be replaced, determine why, and then see if those same reasons wouldn't be applicable to departments they argue should be abolished."
p7451
aS'Generally I have found the reasoning to be arbitrary, though there are so many different forms of libertarianism it is difficult to lay down a critique that applies wholly to all of them.'
p7452
aS'Constitutionalists, for example, at least can find some non arbitrary distinction by sticking to the constitution as the determining factor.'
p7453
aS'Inevitably their theory falls apart when you realize that they create their own distinction of what is "constitutional" and what isn\'t, primarily based on arbitrary personal preferences.'
p7454
aS'Otherwise it seems like you have to commit a tautology in order to justify your libertarian theory: "my theory is good because it gets rid of government, and getting rid of government is good because [insert personal reasoning of why the government is bad]".'
p7455
aS'From a theoretical point of view this makes no sense.'
p7456
aS"Classical liberalism is theoretically very well founded, universal, and justifiable; but liberal theory doesn't equate to libertarianism."
p7457
aS'For that equation you have to justify why the state must remain a certain size and not expand, and inevitably you will have to bring up personal preferences and arbitrary distinctions.'
p7458
aS"&gt; you have to justify why the state must remain a certain size and not expand\n\nI'm not sure I agree with this."
p7459
aS'I have never seen a libertarian argue for a particular size, just "smaller".'
p7460
aS'I have always interpreted that position as the libertarian saying that government has grown too large "in a direction antithetical to my values".'
p7461
aS"I assume that, should rules about which regulations are acceptable and which aren't that government could and would continue to grow within those boundaries."
p7462
aS"So I don't think it's quantifiable size that counts but rather the properties on the domain of acceptable government behavior which would diminish."
p7463
aS'&gt; Otherwise it seems like you have to commit a tautology in order to justify your libertarian theory: "my theory is good because it gets rid of government, and getting rid of government is good because [insert personal reasoning of why the government is bad]".'
p7464
aS"I think you're trying to point out circular reasoning, not a vacuous tautology."
p7465
aS"Libertarian philosophy doesn't generally say that Libertarian philosophy is good because getting rid of government is good."
p7466
aS'That sounds like high school / early college thinkers trying to say "my team is better than your team".'
p7467
aS'Libertarian philosophy starts from core values regarding individual liberty.'
p7468
aS'It then describes government, quite accurately, as an institution of the collective which demands that individual liberties be abridged for the common good.'
p7469
aS'Then, it moves on to state that the abridgment of individual liberty should be as limited as possible to promote the core value of individual liberty.'
p7470
aS'Then, it attempts to argue for alternative solutions to collective problems that do not involve the abridgment of individual liberty.'
p7471
aS'Finally, it argues that power tends to aggregate and corrupt and that not only are their alternatives to the current level of abridgment of individual liberty but that the powerfully corrupt abuse the collectives trust to harm us and, as such, it is important to strip the government of certain powers to ensure that the institution we trust remains trustworthy.'
p7472
aS"I don't really see tautology or circular reasoning in there."
p7473
aS'I see the law of unintended consequences for sure.'
p7474
aS'I see over-reliance on market solutions over bureaucratic solutions without convincing evidence that the market is the right tool for each job.'
p7475
aS'I see a blind-eye regarding the aggregation of power in other places besides the government as well as a lack of game-theory-based control to avoid unresolvable aggregations of power.'
p7476
aS"&gt; inevitably you will have to bring up personal preferences and arbitrary distinctions\n\nI'm not sure about personal preferences."
p7477
aS'Arbitrary distinctions is a difficult nut, because values are ultimately arbitrary.'
p7478
aS'I do think that you run into a lot of people that argue a pro-market stance because "the market is an end" and not only do I disagree with that axiom but I also firmly believe it\'s not a base axiom but a derived one and that one can argue "the market is a means" quite successfully with a libertarian who values honest debate.'

aS'Time to deworm ourselves. '
p7549
aS'Are you kidding me?'
p7550
aS'The problem is totally the system.'
p7551
aS'The system creates economic hierarchy by giving the owners power over the producers.'
p7552
aS'This is where the problems come from.'
p7553
aS'Indeed, in every example you have given, there was economic hierarchy, which is one of the big reasons that each of them had oppression *from the start* and that said oppression *never went away*.'
p7554
aS'However, if you compare it to, say, Zapatista controlled land in Chiapas, you find that they have been around for over a decade without the same sort of oppression you find under capitalism, feudalism, or state socialism.'
p7555
aS'Why?'
p7556
aS'Because they are lacking in the same economic hierarchies and, indeed, are mostly organized along libertarian socialist lines.'
p7557
aS'Similarly, the Free Territory in Ukraine during the Russian Civil War and Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, though both lasted much less time than the Zapatistas in Chiapas, both were absent of the same sort of oppression found under the systems of economic hierarchy.'
p7558
aS'Again, this is because they were organized along libertarian socialist lines, with these ones being anarchist and communist.'
p7559
aS'So all these systems of economic hierarchy have contained within them this systemic oppression that one just does not find in the systems without economic hierarchy.'
p7560
aS'This tells me that the problem does not lie with, as you termed it, "a bad case of the worms" which are making the system oppressive.'
p7561
aS'Rather, the systems themselves are oppressive, and the worms you speak of are either not needed or created by the systems themselves.'

aS'People *eroded* the safeguards.'
p7574
aS'People *subverted* the markets (in the capitalist system) and the planning nexi (in the communist systems).'

aS'In other words, we are not even argued yet.'
p7577
aS'Even if you are correct and the structure is the problem, who do you think *built* it?'
p7578
aS'So people made these systems of hierarchy.'
p7579
aS'So?'
p7580
aS'My argument is that the hierarchical economic systems lead to oppression.'
p7581
aS'I backed this up by pointing out that every time people have built a system without such hierarchical economic power structures, there has been little to no oppression.'
p7582
aS"On the other hand, I can't think of a single system with hierarchical power structures that can say the same."
p7583
aS"I mean, of course they are made by people, though I would argue that the capitalistic markets and central planning were never subverted and functioning just as designed, but this doesn't mean that the system is not what is at fault here."
p7584
aS'&gt;My argument is that the hierarchical economic systems lead to oppression.'
p7585
aS"Can't argue that point."
p7586
aS"But then I wasn't."
p7587
aS"It's rather underlined by the hierarchal powers structure that the Communist International tried to become and that most Communist countries did become."

aS"I'm only reluctant about that because I doubt it would actually WORK."

aS'The only thing that will work is arranging things so that nobody can accumlate that much power over others.'
p7595

p7596
aS'The problem with the countries run by communists that spread through the world in the 20th century was marxist-leninism and the leninist theories of state power as well as the idea of the vanguard party.'
p7597
aS'Because of their theory of the state, they constructed a hierarchical structure in order to create a non-hierarchical structure.'
p7598
aS'This was a mistake.'

aS'In all the examples I gave that were good, they were constructed non-hierarchically from the start.'
p7600
aS'You see, by having no hierarchical structure, there is no way for people to gain power over anyone else.'
p7601
aS'This is especially true if the there is a culture of fierce egalitarianism, which will certainly happen if people just fought a revolution/insurrection to create a non-hierarchical society.'

aS'And I think a society with less government will fail those people.'

aS"We aren't a society like we were before the new deal."

p8045
aS'I think there are far fewer of these than you seem to; certainly less than half.'
p8046
aS'I know that they do exist, but I think the far more prevalent demographic are people that think they have no ability to better themselves because of what they have been told their entire lives.'

aS'High school may in fact be too hard for some people.'

aS'The concepts of high school are NOT too hard for anyone, except perhaps the profoundly mentally-handicapped.'

p8052
aS'They have, however, been born into a society that tells them they are.'
p8053
aS"The one thing I've been surprised by most in my life, is how I was told that I was clever, and that going to college made me more intelligent than those that didn't make the cut, and finding out that it was a total lie."
p8054
aS'They are not as helpless as you think.'
p8055
aS"Our society marginalizes those individuals with different kinds of intelligence and skills besides those focused on the academic, or the financial, but it's not the only kind of society that can exist."
p8056
aS'My dream of a more ideal society includes people being able to realize those skills and potentialities that the modern world would tell us are irrelevant.'
p8057
aS"Everyone does have something to contribute to a society that works, and I don't mean just the sweat of their brow."

aS'Edit: And I know this comes down to a fundamental disagreement about human capability.'

aS'In America,  regulated greed is also a problem.'
p8064
aS'Many American libertarians may be born in reaction to greed that is regulated through government corruption; one way to approach this problem is to reduce the government which is corrupt;  the cause of "good government" is lost in the USA (in my opinion).'
p8065
aS'I am currently trying to abandon ship and move to a country with good government,  like Sweden or Denmark. '
p8066
aS'Regulation grows government which is the greediest and sloppiest entity of all.'
p8067
aS"Don't believe me?"
p8068
aS'Just go into any government office.'
p8069
aS'As a libertarian, this is totally non-convincing.'
p8070
aS'The author simply states his position without making his case at all.'
p8071
aS'The USA is not a libertarian paradise, although it does have some features that are attractive (constitutionalism, judicial review, enumerated individual rights) these features are prized by the entire political spectrum in the US.'
p8072
aS'Furthermore, there are other features of American democracy that libertarians especially regret: unfettered power of majority, legislation favoring big business over small business, poor monetary policy and banking policy...'
p8073
aS'I am not really sure what the author means when he says that libertarians cannot be called pro-liberty if they oppose increased regulation of the activities of businessmen.'
p8074
aS'We are not in general pro-liberty if that means political liberty (ex: right to vote) except as a means to an end.'
p8075
aS"The end libertarianism pursues is individual liberty - the freedom to choose one's own activities and life without government interference."
p8076
aS'There are necessary and wise limits to this liberty, most obviously the prohibition on violence, effected through the criminal code, police, and penal system.'
p8077
aS'Nonetheless, the goal of a libertarian is to increase as much as possible this personal freedom, this private sphere of individual self-determination.'
p8078
aS'So much as is possible, both the richest and poorest should have freedom to determine the course of their own lives.'
p8079
aS'A few objections might be made here, the most common of which is that the extreme poor lack the power to determine their lives due to their economic condition.'
p8080
aS'In the most severe cases it may be appropriate for the government to provide for them on an emergency basis (temporarily, and based on need).'
p8081
aS'A second reply is that not all good things are automatically/necessarily the province of government - the extreme desirability of increased opportunity or care for the poor does not imply that it is government which should provide this care.'
p8082
aS'Income redistribution as a stated goal is difficult for me to accept.'
p8083
aS'Relief in times of personal emergency has a naturally limited character to it, while income redistribution will tend to cease its own operation only upon reaching total equality of all persons in material condition.'
p8084
aS'This equality depends on government control (preventing the immediate and drastic de-equalization as people make different choices with different results for their material well-being).'
p8085
aS'This is obviously a situation of drastically reduced liberty, and one which I believe no one is arguing in favor of.'
p8086
aS'(including Obama, the Left, the Clintons, etc)\n\nSo, instead, what is the solution (to the problem of rare but extreme poverty)?'
p8087
aS'Unfortunately it will take some time and require restraint on the part of government.'
p8088
aS'These are not features which are popular in policy, but are often wise.'
p8089
aS'Largely the task is to allow the poor and middle class to begin to accumulate wealth - if their standard of living is rapidly increasing, there is no case except envy which justifies excessive taxation or restraint of the rich.'
p8090
aS'One obvious move would be to reform US agricultural policies, and stop holding wheat, milk, and other staple foods at fixed, high prices.'
p8091
aS'This policy essentially robs from the poorest members of society to line the coffers of arbitrarily and randomly selected big business farmers (who otherwise would be forced to compete in offering higher-quality and more nutritious foodstuffs).'
p8092
aS'Another would be to abandon rent controls where they have been adopted - these are well-meaning but have resulted in no end of grief for all involved, including shortage of housing.'
p8093
aS'Another obvious policy move would be to reform taxation, ending many of the tax loopholes that interfere with decision-making and overall raise the tax burden of the poor and middle class.'
p8094
aS'Of course, there is a case to be made for direct emergency provision, but whether the government ought to provide this or a competent national charity, does not seem to be an already-decided issue.'
p8095
aS'The historical pattern of many charities (most religious, unfortunately) providing for their own community has its own allure, but also its own drawbacks which I will not go into here.'
p8096
aS'&gt; I am not really sure what the author means when he says that libertarians cannot be called pro-liberty if they oppose increased regulation of the activities of businessmen.'
p8097

aS"That's kind of the thrust of the article."
p8100
aS"That you don't, can't or won't understand."
p8101
aS"But I'll restate it, because I was once a Libertarian and I'd still consider myself a champion of individual rights."
p8102
aS"But you see, I don't think it's an expression of liberty to reject ONE set of shackles upon my freedom in favor of a different and actually much heavier set."
p8103
aS"It actually matters very LITTLE to me whom I'm being oppressed and exploited by, or even who benefits."
p8104
aS'Some vague collective good, some faceless plutocrat, whether you call it a tax or a fee for services; if I don\'t have a choice about it, that ain\'t nothin\' like "freedom.'
p8105
aS'"\n\nAnd you can\'t or won\'t see it, but for the vast majority of people, there are no MEANS - not enough economic liberty - to be actually free.'
p8106
aS"And you cannot, will not, do not admit that's a problem - hell, some of you deny poverty exists at all."
p8107
aS'This is why PZ Meyers is not engaging in a "discussion" about what you consider to be the "issues.'
p8108
aS'" He\'s given up in disgust and in point of fact, the core ideas of Libertarianism were developed from Classical Liberalism.'

aS'Which is what the sane and civilized among us have returned to.'
p8110
aS'We shall retrace our steps in hopes of avoiding the diversions and pitfalls.'
p8111
aS"Because I actually DO support individual liberty, it's now actually possible to implement that, but strangely enough, it's Libertarians and the like that are in the way of doing that."
p8112
aS"I don't much care why any more."
p8113

p8118
aS"&gt; As a libertarian\n\nNo, you're not."
p8119
aS"If you were, you'd be anti-capitalism."
p8120
aS'Libertarianism is, and always has been, anti-capitalist in orientation, precisely because capitalism (and especially *laissez-faire* capitalism) is a fundamentally authoritarian mode of socioeconomic organization.\n'
p8121
aS'Well I oppose the government underwriting the banks and the markets for capital, and believe we would have a vastly different economy if the government treated banks, other businesses, and individuals alike\n\n(Capital-ism being based on markets for capital)'
p8122
aS'Thank you for describing well the position of the Libertarian.'
p8123
aS'it gives us all a framework from which to formulate our arguments against it or to find common ground if there is any.'
p8124
aS'I agree, he makes alot of assumptions in the final paragraph that he attributes to deregulation.'
p8125
aS'I would say agree that they are issues, but I would blame big business lobbying for unfair advantages, which is crony capitalism.'
p8126
aS'We advocate a fair open market for the smaller businesses to have a shot at providing competition and lower prices.'
p8127
aS"That's all well and good but when I hear people like Ron Paul talk about getting rid of the EPA, OSHA, and the FDA I imagine a return to all of the pollution and exploitation of the gilded age."
p8128
aS'Because they can be replaced by more efficient, less corrupt alternatives.'
p8129
aS"We have those organizations theoretically to protect the common man from excessive exploitation, but they don't work as intended, big business gets what they want because they write the campaign checks. "

p8132
aS'Human nature will suddenly change when the free market is allowed to fly unfettered. '

p8136
aS"I've seen a lot of really absurd contrivances proposed as alternatives - much of it reminds me of a return to feudalism."
p8137
aS"I've actually *seen* feudalism proposed with a straight face as a model for minarchist government."
p8138
aS"Since I do believe that it's possible to have a future in which almost everyone has far more practical freedom than now while living in a world that is far less violent and nobody needs to be subject to the whims of any great power - well, the fact is, a LOT of people need to have a fair deal more power and smallish number will have to settle for less - and a handful need to submit to the inevitable."

aS'What ad hominem attack?'
p8150
aS'I said nothing about the person making the argument.'
p8151
aS'I merely made a smartass remark about your claim that our corrupt institutions can be replaced by less corrupt alternatives.'
p8152

p8153
aS"I simply don't believe that such things are realistic, as noble as they may be."

p8155
aS"These people speak as if the government will blink out of existence and be replaced by a 100% libertarian government that won't have to work within the existing framework."
p8156

p8157
aS"That's not to mention the whole mess of problems that none of us can predict that will arise seeing as how there are no serious libertarian models to work off of."
p8158
aS'The fact of the matter still remains - government exists and has for thousands of years in many shapes and forms.'
p8159
aS'While it may not be doing a good job of it now its intent, in our model, is to exist as a voice of the people.'
p8160
aS'The same goes for the regulations that they so often demonize.'

aS'They may not be perfect but they exist, in theory, to protect the population from the destructive nature of the corporation.'

aS'They will, inevitably, prove their own point and sometimes on purpose.'

p8193
aS'The business owner would actually be in a whole lot more trouble in libertarianism than under the current US rules about that kind of stuff.'
p8194
aS'Who defines dumping waste in a river as an aggressive act?'
p8195
aS"Is this just a moral code that I can skirt when it's convenient?"
p8196
aS'Who defines it?'
p8197
aS'The Libertarian government.'
p8198
aS'It is a violation of property rights (and thus an act of aggression) to dump waste in a river.'
p8199
aS"Pollution is something that wouldn't be tolerated in a libertarian society as much as it is in our current one."
p8200
aS'So the owner of the whole river just takes them to court, right?'
p8201
aS"Presumably you wouldn't even have to initially."
p8202
aS'You call the police.'
p8203
aS"What if no other part of the river is another's property, and the pollution does only environmental damage, or the damage only presents itself at another time (say, long after the polluter is gone)?"

p8205
aS'I am not really aware of any pollution that is so self-contained.'

aS'The US owns so many miles off the coast.'
p8523
aS'Also individual people own the property on the beach front.'

p8525
aS"Under the NAP, you can't force them to do something they don't want to do."
p8526
aS'The pollution is just an economic externality. '
p8527
aS'The NAP is about the *initiation* of force.'
p8528
aS'When the company started polluting was when it broke the NAP and therefore the police can step in.'
p8529
aS'That seems to be a difficult concept for some people.'
p8530
aS'The NAP is not a "no aggression ever" policy, but a "no *initiation* of aggression".'
p8531
aS"Maybe people don't grasp it because it doesn't make much sense."
p8532
aS'So, if I have you right, we would have the rule on the book, and when a company violates the rule, we punish them.'
p8533
aS"Isn't that kinda how it works now?"

aS"Isn't that kinda how it works now?"
p8536
aS'Yup.'
p8537
aS"I didn't say it was much different."
p8538
aS'Only that instead of limiting the responsibility for clean-up like we do now, the business would become 100% responsible for the clean-up.'
p8539
aS"No limited liability, no limited corporate responsibility because the federal government would not have the power to infringe on someone's property rights."
p8540

aS'And it was awful.'

p9072
aS'It has even come up with a crowning principle to draw it\'s line in the sand - the "non-aggression" principle.'
p9073
aS'Drawing a line that states violence, in all forms, is unequivocally wrong, is itself a redeeming quality to Libertarian philosophy.'
p9074
aS'And in these 2 simple, possibly simplistic, understanding of Libertarian philosophy, you now have the ability to contend directly with its supporters and come to common understandings.'
p9075
aS'In arguing that Libertarianism would lead to serfdom, you must first make the case for how a serfdom comes about and then demonstrate that these steps are all inline with Libertarian values.'
p9076
aS'This allows you to make the case that Libertarianism has, at the very least, no baked in safeguards against this outcome.'
p9077
aS'If the argument has not been decided in your favor, most likely it is because the supporter of the Libertarian position has moved to saying that a serfdom is not undesirable.'
p9078
aS'At which point, you now have to make the argument that a system of serfs and lords is (A) NOT representative of a system with maximal personal liberty and (B) does not afford the opportunity, within the framework of Libertarian rules, for the growth of personal liberty over time.'
p9079
aS'If you manage to make this argument, you have successfully demonstrated that Libertarianism cannot achieve its stated goals without some reformulation, at the very least.'

aS"I don't think the issue is that people accuse Libertarians of advocating immorality directly."
p9108
aS'The accusation is a bit more subtle (though not much): Libertarians are prescribing a world in which immoral behavior goes unpunished, and as a result, those who are willing to engage in it can achieve an unfair dominance over those who are restrained by virtue.'

p9117
aS'Under the ideals of Libertarianism, any citizen who is damaged can seek redress for those damages in court.'
p9118
aS'In this way, large transgressions, like dumping in a river and causing thousands to fall ill, would likely result in very large suits that would effectively regulate an immoral actor from taking said action or sufficiently and fairly punishing said actor if they carried out the transgression.'

p9303
aS"You're absolutely correct about support for the movement."
p9304
aS'Time is our greatest ally and acting too quickly without a base of support would result in the things you mentioned, if not outright banning of socialist groups due to some association with "terrorism" should protests turn violent.'

p9306
aS'Ultimately the goal is to eradicate the inequalities that have plagued us since the advent of modern capitalism.'
p9307
aS'This could mean using market forces against the bourgeoisie, but this would only succeed with strong governmental oversight.'

aS'The capitalists have more practice, they have more experience, they have more allies, they have greater control of mass media.'
p9316
aS"I just don't see how a revolution could possibly end in any way other than the ruling class co-opting the power vacuum and re-establishing control in a very short period of time."
p9317
aS'It seems to me that the only solution is the enlightenment of society, which happens at individual points of contact.'
p9318
aS'You will always lose to the math if you focus on enlightening one person at a time, which is why you need force multipliers to accelerate growth.'

p9878

p9879
aS'Because that point is not true.'
p9880
aS"The reason for tuition rises is due to declining state contributions to higher education, and besides, the actual cost of college hasn't risen in the last decade; the sticker price has."

aS'&gt; a 30% tax on millionaires who earn $1-$2 million per year\n\nIs this right?'
p9883
aS'30%?'
p9884
aS"That's...utterly fucking ridiculously high."
p9885
aS"That just can't be right."
p9886
aS"That's not high."
p9887
aS"That's really low."
p9888
aS'The current rate is 39% and they pay way lower then that.'
p9889
aS'The top bracket is 39%.'
p9890
aS'The marginal rate on $2mil with absolutely no deductions is only 33%.'
p9891
aS'The way I read it was that it would be a new 30% tax.'
p9892
aS"And no, it's still 39% on ordinary income at that amount."
p9893
aS'The thing is that the ultra-wealthy that have incomes this high typically get most of it from capital gains.'
p9894
aS'Yes, I read what you said.'
p9895
aS"I'm just saying that it's not high at all."
p9896
aS'Why does it matter that they get there income from capital gains, those are taxed at 15%.'
p9897
aS'Lastly it would only be on 1 million of income so that leaves all are billionaires more then safe.'
p9898
aS"People freak out because they really don't understand."
p9899
aS'It used to be 90% and the economy boomed. '
p9900
aS'And we used it to build infrastructure'
p9901
aS'I actually would support substantially higher income tax rates on very high incomes.'
p9902
aS'But only if it goes into the general fund and is used for broad social programs, not if it all is earmarked for one single issue.'
p9903
aS'actually the economy boomed when we lowered it.'
p9904
aS'90% was way to high.'
p9905
aS'The problem now it that when they lowered it the economy boomed so they think if they keep lowering it then the economy will keep growing and that is not true.'
p9906
aS'Ha, we had growth during the 1940s and 1950s with the 90% rates.'
p9907
aS"Reagan's cuts destroyed that"
p9908
aS"Regan didn't cut them from 90%, Kennedy did."
p9909
aS"Regan's tax cuts are my point."
p9910
aS"I'm not sure of the particulars but it probably wouldn't be a tax on the whole 1-2 million, it would be a marginal tax, meaning that only the amount between one and two million would be taxed at that amount."
p9911
aS'Everything below one million would be taxed at normal rates.'
p9912
aS"Yes, that's how taxes work."
p9913
aS"Nobody get's 90% of their income taken away by taxes."
p9914
aS"But they would get 90% taken away *above* a certain threshold (If it was say 3M and you made 4M last year you'd have to pay 90% of 1M or 100k and then taxes on the remaining 3M depending on what bracket(s) that income falls under. "
p9915
aS'Yep.'
p9916
aS"Don't see a problem with that."
p9917
aS'The problem is capital flight.'
p9918
aS'People who make a shitload of money will just find a way to park it off-shore and not use it in the US economy, which is counter productive.'
p9919
aS'I think that problem has been shown [not to be as big a problem](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3556) as the capitalists like to claim.'
p9920
aS"I'm not thinking of actual people leaving a country, but a few insanely wealthy entities parking vast sums of money off-shore to avoid taxation."
p9921
aS"They're doing that already."
p9922
aS"What I'm saying is that the higher income taxes and capital gains taxes become the more cost effective it becomes to create more elaborate tax dodges."
p9923
aS'I\'m not saying higher taxes are "bad.'
p9924
aS'"  It\'s just a fact that taxing large fortunes has become far more challenging than it was in the days of Truman or Eisenhower.'
p9925
aS'I think estate taxes are probably a better avenue to tax large fortunes than income taxes, both from a moral and practical perspective.'
p9926
aS'Nothing is perfect, or completely immune to evasion though.'
p9927
aS'(Edit for punctuation/spelling)'
p9928
aS"I think you're correct although I'm nowhere near educated enough to know what to do about the issue."
p9929
aS"It's too multifaceted to simply be a part of a taxation scheme though, it would also require significant education efforts (show the rich what being poor in America is), a realignment of corporate priorities and focus (toward their communities and employees rather than their shareholders) and probably a bit of magic as well."
p9930
aS'I guess the issue is it\'s basically the government drawing a line and saying "X is too much money".'
p9931
aS'Once you start taxing something at 90% you are disincentivizing anyone to make anything beyond that.'
p9932
aS"You're not gonna work that much harder just to have nearly all of it go to the government."
p9933
aS'So in theory that money would go to other employees or R&amp;D or whatever and ultimately help the economy. '
p9934
aS"You know, I don't think that's the case."
p9935
aS"Perhaps this kind of policy might lower a corporation's profit drive (which wouldn't be a bad thing, especially if that money was funnelled into employee pay and benefits, yeah?"
p9936
aS'), but in terms of the individual, my understanding is that the vast majority of people who make beyond X too much money are doing so through capital gains, meaning that their *money* is making too much money.'
p9937
aS"They aren't earning it, their money is - and I don't think you can put your money in a bank and say, sorry, I don't want that high an interest rate."
p9938
aS'When you set X at a high enough number, say, above a million, you do a pretty good job of excluding most wage earners and instead tax the capitalists (whose capital is just fine, earning money).  '
p9939
aS'Well, keep in mind that these are *marginal* rates.'
p9940
aS"When people talk about, for example, a 50% tax rate on top earners, that doesn't mean 50% of their *entire* income-- just the portion that's over and above a certain threshold."
p9941
aS'As for 30% being ridiculously high...I hate to tell you this, but the current top tax rate (on income over ~$407K) is already 39.6%.'
p9942
aS"There's no bracket/rate above that."
p9943
aS"So, the way it averages out, if you make $500K, you're paying about 31% of your total income, while if you make $2M, you're paying about 37.4%."
p9944
aS"So, I really don't know how this 30% rate on incomes over $1-2M would have actually worked."
p9945
aS'Not surprisingly, the article is pretty short on details.'
p9946
aS'I guess maybe an *extra* 30%, or 69.9% on income over $1M?'
p9947
aS'If that were the case, your $2M earner would pay an extra $300K.'
p9948
aS"I'm not going to debate whether that's fair or not; that extra amount is still about 50x more than I've ever made in a year."
p9949
aS"But, as other commenters have pointed out, it still wouldn't be the highest rate we've ever had in this country, and there's been a pretty direct correlation between lowered top tax rates, and rising inequality."
p9950
aS"The average tax rate on middle-incomes hasn't changed much since about 1965, while the top rate has pretty steadily dropped. \n\n\n\n"
p9951
aS"So, by disincentivizing success, you're helping the economy how?"
p9952
aS'In what way has anyone been disincentivized from being successful?'
p9953
aS'What proof is there?\n'
p9954
aS"I'm not going to forgo an opportunity simply because some of it gets taken for tax."
p9955
aS"It's only logical to pursue an opportunity, so long as the entire amount doesn't get taken."
p9956
aS"It's a bill to set forth a strategic plan to implement single-payer."
p9957
aS'But certainly closer than anyone else has ever got.'
p9958
aS"2017's a good ways off to have time to get it put together."
p9959
aS"Here's the bill if anyone really wants to read it: \nhttp://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2012/bills/Passed/H-202.pdf\n"
p9960
aS"Thanks for this- I've been seeing articles about this crop up recently, but they all link back to that Minpost opinion piece that has no actual citations, and I couldn't find much else out there on the web."
p9961
aS"Looks like it was passed and [signed in 2011](http://vtdigger.org/2011/05/27/shumlin-signs-nations-first-single-payer-bill-into-law/), and that they're now slowly working through all the roadblocks preventing it from being implemented- how to pay for it, federal approval of the use of funds, getting the ACA state exchange set up first, etc ([Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_health_care_reform))."

p9971
aS"That's true, but there are ways to switch to single-payer without raising taxes."

aS"Plus, it's not inconceivable that 2/3rds of voters would approve of doing this by ballot proposition. "

aS'Missouri had a ballot initiative to ban new billboards along highways in 2000.'
