aS'&gt; they are more likely to have been victims of abuse; \n\nDiscrimination against boys and men who are victims of domestic and sexual violence is systematic in the UK.'
p74
aS'For instance, the British Home Secretary recently announced new anti-domestic violence measures that appear to specifically exclude men and boys who are victims, and also appear discriminatory towards LGBT victims "Bullying husbands who shout at their wives could be found guilty of domestic abuse under new crackdown" (daily mail)\n\n&gt; mental health problems are more prevalent in female than male prisoners; \n\nThe male suicide rate in the UK is 3 1/2 times higher than the female rate "There were 4,590 male suicides registered in 2012, compared with 1,391 female, equating to 18.2 per 100,000 men and 5.2 per 100,000 women, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).'

p152
aS"CH teased and belittled muslims and people of all religions, I don't agree with doing deliberately provocative things just to make a point about pissing people off, the same way I don't agree with people burning poppies."
p153
aS"I'm not saying burning poppies should be illegal, and I'm not saying cartoons should be censored, but these are things people found offensive, why would you *want* to deliberately offend people, and offend people (normal muslims living happily in the UK) who are already facing enough problems with people associating horrible things like these attacks with their religion."

aS'I think I come from a rather too privileged position to empathise with people when it comes to offence.'
p160
aS"I'm a WASP, and tend to find that nothing I find in the media really offends me."
p161
aS'I often find the argument that anyone who is getting offended is taking something altogether too seriously, eg I would say that anyone getting offended by poppy burning should appreciate that the poppy is essentially a trivial symbol, and what it represents is far more important, and so the burning of said poppy is pretty much irrelevant.'
p162
aS'I read a really good point made by a staff member at Al Jazeera:\n*If a large enough group of someone is willing to kill you for saying something, then it\xe2\x80\x99s something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization, and when that scenario obtains it isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a liberal civilization any more\xe2\x80\xa6.liberalism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on everyone offending everyone else all the time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to prefer a society where offense for its own sake is limited rather than pervasive.'
p163
aS'But when offenses are policed by murder, that\xe2\x80\x99s when we need more of them, not less, because the murderers cannot be allowed for a single moment to think that their strategy can succeed.'

p597
aS"Although one of the blokes they showed seemed happy enough at the time, it'd be interesting to see if he changes his tune once the novelty wears off and he notices the government is suddenly taking money he's earned off him in taxes rather than giving it to him for nothing."

aS"That's actually the same problem."

aS"Actually you're absolutely right, I judged too quickly and thought the title was poorly worded at first."
p604
aS"I agree with you, cutting benefits further isn't the solution, though I think we do need to focus on better regulation of the existing policies in order to reduce expenditure from people who are exploiting the system (claiming unnecessarily, working cash-in-hand while claiming etc.)."
p605
aS'I was trying to emphasise the significance of the lack of difference between the two figures, which is responsible for the current situation in which the lack of incentive to work has resulted in people becoming complacent to live off benefits rather than actively seek work.'
p606
aS"Something I felt the journalist neglected to mention (while perhaps not something I'd typically expect to read in the Guardian, it remains a valid concern)."
p607
aS'Accepting that further cuts to benefits are no longer an option, encouraging higher wages is the best solution \xe2\x80\x93 as you said \xe2\x80\x93 in order to re-establish that incentive and encourage people back to work.'

p1968
aS"I am glad they are talking about it though--it's time to acknowledge that anti-vacc parents are still a very tiny minority and that herd immunity is all of our responsibility."
p1969
aS'First, I do agree that adult vaccination is important.'
p1970
aS"However, it's important to understand a few things."
p1971
aS'First, anti-vaccination parents aren\'t exactly a "small minority," particularly when you look at the stats by community.'
p1972
aS'Anti-vax parents tend to cluster in certain areas, and because of the way diseases like measles and pertussis spread, these pockets of low vaccination rates are a huge issue.'
p1973
aS'Anti-vax parents will continue to be a serious public health problem even if our overall national vaccination rate remains high.'
p1974
aS'Second, because our vaccination rates in the U.S. have remained high, adult immunizations/boosters were never really considered much outside of some high-risk individuals (e.g., hospital workers, military personnel, etc).'
p1975
aS"For a long time,  it was believed (and I think there was evidence to show this) that as long as vaccination rates among children remained high, adults weren't an issue, even if their immunity from vaccines started to wane."
p1976
aS"In fact, most insurance companies wouldn't even cover adult vaccinations prior to the early 2000s."
p1977
aS"This changed (thankfully) for a variety of reasons, but not that long ago an adult couldn't even get their vaccine boosters covered by insurance if they wanted them."
p1978
aS"Third, you are absolutely right that herd immunity is everyone's responsibility."
p1979
aS'This needs more attention.'
p1980
aS'But people and doctors also need more/better information.'
p1981
aS'For example, most doctors will tell you that the Tdap vaccine (tetanus, diptheria, and acellular pertussis) is good for 7-10 years.'
p1982
aS'The problem is that the pertussis component of the vaccine only lasts 2-3 years.'
p1983
aS"But I've still encountered doctors who didn't know this, or even doctors who were not yet aware of the new CDC guidelines recommending women receive the vaccine during the third-trimester of each pregnancy."
p1984
aS'So the information needs to get out there to people and to physicians as well.'
p1985
aS'I work in public health and the dissemination of this information (or lack thereof) is more of an issue than people realize.'
p1986
aS'There are so many guidelines that are constantly being updated, and implementing them in a timely, efficient fashion is a long-standing issue within health care. '
p1987
aS'If the CDC reports that 90% of US children are vaccinated than non vaxxers ARE a tiny minority--immuno-compromised children are part of the remaining 10% of unvaccinated children.'
p1988
aS'A 90% vaccination rate actually takes us below the threshold as an entire community for preventing the spread of some vaccine-preventable diseases.'
p1989
aS"That's not where we want to be as a nation."
p1990
aS"BUT, as I stated previously, it's not about the NATIONAL vaccination rate, it's about the **vaccination rates within specific communities."
p1991
aS'** There are parts of California, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and other states where vaccination rates are closer to 60-70%.'
p1992
aS'Because of how communicable diseases spread, you really have to look at individual communities/metro areas to understand true risk.'
p1993
aS'You look at the areas where people move around the most in a given day.'
p1994
aS"That's what you have to worry about."
p1995
aS'National rates are secondary.'
p1996
aS'Also, I would argue that 10% is not a "tiny" minority.'

aS'The focus on the forms of resistance taking place in Ferguson is reflective of a shared, cross-class and racialized world-view that accepts the carefully constructed elite view concerning what constitutes illegitimate resistance.'

p4987
aS'Assuming that we as students should be able to attend a school for 4 years and graduate with nothing to pay back is not that different than an individual signing a contract with Verizon for a cellphone, paying less than the cost of the service for the contract term, and being able to keep the phone at the end of the contract without paying for the remaining cost of the service and physical asset.'

p5400

p5401
aS'They had guns drawn as they got out of the car.'
p5402
aS"They force multiplied his ass, they didn't attempt to deescalate the situation at all."
p5403
aS'You can hear in his voice that he knew he was dead.'

aS'That\'s why he shouted "Shoot me"'
p5405
aS'&gt; You can hear in his voice that he knew he was dead.'
p5406
aS'That\'s why he shouted "Shoot me"\n\nHe robbed a store at knife-point, and then hung around for the cops to show up.'
p5407
aS'When they  finally did, he approached them and told them repeatedly to shoot him.'
p5408
aS"When that didn't work, he backed up and tried it again."
p5409
aS'This was *clearly* suicide by cop.'
p5410
aS"That's what he *wanted*."
p5411
aS'Now maybe the officers had other options.'
p5412
aS"I'm very surprised he wasn't tazed."
p5413
aS"But he wasn't scared that they would shoot him."
p5414
aS"That's what he was there for."
p5415
aS'Are you actually suggesting that they do not have their weapons drawn when pulling up on an armed suspect? '
p5416
aS'Is he gonna throw the knife thirty feet at them like a Damn ninja? '
p5417
aS'No, he could charge them and close 15 feet in 2 seconds.'
p5418
aS'Is that not enough?'
p5419
aS"Also, they don't know if he has a firearm either."
p5420
aS'Saying "sir, we see that you are wielding a knife, could you please put it on the ground?'
p5421
aS'" is not controlling the situation.'
p5422
aS'Making him drop the knife and get on the ground at a safe distance is.'
p5423
aS'Anyone who says different is just doing it from the unfair position of knowing all the facts NOW since they have reviewed the video, and also the ignorant viewpoint that cops should be ninjas and disarm the guy, or risking a knife to the neck to try and use a taser.'
p5424
aS'They do not meet lethal force with non lethal force. '
p5425
aS'&gt; cops are trained in hand-to-hand combat for situations such as these\n\nNo they are not.'
p5426
aS'They are not superheroes.'
p5427
aS'It is not their job to try to wrestle a knife away from someone in a situation like this.'
p5428
aS'That is insane to think.\n\n'
p5429
aS'You want to go hand to hand with someone carrying a knife?'
p5430
aS'Good luck dude'
p5431
aS'If they had a taser absolutely, not all cops have them though.'
p5432
aS'So if they did have them, and between the two of them, neither used them.'
p5433
aS"Wouldn't this be something that would upset a community, over time?"
p5434
aS'What will happen to the officers, if and when they are found to have them? '
p5435
aS"&gt; I'm watching rachael maddow, they contacted the department, both officers had tazers.\n\n"
p5436
aS"I would be upset if they had them and didn't use them in that situation, but I'm not going to get upset over a hypothetical."
p5437
aS'The officers are not supposed to meet lethal force with non lethal force.'
p5438
aS'Tasers are not the magic "sleeping dart" like they are in video games.'
p5439
aS'They are great for controlling situations with non lethal force, but had the shot missed, or not worked, the officer would be dead here.'
p5440
aS'That officer could have been more defensive and immediately moved behind the car.'
p5441
aS'One could attempt a taser while the other one had a gun as a backup.'
p5442
aS'Before people say \xe2\x80\x9dhindsight is always 20/20", let\'s remember that these are meant to be trained professionals.'
p5443
aS'Many police forces in the world use no guns at all.'
p5444
aS"This shows that our police forces (in many cases) aren't worried about the non-lethal option."
p5445
aS"That's a serious problem."
p5446
aS'They are trained, but they are also not Batman.'
p5447
aS'Remember that.'
p5448
aS'They are not action movie stars, they are Police Officers dealing with an enraged, erratic criminal holding a knife and walking aggressively towards them.'
p5449
aS'They waited until he got one second from stabbing range.'
p5450
aS'This incident left absolutely no room for putting their guns away and talking calmly with the guy.'
p5451
aS"They didn't know if he was on drugs."
p5452
aS"They didn't know if he had a gun in his pocket."
p5453
aS'One cop gets within range to use a taser, then the shot misfires, or hits his clothes, or misses altogether, then what?'
p5454
aS"He is within stabbing range, and the other officer doesn't have a clear shot."
p5455
aS'Now you have one officer stabbed to death, and a suspect shot to death, and for what?'
p5456
aS'Because the man armed with a deadly weapon screaming SHOOT ME SHOOT ME and trying to kill cops *maybe* deserved to be tried?'
p5457
aS"It's absurd."
p5458
aS'It\'s almost as if people would only be satisfied if the cop waited the the blade to slip into his ribcage before finally saying "okay, we\'re gonna have to shoot him now".'
p5459
aS'TIL all UK cops are Batman.'
p5460
aS'We are a rarity in the civilized world to have cops with guns.'
p5461
aS'All of the others deal with knifes too.'
p5462
aS'These guys just took the easy way out.'
p5463
aS'Kill him and be done with it.'
p5464
aS'I expect better from our police.'
p5465
aS'I expect better from our citizens, actually.'
p5466
aS'I expect better than us to assume a cop should wait until he has been stabbed or shot before finally taking lethal force against a very clearly lethally dangerous individual.'
p5467
aS'If deadly force is EVER necessary, can you tell me when?'
p5468
aS'Well of starters, when they have a gun.'
p5469
aS'With respect for life and the constitution, a cop will find themselves in many situations that call for a hero.'
p5470
aS"If they don't want to do it, we can find someone who will. "
p5471
aS'They should.'
p5472
aS'The US crime code states that the minimum amount of force needed should be used in situations.'
p5473
aS'Sadly the determining factor is a cop hyped on adrenaline.'
p5474
aS'Maybe they need more risk management training or something.'
p5475
aS'This seemed a bit premature, you know, killing over soda.'
p5476
aS'Hyped on adrenaline.'
p5477
aS'Person closing in on me carrying a knife shouting at the top of his lungs to shoot him.'
p5478
aS'Clearly crazy.'
p5479
aS'Clearly would take my life if he wants to take his own.'
p5480
aS'Save myself.'
p5481
aS'I have a family.'
p5482
aS'yep.'
p5483
aS'That\'s all "big hyped up trigger happy idiot cop right"\n\n'
p5484
aS'I don\'t see how you got there from "hyped on adrenaline".'
p5485
aS"Adrenaline quickens your reaction before your body/brain actually realizes what you're doing."
p5486
aS'That\'s where training overtakes analytical thinking; fight or flight becomes the base reaction, and training for a law enforcement officer is to essentially neutralize a threat, thus "save myself" isn\'t even really a consideration--it is simply a matter of reacting in the manner you were trained.'
p5487
aS'Is the officer responsible for his reaction in such a situation?'
p5488
aS"I don't think so."
p5489
aS'I blame the training, or lack thereof.'
p5490
aS"If law enforcement officers are trained for non-lethal take-downs in lethal situations then that's exactly what they'll do when it's time to take action..."
p5491
aS'Unless the situation skews into unfamiliar territory, wherein a split-second judgement call takes priority, but is still likely to be based on said training.'
p5492
aS'This is why officers that are trained to use non lethal (tazer and OC spray) have to have the item used on them.'
p5493
aS'So they can have an understanding of the pain, what it can do you to you, etc.'
p5494
aS"Coming from a person ( me) that was trained in law enforcement on the military (I'm an engineer now) pepper spray disperses people on groups better than it lays down one person."
p5495
aS'Specially if said person is aggressive.'
p5496
aS'My training Involved me having to be sprayed ; defend against and attacker and handcuff the person after drawing my weapon.'
p5497
aS'All the spray did to me was make me angry and more aggressive.'
p5498
aS'It burnt yes; but the adrenaline from being sprayed knocks out the pain until it is over it.'
p5499
aS'I short.'
p5500
aS'Pepper spraying an attacking suspect carrying a knife is the worst option in the world.'
p5501
aS'Also; I would like you to try shooing a non lethal shot into a person as they charge you carrying a knife at close range.'
p5502
aS"It isn't going to happen."
p5503
aS'People are already mad at how much we spend on police.'
p5504
aS'You want them shooting at the range every week ?'
p5505
aS'With more advanced shooting ranges ?'
p5506
aS"That's costly.\n"
p5507
aS'&gt; This seemed a bit premature, you know, killing over soda.'
p5508
aS'Justified or not, it was **not** over soda.'
p5509
aS'It was over an armed, unstable suspect approaching cops.'
p5510
aS'Whether or not it was an over-reaction, or if they had other options, it was **not** about the soda.'
p5511
aS"I think we're seeing the results of how poorly-trained these cops are. "
p5512
aS'The minimum amount of force changes when a lethal weapon is brandished.'
p5513
aS'Wrong incident.'
p5514
aS'I know it is confusing, but that was a different black man killed by white cops in St. Louis recently.  '
p5515
aS'And we wonder why people are rioting?'
p5516
aS'No one is rioting over this shooting.'
p5517
aS'As morbid as this sounds, this was a different black man that was killed by St. Louis police this week.  '
p5518
aS'Not referring to this one specifically, just the rioting in general. '
p5519
aS"Given the state of the world today, he should've known there would be consequences for joking about guns on social media, especially as a student."
p5520
aS"I don't really see the police at fault, although detaining him might've been a bit much. "
p5521
aS'I disagree.'
p5522
aS'It was blatantly in reference to a "dinosaur" and there were no threats made to the school or a specific neighbor.'
p5523
aS'So what, it\'s illegal to SAY "gun" for anyone under the elligible age to own a gun now?'
p5524
aS'Nah, the US are quickly becoming a militarized state.'
p5525
aS"It's bullshit and fear mongering and unfortunately the US is the best there is at brainwashing you into thinking this is the norm or even a privilege at that."
p5526
aS"People are all 'murica this and 'murica that like it's something to be proud of these days, but frankly it's not."
p5527
aS'The healthcare system is a government scam, there\'s no free education, taxes go to a military to play world police, we\'re lacking in any kind of updated mass transit system in 90% of the cities, we have ex-military drones being used by the police to watch US citizens, every means of communication is tracked by one agency or another, it\'s the only god damn nation in the world still using "standard" measurements, Fahrenheit, and a 12 hour time system (AM/PM), people blow hundreds of dollars just to fly around the US and avoid our airports because of how insane we are to non-US citizens and the media has become a sensational super biased joke.'
p5528

p5530
aS"The police knew about it, so there would be this whole thing about how the police didn't do enough."
p5531
aS'They take EVERY gun threat seriously, and they should.'

p5654
aS'Was the body moved?'
p5655
aS"If it wasn't, his body position disproves his hands being up to surrender and proves his hands were in a downed, charging position."

p5657
aS'Look at his leg positions.'
p5658
aS'One is straight out and the other is curved at the knee, as if he was in a running stance....'
p5659

p5678

aS'I agree.'

p5683
aS'I agree, but I think posting this information gets people talking about it and anyone can see the image and make their own conclusion.'
p5684
aS'Why was it necessary to shoot in first place, even if this supposed struggle did happen, if the suspect was unarmed?'
p5685
aS'I understood that police carry a baton, pepper spray, and a taser why is it they always just say screw that shit and pull the gun?'
p5686
aS'Because not all police departments, especially smaller ones, issue batons, pepper spray or tasers.'
p5687
aS'The chances of them ever needing those items is usually as likely as ever having to fire their weapon.'
p5688
aS'I however do not know if that was the case with the Ferguson PD.'
p5689
aS'And if the officers story is to be believed, Brown assaulted him before he was shot, which most training teaches you to pull your gun and fire, not use a less than lethal option.'
p5690
aS"Also there's speculation that Mr Brown went for the officers weapon, which I would see as justifiably use of force"
p5691
aS'Have you read the reports coming in, in favor of the officer?'
p5692
aS'IF those are correct, Michael tried assaulting the officer, not once, but twice.'
p5693
aS"We want our officers to show restraint, and if these new reports are true, we have exactly that:  the officer didn't start shooting until Michael started charging a 2nd time, which is more than ample restraint. "
p5694
aS"Yeah it would seem so now and I don't believe wholly the story being given from Michael's accomplice that the cop was lashing out at Michael from his car window."
p5695
aS'However I\'m still upset that given a breadth of "non-leathal" options that there continues to be numerous cases per year of police using firearms against unarmed suspects, and apparently I\'m not the only one:\n\n[op ed on reuters by former KC police chief](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2014/08/19/as-police-chief-i-knew-we-had-no-justifaction-for-killing-an-unarmed-suspect/)\n\nBut I\'m inclined to agree that in this case it is nowhere near as cut and dry as the example in the reuters piece, and yes if it ends up being the case that Michael did double back then I can see a more excusable use of force than was initially reported.'

aS'Of course he panicked.'
p5717
aS'Now, did the officer shoot this "kid" (sorry dude, at that size you are a man) while the kid was on his knees with his hands up, or was it actually during the struggle?'

p5727

p5728
aS"~~Furthermore I've only seen info that he was suspect in the crime but nothing saying that he was guilty, if that was the case it would be prudent for the police to produce some evidence to support that.~~\n\nEdit: The second article posted in the comments contains exactly what I was wondering, where was the evidence from the robbery."
p5729
aS"The police say the shooting happened because the officer's life was being threatened."
p5730
aS"Now that we know this guy was a violent criminal (violent from the video of his grabbing the clerk by the throat and throwing him against the shelf), it is very easy to believe the police's story that the guy attacked and threatened the police officer."
p5731
aS'Now, if they can prove with objective evidence that the guy was not actively attacking the police officer when he was shot, then they could convict him of murder.'
p5732
aS'But until that happens, the story the police gave is much more likely and the officer is innocent until proven guilty.'
p5733
aS'Thanks for the actual reply instead of just down voting.'
p5734
aS'It will be interesting to see what happens now that the autopsy has been released and sounds like it supports the eye witness testimony.'
p5735
aS"I can see the cops point of view if he was assaulted by this kid, but at the same time isnt' there a reason a cop carries a baton, pepper spray, and a taser as well as their gun."
p5736
aS"If I read correctly the cop is saying that Michael was in his vehicle struggling for the cop's weapon, that just doesn't make any sense to me why would someone do that."
p5737
aS"Even if trying to play tough in front of others, that scenario just doesn't make any sense."
p5738
aS'Now that the autopsy has been released though and it sounds like it shows that Michael was gunned down while surrendering, it will be interesting to see what comes of this.'
p5739
aS"I also don't think that the autopsy by itself disproves the cop's story but it still doesn't make sense to me that even if the cop was struggling with this guy if he was unarmed why was it necessary to shoot him."
p5740
aS"&gt;If I read correctly the cop is saying that Michael was in his vehicle struggling for the cop's weapon, that just doesn't make any sense to me why would someone do that."
p5741
aS"Well, it doesn't make sense to *me* why someone would go into a convenience store, steal a box of cigars on camera, manhandle the clerk and throw him up against the wall, knowing all of this is being recorded and his face is all over the video."
p5742
aS"I can't imagine someone being so stupid as to do *that*."
p5743
aS'And yet he did just that.'
p5744
aS"&gt;Even if trying to play tough in front of others, that scenario just doesn't make any sense."
p5745
aS'But think about the other scenario.'
p5746
aS'People are saying the kid was standing there with his hands up in surrender, and the cop just murdered him in cold blood.'
p5747
aS"The guy has no criminal record, no record of misconduct as an officer, he's been serving the police force and serving his community for 6 years."
p5748
aS"You really think this guy would just up and decide one day, out of the blue, to pull out his gun and *execute* an innocent teenager, who's standing there in surrender, for no reason?"
p5749
aS'That is an absolutely extraordinary accusation, and one that I find very difficult to believe.'
p5750
aS'I find it much easier to believe that the kid was being violent and attacking the officer, considering he has just finished being violent and robbing a convenience store.'
p5751
aS'That being said, obviously they should rely on evidence and proof before making any accusations.'
p5752
aS"Objective evidence takes priority over any and all testimony or character analysis, and I'm confident they will do the right thing. \n"

aS'The facts?'

aS'I assume he was playing with it, pointing it at kids around the area, maybe miming gunshots as one might do when playing.'
p5885
aS'Another customer--a former marine--calls the police.'
p5886
aS'Crawford gets a call from his mother, and while they\'re on the phone, the cops arrive and order him to put down the weapon and such, then she hears Crawford say "It\'s not real," and then the cops shot Crawford and told him to "Get on the ground.'
p5887
aS'" His mother, still on the phone, hears his screaming and crying.'
p5888
aS'I assume Crawford dies at the scene.'
p5889
aS'I think this can be filed under trigger-happy.'
p5890
aS"I'm sure the cops were nervous and frightened for their lives and such, but being a police officer means you are willingly putting yourself in a dangerous situation, in which you may very well be shot or injured."
p5891
aS'As such, a police officer should not resort to violent measures BEFORE violence presents itself.'
p5892
aS'The potential and intent for violence is not enough to justify violent, preemptive action.'
p5893
aS'Any officer not capable of abiding by this should not be allowed anything other than a taser.'
p5894
aS"They *should* be trained to deal with it, but the fact is they aren't."
p5895
aS"I don't blame officers if they make actual mistakes if the system they work for didn't prepare them for it."
p5896
aS"I'll blame the hell out of the system, though."
p5897
aS'You think that the officers did not make a mistake?'
p5898
aS'That is just so wrong. '
p5899
aS'I think that?'
p5900
aS"I wasn't aware."
p5901
aS'Thank you so much for telling me what I think.'
p5902
aS'So you do think that the officers were mistaken.'
p5903
aS"You just don't blame them for those mistakes."
p5904
aS'Glad that we got that cleared up.'
p5905
aS'Your position seems illogical, though.'
p5906
aS'It does not take any special training to not shoot a person, not take a genius or any bravery to not kill a man for doing nothing wrong.'
p5907
aS'I am confident that every police officer in the US is instructed not to shoot a person unless that person is an obvious threat that cannot be dealt with any other way - police training 101.'
p5908
aS"Why would you blame anyone but the officers for the officers' mistake?"
p5909
aS"When you fear for your life, and you aren't prepared."
p5910
aS"you aren't going to be logical."
p5911
aS"You don't know how you will act until the time comes."
p5912
aS"Most of the time for cops in America, it either doesn't come of comes when there is a legitimate threat and clear target."
p5913
aS"But when your life is on the line more things start to look like targets because, guess what, you don't want to die and you panic."
p5914
aS"Long story short, instruction doesn't matter as much in practice."
p5915
aS"Some people aren't cut out for danger, it doesn't matter what they are told beforehand."
p5916
aS'There was zero danger...... As stated above, the cops were obviously trigger-happy and should never have been allowed to be cops in the first place.'
p5917
aS'So lots of blame to go around, but most of all to the crazy fearful police who shot an unarmed man for no reason.'
p5918
aS'No shots fired, no-one hurt, no-one acting erratically even though the man obviously had the pellet-gun for at least several minutes.'
p5919
aS'I mean, the guy was on his cell-phone so his fingers were obviously not on the trigger.'
p5920
aS'The cops were wrong and they should not only be blamed, they should be put in prison for murder. '
p5921
aS'*manslaughter'
p5922
aS"There doesn't need to be danger, the people involved need to *think* there was danger."
p5923
aS"That's what training should help."
p5924
aS'Prepare people to think under stress instead of just acting.'
p5925
aS'Yes, but...... what sane person would think that that man was dangerous?'
p5926
aS'A man in a store for what, 15 minutes or more?, talking on his cell-phone, holding a pellet-gun, no blood, no-one running around screaming?'
p5927
aS'It makes no sense.'
p5928
aS'The cops fucked-up.'
p5929
aS'End of story.'
p5930
aS'What version of this did you read?'
p5931
aS'&gt; customer called 911 to report 22-year-old John Crawford waving what appeared to be an AR-15 at children and others at the Beavercreek retailer.'
p5932
aS'&gt; \xe2\x80\x9cThe officers gave verbal commands to the subject to drop the weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d Evers said in a statement.'
p5933
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cThe subject \xe2\x80\xa6 was shot after failing to comply with the officers\xe2\x80\x99 commands.'
p5934
aS'Someone calls and says a guy with is waving an AR, what are people responding going to expect?'
p5935
aS'They are going to expect what they are told and that will be exacerbated by their fear.'
p5936
aS"A guy waving around a gun isn't what I would call totally out of the ordinary."
p5937
aS'And what does a phone have to do with anything?'
p5938
aS'You can shoot with one arm.'
p5939
aS"Yeah, they fucked up, I'm pretty sure I said that more or less, actually."
p5940
aS"But you aren't allowed to judge unless you are in their shoes or on the jury."
p5941
aS'I can and do judge those ill-trained trigger-happy cops.'
p5942
aS'Who gives a shit who called about what?'
p5943
aS'If cops bust into your home, shoot your child holding a pellet-gun, and then respond "well we got a phone call that your child had an assault rifle" would you not judge them as incompetent fools?'
p5944
aS'Whether it happened in Wal-mart or in your home, those cops should go to jail.'
p5945
aS'If you want to also prosecute the local police department then that is all good with me.'
p5946
aS"If someone called and said an *adult* was and it wasn't in that adults home, I wouldn't too much."
p5947
aS"I don't know why you came up with that other situation, since it is completely different."
p5948
aS'You can wave a gun around all you want in your own home, not in public.'
p5949
aS'A call about an adult is taken more seriously than a kid.'
p5950
aS'Try your sensationalized bullshit somewhere else.'
p5951
aS"And I don't know where you are getting this idea that I think they were competent."
p5952
aS'Personally, in my view of the world, about 75% of people are *completely incompetent* under legitimate stress.'
p5953
aS"It's not the person's fault."
p5954
aS"It is the fault of whoever allows them to be in that situation, especially if they don't prepare them."
p5955
aS'So either cops need better training, or we are going to have a ton of incompetent ones.'
p5956
aS'Unfortunately, good training would probably see opposition by people saying they are being "militarized".'
p5957
aS'And in a sense they would be right.'
p5958
aS'It would also cost a fuckton of money, so good luck with that too.'
p5959
aS'My point was sensational but just to show the irrelevance of someone calling and reporting something that the cops would take immediate and lethal action because of.'
p5960
aS'Again, who gives a shit who called about what?'
p5961
aS'I could call on you.....\n\nMy thought is that we are arguing whether the cops were mistaken, whether they were at fault.'
p5962
aS'I think so.'
p5963
aS'You seemed to say that it was not their fault, that it was their lack of training so you blame the system (that is what you posted).'
p5964
aS'So to be clear, while I also blame the system, I blame the stupid-ass cops who could not see that a man was playing with a non-lethal toy gun, talking on a phone, no harm had occurred or was happening, and they still shot the man fatally.'
p5965
aS'You seem to want to defend the cops involved and blame their instructors.'
p5966
aS"I don't understand that."
p5967
aS'Even you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.'
p5968
aS"It's irrelevant until you are told someone is very dangerous and *you* are the one who has to deal with them."
p5969
aS"Then it's pretty relevant."
p5970
aS'What do you think went down?'
p5971
aS'They walk calmly up to him, say "can you please put that down" and shoot him?'
p5972
aS'Think about it.'
p5973
aS'They ran up, screamed "drop it", he didn\'t and shot him.'
p5974
aS'It probably took 3 seconds.'
p5975
aS"You don't take your time when you think you can die, trust me on that."
p5976
aS'&gt; Even you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.'
p5977
aS'Bull-fucking-shit.'
p5978
aS'You have no idea how you would act, and pretending you do is terrible.'
p5979
aS"You've never had your life threatened, you've never thought your actions in the next 3 seconds would determine the course of your life, your family's lives, many bystander's lives and their families."
p5980
aS'As soon as you think someone is seconds away from killing you and many others, you can have an opinion.'
p5981
aS'Until then you should probably leave it to people with more experience.'
p5982
aS'They probably thought they would be able to easily distinguish a threat and act accordingly as well.'
p5983
aS'And they had as much reason to believe that as you do now.'
p5984
aS'How does that make you feel?'
p5985
aS'Confident?'
p5986
aS'Less so?'
p5987
aS'You keep saying "if they think the situation is life-threatening" but it wasn\'t.'
p5988
aS"It wasn't even close."
p5989
aS'It would not even seem so to any reasonable person.'
p5990
aS'This is where we disagree.'
p5991
aS'Again, if I called the cops and said that you, a man in a park, was brandishing a weapon, would you think it justified if the cops came and gunned you down like an animal?'
p5992
aS'And again, it makes no sense to defend these cops.'
p5993
aS'They were wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.'
p5994
aS'Just admit it.'
p5995
aS'Say "the police fucked up.'
p5996
aS'" That is all I want and my request is reasonable.'
p5997
aS'But you keep defending them.'
p5998
aS'You ever hear the phrase "hindsight is 20-20"?'
p5999
aS"It doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what you *think* they are."
p6000
aS'&gt; Just admit it.'
p6001
aS'Say "the police fucked up.'
p6002
aS'"\n\nI think if you back up a couple comments you will find just where I said that.'
p6003
aS"But I'm guessing you probably didn't read all of what I've said."
p6004
aS'That would probably be why you brought up that "not life threatening" point again when I already explained that.'
p6005
aS"If that hypothetical guy in your story didn't drop the weapon, and it wasn't clearly fake, yes they would be justified in shooting him."
p6006
aS'Adding the "like an animal" thing is more sensationalist bullshit just to stir people up.'
p6007
aS"Please don't spread that and stick to clear facts."
p6008
aS"You're beginning to sound like a major news network."
p6009
aS'You can be wrong but not totally liable for it.'
p6010
aS'Recently a plane had to make a landing on a beach near me and killed a father and little girl.'
p6011
aS"He was wrong but I don't blame him."
p6012
aS"A court might and I'll have to respect whatever they say(since they would know more of the facts), but until then I'm not going to let hate fly."
p6013
aS"It's pretty nice being moderate in life until you know all the facts."
p6014
aS'You should try it out.'
p6015
aS"It's calming."
p6016
aS'You are the one who seems to be stretching the bounds of reason.'
p6017
aS'Think about the situation.'
p6018
aS'A man called and reported possible trouble, 10 minutes later the cops arrive, they see that no-one is hurt, a man is talking on his cell-phone not shooting people.'
p6019
aS'Think about that for a minute and then tell me where the police were justified in shooting him.'
p6020
aS"Again I ask you to put yourself in the victim's place."
p6021
aS'Who gives a shit who called on whom?'
p6022
aS'I could call about the mayor right now - would you think it appropriate for the cops to bust into City Hall and shoot him?'
p6023
aS'If the police were not justified then they are guilty of acting inappropriately and should be punished.'
p6024
aS'They did not "accidentally" shoot him, they had time to assess the situation and without reason shot the man.'
p6025
aS'Hindsight, foresight, clear sight - it is all the same.'
p6026
aS'Where are you getting your insight into what happened?'
p6027
aS"You seem to know pretty well, but that article wasn't exactly long and detailed."
p6028
aS"If the mayor was waving around what people thought was a gun and someone called it in, then the police arrive and he doesn't put it down I would hope they wouldn't let the fact that he is the mayor stop them from doing what they think they should."
p6029
aS"Why aren't you mad at the person who called it in?"
p6030
aS"If someone tells me I might be shot I'm going to take their word for it and act with caution."
p6031
aS'I think that the marine who called it in is a moron and should have known better but also think that he was justified in reporting what he thought was a criminal and dangerous situation.'
p6032
aS'I do not think that the police were justified in shooting the man because of that call or by anything that the man could possibly have done.'
p6033
aS'You tell me if you think otherwise.'
p6034
aS'What could this victim possibly have been doing, what could have the cops seen, what scenario was unfolding, that would justify shooting him?'
p6035
aS'Again, there had to be at least a few minutes between the call and the arrival of the cops.'
p6036
aS'They saw no bullets fired, no blood, no screaming people...... just a guy with a (pellet-)gun talking on a cell-phone.'
p6037
aS'Should the cops have arrived because of the call?'
p6038
aS'Sure.'
p6039
aS'Acted cautiously?'
p6040
aS'Of course!'
p6041
aS'Shot the man?'
p6042
aS'NO!'
p6043
aS"You're problem is that they acted irrationally?"
p6044
aS'Great.'
p6045
aS'Now go put your life in perceived risk and see if you act rationally.'
p6046
aS'What could he have been doing?'
p6047
aS"Well, I'm assuming standing there holding what looked like a gun and not dropping it when told."
p6048
aS"There isn't much you can do between the time someone aims and they fire."
p6049
aS"It doesn't matter what they saw, it matters what they perceived, and they perceived a threat according to the official story."
p6050
aS'You want to know the thought process of someone who expects to be shot?'
p6051
aS"Here it is, it's pretty simple."
p6052
aS'"Oh shit, looks like gun!'
p6053
aS'" *pull trigger*.'
p6054
aS'No thinking involved.'
p6055
aS"Even people trained for combat don't think in the moment."
p6056
aS'You act on instinct.'
p6057
aS"Thinking comes later, you don't have time for that now."
p6058
aS"You know another reason why I'm not judging harshly?"
p6059
aS"Because I know I don't know the facts."
p6060
aS'What time did this occur?'
p6061
aS'Was the store crowded?'
p6062
aS'Was is business as usual?'
p6063
aS"I'd like to think it wasn't crowded at the time."
p6064
aS'Most cases of "guy with gun" don\'t involve blood and casings everywhere, actually.'
p6065
aS'People run and people suck at shooting.'
p6066
aS'If I was arriving I would think that, unless it was crowded, people ran away and stayed away and the guy was hold up inside.'
p6067
aS'Did the guy who called tell the employees?'
p6068
aS'Did he tell other people?'
p6069
aS'Did people leave while completely avoiding the victim thinking there was a problem?'
p6070
aS'I would.'
p6071
aS'And what makes you think nobody else thought there was a problem?'
p6072
aS"If these guys walked in and there were dozens of shoppers going about their business that's one thing."
p6073
aS'But I have no reason to believe that is true any more than I have reason to believe the alternative.'
p6074
aS'And you keep bringing up the cell phone like it makes him look less threatening or something.'
p6075
aS'Why?'
p6076
aS'If they shot him after seeing all the evidence you are assuming was there, they did it because they wanted to kill someone.'
p6077
aS'Nobody is as dumb as you are thinking these guys are.'
p6078
aS'They either acted out of fear or malice.'
p6079
aS"And you shouldn't punish someone acting out of fear and you can't determine malice without an investigation in this country."
p6080
aS"You could get these guys for manslaughter, now that I think of it, but I'm not on the jury so it doesn't matter what I think."
p6081
aS'Many minutes in between report and police arrival.'
p6082
aS'Store was not in chaos, no blood or screaming.'
p6083
aS'If the man had a cellphone then only one hand was holding a rifle.'
p6084
aS'I agree that the cops acted out of fear - that was wrong.'
p6085
aS'I stand by my assertion that the cops made a mistake and are guilty of manslaughter.'
p6086
aS'Where are you getting that information?'
p6087
aS'And in what world can you not operate a rifle with one hand?'
p6088
aS"I mean, it wasn't bolt action."

p6095
aS"Very true, but I believe one is a crime and the other isn't."

p6097

p6319
aS'Just recently, a plague of flies was so thick in the upper Mississippi River valley that it showed up on radar\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nThe mayflies were detectable on radar around 845 pm and reports in the towns and cities began rolling in of the swarming and piles of mayflies.'
p6320
aS'Numerous videos and pictures were circulating on social media, some of which are posted below as well.'
p6321
aS'The radar detected the flies about 845 pm, emanating from the river (the source) with echo values similar to that of light-moderate rain (35-40 dBZ).'
p6322
aS'With a general south-to-north wind flow above the surface, the mayflies quickly moved north once in the air.'
p6323
aS'As the flies dispersed moving north-northeast, they also gained altitude with some of the echo being detected as far north as Black River Falls and as high as 2500 feet above ground.'
p6324
aS'By late evening, mayflies were swarming in La Crosse, La Crescent, Stoddard and points up and down the river.'
