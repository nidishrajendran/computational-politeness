VJust saw this on the Guardian, scary stuff
p5
aVJust out of curiosity, what would prevent a concerned citizen from setting up surveilance on this site and reporting on every single entrance and exit from the facility?
p6
aVIt's open to the public, you have to go there to claim recovered property.
p7
aVThis article is terrible.
p8
aVOf course it can't, it's damning to the defense.
p9
aVThere was a time when cops accepted the fact that they had a responsibility to put their lives on the line to uphold justice and rights for the people.
p10
aVThere was a time when the police were respected for that.
p11
aVPolice were a different class; they accepted that their lives were forfeit to the cause of service and protection, and many of them died in that pursuit.
p12
aVNow there doesn't seem to be any sense of nobility.
p13
aVCops aren't proud patriots anymore.
p14
aVThey don't do their job because they know it is necessary and want to put their very lives behind American values.
p15
aVThey don't do their jobs because of a sense of moral duty.
p16
aVThey do it because its a job you can get without any skills, special qualities, or strong moral compass.
p17
aVSmart people, with critical thinking skills, worldly knowledge, strong moral convictions and the willingness to put their lives on the line for justice are excluded from the police force for the most part.
p18
aVIf you are not prepared to take a bullet for truth and justice, then you have no business being a police officer.
p19
aVIf you are willing to kill an unarmed, negligibly-dangerous person, you have no business being a police officer.
p20
aVThose cops know that they murdered that guy, and they know that he posed no threat to their lives, or any meaningful threat to their persons at all.
p21
aVThose cops are despicable, and they should all be criminally prosecuted, and they know that they are guilty.
p22
aVedit: Thanks for the gold, stranger.
p23
aVI was just venting my frustrations here.
p24
aVI obviously don't have the evidence, and am just reacting to what seems like convincing video.
p25
aVI'm very pleased that my thoughts resonate with many Redditors.
p26
aVI really believe in the power that Reddit has as a tool for disseminating ideas, and providing the opportunity for discussion.
p27
aVIf I had posted this in a more popular subreddit, I might have been downvoted for "sitting on my high horse," but I'm glad that some Redditors recognize the honesty in "fancy worded walls of text.
p28
aV" I'm no paragon of social justice or activism, and I'm no revolutionary thinker.
p29
aVI'm just an American who believes in the foundations of my country.
p30
aVWhen I see people tearing down those foundations, I feel like the only thing I can really do to manifest change is to talk about it.
p31
aVSome people don't want to hear it, or tell me to get off my computer and do something, but I think that I'm at least doing my part to speak out, and hopefully my words can reach someone who will benefit from them in some way (this is a better venue for speech than a sandwich-board on a street corner, after all).
p32
aVI'm also really glad that redditors find my input valuable enough to support Reddit with gold.
p33
aVThough it is relatively insignificant, I am proud to be a part of the gears that keep Reddit turning.
p34
aVThanks again, and keep on Gilding!
p35
aVCheers,\u000a\u000aOakenbones
p36
aVYou have an excellent way with words, sir.
p37
aVThank you.
p38
aV"You're Honor, I object!
p39
aV"\u000a"On what grounds?
p40
aV"\u000a"It is incredibly damaging to my defense.
p41
aV"\u000a\u000a-Couldn't find the gif so I figured I would act it out.
p42
aVThis needs to get to the top.
p43
aVThey straight up **murdered** that kid.
p44
aVRight at the end it looks like he is begging them.
p45
aVHe looked like he was about to throw another rock at them to me.
p46
aV/S ?
p47
aVNot at all.
p48
aVHe looks like he has something in his right hand and is bringing it up to draw back and pitch it at them.
p49
aVI'm not saying that's what happened.
p50
aVThat's just what it looks like to me.
p51
aVHe at no point drew back in a way that would indicate he was about to throw a rock.
p52
aVTIL most redditors are blind.
p53
aV[This was his stance the moment he was shot to death.
p54

p55
aVAre tasers not an option anymore?
p56
aVWhen they got developed this is the kind of thing we were promised they would prevent, crazy person does dumb shit to cops gets stunned and handcuffed.
p57
aVIt seems though that lots of departments just don't issue them.
p58
aVStill no excuse though, there are 3 of them and they do have batons, which might hurt him if they used them but you know, less than bullets.
p59
aVIt seems now that the new doctrine for any misbehavior is to mag dump on the guy till you are sure he is dead, even if you have to chase him across the street and corner him before you shoot him some more.
p60
aV"there are 3 of them and they do have batons, which might hurt him if they used them but you know, less than bullets.
p61
aV"\u000a\u000aBruises result in lawsuits, bulletholes don't.
p62
aVUnless of course someone is recording...
p63
aVAnd it just pains me so much that I'm thinking the exact same thing while I'm typing the comment you replied to.
p64
aVThat dead guys don't have a story different from yours, don't use up crowded jail space, don't add workload to over loaded public defenders and court-dockets and don't sue.
p65
aVIt makes wonder how many times does this happen not in front of a camera.
p66
aVDo they just kill a guy and clean up the story all the time because it's easier and cheaper?
p67
aVCheaper until the day when the public at large loses faith in their police force.
p68
aVThen the bill comes due with interest.
p69
aVSpeaking of 'overuse of force,' let's think numerically about this:\u000a\u000a I count three officers firing 5 shots down the street and, ten seconds later, 7 shots into the wall or into Mr. Zambrano-Montez.
p70
aVThey could be firing together, close enough that bullet shots sound like echos, but perhaps that's what you folks hear.
p71
aVHopefully forensic analysis can take all the bullets and match them to each gun.
p72
aVHow many rocks was this 35-year-old man holding?
p73
aVHow big exactly?
p74
aVAny sharp rocks in there?
p75
aVHow high were these cops when they decided that rocks require lethal force?
p76
aVPerhaps they were using something whilst in their wonderfully shiny police car?
p77
aVOkay, the last two questions were not really useful (yet) here... but still: does rock throwing require a response of bullet firing?
p78
aVThis article has the best and unedited version of the video I could find.
p79
aVNo adds to watch before hand either.
p80
aVWow, thats the first I've seen that.
p81
aVIf he was unarmed they effing murdered him.
p82
aVHoly crap.
p83
aVI am no police defender - I think they are mostly huge bullies and have been harassed for nothing on multiple occasions- but what did this guy think was going to happen when he started throwing rocks at cops?
p84
aVSo being stupid or possibly having mental issues (I don't know this kids story) is a capital offense?
p85
aVCops are paid to be in the line of fire and dangerous situations that is the job.
p86
aVIt is not their job to play judge jury and executioner.
p87
aVOur police forces have either become the biggest bullies or the biggest pussies, I am not sure which.
p88
aVOh he threw a rock at me - yes you can hurt someone, but you will damn sure do more damage with a gun than someone with a rock.
p89
aVThey can get back up, not every situation has to end withing 10 seconds, and if they get away well then do some damn investigative work to track them down.
p90
aVOh but that is all too much work, it is faster and less effort to just straight up murder people especially since the cops never get held accountable.
p91
aVNot to mention that the barrage of bullets headed downrange on a street full of cars presents a very clear and present danger to the walking/driving public.
p92
aVNobody got hit this time but that's why you don't add 30 or 40 shots to a scenario where the police are the only ones with guns.
p93
aVDid I say he deserved to be shot?
p94
aVNo.
p95
aVBut he also shouldn't be throwing rocks at the police if he wanted to stay alive.
p96
aVBoth parties can be in the wrong you know.
p97
aVYou may as well say it because you are implying it awfully hard "shouldn't be throwing rocks at the police if he wanted to stay alive".
p98
aVI will reiterate the job of the police is to catch the criminals, not judge them, or sentence them to death.
p99
aVLethal force should always be a last resort even if it costs a cop their life - that is the job that is what they get paid for.
p100
aVIf they do not want to do that then they can GTFO of the force.
p101
aVWe don't know if the kid had mental problems or not, not everyone is rational, yes it is a bad idea to throw rocks at the police, did he do it because he thought he was playing a prank or was he sick, we will never know because the cops murdered him.
p102
aVSaying someone should know better is not the same as saying they deserved what they got.
p103
aVIt is easy to say someone should know better but do you understand that not everyone does.
p104
aVEveryone wants to think that everyone in the world is normal, that mental issues do not exists or low intelligence but they do.
p105
aVNot every person out in the world understands right and wrong and the police have to deal with those types more often because they don't understand the difference.
p106
aVSo the police need to be able to deal with that because they will face it.
p107
aVI don't know if this kid is an example of that but throwing out that phrase "they should know better" is just dumb not everyone does.
p108
aVI guess that Indian guy the police body slammed to the ground is to blame in your world as well because you should know better than to not speak English or pull away from someone when you know you have done nothing wrong.
p109
aV&gt; Lethal force should always be a last resort even if it costs a cop their life\u000a\u000aNo, no, no, no.
p110
aVWe have no right to ask that.
p111
aVWe can ask them to go into dangerous situations, yes.
p112
aVWe expect them to make a best-effort attempt at apprehending suspects.
p113
aVWhat we cannot do is expect them to sacrifice their lives for it.
p114
aVThat's not the same thing.
p115
aVThese are cops, not soldiers for crying out loud.
p116
aVIf they were soldiers, then yes we could expect them to succeed at all odds, even pain of death... but we'd also expect them to use deadly force as a primary tactic.
p117
aVCops have just as much right to come home safely as other emergency services (such as firefighters).
p118
aVI have no problem with cops holding their own lives above those of violent offenders.
p119
aVThey should try everything that *doesn't* involve getting themselves killed before taking a life.
p120
aV(I haven't seen the video yet.
p121
aVI'm replying specifically to a statement that I disagree with, not within the context of this shooting.
p122
aV)\u000a
p123
aVWe hold our soldiers to higher standards than we do our police when it comes to use of force, if I had done what these guys did when I was in the Army I would probably still be sitting in a jail cell even though it was a war.
p124
aVWhy can we not expect cops to sacrifice themselves when dealing with our own citizens, they are the enforcers of justice and in this country justice is supposed to be one of our highest ideals.
p125
aVBy them putting themselves above justice it weakens our entire system and I guarantee if it continues you will see more instances of people just saying the hell with it "I am going to take them with me" or purposefully hunting them.
p126
aVYou seem to be conflating concepts.
p127
aVThere is a spectrum of choices upon which cops have to choose.
p128
aVAt one extreme end, you have shoot-first and ask-questions-later, even for minor offenses.
p129
aVThis is unacceptable.
p130
aVEveryone agrees on that.
p131
aVAt the other end, they can bum-rush any suspect, regardless of how dangerous, lemming style, and pin them under the weight of their now dead bodies.
p132
aVThis is also unacceptable.
p133
aVWhat you're suggesting seems suggestive of the latter, as a knee-jerk reaction against the former.
p134
aVYou seem to be saying that police should value their own lives less than the lives of violent criminals.
p135
aVIs this really what you are saying?
p136
aVI strongly disagree.
p137
aVI don't believe that justice demands that, nor can we maintain a police force at that standard.\u000a
p138
aVNo. 
p139
aVAre you sure about that, cause from where I'm standing your doing the apologist dance.
p140
aVCan I play you some music to do it with?
p141
aVI brought my tambourine. 
p142
aVTo clarify a little: What Brad is doing, knowingly or unknowingly, is using his statement as a strawman.
p143
aVThe fact that it IS stupid to throw rocks at cops has no bearing on whether or not lethal force was justified in this situation.
p144
aVThe way to respond to your argument could be, "Maybe you're right that lethal force was not necessary in these kind of situations, but you do have to agree that the action of throwing rocks at cops was a terribly stupid idea and he should well have known that he would be going to jail for aggravated assault.
p145
aV"\u000a\u000aThere, now we can have two discussions, one about the justification of lethal force and one about what level of response is necessary for rock throwing!
p146
aVApologists don't show up to have discussions, they show up to carry agendas.
p147
aVMaybe I should be more polite about it.
p148
aVI just really don't care what people think about me anymore so long as they don't see me pretend like any of this predictable damage control is in the slightest bit credible.
p149
aVYeah, I'm an apologist for saying that it's dumb to throw rocks at cops.
p150
aVOk.
p151
aVI have a huge problem with their illegal seizure of someone's phone and the claim that the video can't be used as evidence.
p152
aVBut throwing rocks at cops from 10 feet away is something an idiot does.
p153
aVOr someone who wants to die.
p154
aVI genuinely look at this video and think "suicide by cop"
p155
aV"He had it coming folks!
p156
aV" Classic apologist dance there, only two steps and always the thing to fall back on when nothing else could possible work.
p157
aVAlways be sure to tell everyone your not going to dance it while dancing it.
p158
aVAre you genuinely an idiot or are you just a troll?
p159
aV"He's got a rock" He had it coming" There is absolutely no excuse for what everyone can click that video and see and damn straight I'm mocking you for your weak ass attempt to apologize for it.
p160
aVIt's straight up murder for disrespecting their badges.
p161
aVYou hear that?
p162
aV*Straight up murder.
p163
aV* You should be ashamed for even trying to excuse it.
p164
aVI never said he had it coming.
p165
aVI said he was an idiot for throwing rocks at cops.
p166
aVI said he should have known better.
p167
aVIf you can't accept that it is dumb as fuck to throw rocks at cops, how in the world are you still alive?
p168
aVI have been held at gunpoint by cops for driving a shitty car in a nice neighborhood at night.
p169
aVI have been handcuffed and detained for "fitting a description" I did not actually fit.
p170
aVI have had two cars stolen from me and never received a lick of help from the police.
p171
aVI have had one car impounded by the police for a violation the judge later said was not even a real thing.
p172
aVI have no love for cops.
p173
aVI also have no love for idiots who assault cops.
p174
aVShould they be killed?
p175
aVAbsolutely not.
p176
aVDo I have to treat them like blameless martyrs?
p177
aVFuck no.
p178
aVWhat you'll do is deflect as much blame as you can.
p179
aVYou think we don't know you're coming to do that the second the link gets posted?
p180
aVYou think we don't know you're going to open with "I don't like Cops BUT..." You think we don't know before you even land on the thread that you're going to move on to "What did he think would happen?
p181
aV" You think we don't know you're going to moan like a little girl when you get mocked for it?
p182
aVPredictable as the sunrise.
p183
aVMy only question is:\u000a\u000aHas he not seen the news in the last few months?
p184
aVIs he not aware that cops have killed people for little to no reason before?
p185
aVIf no, that is the only justifiable reason I can think of why you would become aggresive with a group of police.
p186
aVIt's almost like he wanted to die.
p187
aVBy no means does this alleviate the police of wrongful intent, but it does make me wonder what the hell was going through that guys mind.
p188
aVMust have been very serious to warrant risking your life to cops.
p189
aVToday in misleading headlines.
p190
aVThis kid's teacher must just hate him.
p191
aVIf I were the parents I'd simply lawyer up and make the ISD start spending money they don't have to defend against a barrage of lawsuits against them and the teacher.
p192
aVI'm talking hyper sensitivity like a Tunbler/SJW on crack; every time he got scolded, looked at funny or if the teacher didn't call on him when he raised his hand the teacher, principal and the ISD would get letters.
p193
aVAfter a while they'd learn to walk on eggshells around him.\u000a
p194
aVThat sounds like a terrible idea.
p195
aVSounds like a perfect idea.
p196
aVTheir child is being abused. 
p197
aVSometimes teachers/admin make the wrong decisions.
p198
aVSo, you think that essentially putting your child in this isolated bubble and forcing the school district to spend the small amount of money that they get from taxpayers to fight lawsuits over stupid shit like this is a good idea?
p199
aVYou're a psychopath.
p200
aVInstead of being a fucking crazy person, you could instead go the route that involves sitting down with the instructors and admin and talking things out.
p201
aVIf that doesn't work, then go to the school board.
p202
aVImmediately suing seems to be the knee-jerk reaction in America nowadays, and it's fucking ridiculous.
p203
aVBe an adult and handle your problems without potentially ruining peoples lives. 
p204
aVNo sir you are naive.
p205
aVFirst of all my child comes first.
p206
aVIf you can't say that then don't you EVER have a child.
p207
aVThere's nothing to talk about.
p208
aVThe kid did nothing wrong.
p209
aVCut and dry.
p210
aVAs far as politely discussing anything; what do you think they did?
p211
aVLegal action comes 2nd.
p212
aVI would always give the retarded monkeys who run the public school system a chance to explain why they do the moronic shut that they do but there's a line you don't cross.
p213
aVYou don't let your child be bullied at ANY cost!
p214
aVIf you would put government employees above your own child then you are pure shit.
p215
aVNo parent would ever do that.
p216
aVDisgusting.  
p217
aVNo shit your child always comes first.
p218
aVBut that doesn't mean you should discard every sense of decency that you have just because you want to act childish yourself.
p219
aVThis school suspended the kid for a stupid reason.
p220
aVDid they put his life in danger?
p221
aVNo.
p222
aVDid they bully him?
p223
aVIt doesn't really seem like it.
p224
aVSo they made a mistake in suspending him.
p225
aVIt didn't ruin the kids life.
p226
aVI think it would be a great way to set an example for kids if parents didn't freak the fuck out every time their child gets put in an adverse situation. 
p227
aVIt's doesn't matter.
p228
aVThey are government employees.
p229
aVThey work for the public.
p230
aVThey answer to us not we to them.
p231
aVWe set the rules.
p232
aVThey did not make a mistake.
p233
aVThey purposely suspended a child for no legitimate reason.
p234
aVYou tell them what did was stupid (it was) and that they will apologize to your child and fix any damage.
p235
aVThey do this and it's settled.
p236
aVThey don't and it's lawsuit city\u000a\u000aYou tell your child they they work for him (they do) and he answers the his parents not a federal troll. 
p237
aVYou do understand that these "federal trolls" you're speaking of are other people right?
p238
aVPeople who are just trying to make a living to support their families and themselves, just like anyone else.
p239
aVThey weren't out to get this kid.
p240
aVThey were just trying to follow the codes of conduct at their school so that no one gets hurt.
p241
aVThe whole magic ring suspension was garbage, but the other two were at least somewhat understandable.
p242
aVI'm sure they have clear-cut rules on the use of labels, and on nudity of any kind.
p243
aVMost teachers try their best to make sure that learning environments are comfortable for students, and they have to make judgement calls on the fly to make sure every kid is okay.
p244
aVSometimes they're wrong.
p245
aVBut they aren't your kids personal servants, they're other human beings.
p246
aVMaking a living and calling kids out for not following bullshit rules are two different things.
p247
aVAlso it's a known fact that people who work for the government are assholes.
p248
aVCops, the IRS, the dmv \u000a\u000aNow if I go to chick-fil-a I'm greeted with a warm smile.
p249
aVAt the dmv I'm made to feel like an idiot for not knowing what a form 44-34S is like I live and breath nonsense.
p250
aVThose codes of conduct are pure bullshit.
p251
aV8 year old wares a James Bond shirt = suspended for sexism.
p252
aVWhat about the classic; "terrorist threatening" which can be applied to anyone for ANY bullshit reason!
p253
aVSchool administrators are a big part of what's wrong with education.
p254
aVThey soak up tax dollars and earn six figure salaries to turn schools into a police state.
p255
aVParents hate them, teachers hate them so why are they even there?
p256
aVThis is why no child of mine will ever set foot in a "public" school.  
p257
aVYou do know that admin isn't a public school only problem right?
p258
aVPrivate schools have just as many issues, and their admin make an excessive amount more than public school admin.
p259
aVSo sending a kid to a private school doesn't help them escape from bullshit rules and people.
p260
aVIn fact, considering that most private schools are religiously affiliated, those schools probably have even more ridiculous rules set in place.
p261
aVMost restaurants are McDonald's but I don't eat there lol.
p262
aVPrivate schools exist because patients pay tuition.
p263
aVIf a parent doesn't feel their child is being treated properly then then can move them to another school.
p264
aVThat's their incentive to not fuck up.
p265
aVHey idiot.
p266
aVInstead of punishing other teachers at that school for something they didn't do, why not just press for the school to fire the teacher that did this?
p267
aVEat a big bag of dicks.
p268
aVI'll do as I please 
p269
aVI was thinking this.
p270
aVI'd say this has more to do with small town xenophobia than the child's behavior.
p271
aVThe staff is thinking they'll run them off with repeated suspensions.
p272
aVTime to lawyer up, and file a lawsuit.
p273
aVI don't see how the kid's behaviors are causing any real disruption in the classroom, and the suspensions are affecting his right to be provided an education.
p274
aV..i'm wearing a replica of the one ring right now... am i a threat to my coworkers without knowing it?
p275
aVYes,  I understand that you know yourself and co-workers better then I do but as a person that lives in this society I know what is best for you and them.
p276
aVPlease stop offending people with your magical accessories. 
p277
aVwhat about the replica of one of the nine rings of power of the humans?
p278
aVCan i keep that one?
p279
aVOh man, you're in a heep of trouble now buddy!
p280
aVI'm not sure where you got these "rings" or as I like to call them WMD's.
p281
aVPlus probably have Garfield the cat literature in your "residence"/home base.
p282
aVThe FBI is coming for you!
p283
aVThis is America and we don't stand for intolerance of America!
p284
aVA proud America \u000aLeRoy Mmmmm Jenkins 
p285
aVWhy is the FBI coming to germany?
p286
aV&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

aVAmerica, that's why. 
p288
aVPlaying make believe?

aVClearly this kid is up to no good
p292
aVThat's so .... preciousssssss.

aVwat
p294
aVThis sounds like a Butters episode
p295
aVYour having an imagination doesn't suit the needs of the system just at this moment, mmmkay Billy?
p296
aV\u201cI assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend\u2019s existence,\u201d the boy's father later wrote in an email.
p297
aV"If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.
p298
aV"\u000a\u000a*Billy slowly nods his head* "Suuuure I'd bring him right back Dad, honest" 
p299
aVAs a recent (ish) texas transplant, this does not surprise me

aVIt's a hobbit dum dum...
p303
aVOne word: TEXAS
p304
aVI've lived in nyc, Houston and la.
p305
aVTrust me, stupid angry people live everywhere. 
p306
aVas the saying goes, everything is bigger in texas, even our idiots!
p307
aVHow can they possibly let him go for this?
p308
aVIt doesn't get more open-and-close than this
p309
aVYou want someone dead,  become a cop.
p310
aVShoot them, take the paid vacation, go back to work.
p311
aVLegal killing / hit men. 
p312
aVMurder is legal for those who carry a badge.
p313
aVNow the campus police are the ones murdering students.
p314
aVThis monster should be tried and executed.
p315
aVIsn't this the shooting previously in the news and posted at reddit during which the cop warned the guy 29 times to stop or he would shoot?
p316
aVPretty sure it is.
p317
aV29 times is no justification for shooting, but I feel like this write-up should mention the fact. 
p318
aVI'm fine with that line of logic, to be honest. 
p319
aVThey opened the door, now make them wear the shoes.
p320
aV/I know I'm mixing metaphors, I'm a metaphor Chef! 
p321
aVWhat would Jesus do with the homeless and hungry?
p322
aV'murican jesus?
p323
aVOr regular Jesus? 
p324
aVMurican jeebus would open up a can of whupass while regular jeebus would probably feed them or wash their feet or some other hippie bullshit. 
p325
aVSeriously, whatever reason these ass wipes think justifies fining and/or jailing people that are feeding other people in a charitable act of humanity, deserve to be jailed themselves due to the danger to society they present as insane as they have to be to actually act this way.
p326
aVThey need to be stripped of any job or responsibility they may take on, that gives them ANY power over any other human being for the rest of their lives.
p327
aVHe got a kill during his latest urban safari, it seems.
p328
aVAnd he's been charged with 2nd-degree murder.
p329
aVFirst degree murder is by definition premeditated.  
p330
aVI can see that my comment sounds as though I was criticizing the 2nd-degree charge versus the 1st-degree charge, but my point was intended to be the fact that this guy WAS charged and not getting off unpenalized.
p331
aVIf only they had found drugs, it would have been worth it!
p332
aV/s
p333
aVYeah TOTALLY!
p334
aVSo justified.

p336
aVShitty situation all around.
p337
aV:(
p338
aVReally tragic.
p339
aVI feel so terrible for his wife.
p340
aVI feel for the community as well, most likely they all feel like they are no longer safe having Police in their communities.
p341
aVWell, now it's is happening to white people, for no reason other than incompetence.
p342
aVNow is it time for action?
p343
aVhttp://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/12/3601771/people-police-killed-in-2014/  I hope you don't think this is just a black/brown issue.
p344
aVIf you have been watching the US  Drug War, there have always been police killings, especially of innocent people, regardless of race.
p345
aVThe fact that police are usually racist thugs doesn't stop them from murdering in a color blind fashion as often as not.
p346
aVThis little baby was hit with a swat team's grenade in a botched , mistake raid: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/20/county-wont-pay-toddler-grenade_n_5695271.html white\u000a\u000aThis sleeping little girl was murdered by cops as she slept in bed, next to her grandma: http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/aiyana-stanley-jones-raid/  black\u000a\u000ahttp://thefreethoughtproject.com/arizona-cop-brutally-attacks-teen-girl-mother-begs-stop/ brown\u000a\u000ahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Kelly_Thomas - a young white guy with schizophrenia, who died begging for his dad.
p347
aVThis one just destroys me, bc I would kill anyone who would do this to my child.
p348
aVI can't imagine the anguish all of these families and all of the rest with murdered loved ones feel.
p349
aVI hope none of us ever know such pain.\u000a\u000a
p350
aV&gt;I hope none of us ever know such pain.
p351
aVSadly, it's probably the only way for it to be recognized by the majority and stopped.
p352
aVOtherwise it will keep growing, as all things do!
p353
aVQuick, what's his skin color?
p354
aVMake a big deal about his skin color!
p355
aVThat is some sad stuff right there. 
p356
aVGee another one.
p357
aVI bet they can find tons more too.
p358
aVWe can be 'honest' about past injustices because we can *feel good* about how righteous we are now huh.
p359
aVDon't watch that Walmart shooting.
p360
aV... or here's the one they really don't want us to notice since it doesn't make the peasants fight amongst themselves: **Not one conviction for the global financial theft and meltdown.
p361
aV**
p362
aVNot in this country, anyway.
p363
aVIceland rounded those fuckers up and jailed them.
p364
aVFrom what I had read it sounded as if they were extra brazen and obnoxious in Iceland, or maybe it's because was novel for your country.
p365
aVThey sure went to town there for a while though it sounded like.
p366
aVAt least you got some justice.
p367
aVHere all that happened is that they had to return some (just some) of the loot.
p368
aVSome of these people deserved life sentences imo.
p369
aVIt was unreal.
p370
aVZero justice - the royalty just loots the peasants here and we call it capitalism.\u000a
p371
aVSorry, I should've been more clear.
p372
aVI'm American.
p373
aVWhat I meant was that we didn't get any justice in this country (the US), but at least Iceland did.
p374
aVOne of the reasons Iceland was so hardcore about locking those assholes up, was because the government of Iceland truly believes that they owed that to their people.
p375
aVThey sent agents as far away as London to arrest bankers.
p376
aVYou just won't find that sort of respect for the citizen in America.
p377
aVOur government knows that if they can distract us long enough, most of us will be too apathetic to care.
p378
aVYou're right, we got zero justice.
p379
aVI watched a story unfold not long ago.
p380
aVA man had committed an armed robbery when he was 19.
p381
aVNobody was hurt.
p382
aVThrough some clerical error, he ended up not being sent to prison.
p383
aVThis last year, the error was noticed, and the state was really wanting to have him serve his 20 years.
p384
aVHe's like 38 or so now.
p385
aVHasn't been in trouble since, and owns his own business.
p386
aVHe's got kids, and does the right thing.
p387
aVPillar of the community and all that.
p388
aVSo here's a guy who fucked up when he was a kid.
p389
aVThe state screwed up and let him walk.
p390
aVHe took that opportunity to get his shit together and be a good citizen, and yet, they still decided that he needed to go to prison.
p391
aVMeanwhile, we had entire corporations and banks that deliberately fucked this country and the world economy over, for the sake of short term profit, causing a global crisis.
p392
aVAnd the prospect of jail was never on the table for them.
p393
aVThat's fucking absurd.
p394
aVYea ...
p395
aVI get pretty mad when I hear what these guys made on their bonuses - 3 or 4 years of multi-million dollar 'bubble bonuses' as they knowingly created the bubble.
p396
aVThen came the crash.
p397
aVSome were let go - since their losses were so huge etc.
p398
aVBut of course they kept the loot.
p399
aVThe guy who ran the derivatives desk at AIG made insane amounts.
p400
aVBut he kept it all.
p401
aVThe taxpayers end up paying these guys for their crookery.
p402
aVWhat happened was so clearly ethically wrong that the govt shoud've done what they did with Capone - get the crook anyway they can.
p403
aVBut no ... nothing.
p404
aVMerely some govt trials so that these banks have to return some of the loot.
p405
aVSo what?
p406
aVSo as bad as this all was, it's all primed and ready to happen again. 
p407
aVOh yeah and it'll happen again.
p408
aVWe didn't revise any policies to put in fail safe procedures.
p409
aVLiterally nothing has changed.
p410
aVA few banks got swallowed by bigger banks, but nobody responsible really lost anything.
p411
aVThe only people who lost are the taxpayers.
p412
aVOf course, next time it happens, it'll be even worse.
p413
aVIt's scary to think how bad things will get before they get better.
p414
aVAmericans don't need distracting, they do that to themselves well enough.
p415
aVBut one day it will all come crashing down.
p416
aVAnd you know what will happen to those people who didn't care to pay attention to what would ultimately affect them, they will kill themselves!
p417
aVYep, it most certainly will come crashing down.
p418
aVWe live in a fading empire.
p419
aVIs it easy to move there?
p420
aVAmerica has turned to shit, and nationalism.
p421
aVI'm not sure.
p422
aVMy aunt lived there for 15 years while her husband was stationed there in the Navy.
p423
aVShe absolutely loved it. 
p424
aVSurprise!
p425
aVHe was black!
p426
aVYay!
p427
aVA happy ending :)
p428
aVThis needs more upvotes just as the world needs more people who take action rather than simply gripe.
p429
aVthis gets me so fired up!
p430
aVi love seeing good officers out there- protecting citizens.
p431
aVand hate/loathe/despise when that shit gets twisted up by others.
p432
aVlove that she got her job back.
p433
aVhate that this still happens.
p434
aVi'm glad she fought and won.
p435
aVthat family will forever be grateful and i hope they never call the cops on their son, again.
p436
aVworst mistake ever.
p437
aVClickbait
p438
aVPeople may not always understand why, but killing cops is almost a necessity now.\u201d
p439
aVI thought the DEA was effective at stopping like a whopping 3% of the imported drugs from the cartels...I'm glad they aren't corrupt or anything. 
p440
aVSeriously, if these guys weren't buddies do you think they would get naked with some girls they sent over?
p441
aVI mean, what a set up for a hitman.
p442
aVKinda hard to infiltrate if you don't participate
p443
aVWhat a fucking disgusting human.
p444
aVPark Service has issued an announcement: http://home.nps.gov/news/release.htm?id=1649
p445
aVI hope that stupid ignorant sefish cunt is made to clean every last drop of paint off she put up.
p446
aVAt the very least she should be banned from the parks for life.
p447
aVAlso could someone near her please go key her car or spray paint some equally shitty art on her home/face.
p448
aVIt not yours to deface.
p449
aVIts ours to enjoy and protect for future generations.
p450
aVI bet she left cigarette butts there too and herpes...
p451
aVI hate going to see ancient cave paintings or breathtaking natural landscapes only to find them closed because of selfish ignorant pukes or worse permanently defaced with "chad was here".
p452
aVFffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\u000a\u000aSorry about the rant I'm in the anger phase haven't gotten to sadness yet.
p453
aVShe needs to be in prison\u000a\u000a(she's hot though lol)
p454
aVI think it's kind of cool.
p455
aVSoooorrrry
p456
aVIt's really not a big deal. 
p457
aVThis should be on r/respectporn .
p458
aVI posted it there.
p459
aVLet's see :)
p460
aVOMG!!
p461
aVSomething positive!
p462
aVAir soft guns typically have an orange tip on them to show a distinction from real guns.
p463
aVSeems like they may have jumped the gun here.
p464
aVA pair of pocket pliers or a roll of black tape can make quick work of that.
p465
aVIf someone else had torn it out of the package, who knows what had been done to it.
p466
aV[White guys carrying real weapons in a department store and live; black guy does the same thing with a toy gun and dies.
p467
aV](http://i.imgur.com/NZm41lL.jpg)
p468
aVThe same thing?
p469
aVSo the white guy was asked to "drop the weapon" and didn't comply?
p470
aVAlso, the article leads one to believe he was pointing it at people in the store.
p471
aVWas whitey doing that too, or did you just instantly pull the race card without bothering to check facts?
p472
aV[deleted]
p473
aVArticle doesn't say that the man that was gunned down was a marine; it was "another customer" who was a "former marine".
p474
aVCrawford, the suspect and victim, was on the phone with his mother at the time (article is written a bit confusingly).
p475
aVAccording to the article, the events happened something like this:\u000a\u000aCrawford goes to store, hangs out in the toys &amp; games section and grabs an airsoft gun (specifically the MK-177).
p476
aVI assume he was playing with it, pointing it at kids around the area, maybe miming gunshots as one might do when playing.
p477
aVAnother customer--a former marine--calls the police.
p478
aVCrawford gets a call from his mother, and while they're on the phone, the cops arrive and order him to put down the weapon and such, then she hears Crawford say "It's not real," and then the cops shot Crawford and told him to "Get on the ground.
p479
aV" His mother, still on the phone, hears his screaming and crying.
p480
aVI assume Crawford dies at the scene.
p481
aVI think this can be filed under trigger-happy.
p482
aVI'm sure the cops were nervous and frightened for their lives and such, but being a police officer means you are willingly putting yourself in a dangerous situation, in which you may very well be shot or injured.
p483
aVAs such, a police officer should not resort to violent measures BEFORE violence presents itself.
p484
aVThe potential and intent for violence is not enough to justify violent, preemptive action.
p485
aVAny officer not capable of abiding by this should not be allowed anything other than a taser.
p486
aVThey *should* be trained to deal with it, but the fact is they aren't.
p487
aVI don't blame officers if they make actual mistakes if the system they work for didn't prepare them for it.
p488
aVI'll blame the hell out of the system, though.
p489
aVYou think that the officers did not make a mistake?
p490
aVThat is just so wrong. 
p491
aVI think that?
p492
aVI wasn't aware.
p493
aVThank you so much for telling me what I think.
p494
aVSo you do think that the officers were mistaken.
p495
aVYou just don't blame them for those mistakes.
p496
aVGlad that we got that cleared up.
p497
aVYour position seems illogical, though.
p498
aVIt does not take any special training to not shoot a person, not take a genius or any bravery to not kill a man for doing nothing wrong.
p499
aVI am confident that every police officer in the US is instructed not to shoot a person unless that person is an obvious threat that cannot be dealt with any other way - police training 101.
p500
aVWhy would you blame anyone but the officers for the officers' mistake?
p501
aVWhen you fear for your life, and you aren't prepared.
p502
aVyou aren't going to be logical.
p503
aVYou don't know how you will act until the time comes.
p504
aVMost of the time for cops in America, it either doesn't come of comes when there is a legitimate threat and clear target.
p505
aVBut when your life is on the line more things start to look like targets because, guess what, you don't want to die and you panic.
p506
aVLong story short, instruction doesn't matter as much in practice.
p507
aVSome people aren't cut out for danger, it doesn't matter what they are told beforehand.
p508
aVThere was zero danger...... As stated above, the cops were obviously trigger-happy and should never have been allowed to be cops in the first place.
p509
aVSo lots of blame to go around, but most of all to the crazy fearful police who shot an unarmed man for no reason.
p510
aVNo shots fired, no-one hurt, no-one acting erratically even though the man obviously had the pellet-gun for at least several minutes.
p511
aVI mean, the guy was on his cell-phone so his fingers were obviously not on the trigger.
p512
aVThe cops were wrong and they should not only be blamed, they should be put in prison for murder. 
p513
aV*manslaughter
p514
aVThere doesn't need to be danger, the people involved need to *think* there was danger.
p515
aVThat's what training should help.
p516
aVPrepare people to think under stress instead of just acting.
p517
aVYes, but...... what sane person would think that that man was dangerous?
p518
aVA man in a store for what, 15 minutes or more?, talking on his cell-phone, holding a pellet-gun, no blood, no-one running around screaming?
p519
aVIt makes no sense.
p520
aVThe cops fucked-up.
p521
aVEnd of story.
p522
aVWhat version of this did you read?
p523
aV&gt; customer called 911 to report 22-year-old John Crawford waving what appeared to be an AR-15 at children and others at the Beavercreek retailer.
p524
aV&gt; \u201cThe officers gave verbal commands to the subject to drop the weapon,\u201d Evers said in a statement.
p525
aV\u201cThe subject \u2026 was shot after failing to comply with the officers\u2019 commands.
p526
aVSomeone calls and says a guy with is waving an AR, what are people responding going to expect?
p527
aVThey are going to expect what they are told and that will be exacerbated by their fear.
p528
aVA guy waving around a gun isn't what I would call totally out of the ordinary.
p529
aVAnd what does a phone have to do with anything?
p530
aVYou can shoot with one arm.
p531
aVYeah, they fucked up, I'm pretty sure I said that more or less, actually.
p532
aVBut you aren't allowed to judge unless you are in their shoes or on the jury.
p533
aVI can and do judge those ill-trained trigger-happy cops.
p534
aVWho gives a shit who called about what?
p535
aVIf cops bust into your home, shoot your child holding a pellet-gun, and then respond "well we got a phone call that your child had an assault rifle" would you not judge them as incompetent fools?
p536
aVWhether it happened in Wal-mart or in your home, those cops should go to jail.
p537
aVIf you want to also prosecute the local police department then that is all good with me.
p538
aVIf someone called and said an *adult* was and it wasn't in that adults home, I wouldn't too much.
p539
aVI don't know why you came up with that other situation, since it is completely different.
p540
aVYou can wave a gun around all you want in your own home, not in public.
p541
aVA call about an adult is taken more seriously than a kid.
p542
aVTry your sensationalized bullshit somewhere else.
p543
aVAnd I don't know where you are getting this idea that I think they were competent.
p544
aVPersonally, in my view of the world, about 75% of people are *completely incompetent* under legitimate stress.
p545
aVIt's not the person's fault.
p546
aVIt is the fault of whoever allows them to be in that situation, especially if they don't prepare them.
p547
aVSo either cops need better training, or we are going to have a ton of incompetent ones.
p548
aVUnfortunately, good training would probably see opposition by people saying they are being "militarized".
p549
aVAnd in a sense they would be right.
p550
aVIt would also cost a fuckton of money, so good luck with that too.
p551
aVMy point was sensational but just to show the irrelevance of someone calling and reporting something that the cops would take immediate and lethal action because of.
p552
aVAgain, who gives a shit who called about what?
p553
aVI could call on you.....\u000a\u000aMy thought is that we are arguing whether the cops were mistaken, whether they were at fault.
p554
aVI think so.
p555
aVYou seemed to say that it was not their fault, that it was their lack of training so you blame the system (that is what you posted).
p556
aVSo to be clear, while I also blame the system, I blame the stupid-ass cops who could not see that a man was playing with a non-lethal toy gun, talking on a phone, no harm had occurred or was happening, and they still shot the man fatally.
p557
aVYou seem to want to defend the cops involved and blame their instructors.
p558
aVI don't understand that.
p559
aVEven you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.
p560
aVIt's irrelevant until you are told someone is very dangerous and *you* are the one who has to deal with them.
p561
aVThen it's pretty relevant.
p562
aVWhat do you think went down?
p563
aVThey walk calmly up to him, say "can you please put that down" and shoot him?
p564
aVThink about it.
p565
aVThey ran up, screamed "drop it", he didn't and shot him.
p566
aVIt probably took 3 seconds.
p567
aVYou don't take your time when you think you can die, trust me on that.
p568
aV&gt; Even you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.
p569
aVBull-fucking-shit.
p570
aVYou have no idea how you would act, and pretending you do is terrible.
p571
aVYou've never had your life threatened, you've never thought your actions in the next 3 seconds would determine the course of your life, your family's lives, many bystander's lives and their families.
p572
aVAs soon as you think someone is seconds away from killing you and many others, you can have an opinion.
p573
aVUntil then you should probably leave it to people with more experience.
p574
aVThey probably thought they would be able to easily distinguish a threat and act accordingly as well.
p575
aVAnd they had as much reason to believe that as you do now.
p576
aVHow does that make you feel?
p577
aVConfident?
p578
aVLess so?
p579
aVYou keep saying "if they think the situation is life-threatening" but it wasn't.
p580
aVIt wasn't even close.
p581
aVIt would not even seem so to any reasonable person.
p582
aVThis is where we disagree.
p583
aVAgain, if I called the cops and said that you, a man in a park, was brandishing a weapon, would you think it justified if the cops came and gunned you down like an animal?
p584
aVAnd again, it makes no sense to defend these cops.
p585
aVThey were wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.
p586
aVJust admit it.
p587
aVSay "the police fucked up.
p588
aV" That is all I want and my request is reasonable.
p589
aVBut you keep defending them.
p590
aVYou ever hear the phrase "hindsight is 20-20"?
p591
aVIt doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what you *think* they are.
p592
aV&gt; Just admit it.
p593
aVSay "the police fucked up.
p594
aV"\u000a\u000aI think if you back up a couple comments you will find just where I said that.
p595
aVBut I'm guessing you probably didn't read all of what I've said.
p596
aVThat would probably be why you brought up that "not life threatening" point again when I already explained that.
p597
aVIf that hypothetical guy in your story didn't drop the weapon, and it wasn't clearly fake, yes they would be justified in shooting him.
p598
aVAdding the "like an animal" thing is more sensationalist bullshit just to stir people up.
p599
aVPlease don't spread that and stick to clear facts.
p600
aVYou're beginning to sound like a major news network.
p601
aVYou can be wrong but not totally liable for it.
p602
aVRecently a plane had to make a landing on a beach near me and killed a father and little girl.
p603
aVHe was wrong but I don't blame him.
p604
aVA court might and I'll have to respect whatever they say(since they would know more of the facts), but until then I'm not going to let hate fly.
p605
aVIt's pretty nice being moderate in life until you know all the facts.
p606
aVYou should try it out.
p607
aVIt's calming.
p608
aVYou are the one who seems to be stretching the bounds of reason.
p609
aVThink about the situation.
p610
aVA man called and reported possible trouble, 10 minutes later the cops arrive, they see that no-one is hurt, a man is talking on his cell-phone not shooting people.
p611
aVThink about that for a minute and then tell me where the police were justified in shooting him.
p612
aVAgain I ask you to put yourself in the victim's place.
p613
aVWho gives a shit who called on whom?
p614
aVI could call about the mayor right now - would you think it appropriate for the cops to bust into City Hall and shoot him?
p615
aVIf the police were not justified then they are guilty of acting inappropriately and should be punished.
p616
aVThey did not "accidentally" shoot him, they had time to assess the situation and without reason shot the man.
p617
aVHindsight, foresight, clear sight - it is all the same.
p618
aVWhere are you getting your insight into what happened?
p619
aVYou seem to know pretty well, but that article wasn't exactly long and detailed.
p620
aVIf the mayor was waving around what people thought was a gun and someone called it in, then the police arrive and he doesn't put it down I would hope they wouldn't let the fact that he is the mayor stop them from doing what they think they should.
p621
aVWhy aren't you mad at the person who called it in?
p622
aVIf someone tells me I might be shot I'm going to take their word for it and act with caution.
p623
aVI think that the marine who called it in is a moron and should have known better but also think that he was justified in reporting what he thought was a criminal and dangerous situation.
p624
aVI do not think that the police were justified in shooting the man because of that call or by anything that the man could possibly have done.
p625
aVYou tell me if you think otherwise.
p626
aVWhat could this victim possibly have been doing, what could have the cops seen, what scenario was unfolding, that would justify shooting him?
p627
aVAgain, there had to be at least a few minutes between the call and the arrival of the cops.
p628
aVThey saw no bullets fired, no blood, no screaming people...... just a guy with a (pellet-)gun talking on a cell-phone.
p629
aVShould the cops have arrived because of the call?
p630
aVSure.
p631
aVActed cautiously?
p632
aVOf course!
p633
aVShot the man?
p634
aVNO!
p635
aVYou're problem is that they acted irrationally?
p636
aVGreat.
p637
aVNow go put your life in perceived risk and see if you act rationally.
p638
aVWhat could he have been doing?
p639
aVWell, I'm assuming standing there holding what looked like a gun and not dropping it when told.
p640
aVThere isn't much you can do between the time someone aims and they fire.
p641
aVIt doesn't matter what they saw, it matters what they perceived, and they perceived a threat according to the official story.
p642
aVYou want to know the thought process of someone who expects to be shot?
p643
aVHere it is, it's pretty simple.
p644
aV"Oh shit, looks like gun!
p645
aV" *pull trigger*.
p646
aVNo thinking involved.
p647
aVEven people trained for combat don't think in the moment.
p648
aVYou act on instinct.
p649
aVThinking comes later, you don't have time for that now.
p650
aVYou know another reason why I'm not judging harshly?
p651
aVBecause I know I don't know the facts.
p652
aVWhat time did this occur?
p653
aVWas the store crowded?
p654
aVWas is business as usual?
p655
aVI'd like to think it wasn't crowded at the time.
p656
aVMost cases of "guy with gun" don't involve blood and casings everywhere, actually.
p657
aVPeople run and people suck at shooting.
p658
aVIf I was arriving I would think that, unless it was crowded, people ran away and stayed away and the guy was hold up inside.
p659
aVDid the guy who called tell the employees?
p660
aVDid he tell other people?
p661
aVDid people leave while completely avoiding the victim thinking there was a problem?
p662
aVI would.
p663
aVAnd what makes you think nobody else thought there was a problem?
p664
aVIf these guys walked in and there were dozens of shoppers going about their business that's one thing.
p665
aVBut I have no reason to believe that is true any more than I have reason to believe the alternative.
p666
aVAnd you keep bringing up the cell phone like it makes him look less threatening or something.
p667
aVWhy?
p668
aVIf they shot him after seeing all the evidence you are assuming was there, they did it because they wanted to kill someone.
p669
aVNobody is as dumb as you are thinking these guys are.
p670
aVThey either acted out of fear or malice.
p671
aVAnd you shouldn't punish someone acting out of fear and you can't determine malice without an investigation in this country.
p672
aVYou could get these guys for manslaughter, now that I think of it, but I'm not on the jury so it doesn't matter what I think.
p673
aVMany minutes in between report and police arrival.
p674
aVStore was not in chaos, no blood or screaming.
p675
aVIf the man had a cellphone then only one hand was holding a rifle.
p676
aVI agree that the cops acted out of fear - that was wrong.
p677
aVI stand by my assertion that the cops made a mistake and are guilty of manslaughter.
p678
aVWhere are you getting that information?
p679
aVAnd in what world can you not operate a rifle with one hand?
p680
aVI mean, it wasn't bolt action.
p681
aV&gt; Another customer, 37-year-old Angela Williams, suffered a medical emergency during the incident and died a short time later at an area hospital.
p682
aVprobably lead poisoning. 
p683
aVCannot view without Facebook account.

p686
aVShitstorm begins
p687
aVI don't feel like Mcconnell's 20 minute statement is doing this situation any favors. 
p688
aVCan you link that?
p689
aVIt was pretty much required.
p690
aVNobody who was interested in this knows what the fuck a grand jury is.
p691
aVI wonder if there will be any uproar or rioting.
p692
aVThe last thing needed is another situation to get out of control.
p693
aVLet's hope the time passed has cooled the tempers a bit.
p694
aVWas there some sort of obligation, legal or otherwise, to announce this during the evening or did just nobody think this through?
p695
aVWhat's next?
p696
aVProbably not all that much.
p697
aVA civil  trial maybe.
p698
aVMaybe a burning car. 
p699
aVCivil trial is off the books in a self-defense dismissal.
p700
aVIn almost every state with self-defense laws, the defender is protected from civil litigation.
p701
aVThe police and the officer also have sovereign immunity in this case as no foul play was suspected.
p702
aVThere will be a Federal case in the works, and probably a federal grand jury will look as see if there was a civil rights violation and if the law was followed as this case was brought before the county grand jury.  
p703
aVAnigGamor is familiar with judicial systems hierarchy.
p704
aVImpressive. 
p705
aVI hope it's darren Wilson's car and he's in it alive.
p706
aVWe already knew this would be the outcome.
p707
aV#justicefortrayvon didn't work either 
p708
aVA lot of those protesters didn't look like they were from Ferguson.
p709
aVThe moment it was determined at the time of the shooting that a young black man was killed by a white officer, today's grand jury verdict was pretty much a foregone conclusion.
p710
aV(I'm not saying this particular verdict is wrong - I don't know if it is or not.
p711
aV) Given all the deaths of seemingly innocent people at the hands of police without any negative consequences to police, I wonder exactly what laws an officer would have to break in order to be indicted for murder after killing a young black man.
p712
aVIt's beginning to seem like there aren't any laws police can break that will definitely result in indictments. 
p713
aVThat's fucked up.
p714
aVThis is all so fucked up.
p715
aVRacism, goddamn alive and well.
p716
aVI don't know how to put it other than say it's so fucked up.
p717
aVThis comment is straight up racism.
p718
aVCompletely without any logic, and looking for a verdict solely based on the race of the parties involved.
p719
aVHave faith in the justice system, or get involved with politics to change it.
p720
aVQuit looking for racially influenced judgements.

aVJust keep it to yourself!
p728
aVWould you?
p729
aVIt's like the young guy that goes to confession and tells the priest that he has been sleeping with twin sisters who are members of the congregation.
p730
aVThe priest tells him to say three Hail Mary's and to stop doing it.
p731
aVThe young guy says he does not want forgiveness and the priest asks him why he told him about it.
p732
aVThe young guys says, "Father, I'm telling everybody".   
p733
aVresistance is futile!
p734
aVAwaiting the eventual comment you're all thinking.
p735
aVI went to the wrong high school? 
p736
aVWhy was this not happening when i was in school?
p737
aVall my female teachers were mean old ladies ....
p738
aVFuck, I should have gone to school in Louisiana.. 
p739
aV[deleted]
p740
aVIt's because everyone who was ever a 16 year old guy knows that's bullshit.
p741
aVSex with with two hot blond teachers doesn't give teenage me anything but a lifetimes worth of memory boners.
p742
aV&gt;Sex with with two hot blond teachers doesn't give teenage me anything but a lifetimes worth of memory boners.
p743
aVFACT!
p744
aVThat's jerk off material for decades.
p745
aVI still to this day remember my first threesome and it was far longer ago than I care to admit.
p746
aVBut yeah, reverse this and those (male) teachers would be strung up in the streets by a mob if they gang banged a 16 y/o girl.
p747
aVDouble standards.
p748
aVSociety is full of them.
p749
aVEDIT: I meant material for the boy who did it.
p750
aVNot for me or us.
p751
aVI read my comment and realized it could have been taken the wrong way
p752
aVAnd never having been a 16 year old girl I can't say she isn't mentally/emotionally harmed by such an event.
p753
aVAsk someone who used to be one.
p754
aVAnd maybe two adult women COULD harm a boy's psyche doing this if they wanted to.
p755
aVOdds are though if he is harmed by it, it will be because of guilt for getting them in trouble.
p756
aVAnd how can we we legally and morally say this is okay for boys but jail time if you do it to girls?
p757
aVI guess we can start by not pretending that it would not be awesome to find yourself in what would be considered an unrealistic fantasy porn clip. 
p758
aVHow do you think he's going to be "twisted up"?
p759
aVIt's not like 16 year old kids don't have sex anyway, this was just with older people who, for all intents and purposes, look kind of like highschool girls.
p760
aVHeck, the one chick was 23.
p761
aVIn two more years would you be complaining about an 18 year old being "twisted up" after sleeping with a 25 year old?
p762
aVIt's not like he's a ten year old child.\u000a\u000a
p763
aV&gt; just with older people\u000a\u000aThe problem is they are teachers - in position of authority over the students.
p764
aVIANAL, but i think in some places that means there can't legally be consent.
p765
aVYou are wrong on so many levels, he will be telling this story in the retirement home one days with a huge grin on his face.
p766
aVI hope the kid turns out alright.
p767
aVIt's easy as hell to make jokes, and frankly, if it doesn't effect him negatively, rock-on, guy.
p768
aVBut this could very well ruin his life.
p769
aVDamn.
p770
aVHeavy stuff.
p771
aVMeh.
p772
aVThe kid is 16.
p773
aVMost kids are fucking at 16 (or wish they were).
p774
aVGoing to jail for 17 years for something so arbitrary is beyond stupid.
p775
aVAnd yes I would say the same thing If it was a female student and male teachers.. as long as she is a willing participant.
p776
aVThe problem is that the teachers are in a position of authority over the students, muddying the fact that of whether or not they are willing participants.
p777
aVThe force is strong with Reddit today.
p778
aVThe lies coming from the Obama administration are just becomming laughable now.
p779
aVHope and change my ass.
p780
aVYou want him to change your ass?
p781
aVI'll excuse myself now.
p782
aVNo one, EVEN a criminal deserves to get shot multiple times in the back for running away.
p783
aVI don't care what his rap sheet says, chase him down and do your job.
p784
aVAnd for the record, my dad was a cop and I have huge respect for the good ones, which this man is not.
p785
aVI just think it's great that the department is not letting this guy hide behind his badge while they conduct an "internal investigation.
p786
aV"\u000a\u000aNope, no special treatment.
p787
aVYou fucked up, you pay the price.
p788
aVRespect to the chief.
p789
aVI like to believe it's because that is the right thing to do, but In all honestly it's only cause it was all caught on camera.
p790
aVThat's why I think we need body cameras, the good cops won't care and fuck the bad ones.
p791
aVSad to think this might have played out completely differently if not for the video. 
p792
aV[deleted]
p793
aVThere is clear video evidence of the officer shooting the victim in the back as he is running away...
p794
aV&gt;Scott allegedly gained control of the Taser to use it against the officer who then fired his service weapon at the suspect.
p795
aVDid you watch the video?
p796
aVNo problem giving the officer the benefit of the doubt but there is video evidence showing what happened.
p797
aVAnd in this case it shows him very obviously murdering a man who is no threat.
p798
aVMost of the "witnesses" who claimed that Brown was just being so innocent are those local neighbors that hate police and are trying to stick up for one of their own.
p799
aVThe MAN was a thug, he just committed strong arm robbery.
p800
aVHe is a known thug.
p801
aVHE violently attacked a police officer.
p802
aVYou can't play with fire and then get pissed if you get burned.
p803
aVIt has nothing to do with race.
p804
aVThe man was a thug and an idiot.
p805
aVRace is only brought in because people love to play that card so they can stir up drama and/or go steal from stores and burn down a town.
p806
aVIt's ironic that the protesters say "hands up don't shoot" like they're sparely mimicking Michael Brown to protest police action.
p807
aVIf Michael Brown would have done that he would be alive today. 
p808
aVWhy is there not a shoot to kill policy being used against the rioters? 
p809
aVWhy the down votes?
p810
aVThey're a risk to human life. 
p811
aVSounds far from a 100% sure scenario.
p812
aVThat is what a jury is meant to sort out, not a grand jury.
p813
aVA grand jury is meant to determine whether there is probable cause for the charge, not determine whether it was a "100% sure scenario.
p814
aV"
aVThe grand jury seems to have decided that this scenario of what happened is 100%.
p815
aVEven [The National Bar Association is questioning](http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b493e6c4d31beda32fdaf8e2d&amp;id=73514e334b) how the Grand Jury, considering the evidence before them, could reach the conclusion that Darren Wilson should not be indicted and tried for the shooting death of Michael Brown.
p816
aV&gt;The National Bar Association was founded in 1925 and is the nation's oldest and largest national network of predominantly African-American attorneys and judges\u000a\u000aYep, no racial bias there.
p817
aVYou don't know what the Bar Association is, do you?
p818
aVlol.
p819
aVI think you're the one who seems to be confused.
p820
aVThe [American Bar Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association) is the national association of lawyers which establishes the code of ethics for attornies and the criteria for the testing of law students.
p821
aVThe [National Bar Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bar_Association) is a fraternity of black lawyers and judges.
p822
aVThat the National Bar Association is suspicious of the findings should not surprise you.
p823
aVThe press release you linked (which was written by the NBA themselves) intentionally avoids making a distinction between the ABA and the NBA, likely in an attempt to stir outrage by making people think that the ethical overseer of lawyers everywhere thinks that there should have been an indictment.
p824
aVWhat should have given it away to you, had you actually read the entire release, is that the NBA clearly takes a position that "justice" is an indictment and not a decision made based on study of  evidence.
p825
aVThe ABA would not take sides on a case, nor would they publish a press release in favor of one side versus another.
p826
aVDo you?
p827
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bar_Association   It's original founding name is the "Negro Bar Association", a professional association for black law practitioners.
p828
aVYou're confusing the NBA with an actual government mandated bar association http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association  Those aren't national, they are state by state in the US.
p829
aVEDIT: The ABA exists too, nationally, but is not an association attorney's are required to join in their stats afaik.

p838
aVI guess life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness isn't the US main goals anymore.
p839
aVI guess 1 our of 3 (pursuit of happiness) is still ok...but the other two would be nice to get back.
p840
aVThe goal of the average US citizen is to die with a roof over their heads nowadays.
p841
aVWhere have you been?
p842
aVThere need to be riots over this too!
p843
aVMost the water in Montana is shit anyway. 
p844
aVThey know who the kids were that did this, or I assume at least the victim does as they go to the same school, no?
p845
aVPuts some perspective on "cyberbullying" when you read about real bullying.
p846
aVIn several of my various job titles (none of them police related but dealing with potentially hostile people) I have been trained on responding to various situations.
p847
aV(I know, kinda vague but bound by confidentiality agreements and such).
p848
aVOne of the training sessions that we do is with a hostile person wielding a knife.
p849
aVWhat I took away from the session is never let someone that intends to harm you within about 20 feet.
p850
aVBy the time you can react to the persons movements (person makes move towards me, do I shoot?
p851
aV) you could already have multiple wounds from the attacker.
p852
aVIn my professional opinion, this is an open and close case in terms of was it justified.
p853
aVThe officers lives were in clear danger (the attacker was about 10 feet away by my quick calculations).
p854
aVI saw a good post on another thread about this saying that although the shooting was justified, the police were mistaken to pull their car that close, narrowing the time to talk the suspect down.
p855
aV&gt;In my professional opinion, this is an open and close case in terms of was it justified\u000a\u000aAgreed.
p856
aVThe two shots they put into him on the ground could use some explanation, though.
p857
aVYou shoot to eliminate a threat.
p858
aVThat means you shoot until you are certain that the threat is eliminated.
p859
aVAs I was taught in my Concealed-Carry Class, "No Collateral=No Overkill".
p860
aVIt doesn't matter if someone get hit with One bullet or One Hundred, the end result should be the same. 
p861
aVYou shoot to eliminate the immediate threat; while hitting them once or ten times is fine, once someone is lying on the ground no longer advancing on you, they're no longer an immediate threat (subject of course to them not pulling out a gun, or otherwise missing the hint that now might be time to give it a rest).
p862
aVIf you keep shooting once they're on the ground, it starts to look like you're shooting not to stop, but to kill, which is frowned upon.
p863
aVWhy would they just pull up and get out of the car guns blazing if they expected him to cause them harm?
p864
aVThey made no effort to disengage.
p865
aVHe had his hand in his pocket before the car parks.
p866
aVThe police were justified in drawing their guns at that point.
p867
aVIn this case it was a knife but it could have easily been a gun and he could have fired as they got out of the car.
p868
aVTL;DR:  keep your hands out of your pockets when talking to the police.  
p869
aVI changed the title because I thought it was a little biased.
p870
aVWhile it's true the guy didn't attack the officers using an overhand grip on the knife, it's very clear he was going to keep advancing til they opened fire, they let him get very close.
p871
aVSuicide by cop.
p872
aV**According to the rachael maddow show, both officers had tazers.
p873
aV**
p874
aVSo, they had Tasers.
p875
aVTasers are inaccurate and unreliable.
p876
aVYou cannot use a taser until a person is within 16 feet from you.
p877
aVYou are not supposed to let a person with a bladed weapon within 20-25 feet of you.
p878
aV(Sorry I cannot recall the exact number.
p879
aV)\u000a\u000aI got all of the info above from CNN, who had an expert on and then interviewed multiple other people, none of whom contradicted the CNN expert.
p880
aVEdit: punctuation
p881
aVIf you tazer him, and it doesn't work PERFECTLY, you are likely dead or seriously wounded.
p882
aVBut hey, it's easy to tell the cops what to do from the privacy of your computer desk, right?
p883
aVI didn't tell anyone to do anything, I am simply stating the fact that they both had tazers.
p884
aVThese cops had options.
p885
aVThey didn't have to kill him. 
p886
aVThey did have options.
p887
aVThey could have yelled at him to drop the weapon repeatedly.
p888
aVThey could have given him ample chances to raise his hands in the air.
p889
aVThey could have even been unbelievably restrained and allow a man wielding a knife to get within one second away from stabbing range before finally deciding to use lethal force.
p890
aVWait, just watched the video.
p891
aVThey did all of those things.
p892
aVTo use 20/20 hindsight and yell about a taser or something is pretty ignorant, and unfair, frankly.
p893
aVA lot of Monday morning Quarterbacks around here.

aV:\u005c
p895
aVSuicide by cop is a common thing, for which I'm sure there is training to avoid.
p896
aVThis incident speaks to the fact that the police are not members of this community.
p897
aVThis guy was known to be mentally ill.
p898
aVThe police were the targets of his behavior.
p899
aVThe could have stepped back to the other side of the car.
p900
aVThey could have shot his legs.
p901
aVThey could have tazed him.
p902
aVThey could have put their weapons up and deescalated the situation since the man was positive they were going to shoot him.
p903
aVThere were many other folks around.
p904
aVThe man made no motion of intent towards any of them.
p905
aVHe was fixed on the cops.
p906
aVThis gives the cops options since they didn't need to be as concerned about the safety of other folks around.
p907
aVHis hands were at his side, yet the police report claims he had an overhand grip.
p908
aVWhy would those details be changed if the cops felt they had done the right thing?
p909
aVHow many bullets did they put in that guy?
p910
aVYou're going to tell me each round fired was necessary to take down a mentally ill man who was obviously in an agitated state?
p911
aVThis incident speaks to the over-equipment and lack of training of cops around the St. Louis area. 
p912
aVYou make it patently obvious that you have no idea what you're talking about.
p913
aV&gt;The could have stepped back to the other side of the car.
p914
aVBacking away from an armed man/turning around to see where you're going...neither are good ideas.
p915
aV&gt;They could have shot his legs.
p916
aVI'm going to take a stab in the dark and say you're not too familiar with semi-automatic handguns.
p917
aVShooting a small, moving target (like a leg or an arm) is not as easy as those movies you watch make it seem.
p918
aVThis is an extremely unrealistic idea.
p919
aV&gt;They could have tazed him.
p920
aVLet me walk you through the possible scenarios.
p921
aVFirst off, they would have to decide who was going to holster their gun and pull their tazer.
p922
aVThey'd probably have to do this by just yelling at each other, meaning he would know what they were doing.
p923
aVThen the cop would have to holster his weapon, unholster his tazer, fire its one fairly inaccurate round that may or may not incapacitate the subject...all while hoping he didn't get a knife in his throat at any point during his actions.
p924
aV&gt;They could have put their weapons up and deescalated the situation since the man was positive they were going to shoot him.
p925
aV...these are literally the dumbest words I've ever seen put together in a sentence.
p926
aVI'm not going to explain this one.
p927
aV&gt;How many bullets did they put in that guy?
p928
aVDo you know what a life or death adrenaline rush feels like?
p929
aVI guarantee neither one of those cops could accurately recall how many shots they fired.
p930
aVThey probably couldn't accurately recall a lot of things because their eyes should have been completely fixed on the hand holding the knife.
p931
aVTL;DR:  Your arguments are shitty and if you replaced the cops in this video you'd probably be dead.
p932
aVOr they could have been stabbed to death?
p933
aVThis seems to have been a good time to use a Taser, as pointed out.
p934
aVBut not all cops have them.
p935
aVCan anybody confirm that these officers actually had Tasers, and declined to use them?  
p936
aVThe taser has one shot.
p937
aVHad the closest officer used one, and it didn't work (hit clothes, misfired, missed, flat out not stopped the guy) he would have been stabbed.
p938
aVI'm watching rachael maddow, they contacted the department, both officers had tazers.
p939
aVIrrelevant.
p940
aVCops are not trained to shoot at ankles or taze.
p941
aVThey are trained first and for most to protect their own lives.
p942
aVThen the public at large.
p943
aVThey don't distinguish between cold weapons and hot weapons.
p944
aVWhat I saw in this clip is a deranged man yelling for the cops to shoot him.
p945
aVI didn't really see a knife but he did advance towards them in an aggressive manner and they reacted to their training.
p946
aVThat said, the issue we need to address is with training police officers to shoot at the knees or other non lethal location to subdue the assailant if they advance if that assailant does not have a hot weapon.
p947
aVIf they keep advancing, mortally wound them.
p948
aVIf assailant has a hot weapon shoot for the bullseye. \u000a\u000a
p949
aV&gt;That said, the issue we need to address is with training police officers to shoot at the knees or other non lethal location to subdue the assailant if they advance if that assailant does not have a hot weapon\u000a\u000aDo you know how many people in the world could consistently make a shot like that?
p950
aVA shot on a arm/leg while that limb is moving, while they are under extreme stress and fearing for their lives?
p951
aVI am certain it is less than 10.
p952
aVYou expect the entire US police force to be held to that standard?
p953
aVRidiculous.
p954
aVNotice how the cop jumped out of the car and just shot.
p955
aVIt's called murder folks.
p956
aVI remember when cops were part of the community not the enemy of the people.
p957
aVTimes sure have changed.
p958
aVIf you think you saw a cop jump out of the car and just shoot, you are delusional.
p959
aVBoth cops were out of the car at 1:25, and the shooting didn't start until 1:40.
p960
aVIf you bother to watch or listen, you will see that during those 15 seconds, both officers shouted an order to stop what he was doing, and both told him "drop it" and "drop the gun".
p961
aVDuring that time, the "victim" had enough time to approach them twice and yell "Shoot me, Shoot me!
p962
aVShoot me Now!
p963
aV" and brandish what they understood to be a gun or unknown weapon.
p964
aVThey showed considerable restraint in not shooting him in the first 4 seconds he approached them while showing a weapon.
p965
aVAt any time, he could have said "ok" or "yes, sir" or, "I'm co-operating" and dropped the knife and stopped rushing them, and he would have lived without injury.
p966
aVWhy do the cops owe it to him to risk their own lives by giving some random screaming maniac the chance to attack them?
p967
aVI would prefer that he be tazed...but did they have tazers?
p968
aVIf they did, did they have time to holster their guns and take out and aim a tazer before this unknown attacker had time to pull a trigger or run 5 feet and stab them?
p969
aVSo what is your theory?
p970
aVIs it that they see a black man and they immediately think "Here's our chance to kill one?
p971
aV"  Why, then, did the 5-10 other black people holding up phones and some shouting things at them not get threatened with weapons or killed?   \u000a
p972
aVThank you!
p973
aVI was beginning to think I was crazy for seeing what I thought was the logical turn of events.
p974
aVSome of these comments are just so far biased, it's concerning.
p975
aVI am all for shedding light on police brutality or corruption, but this one just doesn't look like that to me.
p976
aVOh of course.
p977
aVWhy should we expect the protectors of our civil society to treat someone like a human being?
p978
aVLet's just jump out of our car and act like there's a rabid dog that needs put down. 
p979
aVThey treated everyone on that scene like a human being.
p980
aVEveryone who didn't make themselves appear to be a threat was left alone.
p981
aVEveryone who didn't charge the police screaming and holding a weapon was never threatened in any way.
p982
aVThis one person clearly set up a situation that forced the police into a conflict with him, and then he gave them no choice but defend themselves.
p983
aVHow can you look at that and blame the two people who showed up and did their job as commanded and trained?
p984
aVOh I dunno, maybe because they came flying around the corner like Super Troopers and blew a guy's brains out?
p985
aVYou're telling me THIS is the best way to diffuse a situation?
p986
aVOut of all the ways in all the countries of the world that officers are trained, THIS is the best thing to tech them?
p987
aVI would genuinely love to hear how you would have handled this situation.
p988
aVSo, when somebody calls the police to respond to an armed robbery, you don't think they should rush?
p989
aVAnd again I don't think I need to repeat my entire first post on this point, but they didn't just fly around the corner and blow somebody's brains out.
p990
aVIf you really think that's what you saw, either you didn't really watch the video or you're delusional.
p991
aVYou're only seeing your own hatred and preconceptions, and not  acknowledging anything that actually happened.
p992
aVLet me guess...you are white and have never been to the ghetto.
p993
aVLet me guess\u2026 You disagree with me but can't think of a single reasonable thing to say that contradicts anything I said above.
p994
aVTherefore, your only recourse is to try to guess my biography and play the race card if applicable.
p995
aVI don't think there is any reason for me to help you do that.
p996
aVYep pretty much, I love you!
p997
aVI didn't see it that way, looks like they tried to talk him down and then he walked into them, they let him get a lot closer than I think most would have.
p998
aVTalk him down?
p999
aVThey had guns drawn as they got out of the car.
p1000
aVThey force multiplied his ass, they didn't attempt to deescalate the situation at all.
p1001
aVYou can hear in his voice that he knew he was dead.
p1002
aVThat's why he shouted "Shoot me"
p1003
aV&gt; You can hear in his voice that he knew he was dead.
p1004
aVThat's why he shouted "Shoot me"\u000a\u000aHe robbed a store at knife-point, and then hung around for the cops to show up.
p1005
aVWhen they  finally did, he approached them and told them repeatedly to shoot him.
p1006
aVWhen that didn't work, he backed up and tried it again.
p1007
aVThis was *clearly* suicide by cop.
p1008
aVThat's what he *wanted*.
p1009
aVNow maybe the officers had other options.
p1010
aVI'm very surprised he wasn't tazed.
p1011
aVBut he wasn't scared that they would shoot him.
p1012
aVThat's what he was there for.
p1013
aVAre you actually suggesting that they do not have their weapons drawn when pulling up on an armed suspect? 
p1014
aVIs he gonna throw the knife thirty feet at them like a Damn ninja? 
p1015
aVNo, he could charge them and close 15 feet in 2 seconds.
p1016
aVIs that not enough?
p1017
aVAlso, they don't know if he has a firearm either.
p1018
aVSaying "sir, we see that you are wielding a knife, could you please put it on the ground?
p1019
aV" is not controlling the situation.
p1020
aVMaking him drop the knife and get on the ground at a safe distance is.
p1021
aVAnyone who says different is just doing it from the unfair position of knowing all the facts NOW since they have reviewed the video, and also the ignorant viewpoint that cops should be ninjas and disarm the guy, or risking a knife to the neck to try and use a taser.
p1022
aVThey do not meet lethal force with non lethal force. 
p1023
aV[deleted]
p1024
aV&gt; cops are trained in hand-to-hand combat for situations such as these\u000a\u000aNo they are not.
p1025
aVThey are not superheroes.
p1026
aVIt is not their job to try to wrestle a knife away from someone in a situation like this.
p1027
aVThat is insane to think.\u000a\u000a
p1028
aVYou want to go hand to hand with someone carrying a knife?
p1029
aVGood luck dude
p1030
aVIf they had a taser absolutely, not all cops have them though.
p1031
aVSo if they did have them, and between the two of them, neither used them.
p1032
aVWouldn't this be something that would upset a community, over time?
p1033
aVWhat will happen to the officers, if and when they are found to have them? 
p1034
aV&gt; I'm watching rachael maddow, they contacted the department, both officers had tazers.\u000a\u000a
p1035
aVI would be upset if they had them and didn't use them in that situation, but I'm not going to get upset over a hypothetical.
p1036
aVThe officers are not supposed to meet lethal force with non lethal force.
p1037
aVTasers are not the magic "sleeping dart" like they are in video games.
p1038
aVThey are great for controlling situations with non lethal force, but had the shot missed, or not worked, the officer would be dead here.
p1039
aVThat officer could have been more defensive and immediately moved behind the car.
p1040
aVOne could attempt a taser while the other one had a gun as a backup.
p1041
aVBefore people say \u201dhindsight is always 20/20", let's remember that these are meant to be trained professionals.
p1042
aVMany police forces in the world use no guns at all.
p1043
aVThis shows that our police forces (in many cases) aren't worried about the non-lethal option.
p1044
aVThat's a serious problem.
p1045
aVThey are trained, but they are also not Batman.
p1046
aVRemember that.
p1047
aVThey are not action movie stars, they are Police Officers dealing with an enraged, erratic criminal holding a knife and walking aggressively towards them.
p1048
aVThey waited until he got one second from stabbing range.
p1049
aVThis incident left absolutely no room for putting their guns away and talking calmly with the guy.
p1050
aVThey didn't know if he was on drugs.
p1051
aVThey didn't know if he had a gun in his pocket.
p1052
aVOne cop gets within range to use a taser, then the shot misfires, or hits his clothes, or misses altogether, then what?
p1053
aVHe is within stabbing range, and the other officer doesn't have a clear shot.
p1054
aVNow you have one officer stabbed to death, and a suspect shot to death, and for what?
p1055
aVBecause the man armed with a deadly weapon screaming SHOOT ME SHOOT ME and trying to kill cops *maybe* deserved to be tried?
p1056
aVIt's absurd.
p1057
aVIt's almost as if people would only be satisfied if the cop waited the the blade to slip into his ribcage before finally saying "okay, we're gonna have to shoot him now".
p1058
aVTIL all UK cops are Batman.
p1059
aVWe are a rarity in the civilized world to have cops with guns.
p1060
aVAll of the others deal with knifes too.
p1061
aVThese guys just took the easy way out.
p1062
aVKill him and be done with it.
p1063
aVI expect better from our police.
p1064
aVI expect better from our citizens, actually.
p1065
aVI expect better than us to assume a cop should wait until he has been stabbed or shot before finally taking lethal force against a very clearly lethally dangerous individual.
p1066
aVIf deadly force is EVER necessary, can you tell me when?
p1067
aVWell of starters, when they have a gun.
p1068
aVWith respect for life and the constitution, a cop will find themselves in many situations that call for a hero.
p1069
aVIf they don't want to do it, we can find someone who will. 
p1070
aVThey should.
p1071
aVThe US crime code states that the minimum amount of force needed should be used in situations.
p1072
aVSadly the determining factor is a cop hyped on adrenaline.
p1073
aVMaybe they need more risk management training or something.
p1074
aVThis seemed a bit premature, you know, killing over soda.
p1075
aVHyped on adrenaline.
p1076
aVPerson closing in on me carrying a knife shouting at the top of his lungs to shoot him.
p1077
aVClearly crazy.
p1078
aVClearly would take my life if he wants to take his own.
p1079
aVSave myself.
p1080
aVI have a family.
p1081
aVyep.
p1082
aVThat's all "big hyped up trigger happy idiot cop right"\u000a\u000a
p1083
aVI don't see how you got there from "hyped on adrenaline".
p1084
aVAdrenaline quickens your reaction before your body/brain actually realizes what you're doing.
p1085
aVThat's where training overtakes analytical thinking; fight or flight becomes the base reaction, and training for a law enforcement officer is to essentially neutralize a threat, thus "save myself" isn't even really a consideration--it is simply a matter of reacting in the manner you were trained.
p1086
aVIs the officer responsible for his reaction in such a situation?
p1087
aVI don't think so.
p1088
aVI blame the training, or lack thereof.
p1089
aVIf law enforcement officers are trained for non-lethal take-downs in lethal situations then that's exactly what they'll do when it's time to take action...
p1090
aVUnless the situation skews into unfamiliar territory, wherein a split-second judgement call takes priority, but is still likely to be based on said training.
p1091
aVThis is why officers that are trained to use non lethal (tazer and OC spray) have to have the item used on them.
p1092
aVSo they can have an understanding of the pain, what it can do you to you, etc.
p1093
aVComing from a person ( me) that was trained in law enforcement on the military (I'm an engineer now) pepper spray disperses people on groups better than it lays down one person.
p1094
aVSpecially if said person is aggressive.
p1095
aVMy training Involved me having to be sprayed ; defend against and attacker and handcuff the person after drawing my weapon.
p1096
aVAll the spray did to me was make me angry and more aggressive.
p1097
aVIt burnt yes; but the adrenaline from being sprayed knocks out the pain until it is over it.
p1098
aVI short.
p1099
aVPepper spraying an attacking suspect carrying a knife is the worst option in the world.
p1100
aVAlso; I would like you to try shooing a non lethal shot into a person as they charge you carrying a knife at close range.
p1101
aVIt isn't going to happen.
p1102
aVPeople are already mad at how much we spend on police.
p1103
aVYou want them shooting at the range every week ?
p1104
aVWith more advanced shooting ranges ?
p1105
aVThat's costly.\u000a
p1106
aV&gt; This seemed a bit premature, you know, killing over soda.
p1107
aVJustified or not, it was **not** over soda.
p1108
aVIt was over an armed, unstable suspect approaching cops.
p1109
aVWhether or not it was an over-reaction, or if they had other options, it was **not** about the soda.
p1110
aVI think we're seeing the results of how poorly-trained these cops are. 
p1111
aVThe minimum amount of force changes when a lethal weapon is brandished.
p1112
aV[deleted]
p1113
aVWrong incident.
p1114
aVI know it is confusing, but that was a different black man killed by white cops in St. Louis recently.  
p1115
aVAnd we wonder why people are rioting?
p1116
aVNo one is rioting over this shooting.
p1117
aVAs morbid as this sounds, this was a different black man that was killed by St. Louis police this week.  
p1118
aVNot referring to this one specifically, just the rioting in general. 
p1119
aVI hope that "officer" spends a long time in jail.
p1120
aVIt's time to stop tolerating these abuses by police, and make some examples out of the bad apples.
p1121
aVI seriously wonder how the neighbor who called 911 feels.
p1122
aVI'd feel like an ass.
p1123
aVMeh, he will move to Florida and get a raise.
p1124
aVBusinessInsider draws a very strong and unsupported conclusion - pretty much the opposite of what the research actually says.
p1125
aVI strongly suspect financial motives, especially as this study was funded by one of Australia's largest bread and bakery companies.
p1126
aVHere's the response from the editors of the journal publishing the researchers' work:\u000a\u000a&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.12782/full\u000a\u000a&gt;How does the current study tie in with the literature?
p1127
aVDespite there being ongoing debate as to whether gluten is working alone or alongside other wheat components in inducing gastro-intestinal symptoms, **the work by Peters et al.
p1128
aVsupports the existence of non-Celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), albeit in the form of an extra-intestinal manifestation.
p1129
aV** \u000a\u000a&gt;Nevertheless, this certainly opens a gateway for further research and Peters et al.
p1130
aVare to be congratulated for providing insight into this complex yet evolving clinical entity.
p1131
aVWhether NCGS is a disease of the mind or gut is food for thought, **but it is no longer a condition to be dismissed as functional** and perceived as belonging to a \u2018no-man's land\u2019.\u000a
p1132
aVI'm confused
p1133
aVAt best, this BusinessInsider.com article is an example of bad science reporting.
p1134
aVAt worst, it's a deliberate attempt to misrepresent scientific results for financial gain.
p1135
aVSome of the research in gluten science can seem contradictory and in conflict, but taken as a whole we are slowly starting to make incremental progress in understanding what it is, how it happens, and why it varies so much from person to person.
p1136
aVThanks, I am a gluten person so I'm always interested in these studies. 
p1137
aVSo... What is it?
p1138
aVThe study found no hint of a link to Physical symptoms. 
p1139
aV"Found no evidence" is a very different - and much better - statement than "thoroughly disproves.
p1140
aV"\u000a\u000aSo what is it?
p1141
aVWell, "it" isn't one thing.
p1142
aVSome people are reacting to gluten via Celiac Disease, some people seem to be reacting to other components of the wheat like the specific types of sugars, and there also seems to be at least one additional condition that is a reaction to gluten, but has more to do with psychological symptoms than digestive ones.
p1143
aVWe have more questions than answers at this point.
p1144
aVThe big question is why these things are becoming more common in first-world countries.
p1145
aVBlood samples from the 1950s show lower levels of gluten antibodies than modern blood samples.
p1146
aVCountries divided politically and economically, but not genetically, also show greater prevalence in the more modern and wealthier societies.
p1147
aVSo we're losing our ability to digest foods, and the big hypothesis now points to the microbiomes that we've been killing off with a multifront onslaught of antibiotics, antimicrobial cleaning products, and preservatives in our food.
p1148
aVAll in all, it has been a very enlightening and productive field of research, but that doesn't necessarily mean we understand it yet, either.
p1149
aVThis study referenced pretty clearly showed no link between physical symptoms and gluten.
p1150
aV(Double blind, plocebo controlled.
p1151
aVBasically gold standard for research).
p1152
aVIt would be difficult to find a better study.
p1153
aVWe know what celiac disease is and how to diagnose it.
p1154
aVThis study shows no evidence to support people claiming gluten intolerance out side of celiac disease.
p1155
aVFurther study should be done, no doubt.
p1156
aVMore data never hurts.
p1157
aVBut the picture is becoming clearer and clearer that non celiac gluten sensativity does not cause physical symptoms as far as we know today.
p1158
aVObviously people are suffering but right now i think it makes sense approach these symptons systematically and scientifically rather having people running around self diagnosing gluten senstivity when the symptoms could be coming from very different sources.
p1159
aVI would be interested to see reference for the blood test info though.
p1160
aVI had not heard that before.
p1161
aVI disagree - there was no control group, and all of the subjects experienced increasing digestive symptoms for the duration of the study.
p1162
aVThat's the reason they couldn't find a link to gluten - because everyone was getting worse the entire time, no matter which phase of the test they were on.
p1163
aVThe only exception was the first of the washout phases when all of the suspected food triggers were removed.
p1164
aVAfter that, the patients' reports of symptoms all increased with seemingly no link to what they were eating.
p1165
aVFurther, the study only selected 32 of the subjects, out of the ~120 who were self-diagnosed and willing to participate.
p1166
aVSo 3/4 of the subjects were eliminated due to a lack of testing for Celiac or because of genetic markers associated with Celiac.
p1167
aVIt's a pretty similar number to the proportion of subjects who showed symptoms in Gibson's first study, but we don't know if they would have ever qualified for a diagnosis of Celiac through villous atrophy.
p1168
aVNCGS may be a sort of "pre-Celiac" condition, and we'd certainly be better off if we could diagnose Celiacs before they reach a point of imminent starvation.
p1169
aVGibson's third study on psychological symptoms is important too, because it used the exact same subjects from the second study (the 32 who definitely didn't have Celiac markers).
p1170
aVThe data shows a pretty clear link between gluten and feelings of anxiety &amp; depression.
p1171
aVHere are some recent sources on the apparent increase in Celiac Disease.

aVIt seems it is mostly a first-world problem:\u000a\u000a[Increased prevalence and mortality in undiagnosed celiac disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362553)\u000a\u000a&gt;During 45 years of follow-up, undiagnosed CD was associated with a nearly 4-fold increased risk of death.

aV[The \u2018Hygiene hypothesis\u2019 and the sharp gradient in the incidence of autoimmune and allergic diseases between Russian Karelia and Finland](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apm.12023/abstract)\u000a\u000a&gt;Recent results from Russian Karelia and Finland imply that environmental factors have greatly contributed to the increasing prevalence of immune-mediated disorders.
p1175
aVInfections, or lack of them, may indeed be strongly involved in the development of both autoimmune and allergic diseases.

aVYou know how people tell you to be careful of awful science reporting that misrepresents the actual science?

p1179
aVIt's hard to get a picture of exactly what the situation was here, and the police who fired the non-lethal rounds are probably primarily to blame for her injuries.
p1180
aVHowever, this statement "We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.
p1181

p1182
aVIf my wife were pregnant, she would stay the fuck away from any situation that would even have potential for harming her or her unborn baby.
p1183
aV&gt;Police, who were responding to reports of gunshots in the area, said that the officer fired at the car because it was being driven towards him and he feared for his safety \u2013 but Conner claims that he had no need to use a weapon on them.
p1184
aVSo, she tried to run down a police officer?
p1185
aVI hope she rots in jail.
p1186
aVShes lucky to be alive.
p1187
aV&gt;We was just riding around respecting Mike Brown.
p1188
aVAnd she did just that.  
p1189
aVAnother case of "she/he was coming right at me!
p1190
aV"
aVI can't believe there are no comments on this.
p1191
aVThis story makes me sick to my stomach.
p1192
aVI feel for these kids and am so saddened at the state of our "justice" system.
p1193
aVTheir lives will be forever affected so that these police could fill an arbitrary quota.
p1194
aVWhat do you want us to say?
p1195
aVWe all hate cops, you cant trust them, when the gang guys ambush and kill a few you see no one cares.

aV"safe to drink" =/= "should be drank"
p1203
aVThat's utterly laughable.
p1204
aVThat said, I wouldn't be surprised if the stuff actually was somewhat safe to ingest.
p1205
aVAfter all, it's meant to be used by people, to kill tiny, small bugs.
p1206
aVI'm not saying you wouldn't get sick, and it might cause some sort of horrible cancer, but I doubt this stuff is exactly the perfect suicide concoction. 
p1207
aVHaha why are you being downvoted?
p1208
aVBecause love it or hate it, Reddit is full of neckbeards. 
p1209
aV"causing some sort of horrible cancer" sounds extremely unsafe to ingest....
p1210
aVI feel that's the same as sayings cigarettes are safe to smoke.
p1211
aVIt won't kill you immediately but it might cause some sort of cancer. 
p1212
aVExactly.
p1213
aVYou can drink it, you just absolutely shouldn't unless you like vomiting all over the place and getting sick.
p1214
aVOf course, that just adds another level to Mr Lobbyist's bullshit. 
p1215
aVJust because this chemical is "safe to drink" doesn't mean that it won't taste like shit.
p1216
aVIf it truly was safe to drink, I bet it would still taste absolutely terrible, and most people would refuse to drink it even with the knowledge that it was safe. 
p1217
aVExcept why back out like that then when your company's reputation is on the line?
p1218
aVIf the statement is true, that's worth a little bad taste, right?

p1224
aVI'll be sure to remember this article in the future.
p1225

aVPeople have known for a long time that the Koch brothers are a cancer on the U.S. political system and environment.
p1228
aVBut the Koch Brothers are so rich they simply don't care.
p1229
aVI work with people who say, "I don't understand all the hate towards the Koch Brothers.
p1230
aVThey're job creators, they employ people.
p1231
aV"    \u000a\u000aThat's really all they care about.
p1232
aVIt's tough, you know?
p1233
aVPeople need jobs to live.
p1234
aVBut poisoning the planet and the political system each come with significant consequences too.
p1235
aVThat we may not see them immediately doesn't lessen their importance.
p1236
aVBut you've hit right at the heart of one of the big tensions in capitalism--short term versus long term survivability.
p1237
aVIt's bad because I'll be right with this guy on unemployment when the plant leaves the area.
p1238
aVHow am I supposed to get a guy to care about business practices and the environment when we're going to be having trouble paying our bills?  
p1239
aVLol, Rolling Stone is about as relevant as The Rolling Stones
p1240
aVInstead of making doofus "lol" comments bashing a magazine that you personally do not find relevant, why don't you comment on the substance of the article?

aVMilitary equipment should *only* go to SWAT teams, and SWAT teams should be Federally required to pass the same training as counter insurgency teams in the US Marine corps (plus other training).

aVGiving tools of war to someone with a badge who is there for civil servitude is one of the most ignorant things going on

p1273
aVAnd for the record I am actually probably more sympathetic to the police than most redditors.
p1274
aVI have a deep respect for police.
p1275
aVMy step father is a retired assistant police chief and I've heard some really amazing stories.
p1276
aVFrom pulling over drunk drivers, hand cuffing them, but just returning them to their residence (medium town so first timers he encountered got an extra inch) with no paper trail.
p1277
aVTo jamming a police baton between some ones ribs for someone who attacked a sleeping drifter.
p1278
aVPolice play a vital and important role in any society but if you gear them up for a war zone they will act as if they are in one.
p1279
aVFerguson is a touchy subject with me for example.
p1280
aVDue to my respect for officers if one tells me to get off the road and onto the sidewalk I do so at a decent pace.
p1281
aVBut if I was a cop and someone was agitated enough to come up to my patrol car window and a struggle ensues and a shot fired.
p1282
aVBut guy gets away, only to change his mind and come back I feel non lethal should if been used at that point..
p1283
aVBut I've never been in that situation.
p1284
aVBut these stories and videos of high fiving each other after shooting a homeless man, shooting an elderly man, shooting a naked man is just disgusting.
p1285
aVI don't get the mentality and the only thing that I can imagine is the fact the a young individual joins these law enforcement departments and given these feats of engineering that were designed for one purpose and it goes straight to their head.  \u000a
p1286
aVAnother false-flag.
p1287
aVThis operation is contrary to the stated goals and philosophy of Anonymous. 
p1288
aVI thought the whole concept of "Anonymous" was just that - no hierarchy, no organization, no stated goals or philosophy, just an amorphous and unseeable mass of people acting in whatever general direction they choose? 
p1289
aV&gt;I thought the whole concept of "Anonymous" was just that - no hierarchy, no organization, no stated goals or philosophy, just an amorphous and unseeable mass of people acting in whatever general direction they choose?
p1290
aVYou're not wrong, the only thing that truly unites Anonymous is the common belief in the power of anonymity and free speech.
p1291
aVThat an Anon would support the de-masking or social media suppression of another person or group, even a racist one (as if some Anons aren't seriously racist) just smacks of contradiction. 
p1292
aVI only see a contradiction when it's taken at face value.
p1293
aVYou said yourself that they believe in *the power* of free speech and anonymity, not *the righteousness* of it or people's right to it (and while there has been a theme of them fighting for free speech, again, anonymous is amorphous and thus can't take a solid stance on it - on the other hand we can judge they believe in the power of anonymity just by their actions).
p1294
aVIf they don't want people to hold power via anonymity for doing bad things like the KKK presumably does, then they are consistent in attacking that anonymity.
p1295
aVI think under a fair interpretation of their actions, their actions are consistent. 
p1296
aV&gt;anonymous is amorphous and thus can't take a solid stance\u000a\u000aThat's the problem, and why I stopped participating in Anonymous operations soon after Project Chanology.
p1297
aVThere's no way to tell if a task or operation has been proposed by an actual Anon or someone pretending to be an Anon because there's no means of authentication and very little difference besides.
p1298
aVIt falls upon the individual to decide for themselves, hence the meme "[Not Your Personal Army](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-is-not-your-personal-army)".
p1299
aV\u005c#OpKKK seems to be one of the latter, in my opinion, simply because if this were a *chan imageboard nobody would be batting an eye at the presence of racists especially with regards to the situation in Ferguson.
p1300
aVWe're talking about a bunch of assholes that [assaulted an Epileptic forum with blinkenlights](http://www.news.com.au/technology/anonymous-attack-targets-epilepsy-sufferers/story-e6frfro0-1111115935811) for the lulz.
p1301
aVSure they occasionally find it funny to play at Social Justice Warrior for the press, doxing paedophiles on Twitter and whatnot, but their membership has a not-insignificant overlap with the KKK and the more /k/ Anons have been half-jokingly making the same veiled threats towards both the Ferguson protesters and Ferguson cops for months now.
p1302
aVI guess what I'm getting at is that the participants in \u005c#HoodsOff and \u005c#OpKKK don't represent Anonymous as a whole.
p1303
aVAt best, they're one mostly-independent tentacle of the hentai rape monster that is the collective.
p1304
aVMore likely, they're a third party that finds the benefits of slapping a Guy Fawkes mask on a press release outweighs the risk of hacking a bunch of KKK Twitter accounts without a convenient scapegoat. 
p1305
aV"Anonymous responded by \u201cdoxxing\u201d dozens of Klan members, i.e., posting their personal information and photos on line, hence the hashtag \u201c#HoodsOff.\u201d \u000a\u000a\u000aDoxxing members of a semi secret group is much more than just knocking their webpages over.
p1306
aVReddit has a huge racist community of its own.
p1307
aVFinding their main Reddit accounts should be trivial.

aVDo you really think those people are comparable to the organized, actively threatening, and within proximity members of the emergency area in Missouri of the KKK?
p1314
aVI'd argue the difference is that the people you name aren't *really* hurting people.
p1315
aVAnonymous did this in response to the KKK threatening violence in Missouri, which seems credible enough.
p1316
aVI wonder if the deputies will actually face criminal charges because they beat up a white guy.

p1320
aVIt's incredible, the proof is right here on video.
p1321
aVIndisputable proof from beginning to end. 
p1322
aVHow about just for a start we have voting weekends instead of doing it on Tuesdays during mostly work hours?
p1323
aVThat might double turn out at least, especially if the news was allowed to give out exit poll numbers Saturday night to encourage Sunday turn out.
p1324
aVTomorrow- mandatory political reeducation classes
p1325
aVI have not bothered to read the fine print, which has been the catch for drastic changes like this, but someone tell me why this is a bad idea?
p1326
aVRequire everyone, who is a citizen, to vote.
p1327
aVAt least from ages 18 to 40.
p1328
aVWorst thing that could happen is campaign commercials during sponge marathons to capture that 20yr old vote.
p1329
aVAlthough real reform could be fixed by tighter donation restrictions.\u000a
p1330
aV&amp;gt;someone tell me why this is a bad idea?
p1331
aVSimply put, because we have two parties to vote for.
p1332
aVOne loves religion and money- I don't.
p1333
aVAnd the other loves being bossy, money and blaming everyone else- I don't.
p1334
aVI shouldn't have to choose between heroin or crack simply because the dealers don't want to go out of business.
p1335
aVI cannot imagine I'm alone in this regard.
p1336
aVThere are plenty of other parties but in large part because of voter apathy the two dominant parties control almost the entirety of media coverage.
p1337
aVBut you can watch the third party debates.
p1338
aVThey are a real thing.
p1339
aVWhy aren't any of them invited to the big debates?
p1340
aVBecause we allow it to be run that way.
p1341
aVWe the people could definitely change that one part of the system by simply changing the debate formats in the right way and making them mandatory for running.
p1342
aVReally in this internet age there is no reason we are all so beholden to mass media for information on our candidates.
p1343
aVA new system is ripe for the making and we can circumvent be money issues of the old system by leveraging technology.
p1344
aVMore people voting will make it harder on the two party system.
p1345
aVMuch much harder. 
p1346
aVYou don't institute a nationwide compulsory project without dire need.
p1347
aVThere are tens of millions of personal, anecdotal reasons why this is a bad idea, because a mandatory voting requirement will command at least that many people to do something they otherwise would not have.
p1348
aVWho are you to judge how harmful this slight suspension of liberty will be when multiplied by a number with 7 zeros after it?
p1349
aVWhat good does it serve to force people who can't be bothered to vote to interrupt their business (or leisure) on a particular day and time just to express an opinion they don't consider worthy of expression?
p1350
aVEither they have a good reason not to vote, and should be left alone, or they are lazy and probably don't have an informed opinion, in which case we should be grateful they are willing to censor themselves.
p1351
aVThe only reason any Democrat is willing to discuss this is the assumption that most deadbeats would vote for them if forced, helped, or motivated to vote.
p1352
aV(Incidentally, this is the only reason any Republican is interested in cracking down on voter fraud by requiring IDs; they assume a majority of people who would be scared away are voting against them.
p1353
aV)
aVThank you for a different perspective, on phone and in between classes so can't respond justly.
p1354
aVFreedom to vote is an amazing staple to this country and thank you again for your response.
p1355
aVI'd much rather see a move where another national holiday and/or encouragement to employers to allow time off to go to the voting booth.
p1356
aVI know some actually do, but a unified expectation of that could drastically change the landscape of elections
p1357
aVOn a slightly different topic, I still don't know when and how it was apparently proven to everyone that low voter turnout is a problem for anyone in any sense.
p1358
aVCertainly, anyone on the losing side will *assume* that the voters who didn't show would have swung the balance in their favor, but this is wishful thinking and bitterness with no basis in fact.
p1359
aVThe powerful thing about living in a democracy is that you have the RIGHT to vote.
p1360
aVWhether or not you actually go to the polls, your representatives still have cause to fear that you will go to the polls if they displease you too much, and that is what keeps them in check.
p1361
aVIf you feel your representatives have failed to live up the promises of their campaign, you still retain the right to go vote them out next time.
p1362
aV..and if you do, everyone who stays home will be making your opinion count that much more.  
p1363
aVI don't see it as a freedom.
p1364
aVIt's conscription.
p1365
aVI see it as being drafted to provide my consent to the elites, and check a box for OPPRESSOR_A or OPPRESSOR_B.
p1366
aVWhich I refuse to do.
p1367
aVAaron Aaronson would win every time.
p1368
aVI don't know if it's good idea, IMHO democration is all about choice you either choose to go and vote deliberately or you don't give a fuck and you shouldn't vote on behalf some historical events etc first black president, first female president, or first alien president or whatever else stupid reason you have.
p1369
aVYou want mandatory voting?
p1370
aVDissolve the electoral college.
p1371
aVMandatory voting?!
p1372
aVI want to see the opposite in fact!
p1373
aVI feel you should have to prove that you are intellectually superior to the masses before you are given a world changing power like that to choose the leader of an entire country. 
p1374
aVIt is a good idea, in theory.
p1375
aVThere are better ways to get voter participation up though.
p1376
aVVote by mail comes to mind.
p1377
aVI have not heard a single complaint from people who have that policy instituted.
p1378
aVMandatory for illegals too right?
p1379
aVYup.
p1380
aVAnd all votes are for our glorious leader. 
p1381
aVMake it a national holiday.
p1382
aVWhen you vote you get a voucher.
p1383
aVYou turn it into your employer and you get 150% of your regular wage, compensated by the government.
p1384
aVIf you are unemployed you can include it with your taxes for a higher refund or turn it into the Treasury Department and get a check sooner. 
p1385
aVVote for me, my first act will be to increase your dog biscuit incentive for voting!
p1386
aVIt's mostly big-government liberals that love the idea of mandatory voting.
p1387
aVSo, as a compromise I offer this constitutional amendment:\u000a\u000a"No confidence" is offered as a candidate for every seat.
p1388
aVIf 51% of seats in the house or senate are taken by "no confidence", the federal government is frozen at (spending-10%) for two years, until the next congressional election and no legislative action can be undertaken.
p1389
aVLawmakers are not paid for the duration of the freeze.
p1390
aVThe capitol building is mothballed.
p1391
aVIf the Presidency is won by "no contest" the federal government is automatically disbanded and all powers returned to the states.

aVDon't they know that anyone should be allowed to vote here? 
p1397
aVWere the democrats able to pass this sort of legislation, I would vote against them for the remainder of my life.

aVI may be a libertarian, but I have voted for many members of the Democratic party at the state and local level.

aVI rarely consider party or campaign bullshit when voting, I look exclusively at legislative record unless we are talking about someone who's never been elected before.
p1400
aVMost likely, I would just put an empty ballot through the machine in protest of mandatory voting.
p1401
aVNothing makes me more upset than being forced to do things, to the point that I used to get in serious trouble for not doing things as a kid.
p1402
aVMaybe I'm still a 3 year old, but self determination is more important to me than anything else.
p1403
aVIf I can't succeed on my terms, I'd rather fail on my terms than succeed on someone else's.

aV[deleted]
p1405
aVAbsolutely.
p1406
aVWant to make voting easier?
p1407
aVImplement multiple ways to vote: early voting, absentee voting, whatever.
p1408
aVShit, we hire census workers to go to people's houses to count them... why can't we have a few election workers in each district drive out to people's houses to help them vote if they want to but can't get out?

aVYea but to be fair, who hasn't wanted to choke Chapelle.
p1424
aVI mean seriously.

aVHe left us all hanging!

aVAnd another Dave Chappele skit comes to life. 
p1427
aVOfficer that couldn't have been Dave Chappelle, he was standing on a clock in his front window masturbating with todays newspaper.
p1428
aVAnd look at this!
p1429
aVThe sick bastard planted pictures of himself all over the house!
p1430
aVLet's sprinkle some crack on him and get out of here....
p1431
aVUsed to be that black foster children were not to go to white foster homes as they would lose their cultural identity.
p1432
aVThis event shows that in fact, their cultural identity can be maintained.
p1433
aVNot at all racist.
p1434
aVUPDATE: The wording was just changed to "detained" in the article a few minutes ago.
p1435
aVThanks again fox...
p1436
aVWhat county was this in?
p1437
aVEDIT: Found it, Onslow County, NC
p1438
aVThese sound like good parents with creepy neighbors. 
p1439
aVI'm 24 and when I was younger my parents would let my brother and I do this all the time, we would walk to the video store, walk to the park, etc... We didn't have cell phones or anything and nothing ever happened to us, I really think that this is ridiculous, the kids had an expected time to return just like we always did.
p1440
aVI didn't realize this was a "thing", it was just normal for me growing up, it's not like they let them walk around on skid row in LA or something really bad. 
p1441
aVI'm kind of on the fence about this general issue.
p1442
aVFor these parents in particular, this incident proved the faults in their decision.
p1443
aVSomething happened, the children did not return, and they were completely helpless.
p1444
aVThey didn't even know where the kids were, they were just randomly walking around.
p1445
aVIf the kids had a cellphone and used it, this wouldn't seem as bad of a disaster.
p1446
aVThe kids didn't make it home on time, but didn't demand to use a phone to call home.
p1447
aVSeems like this decision was exposed as a failure in every way.
p1448
aVThe last time this happened with these parents, the son did have a cell phone I believe.
p1449
aVI remember reading about him having a necklace that held his phone so he wouldn't lose it. 
p1450
aVWhen you were ten, did you have a cell phone?
p1451
aVAnd if you didn't, were you forbidden to leave home without your parents?
p1452
aVThat is a good point.
p1453
aVI wasn't aloud out "running the streets" in town alone until I was about 13.
p1454
aVWalking about the woods was a way different story.
p1455
aVWhen I was aloud out in town, I was always required to have money to use a payphone in case something happened.
p1456
aVIn this case, I think the phone issue is a red herring.
p1457
aVThey were with the cops.
p1458
aVSurely the police had access to a phone to call their parents, even if the children didn't have a cell.
p1459
aVWhy didn't they make calling the parents and letting them know the children were there the first priority?
p1460
aVThis is a good point.
p1461
aVIt seems likely the police actively prevented them from calling their parents after the abduction.
p1462
aV[deleted]
p1463
aVGood point, thanks
p1464
aVI know this sounds like an old curmudgeon, but when I was in second grade, I walked a mile to elementary school by myself and no one ever called the police on us.
p1465
aVMy mom grew up in the 1930's in rural Minnesota.
p1466
aVShe and her older brother would walk several miles to school each day, they were 5 and 6 years old.
p1467
aVOne day a car stopped and a man saying he was an uncle tried to get them in his car.
p1468
aVWould have but each time my mom said yes my uncle said no.
p1469
aVWhen my uncle said yes my mom said no.
p1470
aVThey kept this up so long that the guy gave up, got in his car and drove off.
p1471
aVSure enough when he got to the end of the road he turned right, their house was left.
p1472
aVKidnappings were quite common during the depression as people attempted to get money from those they considered prosperous.
p1473
aVI'm afraid that this generation of children is being raised to be afraid of their shadows and that actually could make the world more dangerous for them. 
p1474
aVHaving to sign an agreement to now leave the kids alone ever seems preposterous to me.
p1475
aVThere's a major problem with the way our government works if they control our parenting along with watching our every step.
p1476
aVIt's of no surprise kids at the age of 15-17 are running away to ISIS if the parents have never let them leave their sides, I would wanna run from them as well.
p1477
aVLet the children run free!
p1478
aVReleased and sprung have two very different meanings in this context.
p1479
aVArticle title uses released, OPs title uses sprung.

aVWhen my 4 children were young we built up a lot of doctor's bills, our doctor let my husband work off the debt mowing lawns, and doing odd jobs around their house.
p1482
aVNow if you go to a walk in clinic or urgent care its $100 to $140 dollars up front unless you have insurance.
p1483
aVEven with my insurance I end up paying most of the bill until I meet my deductible and I'm never quite sick enough all year to do that.

aVIf I was her I  would lawyer up and sue the shit out of that whole department for their total lack of competence. 
p1498
aV*In*competence is the word you're looking for. 
p1499
aVNo, in the context I used the word was used correctly.
p1500
aVIf I was to say lack of incompetence, it wouldn't make any sense.
p1501
aVBy definition, competence is the ability to do ones job.
p1502
aVIn contrast, incompetence is the lack of ability to to their job.
p1503
aVSo if I said "lack of incompetence", I would be saying the opposite of what I meant.
p1504
aVI'm really not trying to be a dick here, I just want you to know how to use the word correctly.
p1505
aVEdit: Some words and stuff
p1506
aVIncompetence is the word you use when you are trying to say "lack of competence", yes.
p1507
aVThere is a word for the phrase you used.
p1508
aVThat's what I'm saying.
p1509
aVEDIT: I know what the words mean. 
p1510
aVThis is funny.
p1511
aVYou're being downvoted for being correct.
p1512
aVReddit is becoming more and more like facebook.
p1513
aVsteezy's not being downvoted for being correct.
p1514
aVThey're being downvoted for unnecessarily criticizing someone's sentence.
p1515
aVThere's more than one way to express any phrase.
p1516
aVThere's nothing unusual about saying "lack of competence" and to specifically post something to try "correcting" someone is just inane.
p1517
aVHa, no shit.
p1518
aVThanks for the pat on the back though.
p1519
aVHow much of the spaghetti O's did the cops eat before they realized it wasn't meth?
p1520
aVGiven the state of the world today, he should've known there would be consequences for joking about guns on social media, especially as a student.
p1521
aVI don't really see the police at fault, although detaining him might've been a bit much. 
p1522
aVI disagree.
p1523
aVIt was blatantly in reference to a "dinosaur" and there were no threats made to the school or a specific neighbor.
p1524
aVSo what, it's illegal to SAY "gun" for anyone under the elligible age to own a gun now?
p1525
aVNah, the US are quickly becoming a militarized state.
p1526
aVIt's bullshit and fear mongering and unfortunately the US is the best there is at brainwashing you into thinking this is the norm or even a privilege at that.
p1527
aVPeople are all 'murica this and 'murica that like it's something to be proud of these days, but frankly it's not.
p1528
aVThe healthcare system is a government scam, there's no free education, taxes go to a military to play world police, we're lacking in any kind of updated mass transit system in 90% of the cities, we have ex-military drones being used by the police to watch US citizens, every means of communication is tracked by one agency or another, it's the only god damn nation in the world still using "standard" measurements, Fahrenheit, and a 12 hour time system (AM/PM), people blow hundreds of dollars just to fly around the US and avoid our airports because of how insane we are to non-US citizens and the media has become a sensational super biased joke.
p1529
aVI'm not going to go into all of it, but a country that is supposed to represent the foundations of freedom shouldn't be taking teenage kids into custody over a joke on the internet about killing a PET DINOSAUR. 
p1530
aVIm not saying he was wrong, but imagine what that would look like if he actually was a crazy kid and shot up a school.
p1531
aVThe police knew about it, so there would be this whole thing about how the police didn't do enough.
p1532
aVThey take EVERY gun threat seriously, and they should.
p1533
aVLook at all the random school shooting sprees we've had the last few years.
p1534
aVShould we be so sensitive?
p1535
aVNo.
p1536
aVDo we have to be?
p1537
aVUnfortunately, yes.
p1538
aVIt wouldn't even surprise me to hear about another school massacre.
p1539
aVSo what if they took this kids joke too seriously?
p1540
aVLook at the world we live in.
p1541
aVWe can't expect to say 'gun' so sparingly, when so many people are getting shot. 
p1542
aVPlease...travel.

aVCondescending comment aimed at your intelligence. 
p1544

aVDid he pummel himself in the face?
p1546
aVhow about lets wait until all the information is gathered and examined
p1547
aVI wonder how many more "witnesses" will step forward.

aVI thought it was a Flash Back Friday thing when I saw it this morning.
p1557
aVGood that they are saying it.
p1558
aVNow lets see them back up those words.
p1559
aVThat's awesome, it looks like a small city.
p1560
aVIt looks like it would take an awful lot of effort to keep the panels clean.
p1561
aVI'm not sure, sounds like a job for a robot or at least something highly automated. 
p1562
aVI mean, built in water jets would make it pretty easy but that area doesn't look to be overflowing with water...\u000a\u000aThen again if it's supplying 180K homes with electricity maybe it's worth 100 FT employees just cleaning the panels every day.
p1563
aVI'm sure it's something they have thought through.
p1564
aVYou could probably do it with compressed air and some kind of golf cart type vehicle and use very few people.
p1565
aVI went to school with a kid about 35 years ago that didn't stand for the pledge (In Texas).
p1566
aVWasn't a problem then.
p1567
aVHow is this a problem NOW?\u000a
p1568
aVWhen I was in school a lot of people didn't stand,  self included, not out of protest, but of being a lazy high school students.
p1569
aVAnd im talking early 2000s.
p1570
aVThere was one teacher though who was a veteran, and very patriotic that would send students to the hallway during the announcements if you didn't stand.
p1571
aVOddly enough he was one of the most loved and respected teachers.
p1572
aVI remember at the end of the morning announcements first day he said, "in my classroom you will stand for the pledge or sit in the hall but no one will remain seated in my classroom.
p1573
aV" The rest of the year  everyone either stood up or left, and returned post pledge. \u000a
p1574
aVWas it the same school?
p1575
aVWith the same administration?
p1576
aVDifferent schools, different people making decisions.
p1577
aVYou can't assume one incident (or even several) represent a changing in trends.
p1578
aVOr for all we know, your incedent as not the norm 35 years ago.
p1579
aVThere's always going to be people who think facist behavior (and that is what forced pledges are) is ok, and then there are those who don't.
p1580
aVAs a veteran (since the military folks were called out as a reason why this kid should stand): This kid's opinion is **exactly** what I put my ass on the line to protect.
p1581
aVHe *absolutely* has the right to not say the Pledge, for whatever reason he sees as valid - forcing kids to parrot the Pledge will only serve to indoctrinate them into mindlessly repeating what they're told.
p1582
aVDon't use me and my fellow servicemembers as clubs to beat your children into submission.

aVRelied on nowadays for the notion that the pledge is voluntary and thus the inclusion of "under god" in the text is not a problem, because no one is forced to say it...unless you are in Texas, apparently. 
p1592
aVIt should be criminal to force kids to pledge allegiance to ANYTHING anyway, especially a nation, let alone stand for it if you choose not to pledge allegiance to it.
p1593
aVThe school will lose hands down here, violating his rights roundly.

aVIdk is its a correct argument but is my right to say it...thats until reddit deletes my comments.
p1603
aVyeah, and if he wants due process they should deny him that was well, and if his punishments counts as cruel and unusual then he should take it on the chin, because turning the constitution into the goddamn ship of theseus is really working well for the citizens of this country.
p1604
aVWell, he *is* exercising his right as an American to be totally misinformed and act like a brat.
p1605
aVHe's not misinformed according to the article.
p1606
aVAnd not standing up for the pledge is not bratty.
p1607
aVHe is merely acting upon his right to free speech (or lack thereof) and right to protest.

p1625
aV&gt;Most of them believe\u000a\u000a...that doesn't make it remotely true.
p1626
aVHistorical evidence is a much stronger source.
p1627
aVAnd for the record, I've read blogs and sites from across the spectrum, but I don't think the teaching of History admits to partisan differences, unless those differences stem from a desire to mold the thinking of the audience in a particular way.

aV&gt;  He is facing incumbent Eric Skrmetta, who seeks a cap on how much electricity solar customers can sell.
p1632
aVIn what world does it make sense to cap the amount of energy people can sell back to the grid from their own personal solar panels?
p1633
aVIt's clean it's renewable, it's adding competition to the market potentially opening up new ways of gaining capital to enter the peoples hands without having a big industry middle man.... think i just solved that riddle.
p1634
aVWell for starters competition is just what they don't want.
p1635
aVThere are some costs associated with a two way grid that legitimately have to be born by someone, but obviously this is about the end game of keeping solar out of the market and not that because, bomb.
p1636
aVHere is what they really don't want.
p1637
aVEvery business in the state that has a flat roof and a big AC unit on that roof could put just enough solar on it to meet max pull from that unit and cut what they buy from the utility massively.
p1638
aVThis requires only small changes in the way the grid is structured since they only have to transform DC to AC and send it right back to that building or a nearby AC useing consumer.
p1639
aVThis is lots easier than selling that wattage miles away.
p1640
aVIn a few years when that business switches from tube florescent lights to flat panel LEDs that building just doesn't buy much electricity anymore and that equals a huge income loss for the utilities.
p1641
aVTech is coming very soon that puts them in a position where they either have to get government to let them put massive stumbling blocks in the way of consumer solar or find a way to make industry foot most of the bill for the grid.
p1642
aVThus, bombs.

aVDamn, they are very lucky the police were there so quickly.
p1655
aVThis past summer I was traveling in Europe and 8 Albanians did the same sort of thing to me and the two guys I was with.
p1656
aVThey grouped up on my one friend who instigated the event, but we were never able to press charges or anything because it took the cops 45 minutes to show up. 
p1657
aVMaybe your pal shouldn't have instigated a confrontation with a group of 8 Albanians.
p1658
aVJust sayin'.
p1659
aVWell, I'll tell you more if you're interested, but three of them walked by, and the instigating occurred.
p1660
aVAnd then at least 8 came back and the 'leader'  said, "you say fuck you?
p1661
aVYou say fuck you?
p1662
aV"  and started swinging.

aV&gt;Wendy's\u000a\u000aThis jack ass was robbing a Wendy's?
p1668
aVFor what, $40?
p1669
aVIt seemed confusing that the camera man could get in the line of fire, but once they stopped saying "restaurant" and clarified it was only just a Wendy's, my visualization of the place got much smaller making the chaos and danger of the small space much more likely.
p1670
aVThis part got me - "Officers thought the robbery suspect's Airsoft handgun looked and sounded real" WTF?
p1671
aVAirsoft pistols sound like real pistols now???!
p1672
aV!
aVIts Airsoft's latest feature in realism, Accu-Sound.
p1673
aVIt's meant to compliment their other new feature, Accu-Pain.
p1674
aVYou can check it out [here](http://www.beretta.com/en-us/92-fs/).
p1675
aVAll kidding aside, I can imagine that the robber may have racked the Airsoft Gun's slide or something like that.
p1676
aVThe sound and sight of any pistol's slide being racked could fool anyone into thinking that a gun is an authentic weapon.
p1677
aVIt's understandable how a unfortunate decision, like shooting a guy armed with an Airsoft toy, could be made.
p1678
aVThat does't change that this is a tragedy.
p1679
aVEven if the police officers are deemed not liable, they still have to live knowing that an innocent man died because of their action.

aV&gt;Most of the uninsured, however, don\u2019t purchase car insurance because they can\u2019t afford it.
p1697
aVHel-LOOOO.
p1698
aVWhen I was broke and had to commute long distances to low paid temp jobs with no benefits, I had to choose between paying for car insurance and having enough money for rent.
p1699
aVI had no assets so in a car accident, I had nothing to lose.
p1700
aVPeople think you should buy liability insurance to protect the other guy.
p1701
aVI'd like to point out that that has never been the purpose of liability insurance.
p1702
aVThe purpose of liability insurance is to protect your own assets.
p1703
aVJust ask any wealthy person.
p1704
aVThe concept of trying to pay for liability coverage to protect assets I didn't have when I was semi-homeless seemed stupid.
p1705
aVThere was nothing I could do about it anyway since I couldn't pay for it.
p1706
aVAn economy designed to keep workers as impoverished as possible must expect to have to shoulder the extra costs to society that inevitably arise when the unemployed and the low paid can't afford to participate fully in that economy at the "responsible citizen" level.
p1707
aVThere *will* be uninsured drivers, people who can't afford health care and huge numbers of people who retire into poverty.
p1708
aVA society that embraces the keep 'em as low paid and desperate as possible as the best possible economic model should expect and plan for these  extra costs.
p1709
aVIn my opinion, we should be grateful to low paid workers who do their utmost to be responsible citizens while struggling to survive on not enough income to pay the bills, with no benefits or vacations, sometimes no healthcare and no chance in hell of retiring because they are on the work 'til you die retirement plan.
p1710
aVBecause of their sacrifices, they make it possible for everyone else to pay as little as possible for goods and services.
p1711
aVSince I don't need anyone's face ground in the dirt to save me a dollar, I wish they would just pay you more and pass the cost on to me.
p1712
aVOn that note we should never send consumers to a for profit industry under penalty of law.
p1713
aVIf insurance is required then car insurance companies should get regulated like utilities are. 
p1714
aVThat place you just described, what a shithole!
p1715
aVThis is usually the part where someone earns karma by crying about the 'anti-America circlejerk'.
p1716
aV"Waaaaah, people are making fun of our stagnant, low wage economic model again.
p1717
aV"
aVDear PEW CT and "states":\u000a\u000aThe problem is simple, it's greed.
p1718
aVIt's the same problem with "Health Care" and open internet.
p1719
aVSadly there is no simple solution and seeking better ways to identify those driving without insurance is only looking at a symptom of this plague.
p1720
aVIt's the same old idea that says to charge the people who can't afford to make minimum monthly credit card payments higher intrest, and put people who can't afford court costs in jail.
p1721
aVThe question is how do we solve the greed problem in this society?
p1722
aVStart chatter about adopting ideals of socialist systems.
p1723
aVDon't vote for people who support ideals of capitalism.
p1724
aVShame people who support the things that won't carry society into the future.
p1725
aVSlowly it will work its way into the fabric of society like acceptance of gay marriage and cannabis legalization. 
p1726
aV\u000a\u000aI paid 250 a month from age 16 to age 25 till it lowered to around 100 dollars a month after that.
p1727
aVAt age 27 I ran into a pole and totaled my car, the pay out value of 6500 dollars...after the accident my insurance rate went up to 172 dollars a month.
p1728
aVSo in the time I started driving till the time I had my 1st accident I had paid just over 29,000 dollars in insurance fees.
p1729
aVThis is why I don't pay for car insurance despite being a driver.
p1730
aVIf I'm going to be in accident with another drive I can guarantee it will be at their fault.\u000a\u000a
p1731
aVThe premiums cost more than the fines and then they play the deductible game if you ever do need to file a claim... which, of course, raises your rates to the sky.
p1732
aVIn cali, you can get caught every other month without insurance and it's still cheaper than getting insurance.
p1733
aVAnd let's be honest here, you don't get pulled over for not having insurance, you get pulled over for other things.
p1734
aVDrive like someone sane and you'll basically be fine.
p1735
aVPocket the cash and there's your repair money.
p1736
aVOver here, where drivers are horrible and cars are more expensive, i get $0 deductible, no questions asked full coverage insurance for $700 a year.
p1737
aVI so much as get a scratch on the car, or a broken light, and they'll just fix it... unless the cost exceeds the total paid-to-date premium, there are no increases.
p1738
aVThe dunce cap that you can't take off for a while.
p1739
aVWould anyone do this to their kids?
p1740
aVWhich part?
p1741
aVThe haircut or the pubkic shaming?
p1742
aVBecause public shaming has become very popular over the years.
p1743
aVEither part.
p1744
aVDepends how bad the kids were and how prideful they are.
p1745
aVThis kind of thing would have worked wonders for me as a rebellious, vain teen.

aVi thought this was an onion article at first
p1747
aVReplace discipline with trust and social issues!
p1748
aVWhat could possibly go wrong in 10-12 years?
p1749
aVTLDR;\u000a\u000a'Gallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an organization that provides a regular paycheck.
p1750
aV**Right now, the U.S. is delivering at a staggeringly low rate of 44%,** which is the number of full-time jobs as a percent of the adult population, 18 years and older.
p1751
aVWe need that to be 50% and a bare minimum of 10 million new, good jobs to replenish America's middle class.
p1752
aV'\u000a\u000a\u000aEmphasis added.
p1753
aV&gt;The Big Lie\u000a\u000aIs one day without a Hitler reference too much to ask?
p1754
aVI thought we were trying to talk about something serious.
p1755
aV&gt;Right now, we're hearing much celebrating from the media, the White House and Wall Street about how unemployment is "down" to 5.6%.
p1756
aVYes.
p1757
aVLet's take shots at the White House, Wall Street and the media that Gallup is a part of when both parties and all three branches of government have been fucking things up for years.
p1758
aV&gt;None of them will tell you this: If you, a family member or anyone is unemployed and has subsequently given up on finding a job -- if you are so hopelessly out of work that you've stopped looking over the past four weeks -- the Department of Labor doesn't count you as unemployed.
p1759
aVThat's right.
p1760
aVEveryone will tell you that.
p1761
aVThe government, news anchors, columnists, everyone.
p1762
aVAnytime an unemployment number is reported (always in U3 because that's the established, politically convenient standard) people point that out.
p1763
aVI take people less seriously when they ignore the BLS and play dumb about U3 unemployment vs. U6 unemployment.
p1764
aVTo me, this means the writer is either disingenuous or not an expert.
p1765
aVSince Jim Clifton is Chairman and CEO at Gallup, I'm leaning towards the former.
p1766
aVAlso, unemployment has been a *huge* story for about 9 years.
p1767
aVClifton has been in the same position at Gallup since 1988.
p1768
aVIf the news media has failed to explain how unemployment is counted in the past 9 years, Clifton is as much to blame as anyone.
p1769
aVHe's had the power to explain it, and it's actually all fairly easy to understand.
p1770
aV&gt;Gallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an organization that provides a regular paycheck.
p1771
aVWhat a Walmart-friendly way to measure.
p1772
aV[EDIT] It ignores poverty and the fact that 30 hours won't cut it for most people while still demonizing other measures as inadequate and promoting Gallup.
p1773
aVWe're worse off than both parties and their talking heads say, and I'm really sick of bullshit editorials still trying to make it about "the other guy" masquerading as insightful analysis. \u000a
p1774
aVDoes anyone have a number for what the actual total unemployment rate really is if we factor in all the scenarios previously removed?
p1775
aVTen bucks gets you four fricking gallons, 120 miles of driving if you have decent MPG.
p1776
aVI hope it falls more, *MORE* ***MORE!!!
p1777
aV*** YEYEHEHEHEHEHEEHAHAHAHAHHAHAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

p1788
aVOmitted from this excerpt is that O'neill was offered desk work for [the remainder of his contracted service](http://www.esquire.com/features/man-who-shot-osama-bin-laden-0313) so he could retain full benefits (three years as I recall) and he declined.\u000a
p1789
aVWhy is this not bigger news?
p1790
aVBecause the official story is full of holes and likely bs.  
p1791
aVHow so?
p1792
aVIt would seem like a bad idea to make claims like this if you can't back it up.
p1793
aVHa!

aVHere's some [updated information](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/26/report-gruesome-beheading-detail-revealed-in-oklahoma-food-distribution-plant-murder/).
p1804
aVThis should be considered a terrorist attack imho.
p1805
aVBut likely, it will just be called a disgruntled employee, despite his religious advocacy.
p1806
aVHow is this a terrorist attack?
p1807
aVBecause the intent of decapitating this woman was to spread fear, fear that people like ISIS are working within the US.
p1808
aVHe could have left her dead in many ways, but instead, he chose to behead her when beheading is in the news almost every day because of Islamic terror groups. 
p1809
aVAssuming intent through simple associations in method demonstrates a flawed understanding...in fact some might call it ignorant.
p1810
aVExample: A man kills a person with a gun.
p1811
aVSoldiers use guns, therefore the man must be a soldier.
p1812
aVTrue, false, or not enough information to support that statement?
p1813
aVI used a lot more information than your example, but if you can't understand perhaps you're... ignorant. 
p1814
aVWhat other information?
p1815
aVI'm sorry if I hurt your feels
p1816
aVI have no fels just using your own "logic" against you.

aVHmmm.
p1820
aVWas it a Christian, Buddhist, or a Jew this time?
p1821
aVOh wait...
p1822
aVThis seems very odd, from the way this is reported, to the way the police are handling it.
p1823
aVVery sketchy.
p1824
aVSomehow this will be Obama's fault.
p1825
aVStay tuned to Fox for why.

p1853
aVDo you believe the DOJ, DOD, IRS are independent agencies?

aVTL;DR Hello thought police.
p1861
aV[deleted]
p1862
aVProblem is, they are representing OU and the national organization of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
p1863
aVAs members of SAE and students of OU they actually don't have the right to any opinion.
p1864
aVOU and SAE nationals has every right to disown them if they do something they don't appreciate. 
p1865
aV[deleted]
p1866
aVI disagree that as a society we don't have the right to call out dangerous extremists like racists.
p1867
aVWe should ridicule them, because their opinions are out of line.
p1868
aVThey can still hold those opinions, but neither do we need to stay silent about it.
p1869
aVMaybe a few of these students will realize how seriously we take this issue and will reevaluate their perspective. 
p1870
aV[deleted]
p1871
aVThis is a private matter.
p1872
aVFree speech applies to everyone, and the government acting as a legal body can not supress it unless people are at risk of death.
p1873
aVThey can hate other races and we can hate them.
p1874
aVUniversities are largely independent of the state and are disown whatever hate organization forms under their name.
p1875
aVThe nation portion of the group can do the same.
p1876
aVYou can feel however you want and say whatever you want.
p1877
aVBut if you get caught spreading hate while representing another entity, expect that entity to retaliate to save face and the public to turn on you.
p1878
aV[deleted]
p1879
aVThe public has no right to illegally punish these individuals for their actions.
p1880
aVFree speech is meant to protect individuals from persecution from the Government.
p1881
aVThese individuals have a right to have these opinions privately and the right to express them publicly without the threat of criminal law.
p1882
aVHowever, these organizations (OU and the national chapter) can do whatever they want in their response, whether it's suspending the chapter (check), shutting down the house (check), expelling students (check), and possibly bringing legal action against them for discrimination in their recruiting process (I think they can do this).
p1883
aVThe public has ever right to ridicule these individuals but the rights of the public only go so far as to not infringe on the rights of these individuals.
p1884
aVViolence against them, illegal defamation, and other illegal actions are not allowed.
p1885
aVBut when you say "the public has no right to interject itself", you are certainly wrong in the fact that they are exercising their right to free speech as well.
p1886
aVEdit:  Example,  I can say whatever I want to anyone, but if I tell my boss to f*** off he sure as hell can fire me.
p1887
aVSo I'm not really sure what you're trying to argue *for*.
p1888
aVThat's asking to censor people who don't like it.
p1889
aVThose slurred by what they did deserve to hear how much others condemn their attitudes so they know they are a minority.
p1890
aVThis isn't about outrage, this is about supporting the fellow Americans they are disrepecting.
p1891
aV[deleted]
p1892
aVNope, but I do believe if you think someone may be hurt by the opinion, there is nothing wrong with voicing it that you don't agree is equally allowed.
p1893
aVYou can't stop a minority opinion anymore than you can stop a majority one.
p1894
aVThey both have the right to speak.
p1895
aVIt's up to us to choose whom to listen to or not.
p1896
aVThey're actually chanting about lynching people.
p1897
aVNot just saying that the hate them.
p1898
aVI think vocally supporting racially motivated murder is definitely cause for public outrage.
p1899
aV[deleted]
p1900
aV"You can hang them from a tree, but they'll never sign with me..." That doesn't sound like lynching to you?
p1901
aVYou're right and I agree with you.

aVMore taxes.

p1913
aVOr we could make healthy food cheaper?
p1914
aVor we could just tax fat people?
p1915
aVdon't ruin it for everyone.
p1916
aVmost people do not enjoy higher taxes and if they can save money many will lose a few pounds.
p1917
aVplus a specific fatty person tax will provide them motivation, that yes they are indeed making the wrong decisions.
p1918
aVI like the idea but taxes don't change lifestyles.
p1919
aVTaxing poor people won't make them get jobs.
p1920
aVTaxing fat people won't get them to a gym. 
p1921
aVHow about also including high fructose corn syrup?
p1922
aVSince the corn industry has better lobbyists, I bet that would never fly.

aVPeople are getting smarter, people are getting more wealthy, food is easier to come by for anyone in the US,  environmental causes of violence such as heavy metals poisoning is diminishing, and jobs (or at least other things to do) are not too hard to come by.

p1950
aVAfter watching CNN this morning while making my coffee(not something I watch, my brother had it on), CNN would like you to believe that violence in the US and around the globe is on the rise.

aVAs far as classifying this as a homicide, does this just mean that the incident with the police caused his death?
p1953
aVHomicide includes manslaughter, doesn't it?

aVSome commentators I've seen think this is an identification of murder.
p1955
aVI do wonder how large a role Garner's underlying health issues might have played in the outcome here.
p1956
aVHe was asthmatic and had issues with cardiovascular health no doubt in relation to his obesity and continued (what I assume) poor diet.
p1957
aVShould these policemen be held responsible based on the outcomes of their actions, even if the same interaction with a healthy individual would have caused much less harm?

aVStatement from templeton Rye on [their Facebook page:](https://www.facebook.com/templetonrye) \u000a\u000a&gt;We have been working with MGP on a contract distilling basis since we began and have purchased significant product from them.
p1959
aVWe built a distillery in Templeton and have bottled and hand labeled every drop of our product in Templeton since we launched the brand.
p1960

p1963
aVWe are the largest employer in town and to date have invested more than 1 million dollars in the distillery.
p1964
aV&gt;We are proud of what we have accomplished in building Templeton Rye and resurrecting this great American story that both of our families played a part in.
p1965
aVWe have supported the Templeton community including being the largest employer in town, investing over $1 million in our facility and donating $250,000 toward the new Templeton community center.

p1998
aVIt's for allegedly "slipping a .25 caliber handgun into a teenage accomplice's waistband outside a New York hotel", according to the Huffington Post (not the most prestigious news org., but that's what this MSN video uses as a source).
p1999
aVOrta (the guy who filmed Garner's death) testified that these charges were trumped up "by police in retaliation for his role in documenting Garner's death".

p2024
aVNot only did he say a dumb thing about a law he did not read and just had an intern give their best interpretation of based off of talking points but he also did just this, Spoke on behalf of his company to boycott Indiana while his company keeps getting record sales in countries that have REAL problems.
p2025
aVBut he has no issue filling his pockets, his buddies pockets, and his share holder pockets... you know since its not here in America, nor getting the amount of attention since it doesnt fit any kind of agenda.

p2051
aVI still disagree with using a weapon against your kids.
p2052
aVI think belts are a bad idea, but it seems crazy to consider prosecuting a parent for using one when our schools still spank our kids with paddles. 
p2053
aVThis was in New York, where corporal punishment in schools has been banned for decades.
p2054
aVWell, if you aren't smart enough to convince your child with words, then beat the little brats with a leather belt in front of your friends!

aVDo you have kids?

aVMore likely you'll discover there is a difference between discipline and abuse \u000a\u000a
p2070
aVMaybe you will discover the difference between using *stupidity* in a witty biting response and "abusive" language.
p2071
aVYou accusing me of being abusive while defending the beating of children is funny in its irony.
p2072
aVIf you read the peer-reviewed research I just linked you would see that spanking can be objectively considered abuse by all definitions of the word.
p2073
aVYou thinking these methods of physical punishment are necessary or as common as you suggest are telling.

p2112
aVAs contrasted to the years when they *admitted* to fake vaccination campaigns?
p2113
aVAlso, could they not have administered real vaccinations as part of their intelligence gathering?
p2114
aVI am asking; were the programs administering *fake* vaccinations?
p2115
aVAnd are they reneging in their word if they conduct *real* vaccination programs.
p2116
aVOk, lets get this rolling: \u000a\u000aI believe, in a very kind of nice way, the CIA spend some of its overblown budget, that it gained through vileness and treachery, on setting up vaccination campaigns.
p2117
aVThus far, no problem.
p2118
aVAfter all, fuck, if anybody had the funds to do this, surely the CIA had.
p2119
aVNow, what I have a problem with is their practice of using this as an intelligence gathering mission.
p2120
aVNo idea how?
p2121
aVYou go out, and propose to vaccinate kids.
p2122
aVBecause, why not.
p2123
aVNow, what they don't tell you is that they don't exactly use needles for some vaccinations, also microblades, ect.
p2124
aVSo, over the course of this, you build a database of genetic material of people in this city.
p2125
aVBecause heck, you gave them a free vaccination, right?
p2126
aVNow, what the directly disagreeable thing is this is fucking close to metadata gathering.
p2127
aVAnd we all know, metadata being gathered by the CIA leads to anything from unlawfull drone strike killings to being abducted and tortured by the worst type of human swine.
p2128
aVSo yea.
p2129
aVAs hard as it sounds, I think a court order is in need to force the CIA and every medic worldwide to disclose if they ever worked or work for secret service, asnd if they lie on that, to revoke all of their licenses.

p2158
aVIn my mind he suffered instant karma the moment he went AWOL.
p2159
aVDoes such action merit FURTHER punishment?
p2160
aVThe primary reason for the hate stems from the prisoner exchange that brought him back into American hands.

aVSlovick had to desert over and over again to finally get put in front of a firing squad and even then some of the military leadership was not happy it had been approved.
p2175
aVA handgun from 120 yards???
p2176
aVI think not.
p2177
aV100+ yards with a quick follow up shot is either a rifle or a championship pistol shooter.
p2178
aVThis is what happens when you ignore evidence and continue to chant "hands up don't shoot.
p2179
aV" Now one officer can never have a normal life again and two more had been shot that are completely innocent.
p2180
aVWillful ignorance is responsible for this.
p2181
aVIn reference to the racist e mails discovered, all employees should be terminated immediately and that's being taken care of.
p2182
aVThat doesn't justify any of this though.
p2183
aVYes, one officer that killed an unarmed man with a paper thin convenient excuse of "he was coming right at me" trumpeted mostly by the media, despite the evidence contradicting that.
p2184
aVHe can not have a normal life, boo hoo.
p2185
aVHe may see a court trial yet as the civil law suit brings to light new evidence and understandings.
p2186
aVHe was not found innocent, he was not tried in a court of law.
p2187
aVA tool that is known for its manipulation and lack of reliability, a grand jury hearing, was used to skip charges.
p2188
aVCharges can be brought back up at any time.
p2189
aVThey should  have terminated the whole police force and began investigating the surrounding police forces.
p2190
aVThis is obviously a wide spread and deep seated problem in more than just Ferguson.
p2191
aVThey've fired the police chief and got the judge and states attorney to step down, taken over all the cases, fired at least two other officer, but it is not enough and could not come quick enough for years of rampart brutality that has terrorized a community for what is likely decades.
p2192
aVThe evidence speaks for itself, a grand jury is to decide if they have enough evidence for a trial, they didn't.
p2193
aVYou're free to look at the evidence yourself.
p2194
aVI'm not going to argue past the fact that when someone who just grabbed for your gun and took off and then doubled back at you when you are alone with a weapon, you have to shoot or risk having that weapon used against you, period.
p2195
aVThe issues with the few police officers involved in the email scandal have been taken care of swiftly, officer Wilson was investigated locally and federally swiftly.
p2196
aVThe media joined in with the "hands up don't shoot" claims early on until evidence showed otherwise.
p2197
aVYou're obviously very emotionally charged and biased.
p2198
aVI'm not emotionally charged, you are obviously uninformed of the evidence and biased by media.
p2199
aVI am well studied in the evidence which clearly contradicts the ridiculous media claim that Wilson was charged at.
p2200
aVYou don't get to slaughter someone in the street while they are no longer a threat at all, for some previous threat (the previous altercation at the side of the car that happened ~180 feet away).
p2201
aVThere was more than one police incident contributing to "hands up don't shoot". 
p2202
aVPlease show me this contradictory evidence.
p2203
aVhttp://fox2now.com/2014/11/24/prosecutor-robert-mcculloch-releases-grand-jury-evidence-in-michael-brown-case/\u000a\u000aIt is all there, you just have to understand it.
p2204
aVThe physical evidence proves he was shot several times, likely dying, and headed back towards the police car, which was away from Wilson.
p2205
aVHe likely was not standing up at the time he was executed in the street with a bullet to the top of the head.
p2206
aVAre you wearing your tin foil hat today?
p2207
aVNo, I am just informed.
p2208
aVUninformed.
p2209
aVFTFY. 
p2210
aVStudy the evidence, read the testimonies, and form your own opinion.
p2211
aVThat is what I did.
p2212
aVNo amounts of downvotes by fools who have not will cause me to change my assessment.
p2213
aVThe downvotes this post got as well as on all your replies to /u/XA36 are just despicable.
p2214
aVReddit is a corporate tool just like all the other news outlets.
p2215
aVWhen the riots happened reddit was ablaze with people who couldn't stop parroting negativity towards the people who have been marginalized for decades by the police and justice system culminating in the events of the past few months.
p2216
aVUnderstanding the issue is so goddamn easy too....
p2217
aVA sniper-style attack that could just as easily have killed or injured demonstrators.
p2218
aVI hope the POS shooter is arrested, tried, convicted, and put away for life.
p2219
aVHow could it just as easily injured demonstrators when the target was very obviously cops and the shooter clearly had fine aim?
p2220
aVThat's absurd.
p2221
aVIf you read the news items out there, a protestor who was present described the sound of bullets whizzing past his ear.
p2222
aVThe shooter put more people at risk than just the police he was shooting at.
p2223
aVIt's absurd of you to think otherwise.
p2224
aVAnd your "fine aim" comment is amusing.
p2225
aVIf his aim had been that "fine," the cops hit would be dead.
p2226
aVI hope he gets a grand jury and doesn't go to trial, fair is fair right?
p2227
aVAt least the cops lived.
p2228
aVYes, ambushing people with a gun is certainly no crime at all.
p2229
aVThe shooter tried to kill two police (one of whom will probably live the rest of his life with the effects of the shot to his head) and endangered people who were protesting.
p2230
aV(Protestors mentioned the sound of bullets whizzing past their ears.
p2231
aV) This shooter should definitely walk.
p2232
aVBecause you say so.
p2233
aVAccording to the Ferguson legal system violent gun crimes that result in dead innocent people is perfectly legal, just ask Darren Wilson!
p2234
aVDon't blame me.  
p2235
aV"Innocent" .. attacking a police officer after you just committed a strong-arm robbery.
p2236
aVI wonder what goes through your head.
p2237
aVDude sarcas brah, calm down.
p2238
aVGiven the evidence from the report by U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder's office, "the Ferguson legal system" delivered a just decision in not indicting Wilson.
p2239
aVMike Brown was clearly and repeatedly not "innocent.
p2240
aV" If he had just stepped up on to the sidewalk, he'd be alive today.
p2241
aVHonestly I am surprised this hasn't happened more often since the release of the DOJ report.
p2242
aVA community that has been pushed to the brink now has evidence that they have been systematically victimized by the people they are paying to protect them.
p2243
aVNot saying it's right, but it's not a surprising reaction to a horrible situation.
p2244
aV"This is really an ambush," [said St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar].
p2245
aV"You are basically defenseless.
p2246
aVIt is hard to guard against.
p2247
aV"\u000a\u000aOh the irony.
p2248
aVI wonder if this has anything to do with they plan to fuck the public with the upcoming decision on net neutrality
p2249
aVDoes this report really ask for armed investigators?
p2250
aVMore concerning to me is the FCC'S interference when the IG's tried to hire investigators and the FCC setting up its own IG-like unit without IG or DOJ input.
p2251
aV&gt; "It has also not yet been determined if the motive was a hate crime, domestic terrorism, a personal act of violence against a specific individual, or other motive as there are numerous individuals and entities tied to the building in the vicinity of the explosion," Sanders said in an email to The Times.

aVHeard this while making my coffee.

p2276
aVSgt.
p2277
aVGrubbs... Hope you don't mean you plan to arrest all the "clown terrorists" that are going around making photos in public.
p2278
aVWhether their presence scares people or not, they are well within their rights.
p2279
aVUnless of course, the law has been changed without notice and there is suddenly a law against walking around in clown costumes making photos.
p2280
aVAnd of course, even if a town passed such a law, the Constitution definitely trumps that.
p2281
aVPretty sure you're going to have a lot of fun losing in court on these arrests you're planning...

aVNow if it was say...Stephen hawking that'd be different.

p2303
aVStephen Hawking never was on a TV show...
p2304
aVHawking has been on tv and had his own show. 
p2305

aVWell I see my sarcasm didn't go well. 
p2314
aVI'm no racist, but I hate that man.
p2315
aVYou're not racist if you don't like someone for their actions.
p2316
aVSo sad you have to preface your statement like you did. 
p2317
aVYes you are,  have you been living under a rock or not paying attention to the atmosphere of politics?
p2318
aVJoin me in taking away the phrase "I'm not racist but,.."  From here on in please only use "I'm not racist but,.." followed by a statement that can in no way deal with race.

p2328
aVHa!

p2351
aVI use them because I get 5% off for linking my debit card.
p2352
aVBut those savings can be replicated using bitcoin or other giftcard promotional services.
p2353
aVBut they are cumbersome.
p2354
aVI like the Target near me for most dry goods and groceries because it's never really crowded and and easy experience.
p2355
aVBut I'm losing my patience with them as their service is already horrible.
p2356
aVIt's like the people who got fired from McDonalds work there.

aVthis is pretty fucked, no matter who you're supporting
p2373

p2375
aVSo full of it.
p2376
aVHow can they say that they can't release it because the hackers are threatening to release movies and information online, and then after be like "oh but the reason we aren't releasing it is because it's not a good movie.
p2377
aV" Real slick. 
p2378
aVYeah it's really funny when you look at it from this angle.
p2379
aVYou can imagine these slime ball backless executives sitting around a big table sweating and nervous.
p2380
aVOr better yet their all skyping each other from their secret woodlands cabin/hideouts.
p2381
aVAll in a desperate attempt to solve their public relations nightmare with some unquestionably epic line of bullshit.\u000a\u000a
p2382
aVExactly, that groups comedy doesnt make everyone laugh but sure as hell I am literally rolling around chuckling at their penis jokes.
p2383
aVYour highness, This is the End, Pineapple Express... all good funny movies... to me, all that matters.
p2384
aVOnly reason the movie was pulled from theaters is to protect themselves from the dirt they were sending each other via email.
p2385
aVI mean that last "big" peace of information is how the damn district attorney was pals with them.. remember Zero Dark Thirty?
p2386
aVWas a big scandal of secret information passed to SONY to make a movie glorifying killing a damn icon in the terrorist world, no one was scared of repercussions then.
p2387
aVBut when some well organized hackers straight steal personal emails, bluffed with the email on how racist Amy Pascal really is how the poor 1k+$ plate dinner she was attending on what to say to Obama is only then they decided to give in.
p2388
aVNot to protect peoples lives, they can give two shits about that.
p2389
aVEdited enough so just going to make a new post.
p2390
aVSecretive and select information only given to SONY to make a movie, none of the other movie studios.

aVKinda one sided you think?
p2392
aVI just finished it, watched with my gf, mom and her bf and we all thought it was hilarious..
p2393
aVI'm not sure why people think it's not tbh.. Stop taking it so seriously it's just stupid fun and that's OK... 
p2394
aV&gt;Stop taking it so seriously it's just stupid fun and that's OK... \u000a\u000aYeah ok I guess for stupid people.
p2395
aVPersonally I'm not into stupid fun.
p2396
aVLol no not for stupid people.. Not every movie you see has to be Schindler's list
p2397
aVMel Brooks isn't exactly "high brow", yet he's still regarded as one of the greatest comedy filmmakers of all time.
p2398
aVEnjoying silly slapstick fun doesn't automatically make you stupid.
p2399
aVBut I'd venture to say that making such a blanket judgment about people does, in fact, make you a jerk.
p2400
aVYou could tell it was a crappy unfunny movie from the trailers/commercials.
p2401
aVIt would have sold out just from all the free publicity North Korea was giving it, even if it wasn't funny.
p2402
aVSony really screwed themselves over here.
p2403
aVSo we have corrupt police officers murdering citizens.
p2404
aVThe politicians, the police force and the prosecutors are all corrupt in stopping crime and holding criminals accountable for their actions...
p2405
aVSounds like we need Batman.\u000a

p2415
aVDid it really warrant being removed?
p2416
aVNo!
p2417
aVI don't support the shooting one bit.
p2418
aVBut the number of times someone is shot is 100% irrelevant.
p2419
aVWhen a police officer makes the decision to use his gun it isn't to *wound* the suspect into submission, or *warn them* that the officer means business.
p2420
aVA gun is fired with the intent to kill.
p2421
aVThe highly questionable decision to use the gun needs to be the subject.
p2422
aVNot how many bullets were discharged.
p2423
aVThe head shots seem to confirm that the original intent of Wilson was to kill.
p2424
aVIt looks like he just started firing once he had the gun up and then moved towards Brown's head, rather then going for his legs, or some other place that would actually stop a person, but not kill that person
p2425
aVCops are specifically trained not to shoot to maim.
p2426
aVIt's in fact illegal in the US
p2427
aVSo instead they shoot to kill?
p2428
aVIf you shoot someone 3 times in the leg, that person isn't going to be able to run and most likely will be able to recover from the injuries unless a knee gets blown out.
p2429
aVYou should never train someone to use a lethal weapon as a nonlethal tool.
p2430
aVIt's like fucking for virginity.
p2431
aVYou're just begging for things to go wrong.
p2432
aVGuns are a last resort for police.
p2433
aVYou're only supposed to pull it out if there's literally no other option but to kill the aggressor.
p2434
aVAnd now you see the whole issue.
p2435
aV&gt;Guns are a last resort for police.
p2436
aVIf only that were true in so many cases we see these days.
p2437
aVI am still confused why the cops that gunned down the homeless guy camping in the park are not facing murder charges.\u000a
p2438
aVWell, they're supposed to be anyway.
p2439
aVThe reason for this is simple.
p2440
aVTraining to shoot center mass is simpler in a high stress situation.
p2441
aVThey are trained to shoot for effect,  center mass is effective.
p2442
aVShooting at arms, legs and hands is not easy nor is it effective.
p2443
aVIm going to assume you have absolutely no hands on firearm experience much less training.

p2446
aVIf his hands were raised to surrender, why are his hands/fingers pointing in the opposite direction, towards his body, in these photos?
p2447
aVIf his hands were raised towards the sky, surrendering, his hands/fingers would be up in front of his body with his fingers pointing away from his body.
p2448
aVWas the body moved?
p2449
aVIf it wasn't, his body position disproves his hands being up to surrender and proves his hands were in a downed, charging position.
p2450
aVEDIT: I actually noticed something else!
p2451
aVLook at his leg positions.
p2452
aVOne is straight out and the other is curved at the knee, as if he was in a running stance....
p2453
aVSo, the people claiming he was on his knees when he was still shot at by the officer are completely incorrect!
p2454
aVDid you go to the 9-11 Truther school of forensic science? 
p2455
aVIt's very clear to see.
p2456
aVIf his hands were up, they wouldn't be pointing in the opposite direction.
p2457
aVThere's not enough public available information for anyone to reconstruct the events, or to come to any of the conclusions you're trying to make.
p2458
aVBut, your assertion is false - if he was shot  in his arms first he would have likely dropped his arms and then gone limp if the shot to his eye was next. 
p2459
aV&gt;There's not enough public available information for anyone to reconstruct the events, or to come to any of the conclusions you're trying to make.
p2460
aVOh, yes there is.
p2461
aVYou just disagree with them.
p2462
aV&gt;But, your assertion is false - if he was shot in his arm~~s~~ first he would have likely dropped his arm~~s~~ and then gone limp if the shot to his eye was next.
p2463
aVSee, this is why I think I am correct.
p2464
aVHe was only shot in ONE arm, but BOTH arms are pointing in the wrong direction.
p2465
aVYou don't have nearly enough information, from that picture alone.
p2466
aVIf he was standing it's perfectly possible that his arms fell to his sides before his torso hit the ground.
p2467
aVI doubt he was kneeling (sitting on his heals), or I would expect him to be folded over instead of relativly spread out, and it seems unlikely he was laying down at the time.
p2468
aVNot really expressinng an opinion either way, just saying we really don't have enough quality information yet, everything being tainted by politics as it is, it may be a long time before we do.
p2469
aV&gt;You don't have nearly enough information, from that picture alone.
p2470
aVOk.\u000a\u000a&gt;If he was standing it's perfectly possible that his arms fell to his sides before his torso hit the ground.
p2471
aVWe do know he wasn't standing straight up from the angle of the last two shots.
p2472
aV&gt;I doubt he was kneeling (sitting on his heals), or I would expect him to be folded over instead of relativly spread out\u000a\u000aI can agree, even though, some of the eyewitnesses said the cop was standing over him shooting him.
p2473
aVThat just doesn't seem accurate.
p2474
aV&gt;and it seems unlikely he was laying down at the time.
p2475
aVI agree.
p2476
aV&gt;Not really expressinng an opinion either way, just saying we really don't have enough quality information yet, everything being tainted by politics as it is, it may be a long time before we do.
p2477
aVI agree, but I think posting this information gets people talking about it and anyone can see the image and make their own conclusion.
p2478
aVWhy was it necessary to shoot in first place, even if this supposed struggle did happen, if the suspect was unarmed?
p2479
aVI understood that police carry a baton, pepper spray, and a taser why is it they always just say screw that shit and pull the gun?
p2480
aVBecause not all police departments, especially smaller ones, issue batons, pepper spray or tasers.
p2481
aVThe chances of them ever needing those items is usually as likely as ever having to fire their weapon.
p2482
aVI however do not know if that was the case with the Ferguson PD.
p2483
aVAnd if the officers story is to be believed, Brown assaulted him before he was shot, which most training teaches you to pull your gun and fire, not use a less than lethal option.
p2484
aVAlso there's speculation that Mr Brown went for the officers weapon, which I would see as justifiably use of force
p2485
aVHave you read the reports coming in, in favor of the officer?
p2486
aVIF those are correct, Michael tried assaulting the officer, not once, but twice.
p2487
aVWe want our officers to show restraint, and if these new reports are true, we have exactly that:  the officer didn't start shooting until Michael started charging a 2nd time, which is more than ample restraint. 
p2488
aVYeah it would seem so now and I don't believe wholly the story being given from Michael's accomplice that the cop was lashing out at Michael from his car window.
p2489
aVHowever I'm still upset that given a breadth of "non-leathal" options that there continues to be numerous cases per year of police using firearms against unarmed suspects, and apparently I'm not the only one:\u000a\u000a[op ed on reuters by former KC police chief](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2014/08/19/as-police-chief-i-knew-we-had-no-justifaction-for-killing-an-unarmed-suspect/)\u000a\u000aBut I'm inclined to agree that in this case it is nowhere near as cut and dry as the example in the reuters piece, and yes if it ends up being the case that Michael did double back then I can see a more excusable use of force than was initially reported.
p2490
aVIf anything, at the end of the day I think this case shows again the need for officer's to start being equipped with personal recording devices to eliminate the back and forth accusations happening now.  \u000a\u000a
p2491
aVImproper training.
p2492
aVOver-militarization of our police forces
p2493
aVMilitarized police departments and a failed War On Drugs are why can't have nice things
p2494
aVThis story is so damn sad.
p2495
aVThis family is going to be in a state of fear and stress for a long time to come.
p2496
aVTheir child will have lasting damage and what would have been a fruitful life will be spent trying to cope with injuries.
p2497
aVI sincerely hope the SWAT team made a trip to the hospital (if allowed to) to express their sympathy and extend any help. 
p2498
aVI hope that members of the SWAT team, as well as their commanding officers, are fired and thrown in jail for what was obviously excessive use of force.
p2499
aVThese fucking power tripping pigs are really getting out of hand.
p2500
aVThe country is sinking lower each time this shit happens.
p2501
aVI hope your son recovers.
p2502
aVWhat was going on in '92 that people were so frisky?
p2503
aVWas it some kind of mini baby boom after the Persian Gulf War?
p2504
aVAnd most won't vote in the midterms
p2505
aVLol and I just turned 22 yesterday.
p2506
aVGlad to be part of the majority haha
p2507
aVMY PEOPLE
p2508
aVwhich is troublesome because how many of them have a college education (a lot) and how many of them have jobs (a little)
p2509
aVSpent a lot of money and debt learning how to be a populist robot.
p2510
aVNo real education unless you're specializing. 
p2511
aVI understand downvoters in most reddit threads, but not this time.
p2512
aVYou really have to be a complete moron to not realize there's an issue here.
p2513
aVAnd to the downvoters: BRING IT ON.
p2514
aVYou probably can't even integrate sec(x) dx
p2515
aVNot after Elliot Rodgers, amirite?
p2516
aVI don't see the issue here.
p2517
aVThe purpose of an execution is to kill someone.
p2518
aVWho cares how it happens, as long as it does.
p2519
aVI'm sure that he didn't afford the poor girl he killed a pain free death, so why should he or anyone else get it easy?
p2520
aVPeople in the United States have rights against cruel and unusual punishment as a provision of the [Eighth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) to the US constitution.
p2521
aVArguments about the general morality of the death penalty aside, most first-world countries that have any sort of punitive justice system have stipulations that enforce consistency and even-handedness in sentencing.
p2522
aVThe idea is to keep the court system as objective as possible, to serve as a source of justice, not retribution or vengeance.
p2523
aVIn this case, the "Unusual" clause of the amendment is important; barring unusual punishments means that as a judge, I cannot knowingly sentence someone to die in a way that is inconsistent with prevailing standards just because I think they "deserve it".
p2524
aVI can't mandate that a convict be crucified, burned at the stake, drawn-and-quartered, stoned to death, fed to pigs, etc.
p2525
aVLikewise I cannot sentence someone to be strapped to a table and administered a procedure that induces a long, lingering heart attack and leaves them partially conscious and gasping feebly for the duration.
p2526
aVRegardless of their crimes, as a country we have decided that even for the most heinous offenders we must not sink into sadism under the guise of being just.

aVad hominem
p2555
aVIt's not ad hominem, it's an honest news event and a critique on the content of one's arguments (and by tertiary one's character for making such arguments).
p2556
aVIt is not a red herring used in response to an argument to distract from said argument (according to the definition of ad hominem).
p2557
aVUnless, of course you are commenting on Ellen Pao's lawsuit against a former employer as being an ad hominem.
p2558
aVThen, of course, yes you are correct that Ellen Pao used an ad hominem attack against a former employer to distract from the real reason that she was fired \u000a\u000aIrony.
p2559
aVI believe that's called a 'political cartoon'
p2560
aVAhhh... yes, satire!
p2561
aVApparently, that's banned here because you are not allowed to criticize the kafkaesque reddit burea-o-kraut-acracy!!
p2562
aV!
aVIt's fine to criticize Reddit, they have problems.
p2563
aVBut who she slept with doesn't really have much to do with her lawsuit.
p2564
aVI agree with you that her lawsuit was unjustified.
p2565
aVBut that's our opinion, not the news.
p2566
aVIt's not ad hominem, but it's editorialized.
p2567
aVFurther, it's an image macro related to current events, but there's no informational material.
p2568
aVI guess you're mod, but if this passes for content in /r/usnews, I'm out.
p2569
aVNot because I disagree with the spirit of the submission, but because I expect a more serious space.
p2570
aVI respect your opinion, and largely agree with you.
p2571
aVIt is, however, the modern day equivalent of a political cartoon.
p2572
aVI do, indeed, ask that people *try* not to editorialize, but I often allow some opinion.
p2573
aVit's impossible not to have opinions and be biased, but it is possible to be honest and diplomatic about it.

p2592
aVI'm happy to have that discussion as long as it is constructive and civil.
p2593
aVI had this one guy that I had to reluctantry ban after numerous warnings, and he changed user names to do a self post accusing me of being some sort of "faggot nigger" if I recall correclty.

aVHe's saying they're already an established power and that we shouldn't allow them to expand their influence to country x, y and z. 
p2604
aVJust to be safe, they probably shouldn't be allowed to control any more cities in Iran.
p2605
aVOtherwise, as more Iranian cities come under the control of Iranians, the rest of the Iranian cities will also come under Iranian influence and the next thing you know, they'll fall like dominoes and then the entire country will be under Iranian control.

p2639
aVOf course I hate what the monsters did, what in the world does that have to do with whether or not I agree with Fox showing the entire footage?
p2640
aV3.
p2641
aVThey haven't showed the full footage of anyone else being executed.
p2642
aVWhy start now, with a Jordanian?
p2643
aVWhy not air/display all the others?  
p2644
aVYou do realise that out of all the other execution videos released by ISIS, this is the only one Fox News have shown?
p2645
aVThey have not shown a single other execution video released by ISIS.
p2646
aVFox is just following W's lead by "catapulting the propaganda".
p2647
aVBut why are aiding ISIS?\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p2648
aVBecause they are publicising their material.
p2649
aVThe whole point of a terrorist organisation is attention and terror, give them that and they have won.
p2650
aVRight.
p2651
aVI was saying that Fox News was aiding ISIS by publicizing the ISIS propaganda.
p2652
aVSo, why would they be doing that?
p2653
aVI really think this is disgusting.
p2654
aVIf you wanted any evidence that Fox is perpetuating terror, here it is.
p2655
aVWhats disgusting is what they did to this man.
p2656
aVThis video should be showed to the public; the general public doesn't truly understand the inhumane things this group is doing to people.
p2657
aVBy posting this video I feel they are saying "see we aren't perpetuating terror or fear mongering" this stuff is really happening and we don't support it, we should be trying to stop it.
p2658
aVBut ISIS **WANT** people to watch this.
p2659
aVThey released it.
p2660
aVAll Fox are doing is helping them.
p2661
aVHow are they helping them?
p2662
aVThe audience that news site panders to are not going to change their mind and join ISIS.
p2663
aVInstead of just believing what we are told, they are literally showing you the outcome of an ISIS threat.
p2664
aVI think they are doing a little more due diligence on behalf of the public for a change.
p2665
aVSomething I think you should be happy about rather than hate on them.
p2666
aVThe site is also very clear about what the video is, they didn't just spring it on people.
p2667
aVWhat would your reaction be if CNN or MSNBC posted this video; and try to respond objectively with no emotion.
p2668
aVISIS have been releasing execution videos for months now.
p2669
aVShowing these videos is spreading what ISIS want you to spread, which is fear.
p2670
aVShowing the videos, and them getting air time are exactly what they want.\u000a
p2671
aVIt's easy to take the point of view that whatever they want, we should ensure that the opposite happens.
p2672
aVBut in reality that may not be in the best interests of humanity.
p2673
aVIf they had killed him in secret and someone had recorded it clandestinely, then would you argue that the video *should* be shown because they would rather it *wasn't*?
p2674
aVI can see your point about not wanting to give them attention, but the reality is that they *are* engaging in this kind of indiscriminate killing, and ending their reign of terror may be best accomplished by ensuring unified opposition against them.
p2675
aVPerhaps they have taken the old maxim "no such thing as bad publicity" too literally, and in doing so they may have become their own worst enemy.
p2676
aVIn that case, maybe in the end we are fortunate that this video exists.
p2677
aVDo you not realise that ISIS have released many many other execution videos?
p2678
aVGraphic high-res videos of people, Americans, being beheaded.
p2679
aVAre you aware these videos exist?
p2680
aVWhy did fox only choose to show this one?
p2681
aVI disagree.
p2682
aVThis seems to be different.
p2683
aVMaybe the world needs to see how cruel and inhumane this group is. 
p2684
aVHow are they perpetuating terror?
p2685
aVThis is reality.
p2686
aVIgnoring it won't make it go away.
p2687
aVThere are people around the world, and in America that have forgotten 9/11 .. it is time to wake up to the horrors heading our way.\u000a\u000a
p2688
aVBut these are people who have recorded this act in order to show the world, and all Fox are doing is helping them.\u000a\u000a
p2689
aVBut Fox isn't the only one with it on their website, so attacking them alone is stupid and immature and shows a bias.
p2690
aVIf someone is going to attack them for doing something others are, and the others aren't mentioned, then the attack is done out of hate (an ignorance in that hate).\u000a
p2691
aVShow me another news site with the video embedded?
p2692
aVhttp://www.breitbart.com/\u000ahttp://www.theblaze.com/\u000a\u000aThose are two I know of right off the top of my head and whose sites I've been to and know its there.\u000a\u000a
p2693
aVTwo more outlets that are just as far-right, anti-Islamic and pro-war as Fox. 
p2694
aVSo.... care to provide links to them embedding the video?
p2695
aVThat's right.
p2696
aVYou can't.
p2697
aVBecause they haven't.
p2698
aVIf Fox is taking some "amazing" stance on this, why didn't they show any of the other execution videos?
p2699
aVI hate that the author thought it necessary to put in puns like "highs outweigh the lows" or "pretty dope".
p2700
aVThe Land of the free they said
p2701
aVThis is... what's the word I'm looking for?
p2702
aVOh, right.
p2703
aV_Bullshit._
p2704
aVI feel sorry for the kid and mother.
p2705
aVTimes have changed so much.
p2706
aVI had about the the same amount of freedom as a child.
p2707
aVHad to stay on sidewalks, and couldn't cross major street. 
p2708
aVThis is from August.
p2709
aVWe've already put our pitch forks and torches away.
p2710
aVYeah, I'm going to go ahead and trust the doctors on this until a family member can provide some proof beyond "she still had heart and lung function.
p2711
aV" Unless one of them is in fact a medical professional, I highly doubt they have to knowledge to make that call.
p2712
aVAlso, Fox News
p2713
aVare you retarded or just a college freshmen trying to be trendy? 
p2714
aVRetarded for pointing out a story from a disreputable "news" organization?
p2715
aVDoesn't seem retarded to me.
p2716
aVIn fact the story seems very analogous to anti-ACA "death panel" nonsense.
p2717
aVPerhaps a thinly veiled story designed to erode confidence in the american medical system. 
p2718
aVThat's why I will never put donor on my DL.
p2719
aVNope.
p2720
aVIdiot.
p2721
aVIf you truly consider doctors or the medical establishment as a whole to be so morally corrupt that being murdered by them is a real threat to you, don't worry about your driver's license.
p2722
aVJust think of this: If those doctors truly shut off life support on a living person to illegally procure organs (which I highly doubt), do you really think they will care much about what is written on your driver's license?
p2723
aVMurdering helpless patients to get their organs isn't exactly a petty crime, simply "misinterpreting" a worn driver's license is peanuts compared to that.
p2724
aVCertainly less reckless than killing a 26 year old girl under your care in the presence and under the protest of her immediate family.
p2725
aVJust think of the money they could have made by keeping that brain-dead girl's body; decades of medical care and expensive life support...
p2726
aVIf doctors are this morally corrupt and reckless, you better never set foot into a hospital again, never call an ambulance in medical emergencies again, get treated by professionals for any ailment be it a broken leg or end-stage lung cancer, buy at a pharmacy an so on.
p2727
aVIt won't even help you in case you get in an accident, for it will be others who call in the ambulance.
p2728
aVYou also might be interested to learn that working at a hosptial isn't exactly the easiest way to make quick cash.
p2729
aVIf you've got a medical degree and just want to make money, you won't have to put up with 24+ hour shifts, constant stress, an endless stream of paperwork and emotional turmoil.
p2730
aVYou probably won't find those doctors in emergency rooms or intensive care units.
p2731
aVStill that doesn't make them evil monsters.
p2732
aVPlenty of people are greedy, yet very few are willing to murder others for greed alone.
p2733
aVBut if you are one of the few people in our society that is willing to disregard laws, social norms and any morality whatsoever just to become rich, you won't become a doctor to begin with, much less work at a community hospital in Arlington.
p2734
aVI for one have decided that I rather risk getting cut open alive by an evil surgeon than dying in agonizing pain from an infected wound because I'm too afraid of doctors.
p2735
aVWhy bother with a trial?
p2736
aVWhy waste time and money?
p2737
aVTake him out back and shoot him.
p2738
aVHe claims he didn't do it.
p2739
aVYou remember hearing about those dudes recently who were in jail for 20 some odd years for rape until DNA evidence cleared them?
p2740
aVNot saying this guy didn't do it but he deserves a trial. 
p2741
aVWould anyone claim they did do it?
p2742
aVSome people confess during interrogation and plead guilty. 
p2743
aVYes, some people are coerced into confession, I know.
p2744
aVBut based on my view from 2000 miles away and an armchair law degree, the evidence here is pretty solid.
p2745
aVAnd that's just the stuff they made public - there is always more that law keeps secret.
p2746
aVWhy waste time and money.
p2747
aVHaha, yeah I hear ya, it looks like a pretty strong case against him but if that was the case every time where strong cases resulted in instantaneous execution there would be a lot of fuckups and a lot of innocent dead people.
p2748
aVDid you hear about that kid [TJ Lane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardon_High_School_shooting#Shooter) who shot up a bunch of younger kids, wore a t-shirt to trial that said "killer" written in permanent marker?
p2749
aVI think he's in jail for life and for folks like that I agree they should just get shot.
p2750
aVThey still deserve a trial to keep things on the level but there's no reason to waste money keeping him alive in jail, just kill them with a gun out back and dump his body in a hole or burn him or something.
p2751
aVEh who knows though.
p2752
aVSometimes in movies you see characters execute people and you feel that they are justified and it all happens outside of court.
p2753
aVI think trial is just kind of a safeguard to confer with other people that the execution is just.
p2754
aVFuck him, but everyone deserves a fair trial, and you know it.
p2755
aVDon't be dense.
p2756
aVSpot judgement of one sets an incredibly dangerous precedent.
p2757
aVWho knows, maybe you could be accused of murder and rape tomorrow.
p2758
aVI guarantee if that happened you would want to eat your words. 
p2759
aVYea I agree, innocent until proven guilty and all that, you're right...
p2760
aVWe want the prosecutor to present all the evidence so that everyone can see what a lying, horrible dirtbag this is.
p2761
aVWe don't want anyone feeling sorry for him, thinking he was railroaded.
p2762
aVThey can take big chunks of my taxpayer money to make it clear to all and sundry that this guy is a violent, evil, pathetic coward who feels justified beating someone to death who had the audacity to tell him no.
p2763
aVThe police have eye-witnesses, DNA, other physical evidence.
p2764
aVDisplay it all so that no one can possibly think he had an excuse for doing what he did.
p2765
aVBecause your rights will be as worthless as his if they are denied so callously. 
p2766
aV&gt;The teacher was alone in a classroom with no guard nearby on Jan. 30 when a convicted rapist assaulted her.
p2767
aV&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;\u000a\u000a&gt;The claim says the department "failed miserably" in its duty to keep the teacher and other employees safe.
p2768
aVYeah, I'd say that's a bit of an understatement.
p2769
aVNot going to show that in news...
p2770
aVActually it was just on dateline.
p2771
aVIt's fucked up.
p2772
aVHe didn't put his hands behind his back when the cops told him to.
p2773
aVSo they'll justify choking him to death.
p2774
aVI haven't heard of any charges being brought up on the NM cops whot shot a homeless man to death.
p2775
aVhttp://youtu.be/rrV9plIPySA Cops can do what they want.
p2776
aVGood ol' protect &amp; serve.
p2777
aV'Merica.
p2778
aVWow.
p2779
aVIt looked like he was just starting to get down when they shot him.
p2780
aVThat's fucked up.
p2781
aVI wouldn't go as far as calling him a "gentle giant"-- and before you sharpen your pitchforks, it's only because we don't know this guy.
p2782
aVThat being said, the video is extremely hard to watch.
p2783
aVSure, he pulled his hands away while they tried to cuff him, but once he was on the ground he was cooperative.
p2784
aVAnd why would you ignore his complaints of "I can't breathe"?
p2785
aVEspecially when you got a full grown man shoving his head down for no apparent reason??
p2786
aVLastly, if you're going to be an emergency responder, *respond to the emergency*.
p2787
aVI don't see anyone attempting to give him CPR or in any hurry to give this guy some medical attention.
p2788
aVWhy be an EMT if you just want to stand there and look pretty?
p2789
aVAnyway, this whole thing was so depressing.
p2790
aVIt needs to stop.
p2791
aVok, so you want to jump in there to give him CPR while the cops are on top of him.
p2792
aVTalk about getting shot by the cops if you try to do that.
p2793
aVHaving said that, I'm saying he was innocent or didn't deal illegal cigarettes but getting killed for that is beyond any law. 
p2794
aVIf there's communication, there should not be no forced CPR nor shooting.
p2795
aVThey should all be professionals.
p2796
aVYou mean to tell me someone in handcuffs has never received aid from a first responder?
p2797
aVCome on.
p2798
aVAnd yes, being killed for a petty crime is beyond any law.
p2799
aVThat I do agree with.
p2800
aVI have seen police abuse countless times in my life.
p2801
aVNo, just the left half of the US is.
p2802
aVThe right half has enough or too much.
p2803
aVYeah, it strikes me as more of a matter of poor distribution than actual supply.
p2804
aVCollect, store, and slow rainwater.
p2805
aVYes, probably a coincidence. 
p2806
aVThere is certainly a strong correlation, but more work needs to be done. 
p2807
aVProbably a coincidence unless/until a scientifically verified study demonstrates any kind of causality.  
p2808
aVAgreed.
p2809
aVDo you think there was ever a scientific study during Prohibition to see if making alcohol illegal might have helped Al Capone make $1 Million a week in the 20's?
p2810
aVI don't believe that I've ever heard of one.
p2811
aVAnd the FBI strongly denied that there ever was a organized crime syndicate.
p2812
aVCorrelation does not imply causality.
p2813
aVAbsolutely true.
p2814
aVThere was a rumor that Buddhism had taken hold in parts of the city, so maybe that affected the numbers.
p2815
aVMore people meditating and less people to kill.
p2816
aVwell duh, no shit.
p2817
aVThat asshole pissed me off so much today!
p2818
aVI think I'm gonna grab my gun and put it down cuz damn those trees look good...
p2819
aVThem thugs are too stoned to murder.
p2820
aVThey would, but they spent all their bullet money on pot and munchies.\u000a\u000a
p2821
aVThese statistics are especially convincing considering the short amount of time that this drastic reduction in crime has taken place.
p2822
aVIn just one short year the number of homicides dropped by 52.9%.
p2823
aVSexual assaults were reduced by 13.6%.
p2824
aVRobberies were down by 4.8% and assaults were down by 3.7%.
p2825
aVNot quite.
p2826
aVYou said "in just one short year" but it's only been a few months.
p2827
aVThe sample size is too small.
p2828
aVPresuming those rates are yearly, you have to adjust for seasonality too.
p2829
aVCommon sense dictates that social interaction causes murder, and people aren't out and about during the wintertime that took up most of the nascent legalization period.
p2830
aVYou have to wait a whole year before making inferences.
p2831
aVAnd - let's not forget - when the numbers are small to start with, the percentage change looks bigger on paper.
p2832
aV...this is news?
p2833
aV&gt; Mesa\u2019s attorney, Mark Gardner, said she\u2019s not a pedophile.
p2834
aV&gt;\u201cShe was not preying on people who had no interest in participating,\u201d Gardner said.
p2835
aVI don't think they know what the word 'pedophile' means.
p2836
aVExcept that pedophilia is defined as an attraction to prepubescent children which these kids aren't.
p2837
aVNot sure what the right term is.
p2838
aVI'm sure there is one out there.
p2839
aVEDIT: Holy Shit there are terms for a bunch of age ranges:  \u000a0-3 Nepiophilia Babies  \u000a0-11 Pedophilia--Prepubescent  \u000a11-14 Hebephilia--Pubescent  \u000a15-19 Ephebophilia--Post Pubescent kids  \u000a20+ Teleiophilia--Adults  \u000a60+ Gerontophilia--Elderly  \u000a
p2840
aVThe male sentence would have been death by mob
p2841
aVShagalicious, baby!
p2842
aVApparently not a consequence free environment :(
p2843
aVShe seems like that girl that beat up that autistic chilc, isn't she?\u000a
p2844
aV&gt; She\u2019s facing two counts of electronic solicitation of a minor and could get up to 22 years in prison when sentenced in May\u000a\u000aIs that the male sentence or the female sentence?
p2845
aVSo many fish in the sea and this hoe looks towards school teens?
p2846
aVSchools of fish.
p2847
aVShe took it literally.
p2848
aV52% of 1687 people surveyed.
p2849
aVStatistics annoy me. 
p2850
aVThis has been stretched out for decades in order to put off having to talk about something important like privacy, economic inequality, and corruption.
p2851
aVThis works in tandem with gay marriage.
p2852
aVGay marriage is way more of an actual issue than this.
p2853
aVDenying American citizens their rights based on religious discrimination is appalling and I'm not really sure how you can compare it to smoking weed.
p2854
aVI know couples personally that plan to stay with each other for the rest of their lives, but don't want to get married because they don't see the point.
p2855
aVThey are just "meh" about it.
p2856
aVThere are some fringe benefits, the posterchild reason (filing joint taxes) is not nearly as helpful as people commonly believe.
p2857
aVI actually think it's more of a non-issue than weed.
p2858
aVWeed has medical uses.
p2859
aVFor some people it's the only pain relief they can get.
p2860
aVIt helps in a couple other areas as well.
p2861
aVAs far as the general population, the right to pursue altered states of mind is more basic than the right to be viewed by the state as a single financial entity with your spouse.
p2862
aVAnd we're living in an evolved form of slavery called Capitalism.
p2863
aVThere are way more important issues that need to be resolved rather than rile up the christian bigots so we can have the Dr. Zhivago of circus politics.
p2864
aVI can understand not really caring about the "marriage" part cause I mean really its just a ceremony.
p2865
aVBut since getting married last year my tax situation is better, we pay less for joint health insurance through my employer, get a better rate as a married couple on auto/home insurance relative to being two single people, when we apply for a loan most places will pull both people's credit if they're married and use the lowest rate.
p2866
aVI also understand that many gay couples have issues sometimes with life insurance beneficiaries and other death benefits like from the military.
p2867
aVPossibly you're friends are just young and haven't realized these things yet, or I guess just really don't care which is certainly their right.
p2868
aVAt the end of the day it just really bugs me that there's even a discussion here, there's no ambiguity involved; all American citizens are guaranteed equal rights under the law, its frustrating and infuriating to see politicians wasting their time on this I agree but that doesn't mean the issue should be ignored.
p2869
aVWell we're not actually having a discussion about whether gay people should have their marriages recognized by the government.
p2870
aVI'm saying this is a non-issue because none of the politicians give a flying fuck about gay marriage.
p2871
aVThey are using it to get the most bigoted half of the country to make some noise, so that they can ignore real issues.
p2872
aVYou know, issues like prisons being a private industry.
p2873
aVOr the mass collection of peoples private communications.
p2874
aVNot missed tax credits.
p2875
aVI think gay marriages should be recognized too.
p2876
aVBut I look at it like people marching, holding up progress, expending all this energy writing their congressman, filling up the nightly news, because you can't rent a car before age 25.
p2877
aV&gt; So really?
p2878
aV...you're going to let *this* derail our democracy?
p2879
aVThis is all it takes?\u000a
p2880
aVCut taxes to middle class, as long as you don't cut the cuts to the upper class, everyone will support it.
p2881
aVIn a lot of these cases, they're trying to do both: Either cutting taxes for everyone, or pairing it with cuts for businesses/the wealthy.
p2882
aVIt's always florida
p2883
aVFlorida Woman strikes again.
p2884
aV/r/floridaman
p2885
aVFucking hell... We passed gay marriage, but noooo, we couldn't just have a decent month in Florida.
p2886
aVSorry guys.
p2887
aVThis state sucks.
p2888
aVWish we knew if he/she was infected during Duncan's first or second visit.
p2889
aVNeed an objective source and not a random caller in to The Blaze.
p2890
aV&gt;More than a dozen witnesses... **police sources reportedly told** St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Christine Byers\u000a\u000aNames one anonymous source...\u000a\u000a&gt;**an alleged friend of the officer**, identified only as Josie, shared what she claimed to be Wilson\u2019s recollection of events.
p2891
aVI don't know, that sounds a little fishy.
p2892
aVSo one of the officer's friends just happened to be there?
p2893
aVIs it any more fishy than a bunch of witnesses in an area that has an almost to-the-person distrust and hatred for the cops coming forward and unequivocally saying they saw the officer "Shoot him in the back while his hands were up", something two autopsies so far have yet to show was at all likely?
p2894
aVNo, it's just as fishy.
p2895
aVI don't think we'll ever get a straight story at this point because the witnesses seem to have a bias towards one side or the other.
p2896
aVI'm still kind of wondering about the whole "Bullet fired from inside the squad car.
p2897
aV" It would seem like that would heavily influence how believable either side was if it could be reliably placed in the timeline of the guy getting shot.
p2898
aVSurprisingly,  Glen Becks website may not be impartial news...
p2899
aVThere weren't more than a handful of witnesses in the first place, if any (legitimate ones), let alone more than a dozen

p2902
aVIf his hands were raised to surrender, why are his hands/fingers pointing in the opposite direction, towards his body, in these photos?
p2903
aVIf his hands were raised towards the sky, surrendering, his hands/fingers would be up in front of his body with his fingers pointing away from his body.
p2904
aVWas the body moved?
p2905
aVIf it wasn't, his body position disproves his hands being up to surrender and proves his hands were in a downed, charging position.
p2906
aVEDIT: I actually noticed something else!
p2907
aVLook at his leg positions.
p2908
aVOne is straight out and the other is curved at the knee, as if he was in a running stance....
p2909
aVSo, the people claiming he was on his knees when he was still shot at by the officer are completely incorrect!
p2910
aVAre you an investigator?
p2911
aVIf so, carry on, but more than likely you should just sit down and shut up. \u000a
p2912
aV&gt;but more than likely you should just sit down and shut up.
p2913
aVEveryone should just sit down and shut up while the investigation is going on, but NO ONE is doing that.
p2914
aVSo why are you adding to the noise?
p2915
aVIn fact I saw you copied your comment over to another thread...why?
p2916
aVChill dude/dudette
p2917
aV&gt;So why are you adding to the noise?
p2918
aVBecause both sides deserve to be defended.
p2919
aVIf you look at my history, I actually thought the marks on his arm as being indicative of him with raised hands surrendering.
p2920
aVThis makes it less likely, IMO.
p2921
aVI am sure mostly all of the people paying attention have seen those images.
p2922
aVIt's been right in front of our faces, but no one really noticed it until now.
p2923
aVIt's physical evidence that can be seen and I think that is why it is so important.
p2924
aV&gt; In fact I saw you copied your comment over to another thread...why?
p2925
aVI have copied it many times, mostly so people could point out where I could be incorrect.
p2926
aVWhen I first noticed it, it kind of shocked me.
p2927
aVOnly one person so far has given me an explanation, but it doesn't disprove what I say, just that I can't be sure:\u000a\u000a&gt; ...because your body doesn't freeze frame the moment you die.
p2928
aVOn top of that he fell.
p2929
aVOn top of that, if there was any sort of inertia in any direction, his body would be drastically different then the way it was when it was shot.
p2930
aV&gt;Man...this is speculation at it's finest.
p2931
aVI hope you're not basing your entire opinion on this arm chair forensic investigation\u000a\u000aEDIT: .
p2932
aV&gt;Chill dude/dudette\u000a\u000aI would if I wasn't so afraid of emotions getting the better of everyone.
p2933
aVAny information we can find and add to the whole picture and evaluate is worthy of being posted, IMO
p2934
aVHave the police offered them jobs yet?
p2935
aV&gt;What sets me apart, I think, is a tolerance for risk and an intuition about what will happen in the future.
p2936
aVActually, no, this is what sets you apart sir.
p2937
aV&gt;I was selling pillows made by my family\u2019s business, Pacific Coast Feather Co., to retail stores across the country, and the ........\u000a\u000aYou were born into a family with a nice business.
p2938
aVThat one simple fact gave you a HUGE advantage over most everyone else on this planet.
p2939
aVAnd this simple fact alone is why I'll be one of the men holding those pitchforks and I can't wait to stick it into some fat cat and make him squeal.
p2940
aVYou see while you were growing up in your nice rich family, I was putting water on my cereal in a trailer park.
p2941
aVMy dad died at 15 from a preventable medical condition, he didn't have good health insurance you see.
p2942
aVThis left me stuck with my crack addict and alcoholic mother.
p2943
aVFlat out, as a man who started this life with zero material advantages coming from a trailer park and a very poor family, I know that I will never have a chance to live the kind of life that those born into richer families will lead.
p2944
aVOk, maybe a tiny chance.
p2945
aVBut it's only somewhat more likely than winning the lottery.
p2946
aVBottomline is that most of the people who are wealthy and powerful started out that way or at least with a leg up over others.
p2947
aVSince there was never a level playing field for the rich to take such massive advantage of their power and fuck everyone else over is completely unacceptable.
p2948
aVIf the capitalists would just stay out of politics maybe, just maybe we could balance things enough to keep the civilization going.
p2949
aVBut there is no fucking limit to the greed, rapacity and selfishness of the wealthy.
p2950
aVThey avoid taxes anyway they can, they speak out against and fund opposition to programs that help people who weren't born with the rich man advantage.
p2951
aVThey manipulate the governments to lower pollution standards so they can poison us and increase their profits.
p2952
aVThey manipulate the government into wars and get thousands of us poor folk killed.
p2953
aVThey can't even create jobs for us because they are to busy offshoring them to countries with lower standards of living or importing immigrants that will work for lower wages!
p2954
aVThe majority of the ills of society can be laid at the feet of those with power.
p2955
aVIt was those with the power who made this society and it is those with the money who have the power.
p2956
aVIt's time to pay the fucking bill for all that.
p2957
aVAll of those "externalities" are about to take the form of a lynch mob and oh my god how you rich fuckers deserve it.
p2958
aVhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EWMEjj6SMRM/Uygl9edtpkI/AAAAAAAAF1g/4BlNWX3pqVs/s1600/giphy+%282%29.gif\u000a\u000athat was a great reply to this article, I'll be happy to join you with a pitchfork in hand.
p2959
aVI hope u get tons of upvotes\u000a\u000ahttp://i.imgur.com/BdmfX.gif
p2960
aVIt's only a matter of time.
p2961
aVThe people in power aren't going to change.
p2962
aVThey aren't going to suddenly play fair.
p2963
aVThey got to where they are by doing certain nasty things and its likely all they even know how to do.
p2964
aVSo I reckon pitchfork day will be coming soon enough and when it does I'll be glad to have you with me!
p2965
aV[deleted]
p2966
aVHey man, I'm gonna very direct and honest with you because I don't have a lot of time.
p2967
aVFuck your capitalism.
p2968
aVIt aint working for me and mine.
p2969
aVFuck your capitalism right in it's fucking diseased distended asshole.
p2970
aVIf we manually restored the income distribution to 1950's levels, how much of a "windfall" check would I receive from the 1%ers if my current salary is $30k/yr?
p2971
aVConversely, how much is James Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, giving up of his $18.7million salary?
p2972
aVWell considering that this is a total pipe dream I would hazard a guess that our windfall will be something in between jack and squat.
p2973
aVAs for the CEO of JPMorgan and Chase he couldn't be reached for comment as he was busy doing a line of cocaine off a prostitute's ass.
p2974
aVMore importantly... What is the D2F ratio in this middle-out economy?
p2975
aVI have no idea what that is.
p2976
aVIn fact it is such an arcane term that it defies easy and quick google look up as well.
p2977
aVBut somehow I reckon you were expecting my ignorance on this subject.
p2978
aVEnlighten me?
p2979
aVHaha, no.
p2980
aVAlthough I was looking for an actual answer to the question I posed, I wasn't trying to stump, just making a lighthearted joke.
p2981
aVIt is a reference to a joke made on an episode of Mike Judge's HBO series [Silicon Valley](http://youtu.be/pE4LVSESyXc). 
p2982
aVThat explains all the silicon valley references that kept popping up when I would try to figure out what a D2F ratio was.
p2983
aVGood to know Mike Judge is still in business! 
p2984
aVFairies, fudge packers, and boingo boys rejoice!
p2985
aVThe Hoosiers slapped down and the rump rangers have won!
p2986
aVThe judge is a racist.
p2987
aVJus' sayin'
p2988
aVHow is this okay?
p2989
aVIt's okay by SJW standards only.
p2990
aVPersonally I hope this judge catches a bullet.
p2991
aVWhile I agree, my issue is with the fact deadly force is used for a running suspect because his tail light was out.
p2992
aVIf he had just shot someone else then tried to run.. maybe justified.
p2993
aVOh and also tampering with the scene thing too.
p2994
aVHow about... Let's stop running from police officers?
p2995
aVEveryone likes to act like all cops are criminals.
p2996
aVIf they are, then stop running and just cooperate!
p2997
aVIf a guy came up to me with a gun, I wouldn't just start running.
p2998
aVI'd do what he says. \u000a
p2999
aV"Just do what the police say" hasn't worked out very well for a lot of people in the past.
p3000
aVYOU wouldn't run, but he did.
p3001
aVAnd that doesn't mean he needed to die.
p3002
aVI said he  needed to die?
p3003
aVAnd you are saying.
p3004
aVEven if he cooperated.
p3005
aVHe'd still would have been shot?
p3006
aVWhat is wrong with you guys here.
p3007
aVSo much ignorant rage. 
p3008
aVThe police officer is the one that decided the victim needed to die when he drew his weapon and initiated deadly force over what had started out as a minor infraction.
p3009
aVThan while the victim lay bleeding out he chose to tamper with the scene of a crime rather than provide assistance.
p3010
aVBoth parties made some serious errors in judgment, but it doesn't mean either one needed to die because of those bad decisions. 
p3011
aVWhen did I say he needed to be shot?
p3012
aVSweet shit. 
p3013
aVQuit trying to misdirect.
p3014
aVNo one claimed that you said that.
p3015
aVIn fact, my response indicated as much pointing out THE OFFICER decide he needed to die not you.
p3016
aVQuit being so defensive of a guy that may very well get convicted for murder. 
p3017
aVI didn't say that you said he needed to die, no.
p3018
aVEven if he cooperated, he *may* have been shot.
p3019
aVThat's not what happened, so it's impossible to know.
p3020
aVYou're right the likelihood would have been lower, but again there are plenty of instances where complying with police orders leads to bodily harm or death for the suspect.
p3021
aVSomeone wanted the day off.
p3022
aVJust like the Miami. 
p3023
aVHey Hey!
p3024
aVA friend of mine went to high school with that guy and a number of people I know worked with him.
p3025
aVApparently he was never the most tactical nuke in the arsenal.
p3026
aVIt really was lighting the second fore that pooched him.
p3027
aVThis is scary for me because I accadentally left my hotplate on last night when I went to bed
p3028
aVYa, you should probably not do that.
p3029
aVTo me, this is just more evidence that you should never cooperate with social services when it comes to your kids.
p3030
aVParade the kids out, let them see that they're clean, healthy, and uninjured, then tell them to get off your property.
p3031
aVThe people that cooperate with social workers requests end up getting their kids taken, but the ones that threaten them with bodily harm are allowed to keep their children.
p3032
aVThe whole damn system is broken, and if you give them an inch they'll take your kids.
p3033
aVI was about to make my own comments on this article, but at the bottom the author already touched upon why I think the authorities are most likely doing this.
p3034
aVthey do not like the home schooling, it takes the children out of public view and control.
p3035
aVwhen the parents have that right.
p3036
aVEvolution is a matter of survival of the fittest according to the situations confronted with, if everyone was that passive sheep and all hell broke lose then most people wouldn't survive, diversity is good.\u000a
p3037
aVIt seems pretty obvious that they had them under surveillance, who calls the cops on a neighbor because his kids are playing in snow and taking pictures?
p3038
aVYou don't believe there are judgemental assholes that would do this because they don't agree with someones lifestyle and are looking for some way to mess with said people? 
p3039
aVSure I believe it, but you don't just send a squad like that down there based on a "kids in the snow" phone call.
p3040
aVThere is some history here that is not in the article.
p3041
aVTheir "Mineral Supplement" is a dangerous toxic Bleach-like product sold to be drank to cure AIDS, cancer, and many other ailments like your standard snake-oil.
p3042
aVIt has caused many deaths over the last decade and several people have been jailed or sued over its sale.
p3043
aVThey rely mostly on straw sales, by selling it for one purpose and convincing people to drink it as snake oil.
p3044
aVThis event is being used as a marketing campaign to further sales.
p3045
aVThe product relies on a HUGE Internet PR campaign.
p3046
aVIn many reddit posts there seems to be commenters helping to advertise this product and dilute facts with fake-science nonsense.
p3047
aVI can't believe people are defending this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_Mineral_Supplement

p3055
aVI loathe the idea that the state has a right to take children away from loving parents.
p3056
aVBut the truth is any other world would not be one I'd want to live in.
p3057
aVSometimes love is experessed in misguided ways, and at that point the state's obligation to the child exceeds their obligation to the parent.
p3058
aVChildren have rights too.
p3059
aVIt's a fuzzy area, clearly, but it's not appropriate to call it 'medical kidnapping', and it's deeply disingenuous represent it as 'taking the children away just because the parent's don't follow the state's opinions'.
p3060
aVIt's reductionist reasoning, and it doesn't wash.
p3061
aVJust look at the pics!
p3062
aVThose kids look *so* unhealthy!
p3063
aV/s
p3064
aVMan, fuck these assholes.
p3065
aVThey're already taxing fuel.
p3066
aVPerhaps if they didn't spend all of our tax money on themselves and other stupid shit, we wouldn't have crumbling bridges and roads.  
p3067
aVWith gas prices dipping to their lowest level in years, lawmakers in state capitals throughout the USA are increasingly open to the idea of raising fuel taxes to help rebuild crumbling roadways and bridges.
p3068
aVThe movement at the state level comes as House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week that he's doubtful that there will be enough backing for a bi-partisan push to raise the federal gas tax, which has stood at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.
p3069
aVThe Obama administration has also declined to endorse raising the federal gas tax to finance road funding, but says it will take a look at anything Congress comes up with.
p3070
aVState legislators and governors, however, aren't waiting for Washington.
p3071
aVRepublican leaders who typically find talk of raising taxes a non-starter are making the issue a priority in 2015, even though polling consistently has shown broad opposition among Americans to fuel tax hikes.
p3072
aV"The states have shown that they are more likely to act on the gas tax than the federal government is," said Carl Davis, a senior policy analyst at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research group in Washington.
p3073
aV"The states have to balance their budgets.
p3074
aVIf they see, their roads are in bad shape or their bridges are literally falling down\u2014in some cases\u2014they need to come up with a way to pay to improve that.
p3075
aVAnd there's a limited number of things you can do at the state level.
p3076
aV"\u000a\u000aThe increased chatter in state capitals about raising fuel taxes comes after eight states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming) have done just that over the last two years.
p3077
aVSouth Dakota Gov.
p3078
aVDennis Daugaard noted in his State of State speech on Tuesday that when South Dakota last raised its fuel tax 16 years ago, the price of gasoline hovered around $1 per gallon, and about 22% of that went toward state fuel tax.
p3079
aVThe average price for regular unleaded gas in South Dakota is $1.99 per gallon, and the national average is $2.08.
p3080
aVMeanwhile, the price of road construction has ballooned.
p3081
aVIn 2003, the state could get buy about 7.8 miles of asphalt overlay for $1 million.
p3082
aVIn 2013, that same amount of money could pay for 4.5 miles of asphalt overlay.
p3083
aV"Our state highway system is the state's most valuable physical asset and if we want to maintain it, we must act now," said Daugaard, a Republican, who proposed raising the fuel tax by 2 cents per gallon in 2015 and an additional 2 cents each year going forward.
p3084
aVIn Iowa, Republican Gov.
p3085
aVTerry Branstad and Iowa lawmakers have tossed around raising the 22 cents per gallon fuel tax\u2014which has remain unchanged since 1989\u2014or potentially allowing voters in each county to vote for a 1% sales tax.
p3086
aVThe increased revenue would stay in the counties that levy such taxes to be used on road improvements.
p3087
aV"I think Iowans like the idea of having some say on this," Branstad told reporters last week.
p3088
aVRepublican leaders in Utah's legislature have also signaled they will take a look at the state's gas tax, which hasn't been raised since 1998, as they try to grapple with a transportation funding shortfall there.
p3089
aVIn Louisiana, the state's Transportation Funding Task Force has forwarded a number of ideas to lawmakers.
p3090
aVLouisiana has a backlog of $12 billion in road repairs.
p3091
aVAmong the ideas are to replace the state gas tax with a sales tax on all fuels, direct more money in the construction budget to road work, and steer dollars to highways that would end up in the state's "rainy day" fund.
p3092
aVThe intense debate on the gas tax in New Jersey could have ramifications for Gov.
p3093
aVChris Christie's potential 2016 White House bid.
p3094
aVA Garden State trust fund that pays for road and bridge repair is on the verge of bankruptcy, and some lawmakers in Trenton are pushing for an increase in the state's gas tax to replenish it.
p3095
aVGoing along with that idea is a tricky proposition for Christie, who could find himself trying to show his conservative bonafides with Republican donors and primary voters, many who see any increase in taxes as toxic.
p3096
aVThe idea of raising the state gas tax is also unpopular with New Jersey motorists, who enjoy one the lowest gas taxes in the country.
p3097
aVFifty-six percent of residents said they oppose a raise in the state's gas tax, compared to 41% who support it, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton poll published in December.
p3098
aVOne proposal that's been floated by Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski would increase the state gas tax by 25 cents per gallon, costing the average New Jersey motorist about $292 more per year.
p3099
aVChristie did not address the gas tax or transportation funding issues in his much-anticipated State of the State address on Tuesday.
p3100
aVNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie gives the annual\u000aNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie gives the annual State of the State address on January 13, 2015 in Trenton, New Jersey.
p3101
aVChristie did not address an ongoing debate in the state about whether to raise the gas tax.
p3102
aV(Photo: Andrew Burton, Getty Images)\u000aIn Georgia, lawmakers are taking a hard look at the state's 4% sales tax and the 7.5 cents per gallon excise tax as traffic congestion has become a bigger problem for the state.
p3103
aVA study committee recently found that the state needs to raise at least $1 billion more a year to repair bridges and roads in the Peach State.
p3104
aVMichigan is taking a different tact.
p3105
aVThe GOP-controlled legislature there approved a plan last month for a ballot initiative to boost the sales tax to help pay for road repairs.
p3106
aVMichigan Gov.
p3107
aVRick Snyder signed legislation on Monday to spend $1.3 billion a year more to fix roads and other transportation infrastructure, but it's contingent on Michigan voters increasing the state sales tax from 6% to 7% in the May 5 ballot initiative.
p3108
aVMeanwhile, in Tennessee, Republican Gov.
p3109
aVBill Haslam has warned that the state has to do something soon to deal with its crumbling infrastructure.
p3110
aVThe gas tax hasn't been raised there in nearly 26 years.
p3111
aV"At some point and time soon\u2026I think there will be a bill about gas tax," Haslam recently told The Tennessean editorial board .
p3112
aV"It's incumbent upon us as the administration to show here's what we would do with that money if you increased the fuel tax, and then it's also I think important for all of us not to just increase it so that ... three years from now we're back in the same position.
p3113
aV"
aVAlways great to see our elected leaders being so myopic. 
p3114
aVso how is this guy not labeled a terrorist?
p3115
aVSo a guy who is in trouble with the law is asked to give the FBI information about anything abnormal "in exchange for favourable treatment in an unrelated case".
p3116
aVSo hearsay!
p3117
aVAnd yet where are the American reports of this action, or is the BBC trying something out for the State?
p3118
aVHave to keep in mind this kinda stuff happens fairly often.
p3119
aVThe American Gov't would be terrified if every instance was reported on in it's domestic media.
p3120
aVThen again, most people wouldn't notice due to a marathon of Duck Dynasty. 
p3121
aVWonderful news!
p3122
aVLess smoking and better detection, prevention and treatment are attributed.
p3123
aVI don't know if I'm supposed to be surprised about this.
p3124
aVIt seemed pretty obvious from the beginning that saying it was north Korea was purely because of things that can easily be faked.
p3125
aVIts a good article, but the title should be "why North Korea may not have been responsible for the Sony hack"
p3126
aVDUH.
p3127
aVIt was all done, in my opinion, with the help of the government, as a distraction and to see how they can control people.
p3128
aVLook at all the drones who went to the movies yesterday thinking it was patriotic? 
p3129
aV[Alabama Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrimMyOoEDA)\u000a
p3130
aVThis Alabama man is also a criminal who drove over a police officer during the chase.
p3131
aVNot saying the lawyers aren't scumbags, but it's hard to feel sorry for this guy.
p3132
aVMeh.
p3133
aVI can't bring myself to feel sorry for a cop.
p3134
aVFuck them.
p3135
aVWho would expect a different outcome?
p3136
aVInteresting.
p3137
aVAt first I thought that was completely excessive, but indeed the involvement of bodily fluids is certainly unacceptable. 
p3138
aVThat's what a wet-willy is though, he didn't hurt the guy.
p3139
aVThe only reason this is a felony assault charge is because the cop got embarrassed and wanted the most revenge possible.
p3140
aVI don't know of another charge he could have gotten but this is purely a cop tacking a felony onto someone's record for life for being embarrassed.
p3141
aVI can understand a felony assault charge for an AIDS patient spitting blood into someone's mouth but this is very far away from that.
p3142
aVWhat irks me too is the fact that police probably wouldn't respond to a call of someone giving a wet-willy to someone else and the person who got the willy in the first place would just shrug it off.
p3143
aVThis is a cop though so it is felony assault, which isn't fitting at all.
p3144
aVPetty revenge. 
p3145
aVI'm sure it was overblown, but I really don't think this is that ridiculous.
p3146
aVHe was drunk and he shoved his saliva covered finger in someone's ear.
p3147
aVThat person happened to be a cop.
p3148
aVAlthough I acknowledge it probably would have been lesser for someone who had done this to a civilian, but, I don't doubt for a second that someone *could* press charges for this same thing.
p3149
aVIt's an invasion of that person and the body fluids could indeed transmit a disease.
p3150
aVPeople need to be more careful about their actions, I don't know what that guy expected when he did that to a cop (he probably didn't know either, he was drunk).
p3151
aV WTF was that guy thinking?
p3152
aVOh lets give a police officer a wet-willy and see what happens?
p3153
aVHe was shitfaced so he really wasn't thinking, he was thinking "hey I'm a gonna give this cop a wet willy teehee!".
p3154
aVCop should have taken him in for public intox instead of trying to get him charged with felonious assault.
p3155
aVThat's just petty, like mess up this guy's future by making him seem violent on future job applications petty, so destructively petty when it sounded more like an innocent and playful "attack". 
p3156
aVUhhhh.
p3157
aVNo.
p3158
aVYou don't touch anyone that doesn't want to be touched and you absolutely don't put bodily fluids inside their body.
p3159
aVIt is assault also.
p3160
aVThe cop doesn't decide what to charge him with. 
p3161
aVbut if that wasn't a cop there's no way this would ever be considered a felony
p3162
aV&gt;You don't touch anyone that doesn't want to be touched\u000a\u000aoh, like arresting, handcuffing, and taking someone somewhere against their will?
p3163
aVThat's his job...
p3164
aVThere's people that do that \u000a\u000aPutting your finger in someone's ear isn't the same thing. 
p3165
aVI'd rather get a wet-willy than be kidnapped.
p3166
aVCool, next time an old lady pinches my cheek I'll press charges for assault.
p3167
aVWhen you say "bodily fluids" you're evoking imagery of people spitting AIDS infected blood into someone's mouth which is dangerous and why that counts as assault.
p3168
aVSomeone sticking a finger in someone else's ear for a wet-willy is not the same in scope or severity.
p3169
aVThe cop decided to charge him with felonious assault and through a plea deal with the judge he was able to get it reduced to a lesser charge.
p3170
aVIt is absolutely the cop who decided what to write on the ticket. 
p3171
aVYou can't compare an old lady pinching your cheeks to someone walking up and putting their spit in your ears.
p3172
aVI can't believe you even said that. 
p3173
aVYes you can, pinching someone's cheek and giving someone a wet willy are both meant to be playful.
p3174
aVIf the guy pinched the cop's cheek the cop still would have arrested him, that's the whole point.
p3175
aVCop overreacted to something most people brush off.
p3176
aVWhen you say "putting their spit in your ears" you're more saying spitting in someone's face and that takes it out of context.
p3177
aVYou should call it what it is; a wet willy.
p3178
aVHe licked his finger and stuck it in the guy's ear and twirled it around as a razz. 
p3179
aVYou aren't allowed to do that to anyone.
p3180
aVYou wouldn't let it go if it wasn't someone you knew.
p3181
aVYou'd want to press charges.
p3182
aVYou're literally the stupidest person I've ever encountered 
p3183
aVIn most cases people are just bothered by it if they don't share they in the humor, and in most cases it doesn't lead to felony assault charges.
p3184
aVCan you imagine if a third grader got a felony assault charge for giving someone a wet willy?
p3185
aVThat's because it doesn't happen.
p3186
aVIf someone telling you this is the stupidest person you've ever encountered you should probably get out more. 
p3187
aVChange "pinches my cheek" to "spits at my face" and maybe you've got a valid comparison.
p3188
aVIt's assault.
p3189
aVThough to be honest, randomly pinching a cop's cheek would likely get you arrested all the same.
p3190
aVYou just don't do that.
p3191
aVSee, that changes the intent.
p3192
aVPinching a cheek and giving a wet willy have similar intent.
p3193
aVSpitting in someone's face and punching them are more similar in intent than giving someone a wet willy. 
p3194
aVJust because you didn't intend to commit a crime doesn't make it any less a crime.
p3195
aVDeserving of a lesser punishment, perhaps, but still a crime.
p3196
aVAnd don't tell me you'd just shrug it off if some random asshole came up to you on the street and shoved his slimy wet finger into your ear.
p3197
aV&gt;Deserving of a lesser punishment, perhaps, but still a crime.
p3198
aVExactly, the dude thankfully didn't get charged with felony assault which is what the cop wanted to hit him with.
p3199
aVAnd I wouldn't shrug it off but I definitely wouldn't flag down a cop and potentially ruin a guy's life over it by getting him charged with a violent felony. 
p3200
aVThis stolen trailer is... stolen, you say? 
p3201
aVMan now there's no chance of it getting back to the original owner.
p3202
aVtrailer found, empty LoL
p3203
aVI imagine that stealing the truck was almost secondary,  since it sounds like they also robbed the shop.
p3204
aVI wonder if they even knew what was in the truck when they took it.
p3205
aVPlus, what kind of crappy security does this place have?  
p3206
aVCrappy Security Inc
p3207
aVGood luck getting someone to rat on the cartel.
p3208
aVSomeone should x-post this to /r/guns.
p3209
aVThey can be helpful in tracking down stolen firearms at times.
p3210
aVI would do it myself, but...it's early and I be lazy.

aVThe fact that this happened at all is horrifying and he should be charged, but the more disturbing thing is that his lawyer wanted the case dismissed "because his job as a police officer provides immunity from prosecution.

aVYears ago when my children were little a neighbor had a 4 year old who would slip out at night to visit grandma one street up.
p3229
aVThey ended up putting in a lock high enough that she couldn't reach it with a chair and at some point she outgrew her need for late night adventure. \u000a
p3230
aVWe are already putting the wobbly door knob covers on door knobs and I'm putting an out of reach chain lock on the basement door today.
p3231
aVBut I can see already he is going to be hard to outwit. 
p3232
aVMy 15 month old can already almost open doors, sigh.
p3233
aV*nigga i wanted a slushie*
p3234
aVYes, yes, it is reprehensible and all that jazz.
p3235
aVBut it is also a little bit funny in a twisted sort of way.
p3236
aVIt illustrates why the referendum system doesn't work and why California has such a broken government.   
p3237
aVThe ballot measure is called the "Sodomite Suppression Act", sounds like someone's trying to suppress something!
p3238
aVKamala Harris is absolutely right about the bill creating attention for it's sponsors.
p3239
aVThis is just publicity for a hate group.
p3240
aVThe state court would be wise to relive her of her duties in processing this.
p3241
aVLikewise, this proposal should be in and of itself be grounds for an investigation into whatever hate groups thought to put if forward. 
p3242
aVThats scary that the idea got that far.
p3243
aVwhoa..
p3244
aV... What.
p3245
aVThe.
p3246
aVFUCK?
p3247
aVPropaganda hour...
p3248
aVWow this could be just the most epic shit ever.
p3249
aVFirst the Fed herds millions and millions of new customers into the for profit insurance industry with the carrot of lower rates/no preexisting conditions and the stick of tax mandates.
p3250
aVThen just after all that sweeeeet money flows in the Supreme's tip the whole thing over and everyone has to pay the old rates at the old rules or walk away from what they have already given the insurance cartels.
p3251
aVFucking classic.
p3252
aVDoes this mean that since I lost my job last year, and spent more than three months uninsured, I won't have to pay the fine?
p3253
aV....I'm still not insured....
p3254
aVSince the title is misleading, here is the salient point of the article:\u000a\u000a&gt;At issue is whether residents of the 34 states where the federal government runs the health insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act can receive premium tax subsidies.
p3255
aVAffordable Care Act opponents argue that a strict interpretation of the language in the statute indicates people can only receive federal subsidies if they purchase policies on an \u201cexchange established by the state.\u201d  \u000a\u000aSo I don't know what dickwads are opposing this, but it seems to be a technicality.
p3256
aVAll the states have to do is establish their own exchange, which is easier said than done, of course.
p3257
aVNot sure whats misleading.
p3258
aVHere's another quote.
p3259
aV&gt;Could the change be accomplished quickly?
p3260
aVJudging by the time it took the 16 states that have already established their own exchanges, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d\u000a
p3261
aVRescues don't authorize foreign wars and contracts with congressman stock holder companies.
p3262
aVBecause if they had rescued them then  that is one less event that helps control the human populous by/with fear. 
p3263
aVSo if the British were so upset about it, and so sure; why didn't they send their own team?
p3264
aVThey're certainly capable of it, although without the logistical support of the US it would have been more difficult--but not impossible.
p3265
aVThis seems like a fish trap right here.
p3266
aVIf Obama had decided on the raid in June instead of waiting on fresh intel, and SOF operators had been killed, you could bet your bottom dollar he'd be in it even worse from these people.
p3267
aVI think a lot of people underestimate the decision making process that occurs here and fail to put themselves into these shoes.
p3268
aVIt's obvious that the damage done in the propaganda war and elsewhere could be much worse than even 20 dead hostages would be.
p3269
aVIf ISIS could claim eliminating a US Special Operations team, they'd be recruiting on that like no one's business.
p3270
aVThat would be the number one thing I'd want to avoid given the same set of decisions.
p3271
aVYeah, I agree.
p3272
aVI don't think anything wrong was done here.
p3273
aVJust a political talking point.
p3274
aVCan someone explain to me why he had to wait 22 years on death row before he was executed?
p3275
aVWere they unsure of evidence and wanted to make absolutely sure he was the perpetrator?
p3276
aVI mean they would only need like 5-10 years for that right?
p3277
aVAren't they hemorrhaging money keeping him on death row instead of executing him as soon as possible?
p3278
aVIndeed. 
p3279
aVI'm inclined to believe that after 10 years a person is mentally not the same person anymore.
p3280
aVWith this logic, this man is not the same man they incarcerated 22 years ago; we killed an innocent man.
p3281
aVBut, in his past life or whatever you're getting at....he killed someone and raped their wife. 
p3282
aVI see it like beating a doge for shitting in your living room last Tuesday.
p3283
aVBeating a dog is bad enough, but there is no way the punishment is any longer relevant to the action, especially in the mind of the dog.
p3284
aVBut when you Govern a community, you can't allow shitting on the carpet.
p3285
aVIt's a bad precedent.  
p3286
aVA 16, 15, 11, and 3 year old all home alone while the parents were out of town.
p3287
aVThat seems a bit reckless.
p3288
aVReally?
p3289
aVPeople hire 16-year olds and even younger to babysit their children!
p3290
aVThis fact is one of the arguments that Florida legislators used against a minimum wage.
p3291
aVI clearly don't understand what it means to try someone as an adult if a judge has to consider if an 11 year old should be tried as such. 
p3292
aVTo the story- damn, that is horrible\u000a\u000aTo the commentators- 16 year olds babysit their younger siblings all the time.
p3293
aVOlder kids bully younger ones.
p3294
aVThis sounds like te fifteen year old went nuts and dragged her entire family down with her
p3295
aVYeah it does.
p3296
aVThe 16 year old is a stretch being home for extended time alone (sure as hell wouldn't have let mine at 16) but the others are WAY too young.
p3297
aVEspecially 3, WTF?
p3298
aVSo 2 idiots have 4 kids together and in typical idiot fashion leave town with their children unsupervised and their guns unsecured.
p3299
aVWhat a shocker when something tragic happens.
p3300
aVMore importantly, the son was beating up the much younger daughter.
p3301
aVI can only assume that this is what was said by the girl who murdered the boy so I'd take that with a grain of salt unless there is clear evidence of substantial abuse which the article doesn't specify.
p3302
aVI have 2 older sisters and they beat up on me when we were younger all the time.
p3303
aVWe remain very close and I never once even contemplated trying to seriously injure let alone murder either of my siblings.
p3304
aVI hear you and am certainly not trying to justify the killing.
p3305
aVI just wanted to point out that these two at least thought that they were being abused, that the killing seemed to be a sort of defense.
p3306
aVRather than, say, trying to get the brother's money or as jealous revenge.
p3307
aVAnd to address your point, get personal, I was also beat-up a bit by my older brother.
p3308
aVFor the most part not a big deal, but at times I was on fire with frustration that no adult would take the bullying seriously - at times, in my youth, I was honestly afraid.
p3309
aVAnd that was from my nice brother, think about how some brothers take things further.
p3310
aVI would not discount those girls' motives.
p3311
aV&gt; the killing seemed to be\u000a\u000aFor now, lets not speculate and see what the investigators come up with.
p3312
aVI was correct, actually.
p3313
aVJournalists at least are reporting that the older brother was extremely abusive.
p3314
aVPretty easy to read between the lines there.
p3315
aVCan self-defense be argued?
p3316
aVAn 11-year old was being beat up by a 16-year old........
p3317
aVI suppose that the sisters could have run or could have called the police, but I don't do those things when I am attacked and I am an adult.
p3318
aVI fight back.
p3319
aVThe more people carry, the more irresponsible people carry.
p3320
aVIt's inevitable. 
p3321
aVI don't know all the details here, but as someone that grew up around guns, I was taught that you don't transport or even walk around with a loaded gun, with a bullet in the chamber, or with the safety off. 
p3322
aVAs someone who also was raised around guns you don't let your toddler dig around your purse when you made the decision to carry it for your protection.
p3323
aVIt's one of those added perks you must have mentally when you do decide to carry,  need to be aware of your firearm at all times.
p3324
aVTerrible news story but does sound negligent.
p3325
aVIn the end we are allowed to carry firearms for our protection and with that comes responsibilities.
p3326
aVLike limiting access to your loaded firearm from your 2 year old when you are browsing at WalMart.
p3327
aVI don't picture this kid as quick draw McGraw.
p3328
aVHe fiddled in her purse, he unzipped the compartment,  he did or did not have to fiddle with the safety which is odd, and he did not have to load a round in a chamber( which is not really an issue as its up to how comfortable the user wants to carry their firearm).
p3329
aVI carry with no round in chamber but have friends who do.
p3330
aVThen he gets to swing it around and aim it at his moms head.
p3331
aVWth is she doing this whole time?
p3332
aVCurious what the security footage shows but doesnt sound like good on the side of smart choices.
p3333
aVIts a two year old and I did not read the article.
p3334
aVWas he sitting in the buggy?
p3335
aVIf yes why did she lay her purse where it could be grabbed..
p3336
aVPut it on the bottom or in the basket or keep it on your shoulder..if its uncomfortable then don't carry into the store..
p3337
aV"[Veronica] wasn\u2019t carrying a gun because she felt unsafe.
p3338
aVShe was carrying a gun because she was raised around guns.
p3339
aVThis was just a horrible accident.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd this is one of the big problems America has in a nutshell.
p3340
aVThere was absolutely no reason to be carrying a gun, her own family admits that the woman carried it simply because of the gun culture she is associated with.
p3341
aVThis story is a ringing indictment of how gun-culture is killing us, literally.
p3342
aVI see people arguing that she was a good gun-owner, that just makes it worse.
p3343
aVThe obvious truth that this story avoids is that this could not have happened without the presence of a gun.
p3344
aV"We are gun people".
p3345
aVCletus, I think I may have found the problem. 
p3346
aV&gt; \u201cThey are painting Veronica as irresponsible, and that is not the case,\u000a\u000aShe let a 2 year old kid shoot her in the head with her own gun.
p3347
aVSo yes, you are fucking irresponsible.
p3348
aVThe only good part about it is that she was the one that got shot rather than a random shopper, which it could easily have been.
p3349
aVWhile tragic, this event underscores the truth that carrying a weapon outside of your person is the most retarded thing ever. 
p3350
aVI like how they added that witnesses confirmed that the shooting was accidental... Nah, the two year old kid definitely planned this whole fucking scenario out. 
p3351
aV"In the US state of Idaho..." Ah, must be the nanny state of England. 
p3352
aVsorry, what do you mean by that?
p3353
aVI understand England is a nanny state, but what does that have to do with the quote specifically?
p3354
aVCheers!
p3355
aVSo, nobody in this sub is willing to even consider that perhaps if there weren't so many people carrying guns in the US the number of fatal shootings would be reduced.
p3356
aVAlthough that was a predictable response, it's still pretty amazing.
p3357
aVWhat about all those police shootings that have people rioting in the streets?
p3358
aVI suppose only a communist would suggest that perhaps police officers would be less likely to shoot suspected criminals if there wasn't such a good chance of said suspect being armed.
p3359
aVOh well, carry on then.
p3360
aVPlenty more stories where this one came from.
p3361
aVMake cars illegal to cut back on auto accidents.
p3362
aVCars are designed to transport people.
p3363
aVGuns are designed to kill people.
p3364
aVYou haven't seen Death Proof, have you.
p3365
aVSlow down man, you're going way to fast there.
p3366
aVRegister guns like we do cars so we can keep better tabs on who is and isn't using them properly.
p3367
aVGuns in the US are required to be registered.
p3368
aVSo if I sell a gun to my neighbor, I have to go to the courthouse and sign the title of ownership over?
p3369
aVThe sale is entered into a database so that one could enter a gun ID and see who the registered owner is?
p3370
aVNope, didn't think so.
p3371
aVWhat we have (speaking as a person who used to sell firearms for a living) is a disposition list of who made it and who it was initially sold to.
p3372
aVThat's it.
p3373
aVAnd anyone who suggests more responsible tracking is shot down by the paranoid gun-nuts in this country who think the UN is going to fly in with black helicopters and steal their guns. 
p3374
aVAnd, in addition to protesting and rioting, what is the public response to police officers shooting and killing members of the public?
p3375
aVShooting police officers, of course.
p3376
aV50 police officers were shot and killed in the US in 2014.
p3377
aVGun safety, indeed. 
p3378
aVWhen are Americans going to get serious about gun control?
p3379
aVHow does this have anything to do with gun control.
p3380
aVShe legally purchased the gun.
p3381
aVShe legally held a CCW.
p3382
aVShe simply wasn't practicing safe gin handling. 
p3383
aVThe gin handling was weak, needed some tonic. 
p3384
aVNicely done sir. 
p3385
aVThe much better question is when we will get serious about gun safety, but nice attempt at putting a spin on this woman's irresponsibility.
p3386
aV"Gun safety," you say.
p3387
aVTake away the "gun", and what's left?
p3388
aVSafety.
p3389
aVOr you leave the gun, and activate the safety, and your two year old can't shoot you.
p3390
aVOr remove the "-ty" and you have a handy place to leave your gun when you can't keep an eye on it.
p3391
aVI rest my case.
p3392
aVWhy do that when it is obviously neither the best nor easiest solution?
p3393
aVPer capita, more Americans are killed by guns than in any other industrialized Western nation.
p3394
aVIn 2011, the nationwide gun death rate in the US was 10.38 per 100,000 people.
p3395
aVBy comparison, the gun death rate in the same year was 0.23 in the UK and 0.86 in Australia.
p3396
aV[source](http://www.vpc.org/press/1406gundeath.htm)\u000a\u000aBut I guess other countries are just better at gun safety, right?
p3397
aVIt can't possibly have anything to do with the laughable approach to gun control in the US.
p3398
aVIt's hard to shoot someone without a gun.
p3399
aVWe have the right to bear arms.
p3400
aVA lot more people have guns in America than most places.
p3401
aVIt makes sense we have more gun related violence.
p3402
aVThis isn't to say the same wouldn't hold true if the gun ownership density was the same in the UK.
p3403
aVIt's just they have less guns.
p3404
aVPeople are the problem.
p3405
aVPeople murder people.
p3406
aVGuns are a tool.
p3407
aVYou are responsible for how you use a tool.
p3408
aVIf hammer related murders were on the rise, would you suggest banning hammers?
p3409
aVI bet there's a lot of knife related crimes in places where it's hard to own guns.
p3410
aV"It's hard to shoot someone without a gun.
p3411
aV"\u000aBingo, you absolutely nailed it.
p3412
aVSo let's make it harder to get hold of a gun.
p3413
aVDid you read the rest of my comment?
p3414
aVHammers are designed to break things and drive in nails.
p3415
aVGuns are designed to kill people.
p3416
aVOn your last point:\u000aYour chance of being the victim of a knife-related crime is indeed 1.27x higher in the UK than in the US.
p3417
aVHowever, you are 35.2x more likely to be shot dead in the Unites States than in the UK.
p3418
aV[source](https://dispellingthemythukvsusguns.wordpress.com/)
p3419
aV73% of those are suicides.
p3420
aVYour opinion may differ,  but I don't consider guns to be the root cause to suicide just like I don't view bridges to be either.
p3421
aVYou sound reactive and scared.
p3422
aVThousands of people in the US have guns on them all the time,  accidents like these are statistically low.
p3423
aVIt's a shame people can forgo rational thought when something bad happens.   
p3424
aVThere's nothing rational about thinking that carrying a gun makes you safer, and nothing rational about the gun "debate" in the US.
p3425
aVI would really like to hear you explain what you just wrote to the police.
p3426
aVThey seem to think their gun is one of their most important pieces of gear,  besides their radio.
p3427
aVAlso, I live in Alaska for 3 months out of the year.
p3428
aVWe don't have police within a 4 hour radius,  if we have cell coverage.
p3429
aVWe have fucking grizzly bears,  among dozens of other things that can kill us.
p3430
aVWe also hunt, because a 4 hour drive to a grocery store isn't always feasible.
p3431
aVI would really like to see you come up to Alaska and try to get us to drop our weapons.
p3432
aVIt would be comedy gold.
p3433
aVDo you suggest we just carry bear mace and a bow and arrow to hunt for food,  lol.  
p3434
aVI agree that there are people who could benefit from carrying a gun and you have listed two very good examples: police officers and people who live in relatively wild areas.
p3435
aVHowever, these people are the exception rather than the rule.
p3436
aVThe woman who died as a result of this very avoidable tragedy did not fall into either of those categories, and would certainly not have died if she did not insist on carrying a gun.
p3437
aVMost Americans have absolutely no legitimate use for a gun, and this stubborn insistence on having one simply because it is their right is leading to a great number of avoidable deaths.
p3438
aVIt would be presumptuous to assume she didn't have a legitimate reason to carry the firearm,  as both you nor I know the woman's history.
p3439
aVYour life and security ultimately rely on you.
p3440
aVMy neighbor ( I say neighbor because he lived in my building) died 2 months ago.
p3441
aVHe was going to 7-11, the same one I go to as well as many others.
p3442
aV[He was robbed and stabbed in the chest.
p3443
aVHe ran about one block away before he bled out to death](http://koin.com/2014/10/16/feds-find-man-dead-near-portland-city-hall/).
p3444
aVHe wasn't homeless,  in fact he moved here from California and was a chef,  fairly new to Portland.
p3445
aVHe was stabbed and died one block away from the largest police station in the state.
p3446
aVAnother incident that hits close to home for me is [this incident that occurred as I was driving through Spokane on my way to Montana](http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/23/us/world-war-vet-beating-death/) (I travel to Montana,  Oregon,  and Alaska).
p3447
aVThis man was not physically capable and I wish he had been armed.
p3448
aVWhile statistically unlikely,  I refuse to have something like that happen to me.
p3449
aVEspecially when I possess the ability to carry a gun.
p3450
aVIt very very easily could have been me in Portland,  I go to that store almost every day, 6 months out of the year.
p3451
aVLife is unpredictable and it is not my decision to choose how others defend themselves.
p3452
aVSome aren't physically capable of thwarting an attack like that (elderly especially).
p3453
aVI fully support the right to carry a gun.
p3454
aVIt is a very big responsibility,  and nothing to take lightly,  but it's my choice and a responsibility I accept.
p3455
aVNobody is every going to convince me otherwise.    \u000a\u000a
p3456
aVWhat a piece of shit.
p3457
aVWhy kill the in-laws, especially the 14 year old.
p3458
aVThat's just fucking low.
p3459
aVIn laws commonly intrude into divorce/custody issues... Not trying to justify it, just offering some insight to a possible explanation for why.
p3460
aVKilling anyone is pretty freaking low, no matter the age. \u000a
p3461
aVThat's true.
p3462
aVVery sad story... 
p3463
aVWe engineer these men to destroy for our country, and then wonder why they can't fit into normal society when they are discharged from duty.
p3464
aVIt's a shame anyone had to die over this.
p3465
aVPoor Kids and that family...
p3466
aVDo you and your child feel safe not realizing you're living with a train killer at night?
p3467
aVWhere's the obligatory "once a marine always marine" correction to calling him an "ex-marine"?
p3468
aV&gt;The company claims it will generate $61 billion in economic activity\u000a\u000aHow is that a justification?
p3469
aVThat's like saying you stole my TV because you claimed you could sell it to your friend for $200, so it's okay.
p3470
aVThis will only turn into blow-back.
p3471
aVWHat are the Apache planning to do?
p3472
aVThis violates 200 year old treaties, so WTF?
p3473
aVFrom my understanding there isn't much they can do.
p3474
aVI believe the only thing that can happen now that it passed the senate is for President Obama to veto it.
p3475
aVI hope he does, but I'm not holding my breath.\u000a\u000a
p3476
aVIt's a congressional declaration of war against the tribes is what it is!
p3477
aVWhen only one party decides that the treaty they have with another group is no long sufficient and change the agreement without consent of the group who held the other end of the recognized treaty, people will come together to stop the crime being perpetrated by the government group wanting to **destroy** a 200 year old agreement.
p3478
aVAn agreement that should encompass all US soil.
p3479
aVThe rich aristocrats are the ones the US citizens should be sanctioning to a small piece of land.
p3480
aVSo was this done completely behind their backs? 
p3481
aVI think they have been fighting to keep this land for a while, but the deal was slipped into the NDAA last minute, courtesy of John McCain.
p3482
aVThat's my understanding, at least.
p3483
aVDisgusting.
p3484
aVAbsolutely.
p3485
aVI think it's repulsive that our government is still trying to steal from the indigenous people.
p3486
aV&gt;Steal\u000a\u000aI believe it's still legal to shoot land thieves and horse thieves.
p3487
aVTime to break shit!
p3488
aVI'm not one to judge based on grainy video but there has to have been better ways to handle that.
p3489
aVHe just got out and dropped him, gta style.
p3490
aVJesus Christ.
p3491
aVNot knowing any facts other than what this article says, I can't help but feel that the dispatcher is very responsible for this child's death.
p3492
aV"probably a fake gun" might have let this officer assess the situation a bit longer which could have prevented the shooting...maybe.
p3493
aVRegardless, that is a big piece of info to leave out.
p3494
aVAs someone who carries one regularly you know who is responsible for everything that happens with my gun?
p3495
aVI am.
p3496
aVA tragedy, yes.
p3497
aVBut the kid was playing with a realistic pistol and pointing it at random people.
p3498
aVWhere are the parents?
p3499
aVthat video was sped up it was a minute for every couple of seconds.
p3500
aVin the beginning yes, but the bit at the end is regular 2 frames per second security footage speed.
p3501
aVStop spamming your site, link to the original or GTFO.
p3502
aVAll of your backlinks in your ad riddled blog are for ebay. 
p3503
aVAgain?
p3504
aVTerrible loss.
p3505
aVI am an attorney who specializes in process safety around highly hazardous chemicals like these, and while details don't seem to be out yet, I'm willing to bet this came down to one of two things: normalized deviation or a breakdown in emergency response operations.
p3506
aVI think those two issues (alone or together) have accounted for 75% of the industry fatalities I've seen.  
p3507
aVTo be clear he also pardoned 700 other people, but in 2012 there were at least 5000 cannabis arrests, and multiplied by years that number is not very significant in my book.
p3508
aVWhy not pardon all the cannabis only, non-violent offenders?
p3509
aVhttp://www.mpp.org/states/arkansas/\u000a\u000a
p3510
aVHe stated that he only pardons individuals who have already fulfilled their sentences, who have lived within the law for a few years post-sentence, and who can actively demonstrate that.
p3511
aVIt would be hard for someone arrested in 2012 to have already fulfilled their sentence, assuming that what his son received was typical (3 years supervised probation) and have a clean record for a few years afterwards.
p3512
aVI think I understand your point (more generally) to be that: all cannabis only, non-violent offenders who meet the same criteria being applied to his son should be universally pardoned.
p3513
aVMy guess there is that many of those offenders have not petitioned the parole board for a pardon, which appears to be a necessary step in the Governor's process for selection.
p3514
aVI just grabbed the most recent data on the arrests, which also is not necessarily the same as convictions, although probably pretty close.
p3515
aVI don't think we could get the data on the number of requested vs granted gubernatorial pardons, but I'd like to see it.
p3516
aVholy shit, never read anything about this...
p3517
aVThere is nothing new here.
p3518
aVThis incident was declared an accident by both Israeli and US investigators.
p3519
aVWhy is it so popular all of the sudden?
p3520
aVApparently there's new evidence to the contrary
p3521
aVWtf is this country.
p3522
aVHi, this is the country in which I live, unfortunately...\u000a\u000aAnd about that; if we are trying to create jobs, would this tactic of the IRS be counter productive to the presidents desire to get more people employed?
p3523
aVI'm going to label this as a "Governmental Internal Conflict of Interest".
p3524
aVIn this precarious and fragile economy what this IRS did here was ensure the decay of the economy, but only by a little bit...
p3525
aVBut give it enough time and case load and we have a very large problem.
p3526
aVNot to mention this kind of government seizure is exactly what the U.S. Was born against to begin with
p3527
aVThis is not a defensive statement, just making and observation: That is the past and this is today, our heroes that created our society demand that we take up the sacrifices they adhered to in order to create a society were all men are created equal.
p3528
aVThough, we as a society have forgot about these personal sacrifices for betterment.
p3529
aVUntil we remember what these are and how to utilize them, we are going to be our own hostages that create our masters out of distrust of ourselves and neighbors.

aVIt doesn't make it right in the realm of public opinion, but what she did is also not right.
p3559
aVIt is no different than an employee going into a popular bar and badmouthing the place they work.
p3560
aVEveryone in the public place can hear and will draw conclusions on what that employee is saying.

aVWhich as someone who live a in the southwest, it most likely came from Mexico on someone's pants or in an extra pair of shoes, it's really common.
p3628
aVAnd she did receive medical treatment, but not all scorpions are poisonous.
p3629
aVIt feel like a bee sting, and there really is no treatment for that. 
p3630
aVDespite Hollywood depictions, virtually all species of scorpions are fairly harmless.
p3631
aVThey're about as nasty as a bee or a fire ant.
p3632
aVI wouldn't *want* to get stung by one, but it's not like it's anything to worry about.
p3633
aV[There are a few species of Scorpion that manage to a bit dangerous, but they're all found in the middle-east and asia](http://feafum.blogspot.com/2014/02/6-most-poisonous-scorpion-in-world.html). 
p3634
aVNot my point.
p3635
aVDo you really think a passenger knew this scorpion wasn't poisonous?
p3636
aVEven if she knew it wasn't who wouldn't take the opportunity to go to the hospital just to have a case for a free flight?
p3637
aVI stand by the fact this woman most likely brought it on the plane and would rather disappear than risk getting caught
p3638
aVNot just banning weed, banning Medical Marijuana!
p3639
aVWho the fuck bans medicine?
p3640
aVMedical Marijuana needs to become federally legal.
p3641
aVThat would solve many of the issues/difficulties dispensaries, cities and states face.
p3642
aV(e.g.
p3643
aVfederally backed financial and merchant services would feel more comfortable doing business with the dispensaries which would solve the cash-only issue for city and state regulators and law enforcement.
p3644
aVI heard about this on NPR and elsewhere.
p3645
aVHere's a random article about the banking obstacle:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/payment-options-legal-marijuana-businesses-1282.php  
p3646
aVDid you read the sidebar?

aVDon't editorialize.

aVWtf
p3650
aVIt's a daily mail title, not mine.
p3651
aVBut just for fun - go look for the other sources; dKos, Faux ... and it goes downhill from there.
p3652
aVI can't find one reliable straight news source - at least, not better than the Mail.
p3653
aVIt's as if this whole thing was *designed* to make people's heads asplode.
p3654
aVWell if he is relentlessly propagandized that any gun = murder/death/kill then he is a hero in the shared fantasy world that has been created.
p3655
aVIt's possible to be both a propaganda victim and want to be a self sacrificing hero.
p3656
aVThus Hapless + "Hero"
p3657
aVtell me how I know a good guy with a gun vs a bad guy with a gun.
p3658
aVWhats the criteria?
p3659
aVI'm not at all defending this guy, honestly he should have called the police, but maybe he thought there wasn't time (because isn't that what they always tell the gun owners?
p3660
aVthat you can't wait for the cops, you need to be a hero?
p3661
aV) Please tell me how I know a persons intent before they actually pull out their weapon and shoot someone/go to the register and pay for their merchandise.
p3662
aVPeople who are not at the moment visibly committing a crime are assumed, by law, to be innocent citizens.
p3663
aVFirearms ownership is a right and *the vast majority* of people carrying them are legally doing so.
p3664
aVSo do the math, or follow the law, pick one.
p3665
aVIt's really simple: Is he in the act of committing a crime with that gun?
p3666
aVIf the answer is yes, then congratulations, you've found a bad guy!
p3667
aVOtherwise, carry on, pardon the pun. 
p3668
aVIf a person is carrying a gun and that gun is not legally owned, then they are committing a crime.
p3669
aVYou say if they are committing a crime I should report it, so how do I know just by looking at them whether theyre committing a crime?
p3670
aVHow do I tell the legal gun owner from the non-legal gun owner?
p3671
aVIf what this man did in detaining him was illegal because the gun owner was not committing crime, does it not stand to reason that  the police in this case should be tried for murder, since the man in question wasn't committing a crime?
p3672
aVhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/ohio-wal-mart-where-cops-shot-black-man-pulls-pellet-n215156\u000a\u000aI'm curious if you believe in the "see something say something" advice we see everywhere?
p3673
aVand for the record I don't at all agree with what he did.
p3674
aVFor one thing, black guy = criminal is a problematic world view.
p3675
aVSecond even IF this guy isn't racist, tackle an armed citizen (criminal or no) is borderline suicidal.
p3676
aVYou're asking to be shot, so this story is balls to the wall crazy.
p3677
aVThat said, his behavior begs the question of how does one know who's a criminal and who isn't?
p3678
aVThe idiot's lucky he didn't get shot because the victim could have easily made a self-defense claim.
p3679
aVIf Florida allows concealed carry they what possible basis would he have for attacking someone, uh, carrying.
p3680
aVIt would be like tackling someone in Colorado for carrying a joint.
p3681
aVBecause he was black, most likely.
p3682
aVBeing Captain Obvious here, but if both guys were the same race, this wouldn't have happened.
p3683
aVAnd on another note, had this been in Florida no one would have been arrested.

p3700
aV&gt; and the president concluded that new leadership of that agency was required\u000a\u000aSo she was fired.
p3701
aVIt bothers me that resigning is the treatment that the upper class gets while all of us peons get fired.
p3702
aVIt allows her to say, "What happened was below me and I know it was bad performance, I'm actually better than that, better than my track record.
p3703
aV" and to save face.
p3704
aVIf you are being fired and you suggest to the person that you would rather quit, I'm sure under most circumstances they would accommodate you.
p3705
aVIt's simpler for the company. 
p3706
aVYou're held to a higher standard when being in charge of the security of the President...this isn't a normal office job where you can make mistakes and learn from them, so you should expect to get fired if there's someone out there that can do the job without fail
p3707
aVThat's what I'm saying.
p3708
aVShe should be fired.
p3709
aVAnd it should be called fired.
p3710
aVShe shouldn't get to hide under this cover of "resigned" that people at the top always get to use.
p3711
aVBut people at the "bottom" often get the same courtesy, whether it be laying off for financial reasons or because they can't fulfill their job well.
p3712
aVYou hear people at the top "resigning" more often because it's more newsworthy than people at lesser positions in a company.
p3713
aVMany people get to the top from the bottom, so it's a nice professional courtesy to help someone ease into a new job.
p3714
aVYou'd want that if you made it to a high position in a company.
p3715
aVThey've been found.

aVDude didn't skip off because he was a coward, he didn't agree with what they were doing in Afghanistan, didn't believe it to be moral.
p3721
aVHe knew before he joined the armed forces that he would be sent to the middle east to fight in a war.
p3722
aVSo why did he even bother joining up? 
p3723
aVThere's a difference in fighting a war and killing civilians.
p3724
aVI don't think they tell you about that when you enlist.\u000a\u000a
p3725
aVAn ex-boyfriend of my niece went stark raving mad due to civilian deaths.
p3726
aVHis job was as a forward observer, and he ended up in a hospital Germany after he lost it.
p3727
aVThe niece observed most of the wives and girlfriends of people in his specialty had a high divorce rate, and there were substance abuse issues, and physical abuse issues both for themselves and their significant others.
p3728
aVPeople can talk hard all they want, the reality is that nothing can prepare a person to see that much death, and regardless of what one tells themselves or others, quite a few people can't handle it, and won't know if they can or can't until they are boots on the ground.
p3729
aVThat can change a person, and sometimes they will do stupid or suicidal things when they fail to cope.
p3730
aVI'm sorry to hear that.
p3731
aVYeah, a buddy of mine served in Afghanistan and is in a similar situation.
p3732
aVPTSD, homeless, and alcoholic.
p3733
aVHe said the thing that really haunts him is a situation where he was posted about half a mile away from a 3-4 story shelled out apartment building with some hostiles in it.
p3734
aVHe was a sniper, barret 50 cal, and said he was just waiting for muzzle fire from what they believed to be the last guy in the building.
p3735
aVHe finally spotted the window where the guy was and took his shot and dropped him.
p3736
aVHe went in to confirm the kill and secure the building and said when he found the guy, it was a kid no older than 12 or 13.
p3737
aVI can't imagine what that does to someone; dude grinds his teeth constantly, you can feel the anxiety emanating from him.
p3738
aVI totally agree with you.
p3739
aVBut when you enlist you, especially at war time, it is expected that you will follow orders whether you agree with them or not.
p3740
aVIt's a choice you yourself make when signing up.
p3741
aVIt's not like a regular job where if your don't agree with your boss you just don't do it.
p3742
aVAnd if you are naive enough to think that going into a war zone and killing some civilians is not going to happen then that's on you.
p3743
aVThey call it collateral damage for a reason. 
p3744
aVI'm with you there, I get that.
p3745
aVI think the problem comes in when it starts ceasing to be collateral damage.
p3746
aVWhat I got from the whole situation was he was being exposed to non-aggressives being shot, bombed, or tortured just for the hell of it.
p3747
aVAnd with these guys having to be around sick fucks like Academi (Blackwater) I can see how that would weight on your morals.
p3748
aVThey have to work with [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blackwater+iraq+civillians); don't think I could do that.
p3749
aVShame how this guy is being used as a political football.
p3750
aVHe put himself in this situation.
p3751
aVYou reap what you sow. 
p3752
aVI respectfully disagree.
p3753
aVIf you are saying that he should be tried outside of the [Uniform Code of Military Justice](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm) then you sir are badly mistaken.
p3754
aVIf you are saying he should be given the Medal of Honor, you are sadly mistaken.

p3829
aVI don't know what the answer is, but attempting to subdue someone who is unarmed while you are carrying a gun is just an opportunity for that person to get the gun.

aVVoter turnout is a big problem too, Ohio had 38% of voting age people vote and republicans won.
p3838
aVWhat's sad is that for lower party seats like judges it was democrats all the way through, so more informed voters who bothered to look up party affiliation voted democrats and everyone else voted repub closer to the governor's seat.

aVPathetic voter turnout, people voting from "blablabla jobs Obama's bad".

aVJust so you know, you generally can't "turn a case over" to someone else if you were court appointed.
p3853
aVYou have to move to withdraw and the court has to allow it.
p3854
aVSeems as if the courts with jurisdiction over the case have refused to allow that to happen.
p3855
aVI have no idea whether the current lawyers made a decently-supported motion to withdraw. 
p3856
aVYes, the rules require that you need to be substituted or permitted to withdraw.
p3857
aVBut, the idea that a court appointed lawyer could miss a critical deadline without the Court noticing is simply unacceptable.

aV&gt; A day after US warplanes expanded the war south-west of Baghdad, Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate armed services committee that he could see himself recommending the use of some US military forces now in Iraq to embed within Iraqi and Kurdish units to take territory away from Isis.
p3908
aVA General said he would recommend it to the President.
p3909
aVQuite different from it actually happening.
p3910
aVGoddammit.
p3911
aVShould have put up a no fly zone over Syria in the first place and kept Maliki on his knees with aid and this wouldn't be a problem. 
p3912
aVI suggest every move should be aimed at making Maliki beg on his knees.I have never liked him for one day.He sucks
p3913
aVIts nice to see that somebody recorded something *good* that a cop did in the US
p3914
aVSo, suicide is not your last unalienable right
p3915
aVI feel like pledging allegiance to ISIS and then strolling into JFK airport in New York presents a bit of a clash of interests, if I do say so myself. 
p3916
aVDefinitely seems like a red flag and it very well should be.
p3917
aVBut I'm curious as to what crime has actually been committed here.
p3918
aVI mean the only thing they give is:\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s possible that he traffics in guns to people in this organization (ISIS),\u201d Moore said in Brooklyn Federal Court.
p3919
aVIt's possible that he committed a crime while overseas?
p3920
aVIt just sounds like such a thin thread, but it's a short article so I'm sure there's more to this than it seems.
p3921
aVThe other thing I did notice though, was it seems that he got the attention of the FBI/CIA by posting stupid crap to his Twitter account, I mean how stupid is that.
p3922
aVI wonder if they would have known about this guy if he hadn't posted on social media.
p3923
aVSometimes it seems that the urge to rebel against the established "powers that be" is so strong that people forget that it is serious crap to pledge allegiance to a terrorist organization.
p3924
aVHeck, if you broadcast your allegiance to the USA in Iraq, "justice" from ISIS would involve a beheading.
p3925
aVThis is no joke.\u000a
p3926
aVGood idea. 
p3927
aVI'm from SC.
p3928
aVIf you get in a fist fight at the local bar, the police charge you with every felony they can think of.

aVThat sounds like a winner.

aV"The good news is we landed the big New York State contract.

aVWe're rich!

aVThis is an absolutely fascinating example of both corporate insanity and municipal gluttony.
p3938
aVStaples obviously did not think their brilliant plan all the way through and the executives behind this seemed to have missed Human Nature 101 in business school.
p3939
aVAnd while technically the municipal procurement agents did nothing wrong in taking advantage of a good bargain (and actually honestly fulfilled their fiduciary duty to the taxpayers), the excess certainly highlights a culture of excessive consumerism and accumulation.
p3940
aVI suspect this will soon end up in the courts.

aV&gt; But Ms Brewer said: "By eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer.
p3944
aVThis is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims, and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family.
p3945
aV"\u000a\u000aThat's totally irrelevant though because the death penalty is not about revenge, it's about the unfortunate reality that some people must be quarantined away from us...
p3946
aVGuys?...
p3947
aVFor a lot of people it is about nothing but revenge.
p3948
aVGasping for breath for hours is not suffering?
p3949
aVObvious by the last half of this callus Ms Brewer, she was biased in this assessment.
p3950
aVIt's just hard to feel sympathy for someone who's done something like that, and she's aware of it and playing that angle.  
p3951
aVDon't worry guys, he was just snoring.
p3952
aVI don't understand these botched executions.
p3953
aVIs it honestly difficult to sedate someone, then pump them full of drugs enough to kill an elephant?

aVIs it difficult to kill someone by lethal injection?
p3956
aVIsn't this the plot of I Heart Huckabee's?

aV&gt;The vast gap between solid liberals and steadfast conservatives on [the question "is racial discrimination the reason Blacks can't get ahead"] is striking\u000a\u000aProbably not as striking as the gap between Whites and Blacks on that question is ... 
p3958
aVPersonally, I don't think its a legal problem, or a problem that can be fixed by laws.
p3959
aVThe issue isn't a willing to work or not type of issue it's a more what type of work gets rewards type of issue.
p3960
aVBlack Americans as a whole have the issue where they weren't really able to benefit from the growing economy until it was, for the most part, established.
p3961
aVSo, as a whole they are struggling to find a place where they can be successful.
p3962
aVIt's just getting worsened due to corporation moves to limit new competition.
p3963
aVWe just really need another economic boom with new industries rising since black americans are finally in a halfway decent place to benefit, and are already programmed to put money back into black communities.  
p3964
aVNot to mention they are for the most part gettin out of the victim hood idea that was perpetuated way back in the 60'd and 70's.
p3965
aVKinda like the gay community is doing now.
p3966
aVNot tr best long term plan.
p3967
aVI think the issue is with the corporations and not the people.
p3968
aVUnless you wanna think of them as people then it's that group of people therein lies the problem.
p3969
aVBeing poor is as much a choice as being rich is.
p3970
aVPeople need the kind of economic boom you are describing. 
p3971
aV&gt;Perhaps this cohort, which strongly supports gay marriage, believes that the front in the fight for equality has moved on to new beneficiaries?
p3972
aVWhich should scare the shit out of the conservatives ... 
p3973
aV80% of conservatives say the U.S. has done enough to create equality for Blacks, but 30% of conservatives still support giving Blacks a Racial preference for jobs and education through Affirmative Action programs.
p3974
aVWTF is wrong with those stats???

aV80% graduation rate with a 100% functional illiteracy rate.
p3978
aVReach for those stars. 
p3979
aVPublic schools just push kids through to keep getting federal money.
p3980
aVThe 80% statistic loses its importance when you look at how watered down the curriculum is compared to other developed nations.
p3981
aV(Finland, South Korean, ect.
p3982
aV) 
p3983
aVDespite the down-votes you received, you make a valid point.
p3984
aVThe graduation rate does not reflect the quality or success of our public school system.
p3985
aVOur students are not as challenged here as they are in various other countries.
p3986
aVIt may be difficult for some to acknowledge, but it's true.
p3987
aVIt's definitely tru, but the schools can't be blamed for trying to win at the politicians game.
p3988
aVOften the schools that need the cash the most are the ones that deal with issues far greater than what's on the curriculum.
p3989
aVIf you were broke, had limited out-dated resources, and we're trying to still make it, what would you do?
p3990
aVLet the school fail the achievement marks and receive less and less funding each year it happens or make some classes that ensure more students graduate?
p3991
aVIt is a lose-lose situation that our government/we have created.
p3992
aVBlaming schools systems and school personnel is ridiculous.

aVTexas prides itself on its lack of worker protections.
p4003
aVIt's a federal program, not solely a Texan one, though some states have outlawed it, like Vermont, and done much better at bringing workers with developmental disabilities into the general workforce.
p4004
aVTexas is indeed particularly bad with labor issues in general, and are especially bad with this labor issue in specific, but you might want to check whether where you currently live utilizes a similar program.

aVIt's preposterous.

p4122
aVWhy can't they just use morphine of another happy drug?
p4123
aVwell, let me yell at you.
p4124
aVHave you not read any articles?
p4125
aVMost of the european countries agree that death penalty is dangerouns and a sign of a third world terrorist encampment filled with feudal warlords then a democracy.
p4126
aVNow, imagine what happens if someone leaks which drugs are used, right?
p4127
aVI mean, heck, the biggest step of the anti death penalty movement was that all of the european drug designers no longer ship their products to the terrorist states in america that have the death penalty, and have announced they will not deliver to any state that resells their drugs to one of the lawless states.
p4128
aVNow, imagine what happens when shit hits the fan, and you literally use a happy drug to off someone.
p4129
aVNot only would you get anything but a peacefull looking corpse, but you would also run the danger of the europeans saying, "well, fuck them, if they want our morphine, they have to ban the death penalty.
p4130
aV"\u000a\u000aJust count how many american facilities would be up to the task of manifacturing any drugs that kill.
p4131
aVI mean, heck, there is still a war on drugs going on, as far as I can see, so I bet all the companies want to risk producing happy drugs for usage in death penalty situations, with a promise that the local police units will not treat them like a dispensary.
p4132
aVBut yea.... America don fucked up in that regard, and their only hope is to keep their suppliers secret. 
p4133
aVwow, I have no idea what you said there
p4134
aVLong story short - we buy the chemicals from European countries who disagree with the death penalty, but don't tell them what chemicals are used for what purposes.
p4135
aVIf we switch to morphine and they found out, they'd cut off the morphine supply, and people who *legitimately* need morphine would be completely fucked.
p4136
aVIts probably not really possible to do so, is it?
p4137
aVYou could just grow your own opium or still hide what the end use is.
p4138
aVAustralia has massive licit opium poppy fields which I presume are to produce morphine and/or codeine.

aVWonder if "Temporarily buried in salt" will show up in the CarFax report for these vehicles.
p4206
aV...and here are all the guys that are placing themselves on the wrong side of history.
p4207
aVThey are preparing themselves to look like fools in the future.

aVOh, great, because what real Oklahomans want is more of our tax dollars wasted.

aVWhat an amazing human being.
p4213
aVHe had everything going for him in the U.S. yet he sacrificed his life to help others in disease ravaged countries.

aVBTW, the false negative part of the headline is probably not very relevant.
p4215
aVFrom the article:\u000a\u000a&gt;Smith said "false negative" test results are possible in the first days of symptoms when the viral load is relatively low.
p4216
aVSalia ultimately tested positive for the virus Nov. 10.
p4217
aVTo be honest, these kids, and the organization that brought them, screwed up.
p4218
aVIf they were going in a student capacity they needed student visas.
p4219
aVWhoever was their rep (the person who vouched for their visa to the Russian Government) should have known this.
p4220
aVSecond, they are lucky the authorities let them go back to their hotels to get their visas.

aVIf you are caught without proper documentation you can be arrested.

aVCut the crap, lets make it legal and save everyone the legal mumbo-jumbo bullshit.

aVI mean, it's a quarantine regarding Ebola, not the flu.
p4224
aVThey were asked not to leave the apartment to prevent quarantine break and ignored it, thus potentially jeopardizing the safety of the city exponentially.
p4225
aVYou bet your ass they better have been enforced house arrest.
p4226
aVWhile I don't know the full story of how the nurse was treated, if she was treated inhumanely then obviously an apology and rectification for further cases are in order; however, a quarantine is a quarantine.
p4227
aVPeople can't just disobey requests to maintain quarantine because they feel like it.
p4228
aVGood!
p4229
aV&gt;One of the bills would have required local and state-owned buildings and public venues to build or renovate at least one bathroom so that both sexes could access a changing table\u000a\u000aA law forcing all businesses to build changing tables would be a nightmare, I'm glad he killed this one in particular.
p4230
aV&gt;The other would have forced building owners to create an equally accessible changing station whenever constructing a new bathroom or making major renovations to an existing one\u000a\u000aThis seems far more reasonable but I'm still not sure I like the idea of mandating changing tables in public buildings.
p4231
aVThey should incentivize it with a tax credit or something without mandating it, I dunno.
p4232
aVI'm personally kind of glad that both of these were killed. 
p4233
aVWow only 11?

aVNew testament?
p4242
aVAnything
p4243
aVAs opposed to peaceful MS-13 gang members?
p4244
aVFirst of all they're gang members, secondly they're MS-13 gang members, a gang notorious for their unadulterated aggression/violence and willingness to do anything for the gang.
p4245
aVNo need to sensationalize titles for views.
p4246
aVPost the truth and it'll get upvoted on its own.
p4247
aVTitle should read,  "Suspected MS-13 gang members, a gang with a history of violence,  leave graffiti in border processing center"
p4248
aVThis article is meant to be frightening (note the image they chose), but I'm skeptical.
p4249
aVSkeptical about what?
p4250
aVGoogle the word "Murrieta".
p4251
aVThat's about 30mi from me.
p4252
aVThis wave is out of control.
p4253
aVThe media the left loves to dismiss as false has been talking about this since at least October of last year.
p4254
aVWashington Times, WND, Fox, etc... With the children flooding in mentioned specifically in December in the Washington Times.
p4255
aVYou're at least seven months behind people who can read objectively.
p4256
aVEdit: spelling
p4257
aVI lived in Central America.
p4258
aVEven in remote villages, *MS13* was on the walls.
p4259
aVIt's the edgiest thing you can write on a wall, and that's what 15 year-olds do.
p4260
aVThis article also makes no distinction between purported "gang associations" and membership.
p4261
aVThis is a shallow pitchfork piece to stir people up and the graphic they chose says so.
p4262
aVThis boils down to a scare article about graffiti.
p4263
aVI live in an almost all white rural town.
p4264
aVThere is "GD king killers" or some shit spray painted all over by teenagers.
p4265
aVWe haven't called in the gang task force to look for cowboy hat wearing GD gangsters.
p4266
aVThere's a huge difference between American gang members and Central/S.
p4267
aVAmerican gang members.
p4268
aVEven the hardcore US gangs pale in comparison.
p4269
aVUS gangs idolize the gangster lifestyle, but often jerk violence happens it's fairly clean and quick (I.e gunshots).
p4270
aVIt is also used sparingly against a specific target.
p4271
aVMS-13 and other gangs like it operate more like terror groups.
p4272
aVThey kill much more frequently and with greater violence.
p4273
aVVictims are tortured, skinned, dismembered and then displayed in public.
p4274
aVFrequently over the years Mexican authorities have discovered mass graves containing 50-70+ people who were captured by drug cartels and either couldn't get ransom money or refused to backpack drugs into the US.
p4275
aVWhen was the last time the bloods or crips murdered 50 people at once?
p4276
aV...but it was just graffiti.
p4277
aVIt could have been put there by some unaffiliated ambitious teenager.
p4278
aVSame kooks who are trying to tie the "border crisis" with ISIS by saying ISIS will slip in through the Mexican border.
p4279
aVApparently Al Qaeda and every other terrorist organization ever was too stupid to figure that out. 
p4280
aVHave people stopped buying gas?
p4281
aVI could have sworn there was already a tax on gas for this. 
p4282
aVI've read about this before (well, without the fact that funds were about to run out) and IIRC the short answer is "yes".
p4283
aVGas prices are going up, fuel efficiency is going down, and people are ultimately choosing to carpool or bike/walk or take public transportation a little more often, meaning that tax revenue from gas sales is declining.
p4284
aVfuel efficiency is going up
p4285
aVYes, typo there.
p4286
aVFuel efficiency is going up, which means tax revenue from fuel is going down.
p4287
aVBut quick!!
p4288
aVHouse illegals and their illegal children and pay all their expenses indefinitely!
p4289
aVme included, and by most standards I'm rich\u000a\u000aThat said I just bought a house and spent everything no bolted down on down payment and closing costs.
p4290
aVno c-section necessary?
p4291
aVdid they just lube him up?
p4292
aVarticle leaves out the most important details
p4293
aV14 pages of lies and half-truths
p4294
aVI'm sure the local authorities knew nothing about it.
p4295
aVRemember kids, you can always talk to a cop. 
p4296
aVI saw a documentary recently on HBO about how Chinese businessmen go from state to state scrap yards buying up as much scrap metal as they can.
p4297
aVSo I checked my states (Florida) largest export.
p4298
aVsure enough, The number one export by far is $446 million dollars in scrap metal waste.
p4299
aVCalifornia was at $2.3 Billion in scrap metal export.
p4300
aVThe Chinese say it is easier to get these resources from scrap than to pull them out of the earth. 
p4301
aVThis belongs in /r/propaganda.
p4302
aVWe have a $20b trade deficit.  
p4303
aVWe have a trade deficit that is calculated incorrectly.
p4304
aVTrade deficits are currently calculated by the port of debarkation.
p4305
aVThis means that just because an iPhone was assembled in China with parts manufactured all over the world, including the United States, its value gets added to our trade deficit.
p4306
aVSome analysts say every iPhone adds $200 to the U.S. trade deficit.
p4307
aVSome economists have realized this and started recalculating trade deficits.
p4308
aVIt turns out that our trade deficit is not so large after all when you realize that most of the products that are supposedly "made in China" are just simply assembled in China with the actual components coming from the U.S., Japan, Europe and others.
p4309
aVCheck out this article here that sums it up nicely.
p4310

p4311
aVExactly how would a smart gun reduce gun violence anyhow?\u000a
p4312
aVSometimes guns get stolen.
p4313
aVPeople who steal guns shoot people with them.
p4314
aVThe only smart guns actually available use strong magnets controlled by magnetic rings.
p4315
aVSo to keep the firearm safe I would need to wear that ring at all times.
p4316
aVIf I kept the ring with the weapon as most people probably would when they aren't using it it makes it completely worthless in the situation you're describing.
p4317
aVOn top of that the firearm is still mostly mechanically the same.
p4318
aVIf it were stolen a simple amount of tinkering would remove the "smart" component.
p4319
aVThe only thing a smart gun lockout system is good for is making sure a firearm is not immediately useful in an attackers hand if it is stolen from you in hand to hand combat.
p4320
aVSince police officers are the most likely individuals to have their firearm taken from them in this manner it stands to reason that only police guns have this restriction.\u000a
p4321
aVWell your kids won't be able to shoot it by accident either unless they find the magnet thing too.
p4322
aVIf someone's dumb enough to leave a firearm and ammunition where children can access it, they're probably not smart or careful enough to put the ring in a separate location.
p4323
aVWhile never taking the ring off would fix that, most people wouldn't be willing to always wear it. 
p4324
aVKids will find shit, not everyone can afford a safe.
p4325
aVIf you can't afford to secure a weapon from children, you shouldn't own a weapon.
p4326
aVThat should be obvious.
p4327
aVA trigger lock would work just fine.
p4328
aVI'm not disagreeing with any of your points, I just don't see why smart guns should be illegal.
p4329
aVBecause there are laws in some states that will force gun stores to only stock smart guns when smart guns hit the market. 
p4330
aVCan you help by providing links to evidence?
p4331
aVI have been told New Jersey has such a law, anyone else?
p4332
aVWay to bury the lede, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
p4333
aVIt doesn't even mention New Jersey until halfway down. 
p4334
aVBecause they are not necessary.
p4335
aVThey would most likely be prohibitively expensive.
p4336
aVThey would do nothing to deter crime.
p4337
aVI can't imagine they would be very reliable, at least at first.  
p4338
aVDo you want this axe or this electronically controlled and regulated axe that will prevent you from accidentally cutting off your arm but probably will stop working in the event of (long list of things that can interfere with electronics including your neighbor).
p4339
aVMaybe I should read the article to know what their study concluded...  haha
p4340
aVcause i don't need a gay ass bracelet to fire my gun
p4341
aVIf you squeeze the trigger, the gun better go bang as the situation must be very dangerous to warrant a trigger pull.
p4342
aVI would never install something or buy something new that added any unnecessary complexity that could potentially stop the bang from happening. 
p4343
aVOnly in New Jersey.
p4344
aVsmh.
p4345
aVNO NO NO...\u000a\u000aDon't you remember?
p4346
aVThe BIG stimulus???
p4347

aVAll the bridges are fixed now.

aVREMEMBER ??

aVThey are not.
p4353
aV??
p4354
aV?
aVIf you think that public opinion is relevant to those deciding policy decisions like this one, then you're gonna have a bad time.
p4355
aVI don't, but I found it interesting that this result was the case after years of News Corp bombardment that people should think otherwise.
p4356
aVI'm puzzled by how sometimes this kind of attitude adjustment by the masters of the universe is so effective and other times the public seems very resistant to it.
p4357
aVAnd enduring public opinion sometimes does seem to impact policy in a glacial sort of way.
p4358
aVLook at how the war on drugs is eroding at last.

p4362
aVOur country is not concerned about us.
p4363
aVOur state is not concerned about ourselves.
p4364
aVWe have NO leadership on this issue.
p4365
aVIt's absolutely terrifying.
p4366
aVObviously, I'm not a Californian nor do I pretend to be, but I thought your stare was the great liberal and progressive state.
p4367
aVHow can this happen and why aren't your politicians, media stars, and old school hippies doing anything.
p4368
aVAnd if they are, what are they doing that I should support?
p4369
aVIt's Fucking INSANITY.
p4370
aVNo one is doing shit.
p4371
aVThe politicians are silent,the mainstream media is silent.
p4372
aVGolf courses, almonds are growing, tons of our NorCal water is being diverted to irrigate almond farms, and cattle ranches, and fucking fracking.

aVNothing is happening.

aVNot a word on industrial use.
p4376
aVCalifornian in San Francisco here!
p4377
aVIt seems that there are vague restrictions imposed on water use that could result in fines but they are seldom enforced.
p4378
aVThere is no real signage on the streets or PSAs to remind people or advise them on what to do.
p4379
aVI'm waiting for politicians to put forth a strong statement addressing the claims that California has one year of water left because that's pretty terrifying.
p4380
aVThe chain reaction that will happen when we run out of water sounds apocalyptic. 
p4381
aVAgreed.
p4382
aVFirst there'll be a mass exodus from California.
p4383
aVI dint know if the surrounding states could handle that.
p4384
aVPlus poverty and disease become a big deal.
p4385
aVWater will become the next oil. 
p4386
aV"Nestl pays only 65 cents for each 470 gallons it pumps out of the ground \u2013 the same rate as an average residential water user.
p4387
aV" How is this stealing?
p4388
aVBecause it's water from an aquifer that belongs to CA, where we are running out of water, and being packaged and sold through out the world.
p4389
aVWhat exactly do you think will happen when our state, which supplies 25% of the country's food, becomes a barren fucking desert?  
p4390
aVI am more concerned that people had such a problem with promoting diversity and acceptance.
p4391
aVThe US does not have a national language, so a week of reading the pledge in different languages should not offend anyone.
p4392
aVOf course there are going to be ignorant morons who get offended by a middle-eastern language "soiling their pledge".
p4393
aVThe sad part about all of this is that there are students that have been taught by their parents that this should be offensive.
p4394
aVIt's really a shame that the culture which divides our countries is still in full swing because parents are preaching this hate to their children.
p4395
aVMost of them were children of Jewish parents or those who served in Afghanistan.
p4396
aVI didn't think that those people "defending our freedoms" were mostly dumb fucks to not realize that Arabic isn't even spoken in Afghanistan.
p4397
aVEven if it was, so the fuck what?
p4398
aVUgh.... Mandarin, Gaelic, Apache, Spanish, Japanese, German, Russian, no problems so far....... Arabic HUGE PROBLEM, that is so offensive I might just rip off my ears and go shoot some Muslims are revenge!
p4399
aVWtf is wrong with people?
p4400
aVWe have had our conflicts with all languages listed.
p4401
aVShouldn't they be just as offensive?

aV language isn't killing anyone, intolerance is.

p4404
aVDespite this, I don't know why students attend out of state and private colleges.
p4405
aVWhy pay that much when you can go to a state school.
p4406
aVAlso, our economy doesn't allow students to major in anything, you gotta make informed decisions that match your career choice and the job demands.
p4407
aVAt the same time, universities do rip people off.
p4408
aVDo I really need music appreciation to be a school counselor?
p4409
aVThis is my beef, too, that people seem to think they have to go somewhere expensive to get a decent education and avoid living in poverty.
p4410
aVIt's a lie perpetuated by...by what or whom, I don't know.
p4411
aVAnd I agree that schools should trim down their credit hour requirements.
p4412
aVI get that we want well-rounded students, but there were certainly classes that I took only because they were the most interesting ones of the bunch I had to pick from.
p4413
aVIf I had the choice, I wouldn't have taken them at all.
p4414
aVI say major in whatever you want, *provided you have thought it through*.
p4415
aVI have an English degree from a state school and earn almost $70,000 a year.
p4416
aVI have $15k in student loans to put it all in perspective.
p4417
aVAt the end of the day, though, it's the person signing for the loans who needs to take more responsibility for the decision to take on and agree to pay back the debt.
p4418
aVThe student loan problem has been a problem for years.
p4419
aVIt's not like at this point people can say they weren't aware of it when making their educational decisions.

aVA couple weeks ago, a [poorly written petition](http://pastebin.com/nKXjWg2x) (which I'm ashamed to say almost half the school signed for obvious reasons) was written to try and get the administration to postpone finals due to emotional trauma(unlike at Columbia where law students claimed to "lose all faith in the American legal system" as their reason).
p4466
aVThe administration gave in a little.
p4467
aVThey extended the "pass/no pass" deadline for classes, meaning that students could choose to take a class as simply a "pass" or a "fail" at a later date than usual.
p4468
aVThey also allowed professors to extend finals deadlines at their discretion.
p4469
aVAs you can imagine, the faculty didn't like this very much (specifically this professor), leading to [this exchange](http://i.imgur.com/pOSvWBK.jpg?1) between a student and a professor, which led to [this facebook post](http://imgur.com/WyppgfP.jpg), which then exploded in a complete shitstorm.\u000a

aVthe blades aren't required to be sharp and ive never seen a sharp one... they are symbolic of the Sikhs duty to help defend anyone who is oppressed or being harmed in any way.

aVThat's about as ridiculous as the one Fox made.

aVI don't understand this either: The video says "the fourth American diagnosed with Ebola" and right in the text of the article it says "So far, Duncan's diagnosis is the only verified one in the U.S." What?
p4515
aVOh I see, they got Ebola in Africa and are Americans... that's kind of misleading because she makes it sound like these are cases popping up in America, when our only diagnosis here was to a guy who contracted it in Liberia.

aVLockdown because they finally locked down the uncooperative and reckless family of the man who lied and recklessly exposed 100 people.

aV&gt;In the wake of the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) (2001), a three-day lockdown of American [airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace) was initiated to prevent any remaining escapes of perpetrators.
p4526
aV&gt;In December 2005, the New South Wales Police Service initiated a lockdown of the [Sutherland Shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire) and other beach areas of New South Wales to contain race rioting (and retaliative strikes).
p4527
aVThe New South Wales Labor government, in an emergency sitting of parliament, passed an array of amendments to legislation giving the New South Wales Police Service additional powers to 'lock down' targeted areas and roads within New South Wales.
p4528
aVThe legislation introduced to deal with the [2005 Cronulla riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Cronulla_riots) was the *Law Enforcement Legislation Amendment (Public Safety) Act 2005* (NSW).

p4530
aV&gt;An example of a campus/school lockdown was demonstrated at the [University of British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia) (UBC) on January 30, 2008, when an unknown threat was made and the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police) (RCMP) issued a lockdown on one of the buildings on campus for six hours, cordoning off the area, and a campus alert was sent via email to everyone affiliated with UBC while students and faculties were to remain locked in the building.

aV&gt;Abstract\u000a\u000a&gt;Aspartame, an artificial sweetener is very widely used in many foods and beverages.
p4620
aVBut there are controversies about its metabolite which is marked for its toxicity.
p4621
aVHence it is believed to be unsafe for human use.
p4622
aVPrevious studies have reported on methanol exposure with involvements of free radicals on excitotoxicity of neuronal apoptosis.
p4623
aVHence, this present study is proposed to investigate whether chronic aspartame (FDA approved Daily Acceptable Intake (ADI),40 mg/kg bwt) administration could release methanol, whether it can induce changes in brain oxidative stress status and gene and protein expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3 in the rat brain region.
p4624
aVTo mimic the human methanol metabolism, methotrexate (MTX)-treated Wistar strain male albino rats were used and after the oral administration of aspartame, the effects were studied along with controls and MTX-treated controls.
p4625
aVAspartame exposure resulted with a significant increase in the enzymatic activity in protein carbonyl, Lipid peroxidation levels, Superoxide dismutase, Glutathione-S-Transferase, Glutathione peroxidase and Catalase activity in (Aspartame MTX)-treated animals and with a significant decrease in reduced Glutathione, Glutathione reductase and protein thiol, pointing out the generation of free radicals.
p4626
aVThe gene and protein expression of pro apoptotic marker Bax showed a marked increase whereas the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 decreased markedly indicating the aspartame is harmful at cellular level.
p4627
aVIt is clear that long term aspartame exposure could alter the brain antioxidant status, and can induce apoptotic changes in brain.

aVI cannot find the answer.
p4690
aVIf it was pre-1983, when Reagan signed MLK Day into law, then it's not racist.
p4691
aVBut if it was created in spite of MLK, that's a different story. 
p4692
aVI live in Arkansas and I cant currently find any sources but Robert E Lee's birthday was established first.
p4693
aVI do find it kind of tasteless to celebrate a losing generals birthday as a way to hang on to a dying racist culture.

aVStatements need to be made in such a way that there can be very little interpretation besides the intended interpretation.

aVThe OP linked article clearly states that the ex-boyfriend was talked to and released.
p4712
aVIn murder investigations, the first suspects are the closest people to the deceased.
p4713
aVThe stories you have linked all state that the ex-boyfriend was talked to and released.
p4714
aVThe OP article states that the investigators have talked to the ex-boyfriend, but no arrest were made.
p4715
aVThe article goes on to state that friends of the deceased were spreading some pictures of the ex and the deceased around FB.
p4716
aVThere are screen shots of the conversation in the linked article.
p4717
aVWe don't know of the xe-b and the deceased relationship, and the two individuals histories, and the experiences they shared with the FB posters who seemed sure 'the black guy done it' without stating what they had witnessed from their relationship, which makes it hard to understand just what went down.

aVA free speech zone is the antithesis of free speech.

aVI can imagine in the future the "free speech zone" will turn into the place where the crazy men talk to themselves because the public has become so complacent.

aVWhile I am highly doubtful of the source and agree with WheelerDan, I also found it funny that the main concern of the "sources" and the comments was the financial drain these children are instead of concern over children's care.
p4771
aVAlso should be pointed out lice are a serious problem throughout the US and can be found in any school and all of the diseases noted have vaccines so if the majority of the US population was vaccinated these children would be no risk to public health. 
p4772
aVWhile this is silly opinion piece, is it really a surprise that thousands of children from drug war torn countries, being kept in cramped conditions are carrying lice and other wonderful diseases?

p4792
aVI was wondering that too.
p4793
aVI looked up more information, and it appears this applies to ALL land mines, including the Claymore mine, and anti-tank mines.
p4794
aVI wonder how this would affect things, or if the US is going to come up with some kind of weapon "like" a claymore mine, but call it a "placed grenade charge" or the like.

aVWhat the US military says to the public and what it actually does are two different things.
p4800
aV3.
p4801
aVIn the event of a real war against a credible adversary the military will have the governments public support to make any weapon that does not violate Geneva conventions.
p4802
aVAdditionally they will have secret support to create weapons that violate Geneva conventions.
p4803
aV4.
p4804
aVContrary to popular belief the United States Government and Military are no more ethical on the battlefield than any other countries. 
p4805
aVThe way I understand it is that the US is just destroying old "conventional" landmines.
p4806
aVIt will continue to develop and deploy new types of mines that supposedly become ineffective after a certain period in time therefore they don't consider them indiscriminate weapons.
p4807
aVAlso I don't think that the US has really any intent to ever sign the Ottawa Treaty (which is the treaty banning the use of landmines).
p4808
aVedit: Nevermind, I read more about this on NPR and it says that that's exactly what they intend to do, join the Ottawa Treaty.

aVAwesome to read, one week before heading to the Dominican Republic for vacation.....

aVSheesh, I without sounding like the old-fart that I am, I was walking to school at 7 years old (2nd grade).
p4811
aVMy elementary school was 1.25 miles from home.
p4812
aVI walked nearly every day from 2nd grade all the way through high school graduation.
p4813
aVAlso, I've been to Hawaii and walking a mile in Hawaii doesn't sound like a punishment as much as a reward.
p4814
aVAlso, if there are so many pedophiles around that kids can't be outside, maybe the judge should work with the police to reduce that number.
p4815
aVI'm in my mid 20s and I remember walking to and from elementary school most of the time (my parents were teachers in a whole other city) my walk was probably a little less than a mile but by that judge's theory, I'm one lucky sob.
p4816
aVSad that parents aren't able to discipline the same as in the past.
p4817
aVSounds like it's becoming more and more difficult to parent these days.
p4818
aVI'm sure there's two sides to this.
p4819
aVPossibly.
p4820
aVSure.
p4821
aVBut the remarks allegedly spoken by the judge are pure comedy gold. 
p4822
aVSo stupid.
p4823
aVI mean, there are probably a million ways to discipline a kid, but I don't see the harm here.
p4824
aVI used to walk all over my town.
p4825
aVAt least the kid wasn't being beaten.
p4826
aVSome thing the courts should just but out of.

p4832
aVHere are people who have enough problems as it is, having what little they can muster taken away by someone who goes home to their big phat mansion (relatively speaking).
p4833

p4868
aVI have never liked it I've always thought it was inappropriate that they used it.
p4869
aVI have now found out that my daughter during the WCCO interview decide...d to use Snapchat and send people videos of her thinking that this was a game and it was funny and she actually uses the N-word twice.
p4870
aVRegardless of your skin color I and my wife do not tolerate this word our daughter is going to be reprimanded in an appropriate manner.
p4871

aVI hope that this does not stop our efforts to highlight the issues that still remain regarding bully and the effects it has on children.

aV15,000 chicken nuggets?
p4938
aVThat's, like, two orders.
p4939
aVThe amount of water used for bottled water is so minuscule that this is not even worth mentioning.
p4940
aVYes I do know, and its not California its the Florida Springs. 
p4941
aVWhile this doesn't change how horrible him being shot and killed are, it does introduce a whole lot of context into the situation.
p4942
aVHe was not randomly stopped for jaywalking like we thought- he was a suspect in a crime with video evidence against him.
p4943
aVSo he needed to be stopped by the Police.
p4944
aVIf indeed there was a struggle, this guy is a fricken' giant, 6'4'' 290 pounds.
p4945
aVWhat the hell is the officer going to do if that guy is wailing on him?
p4946
aVOf course he panicked.
p4947
aVNow, did the officer shoot this "kid" (sorry dude, at that size you are a man) while the kid was on his knees with his hands up, or was it actually during the struggle?
p4948
aVBecause thats everything. 
p4949
aVMy question is why this wasn't released sooner?
p4950
aVPolice should have said, 'robbery suspect involved in shooting with police officer'. 
p4951
aVMaybe they weren't certain at the start of this?
p4952
aVThe officer who shot him did not know he was a suspect.
p4953
aVIt's a bogus story to smear the victim.
p4954
aVInteresting article that had Brown's friend admit to the robbery.
p4955
aVhttp://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ferguson-police-name-michael-brown?cid=sm_m_main_1_20140815_29822566
p4956
aVLots of inconsistencies.
p4957
aV~~This doesn't change anything.~~  Changes somethings, but still even if he was a suspect in a crime, are the policy really justified in shooting an unarmed suspect over a $50 theft????
p4958
aV~~Furthermore I've only seen info that he was suspect in the crime but nothing saying that he was guilty, if that was the case it would be prudent for the police to produce some evidence to support that.~~\u000a\u000aEdit: The second article posted in the comments contains exactly what I was wondering, where was the evidence from the robbery.
p4959
aVThe police say the shooting happened because the officer's life was being threatened.
p4960
aVNow that we know this guy was a violent criminal (violent from the video of his grabbing the clerk by the throat and throwing him against the shelf), it is very easy to believe the police's story that the guy attacked and threatened the police officer.
p4961
aVNow, if they can prove with objective evidence that the guy was not actively attacking the police officer when he was shot, then they could convict him of murder.
p4962
aVBut until that happens, the story the police gave is much more likely and the officer is innocent until proven guilty.
p4963
aVThanks for the actual reply instead of just down voting.
p4964
aVIt will be interesting to see what happens now that the autopsy has been released and sounds like it supports the eye witness testimony.
p4965
aVI can see the cops point of view if he was assaulted by this kid, but at the same time isnt' there a reason a cop carries a baton, pepper spray, and a taser as well as their gun.
p4966
aVIf I read correctly the cop is saying that Michael was in his vehicle struggling for the cop's weapon, that just doesn't make any sense to me why would someone do that.
p4967
aVEven if trying to play tough in front of others, that scenario just doesn't make any sense.
p4968
aVNow that the autopsy has been released though and it sounds like it shows that Michael was gunned down while surrendering, it will be interesting to see what comes of this.
p4969
aVI also don't think that the autopsy by itself disproves the cop's story but it still doesn't make sense to me that even if the cop was struggling with this guy if he was unarmed why was it necessary to shoot him.
p4970
aV&gt;If I read correctly the cop is saying that Michael was in his vehicle struggling for the cop's weapon, that just doesn't make any sense to me why would someone do that.
p4971
aVWell, it doesn't make sense to *me* why someone would go into a convenience store, steal a box of cigars on camera, manhandle the clerk and throw him up against the wall, knowing all of this is being recorded and his face is all over the video.
p4972
aVI can't imagine someone being so stupid as to do *that*.
p4973
aVAnd yet he did just that.
p4974
aV&gt;Even if trying to play tough in front of others, that scenario just doesn't make any sense.
p4975
aVBut think about the other scenario.
p4976
aVPeople are saying the kid was standing there with his hands up in surrender, and the cop just murdered him in cold blood.
p4977
aVThe guy has no criminal record, no record of misconduct as an officer, he's been serving the police force and serving his community for 6 years.
p4978
aVYou really think this guy would just up and decide one day, out of the blue, to pull out his gun and *execute* an innocent teenager, who's standing there in surrender, for no reason?
p4979
aVThat is an absolutely extraordinary accusation, and one that I find very difficult to believe.
p4980
aVI find it much easier to believe that the kid was being violent and attacking the officer, considering he has just finished being violent and robbing a convenience store.
p4981
aVThat being said, obviously they should rely on evidence and proof before making any accusations.
p4982
aVObjective evidence takes priority over any and all testimony or character analysis, and I'm confident they will do the right thing. \u000a
p4983
aVFair point.
p4984
aVIt seems in the next few days there maybe some answers finally.
p4985
aV&gt;The guy has no criminal record, no record of misconduct as an officer, he's been serving the police force and serving his community for 6 years.
p4986
aVBrown had no criminal record either AFAIK.
p4987
aVLooked like a kid who went in, tried to buy some cigars, got refused and got pissed off.
p4988
aVWho knows what the clerk said to him, the guy he was with even **put back** the box Brown handed him.
p4989
aVPersonally, not having a record doesn't mean a single thing on either side.
p4990
aVOften, it simply means you've not been caught.
p4991
aVI think both sides are lying to an extent.
p4992
aVI like how you're making excuses for someone that shoplifted and violently threw a clerk around who tried to stop him.
p4993
aVObviously you have another agenda and have absolutely no interest in facts or evidence; you're just another one of those people that wants to see this guy convicted with no trial. 
p4994
aVSpare me your holier than thou bullshit.
p4995
aVYou want facts?
p4996
aVBrown had no prior history.
p4997
aVThat's a fact.
p4998
aVIf you think the scuffle on the video is violent, you haven't really seen violence.
p4999
aVWe just raised a bunch of money here to send a convenience clerk's body back to India where some guy came in and simply shot him point blank without giving him a chance to react.
p5000
aV**That's violence**.
p5001
aVThe facts?
p5002
aVThis kid got angry, made a mistake, then the cop got scared and killed him.
p5003
aVThere's blame on all sides here.
p5004
aVThe sad reality is cops used to be able to deal with someone like that without shooting them. 
p5005
aVEveryone can relax now though, the perpetrator/police officer has been assigned desk duty.
p5006
aVNot sure what to make of this.
p5007
aVShe resisted and put hands in the officers face which could be considered a "threat" but he was stopping her because she's homeless and was walking to get where ever she was going on the interstate?
p5008
aVIf he was really trying to help her and was afraid for her well being walking on the interstate I don't think elbows to the head is the best option. 
p5009
aVThere's a video in the news link, did you watch it?

aVI had wondered about this last winter and posted a question about it in ask science where I got zero replies.
p5027
aVBut I guess the answer is yes, this can happen.
p5028
aVIncreased climate variability, so more of everything.
p5029
aVI think that the methane is the big problem, every increase in temperature releases more methane ice (methane clathrate) along the continental shelf or under permafrost.
p5030
aVLots and lots of methane is trapped as ice and a small increase in temperature releases a lot of it, which can release still more.
p5031
aVThe methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2.
p5032
aVSo the danger is that a runaway, nonlinear situation could develop. 
p5033
aVOMG GLOBAL WARMING
p5034
aVYes, global warming will encourage many odd and increasingly extreme weather oddities that can cause anything from excessive cold to sering heat and massive floods to prolonged drought.
p5035
aVRemember, global warming is the one or two degree average temperature increase over like a 100 year period or something.
p5036
aVWhat happens in ten years, rather on one year, is just statistical noise.
p5037
aVThe long term average is what matters.
p5038
aVThe biggest concern is that the average ocean temperatures will rise, causing dissolved CO2 to be released at a higher rate, perpetuating a snowballing cycle of doom.
p5039
aVYou are ignoring the methane clathrate (ice)

aVCouldn't help but notice some peculiar numbers...\u000a\u000a"...At the unofficial reported cost of $250 per person per day, President Barack Ob..."\u000a\u000aAdmittedly, the reporter claims the per diem is an unofficial number, but lets say for a second that it IS a real number and that it costs, to house-clothe-feed... a person what the government most likely will be paying, namely $250 per day, or basically $7,500 per month...
p5043
aVThe government does realize, doesn't it, that it only gives AMERICAN citizens who are drawing disability or social security (who have, say, worked all their lives here and paid taxes and are usually, through no fault of their own, now unable to continue to work - many bordering on death) about $54 dollars a day to live on (about 1,600 a month)...\u000a\u000aWhat the fuck?

aVAnd throwing a bag of kittens in the river would be 99.5 percent cheaper than keeping them and having to feed them and provide medical care.

aVThat's a bad comparison.
p5057
aVThe problem is, by law.
p5058
aVif you know you have a great white shark, which you are not allowed to knowingly catch and keep, you are supposed to cut your line or catch and release.
p5059
aVThese ASSHOLES knew they had a great white on the line and were laughing while innocent long distance swimmers who were training swam right towards the shark.
p5060
aVThe shark was obviously agitated by being on the line for a significant amount of time, which most likely provoked the attack. 
p5061
aVAbout ten years ago or so this happened before.
p5062
aVNo one was attacked but a great white was caught.
p5063
aVThey were arrested and fine by fish and game. 
p5064
aVwhat...
p5065
aVI mean, who swims in the same place people are fishing and pulling 7 foot sharks out of the water?  
p5066

aV&gt;We understand your concern.
p5080
aVHowever, there are very strict FAA regulations when a plane is on the tarmac.\u2014 \u000a\u000aPassing the buck.
p5081
aVAs if the FAA would fine them for allowing a kid to use the restroom.
p5082
aVTrue but they didn't know when they would get the ok to take off, which would bring about biggera problems in the long run.
p5083
aVThe mother should have taken the kid to the bathroom before boarding.
p5084
aVYeah the attendant couldn't really win in this situation.
p5085
aVIf she lets a kid (and presumably the mom) go to the restroom, others would have demanded the same.
p5086
aVThings can go from bad to uncontrollable when a group of people are stuck on a plane so you can't really bend the rules.
p5087
aVThe FAA has relaxed their old rules about holding planes on the tarmac, but after only an hour they wouldn't have kicked in.
p5088
aVAnyone getting on a plane (or getting a kid on a plane) should be prepared to be trapped in their seat for a while because you never know what's going to happen with takeoff - turbulence, being stuck waiting for weather to pass, etc - a lot of things can keep those seat belt lights on longer than you'd like.
p5089
aVI'm also inclined to think that the off duty pilot chimed in because he knew the flight would be delayed a LOT longer had they returned to the gate, not because he thought it was ok for the mom to disregard the attendants instructions to get back in her seat.

aVHurry with the character assassination before the general public realizes this isn't about land ownership or grazing rights dues and that there is a dirty campaign fraud kickback energy plan being pushed by BLM thugs' illegal conspirings.
p5107
aVI'm aware of the fracking push that's coming through BLM but is this the guy we want for a poster boy?
p5108
aVAnd as for character assassination this guy stands in front of cameras and says this stuff, how can you think it's not going to get covered?
p5109
aVNo one makes him say this unless energy companies employ mind control tech nowadays.
p5110
aVSure he is no poster boy and says dumb stuff in front of cameras, but media chooses what things he says they want to publish.
p5111
aVYou haven't heard positive or compelling things he's said published by mainstream news, that is for sure.
p5112

p5228
aVI guess you might notice an influx of Eastern European looking white people but that's really weird to target a demographic like that that doesn't even compose a majority of the population, and whose population increased more in the 90s.
p5229
aV-Reason why I think it's odd is that the article seems to be implying that there's some kind of widespread racism against *Bosnians* committed by blacks, which is odd because Bosnians look like white people.
p5230
aVSo far it's been a Bosnian dude who got beaten* and now this chick. \u000a\u000a\u000a

aVMany would be hard pressed to dissent from your view of this man and his decision.
p5281
aVWouldn't it be better if they instead launched a massive personal initiative to gain more education and/or more marketable skills?
p5282
aVMany of them *have* a good education and marketable skills.
p5283
aVThey aren't worth squat because there are no jobs in those fields.
p5284
aVAnd before you go "haha, guess their skills aren't marketable", there are *no* fields that are safe.
p5285
aVPlus, your "personal initiative to gain more education" costs time and money that these people don't have, not when their income barely covers food and rent.
p5286
aVWhat are they supposed to do, get a free degree from the all-night degree shop?
p5287
aVSo, you want the govt to force companies to pay wages not commensurate with the skill level of the job performed?
p5288
aVWhat not instead force companies to charge less for their products?
p5289
aVWhy not address the issue of the seemingly exponential increase in the cost of higher education?
p5290
aVWhile we're at it, why don't we address why it is that a college degree is required for a job that barely pays above minimum wage?  
p5291
aVA living wage IS commensurate with the skill level of ANY job performed.
p5292
aVIf the minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would already *be* higher than it is today.
p5293
aV" Why not address the issue of the seemingly exponential increase in the cost of higher education?
p5294
aV"\u000a\u000aBecause we can focus on two things at once.

aV"While we're at it, why don't we address why it is that a college degree is required for a job that barely pays above minimum wage?
p5296
aV"\u000a\u000aBecause we can focus on *three* things at once.
p5297
aVAgain, why are you focusing on a singular symptom in the minimum wage instead of the inflationary policies of the gov't and the federal reserve which affect the total cost of living?
p5298
aVYou are missing the forest for the trees.
p5299
aVIf you address the issue of inflation due to over-regulation and the inflationary policy of the Federal Reserve, minimum wage would stretch a lot further.
p5300
aVMinimum wage was never meant to be a living wage though.
p5301
aVIt was never designed to support a family.
p5302
aVIt was meant for unskilled workers who were to gain skills and move up.
p5303

p5313
aVThey may not be in the locale the person prefers, but if one is willing to move, there are plenty of jobs.
p5314

p5351
aVSorry but students need to brighten up and realize a degree means absolutely nothing.
p5352
aVEmployers are looking for real skills and a degree is an excuse for not having them.
p5353
aVYou need both to be honest.
p5354
aVI majored in business from a top ranking university for undergrad business studies and I'll say the reason I had a job (and a well paying one) out of college last year was because of the skills I learned outside of the business school, in my own research and studies.
p5355
aVWritten and oral communication, leadership, teamwork and technical knowledge are skills we all need but aren't being taught.
p5356
aVI think my generation needs to stop depending on a degree to get us places and take up our own method of education.
p5357
aVWe keep saying its the economy, outside influences.
p5358
aVHow about looking at the education system and start blaming that?
p5359
aV200 years a lot has changed but not the education system!
p5360
aVMakes a whole lot of sense right? 
p5361
aVThat's one small slice of what a college education can mean, I wouldn't trust a doctor or nurse or engineer who *didn't* learn skills in college, and a college degree is a sign that *they do have those skills*.
p5362
aVFrankly, I'm more concerned with what they know than their street smarts and oral communication and whathaveyou.
p5363
aVTechnical knowledge *is* what is taught in school in certain fields.
p5364
aVYour major in business is very far removed from a lot of other coursework.
p5365
aVIn terms of what people can actually accomplish, there simply aren't enough jobs for professional programmers and engineers and mathematicians, despite there being an incredibly great number of very well educated people.
p5366
aVI think instead of changing the education system we need to change the system people are educated into.
p5367
aVA world where leadership (of what?
p5368
aV) and ability to coerce people into various business transactions is worth more than actually knowing things is a sad, sad world, but that is what people are being graduated into. 
p5369
aVBy having a degree in business, it is likely that yoh are going to be payed more than someone who doesn't have a degree.
p5370
aVIt may be easier to get a job with experience, but a degree can help open doors later in your career.
p5371
aVYou've stated the issue right there.
p5372
aVHaving the degree matters more than the skills you've learned while completing it.

p5377
aVNative Americans (including hispanics) were robbed of thier way of life when the Europeans crossed the ocean and brought them diease, the bible and jesus.

aVLet's just hope he doesn't miss another golf vacation.
p5405
aVI want my The President to go on golf vacations.
p5406
aVI **do not** want a fatigued, overworked, and burnt out president, which is what we usually get because people complain or get snarky when the *busiest, most powerful executive in the world* tries to relax or allows his mind to recuperate.
p5407
aVYes the president needs vacations.
p5408
aVHe is not a super hero or a machine.
p5409
aVBut yet when Bush went on all those "vacations" to his ranch, the left cried like little babies?
p5410
aVHypocrisy much?\u000a
p5411
aVSure.
p5412
aVDoesn't change anything though.
p5413
aVAnd did you know his middle name is Hussein
p5414
aVThat not reason boy!
p5415
aVbe clear in your thought don't just barkout
p5416
aVI really don't think he did, you could interpret this a very different and more likely way.
p5417
aVThe dude is a father and has had this job for 5 and a half years.
p5418
aVI commented something to this effect in another story from ABC.
p5419
aV(another news station that vultures over stuff like this)\u000a\u000a&gt;I'm sure if my shit was flipped around and I was drunk or something I'd facetiously say I'd kill Boehner too, he's an asshole.
p5420
aVYou must have been there in person to know the exact circumstances and to know he was being completely serious.
p5421
aVPeople say weird shit to grief people all the time; for all you know the cops were asking him what medication he was on, he might have mentioned his "psychotic break" and they pressed him about it and he said "oh yeah I'm crazy I'm jesus christ.
p5422
aV" Do you know how easy it is to have a "psychotic break"?
p5423
aVAnd considering he just got fired from his job because of John Boehner and his club buddies I really wouldn't be surprised if he was depressed as hell and drinking a lot and extremely pissed off at John Boehner.
p5424
aV&gt;Yet you're here thinking this dude was literally planning to assassinate him.
p5425
aVDoes anyone think the cops would *not* write crazy shit you say off the cuff in a report if they wanted to be the ones to catch you as being the guy that talked about killing Boehner?
p5426
aVThey have every reason to turn everything against him and it sounds like they've done that. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p5427
aVShucks...
p5428
aVHe will get a full pardon one day.
p5429
aVRevenue collection activities will be back to normal shortly.
p5430
aVThis has little to do with crime and a lot to do with money.
p5431
aVAnd by "Work" we mean get back to being stealth tax collectors and reminding brown people that leaving the house means you may get felt up by NYP, better hope that's your fetish.
p5432
aVHail Vivec!

aVThis should be a boon for Tamriel, but maybe not so much for the USA.

p5435
aVSorry Vivek Murthy, I read your name wrong.
p5436
aVHow was Ted Nugent's post racist?
p5437
aVI mean trust me, I don't like the guy, but I really didn't see anything racist in that post.
p5438
aVThis article is pretty shitty and one-sided political tripe.
p5439
aVJust read it and it seems pretty damn racist to me.
p5440
aVCome on Ted, don't say Thug use the word you know you want to use.
p5441
aV Michael Brown was a thug.
p5442
aVYou know why?
p5443
aVBecause he broke the law multiple times, *and* assaulted a police officer, *and* attempted to reach for his weapon.
p5444
aVIn this kind of scenario, officers are trained recognize this as an attempt on their life and react accordingly.
p5445
aVEven if MB had been white/asian/whatever, it would be another thug taken off the streets.

aVSo if the guy doesn't get arrested, they aren't going to buy things?
p5453
aVLogic?
p5454
aVI think not.
p5455
aVBeats burning down businesses
p5456
aVYeah, but you could just, I don't know, live life?
p5457
aVWhere's the fun in that
p5458
aVUh, not going hungry is more fun than going hungry.
p5459
aVI am beaten and cannot offer a retort to that
p5460
aVThat thumbnail is completely irrelevant.

aVThis comment is completely relevantz

aVOne of my biggest fears in life .... going to prison for something I didn't do
p5463
aVWoman *wrongly* convicted.
p5464
aVOP has done a miraculous job of mangling the title so that it is not only redundant but also completely misses the point of the article:\u000a&gt; 'I'm a free woman now,' says Calif. grandmother wrongfully convicted of killing 17 years ago
p5465
aVWTF?
p5466
aVAhahahahaha you like that?

aV&gt; a felony charge for battering a person over the age of 65\u000a\u000aIs it extra illegal to assault someone who is old?
p5472
aVI expected this to be an actual punk, not "some guy who is an asshole".
p5473
aVThe facebook comments are fantastic: \u000a\u000aShows a mug shot of a redneck:\u000a\u000a&gt; Potty-mouthed liberals should be neither seen nor heard.
p5474
aVI hope they lock this liberal up and throw away the key.
p5475

aVAlmost every single other commentator is celebrating prison rape.
p5477

p5478
aVFinally, why is a small physical altercation in a restaurant "news".
p5479
aVI live in Philly.
p5480
aVIt was news a couple years ago that we went four days in a row without a murder.
p5481
aVGet off my news lawn.
p5482
aVYou sound like you're just like the guy in the article.
p5483
aVYou're probably a punk yourself.
p5484
aVI bet you're short too. 
p5485
aVNot OK to resort to violence but in seriousness, the guy might have had his reasons.
p5486
aVLife's a cold bitch because of people in it, and for all we know the people he killed were huge assholes who very well may have made his life a living hell every day.
p5487
aVMaybe they talked behind his back and got him fired and his life fell apart from that.
p5488
aVWho knows.
p5489
aVPeople can be really shitty and nasty in today's world.
p5490
aVSad for all involved.

aVNot gonna even edit it.
p5498
aVI like it too much l.
p5499
aV"students are not valued at NYU, but profit is"\u000a\u000aI feel like that is the same for most universities.
p5500
aVIt's a sad truth .
p5501
aV*It's also untrue.
p5502
aV*
aVThis is not "heartbreaking".
p5503
aVHeartbreaking is kids who would kill to go to community college and can't. 
p5504
aVWhile I understand your viewpoint, as one of those kids who volunteered for military service in order to go to community college, I can empathize with where she is coming from.
p5505
aVIn spite of having a military college fund and savings, I still had to drop out due to spiraling tuition costs that could not be covered by loans at the time.
p5506
aVHer complaint wasn't that she had to pay, it was about the clear inequities involved in asking $80k+ from people in the least position to pay, especially when the chancellor is raking in over $1.5m/yr and the staff are clearly putting enriching themselves above the educational process or, possibly in my view, the long term interests of the institution.
p5507
aVsorry you didn't have enough money for school D:
p5508
aVOh, had circumstances been different, I could have had enough money.
p5509
aVAt the time, I had budgeted out my education in advance.
p5510
aVI was also under 25, with parents unwilling to aid in paying for my education.
p5511
aVThis meant, under the rules at the time, I could not qualify for most loans.
p5512
aVWhen tuition tripled over the course of one semester I was neither able to float my own loan, nor could I make up the difference in my budget, even with extra hours worked.
p5513
aVI simply had to drop out.
p5514
aVIn the end it all worked out, as I focused on my hacking/IT skills which were a hobby, and found I could make a good living at that with much effort, but no degree.
p5515
aVHowever, I don't think most people have such luck/opportunities these days, as times have changed.
p5516
aVI also don't think that most people should have to be "outstanding in a field" to make a decent living- the world needs willing generalists, as much as it needs capable specialists.
p5517
aVAs a rule, many people go to college these days *solely for the purpose of advancing their financial security, not their knowledge*.
p5518
aVThat is counter intuitive if you think about it long enough.
p5519
aVUnfortunately, many, if not all colleges, are taking advantage of this meme, and are propagating it as far and wide as possible for their own benefit.
p5520
aVMost professions simply *do not* require a college education of any kind, as most people are not engaged in advancing their field of study in their day to day work.
p5521
aVMost people are simply interested in being able to afford a home, possibly have a family, not go bankrupt due to illness, and retire without eating cat food as a primary source of nutrition.
p5522
aVThis is not something anybody should have to be indentured for their entire lives to accomplish.
p5523
aVDoing so is counter to the ideals that most humans hold dear.
p5524
aVI feel that the "education bubble" is real, and that many things that people go to college for could be accomplished by an additional year of high school with a restructured curriculum.
p5525
aVMany of the things that people go to college for now were previously in the realm of trades education, which was generally free (or nearly so) until funding was completely gutted in most states.
p5526
aVThe idea that a college education is "necessary" in order to secure a better job is largely propagated by the system benefiting most from it, and only succeeds as an idea because people believe in it.
p5527
aVThank you for your service!
p5528
aVI actually went to school using my fathers military benefits.
p5529
aVI don't respect her argument because she chose a private (!
p5530
aV) school that cost four times what I paid to go to UT Austin, a world class university.
p5531
aVI also don't buy her "NYU is the only place I could go" argument because there are a lot of public universities that would've offered the same "safe haven".
p5532
aVShe made a bad decision by not going to a great school she could afford.
p5533
aVAlso I looked up the department she was enrolled in at NYU and the majors seems questionable and unemployable.
p5534
aVIf she was going to public school I think she might've had a point.
p5535
aVI think she is doing a disservice to the very valid issue of the cost of education and student loans by trying to get people on board with her flawed arguments. 
p5536
aVAll part of the dumbing down of America.
p5537
aVThe 1st 2 years of college should be readily available online for minimal cost.
p5538
aVIf this is what capitalism is all about, it is doomed to fail soon.
p5539
aVAs a recent grad with $82,000 worth of debt, both in low interest government loans and high interest private debt, this really ticks me off.
p5540
aVShe describes NYU as her dream school, yet expects to get it for free.
p5541
aVIf I have learned anything in my short time as a moderately independent member of society, it is that you don't get something for nothing.
p5542
aVLoans are the price we pay for a quality education that opens our eyes to a new view of the world and a deeper understanding of subjects that interest us.
p5543
aVSome are lucky enough to find work within that same discipline, but we are certainly not entitled to it.
p5544
aVIn the end it costs money for a university to provide such a quality education to students, nowhere is that more the case than in New York City.
p5545
aVThat money needs to be payed for by the consumers of the university's service.
p5546
aVWhat really "grinds my gears" isn't the student's complaint about the size of the bill, tuition increases have outpaced inflation after all (one could certainly argue the services provided by schools, and their associated expenses ,could justify this difference in growth rate).
p5547
aVMy gripe is with the student's argument that she should not have to dedicate some years of her life to pay her debt back.
p5548
aVWith proper saving and frugal living $80,000 is possible to pay back, former students face this challenge every day and with government loan plans, such as income adjusted payments, this is made easier on the student.
p5549
aVThe notion that she should be able to leave school without owing anyone a thing defines the problem with my generation, entitlement.
p5550
aVAssuming that we as students should be able to attend a school for 4 years and graduate with nothing to pay back is not that different than an individual signing a contract with Verizon for a cellphone, paying less than the cost of the service for the contract term, and being able to keep the phone at the end of the contract without paying for the remaining cost of the service and physical asset.
p5551
aVNYU is in my school's conference, and is certainly an elite school.
p5552
aVUsing the above example, one would not assume they should pay the same for an iPhone and it's associated service costs vs a Nokia flip phone.
p5553
aVThe iPhone is an elite device, and as such, should carry a higher price tag, whether that is paid in cash each year or as monthly payments over the course of a predefined term.
p5554
aVAdditionally, whether or not she is gay, straight, black, white, horizontal or vertical is not relevant in this situation at all.
p5555
aVNo one should get special treatment because of any sort of demographic checkbox.
p5556
aVSan Francisco and many other cities are just as queer friendly as New York, suggesting it was her only choice is irrelevant to her arguement and it seems she is trying to use her sexual orientation as leverage against the university.
p5557
aVIn fact her even mentioning her orientation seems more insulting to the LGBTQ community than anything else.
p5558
aVI hope someday she will realize her mistake and return to NYU or any other institution.
p5559
aVShe is clearly an intelligent individual, but she might need to have a reality check with regard to her expectations of what an education is worth.
p5560
aVIs it worth a life time of $700 a month payments, no.
p5561
aVIs it worth a few years of adapting our lives around paying back 4 years of, mostly responsibility free, self and world exploration?
p5562
aVHaving just completed the same journey, and facing a similar amount of debt, I would say yes.
p5563
aVI have the diploma, and now it's time to pay back the professors, administrators, custodians and others who have allowed me to gain at least an inkling of an understanding of who I am, what the world is, what ideals I hold, and the things to which I want to dedicate the MANY years of life I have ahead of me, years which extend far beyond the next ten years of my life.
p5564
aVThe U.S. higher education / loan bubble will pop.
p5565
aVIt is only a matter of a few more years of this poor jobs growth performance and the ascendency of Indian and Chinese institutions of higher learning.
p5566
aVOlive Garden servers don't need 4-year degrees and the world's brightest will always fight to go to college where the opportunities are brightest.
p5567
aVTL;DR: young woman could not afford to go to very expensive university in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the world because she did not have enough money saved and refused to take a loan\u000a\u000aboo hoo big fucking crocodile tears
p5568
aVwhat this guy said 100% \u000a\u000aI think education is a right; going to a super expensive school in a crazy expensive city is NOT a right. 
p5569
aVThe thing is, she could have taken a loan like everyone else who attends university.
p5570
aVShe simply does not want to pay for her education.
p5571
aV#EducationisNOTaright
p5572
aVIt should be.
p5573
aVWhen you live in a country where a college degree is necessary to obtain any kind of decent paying job, getting that college degree should be a right.
p5574
aVIt's beneficial for the entire country if it's members are educated and able to provide a decent life for themselves and their families.
p5575
aVUnless you are happy continuing to see welfare need go through the roof year after year, you should be supporting an initiative that allows people to support themselves without having to go the government for help.
p5576
aVthat's why many state college systems are so robust 
p5577
aVVery well, go ahead and pay for it. 
p5578
aV Luckily, my town sees it differently; we offer free college to all of our students here.
p5579
aVAnd, I don't know why you think that the tax dollars you are paying that go toward welfare, TANF, food stamps, etc.
p5580
aVare being any better spent that way than they would be on paying for a college education so people wouldn't have to rely on those social welfare programs.  
p5581
aVYou're making assumptions about where I think who's money should go where.
p5582
aVLook up libertarian.
p5583
aVThat's where I stand. 
p5584
aVI'm not making any assumptions.
p5585
aVJust saying you are already paying taxes (at least, I assume you are) and that I can't understand why you wouldn't support an educated society as opposed to one that is in poverty and under educated.
p5586
aVOf course, you are entitled to your own opinion, I wasn't trying to convert you.
p5587
aVI was just pointing out that the money being spent already can be better spent and that paying for education would make more sense.\u000a
p5588
aVI am a pediatric respiratory therapist in West Texas at a 400 bed hospital where we currently have 6 ICU status pediatric patients between the ages of 6 - 16, all asthmatics and all reporting rhinitis and burning/itchy swollen eyes on top of their severe asthma symptoms.
p5589
aVWhat I would take away from this (if you are a parent of an asthmatic) is to be cautious of those particular symptoms, and because it is airborne, I would keep a mask handy for your child in the case that he/she might have to be in the same room with the symptomatic individual.
p5590
aVAlso make them religiously wash hands.
p5591
aVThe severity of asthmatic symptoms escalates very quickly in the case of enteroviruses, and spreads VERY EASILY.
p5592
aVEdit: a word
p5593
aVThank you so much for this.
p5594
aVEdit: Itchy, swollen eyes AND rhinitis (runny nose, right)?
p5595
aVDamn, other than the asthma, my sister and I both had those two symptoms this week.
p5596
aVProbably just allergies, but I'll keep a really close eye on the asthmatic niece.
p5597
aVRhinitis is inflammation of the nasal airway (nasal conchae) but is sometimes accompanied by runny nose.
p5598
aVThe rubbing of ones eyes and wiping of the nose is presumably how it is spreading in addition to airborne aerosol droplets, which is why I say to wash hands religiously.

p5604
aVDon't really know what I can take away from this article, considering its obvious biases, but from the looks of it, she simply forgot to check the area laws, and paid the price (not necessarily justly).
p5605
aVIt also say that she unwittingly crossed the border into NJ.
p5606
aVI don't really see how that's possible, because the NJ/PA border is market (rather clearly) by the roaring Delaware rice.
p5607
aVKind of hard to miss.
p5608
aVtl;dr it's her own fault but it's stupid she's being punished so harshly\u000a\u000a

aVAmazing, pass a law forcing people to buy insurance and the number of people without insurance goes down...who'd a thunk it
p5638
aVWho gives a fuck if you have "insurance" if it's coverage that doesn't cover much and you can still end up buried under insurmountable medical debt?
p5639
aVThis.
p5640
aVObamacare tried to force more coverage, and did force the bar raised on what is covered and covering preexisting conditions, but I think the dirty insurance companies may have offset most people's benefit of that by jacking up deductibles, which makes poor people reluctant to use their coverage, because they can't afford to.
p5641
aVI used to have good insurance but my current high deductible plan from my employer eats up about 15% of my salary.
p5642
aV"may"\u000a\u000aThe problem is, for profit insurance has been unaffordable for most Americans since the 1990s, but they cannot admit that because of the US's free trade ideology which we are busy forcing on other countries.
p5643
aV**For example, [right now the US is trying to use TTIP to destroy the UK's public healthcare system](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/social-europe-jobs/uk-anti-ttip-protests-focus-nhs-privatisation-303339).

aVBuh-bye.
p5669
aVActually, I've not tried to be clever at all.
p5670
aVI'm capable of it, but with an adversary such as yourself it's entirely unnecessary.
p5671
aVYou have declared that I'm wrong twice now, yet you've failed to demonstrate how in any single regard.
p5672
aVIn fact, as is typical of your ilk, you've fallen back to the usual trite canards and baseless ad hominem attacks.
p5673
aVYour remarks are weak, hollow, and devoid of truth.
p5674
aVWell, look at you, getting to feel all smart and all that because someone chose not to argue a matter of opinion with you.
p5675
aVYou're clearly the victor here.
p5676
aVWorrying about how many times I've been right or wrong, and never demonstrating how you yourself are right!

aVThe headline is technically true in that he did compare the two, but it's a bit misleading.
p5682
aVWhat he's actually saying is that, in the same way an alcoholic may have a genetic predisposition to consume alcohol irresponsibly, a homosexual may have a genetic predisposition to engage in homosexual behavior.
p5683
aVBoth of those statements are largely supported by scientific evidence.
p5684
aVIt's the implied idea that a homosexual should suppress those urges as an alcoholic should, or that homosexuality is at all socially destructive in the way that alcoholism is, that is insensitive, offensive, etc.
p5685
aVSo he's not wrong; he's just an asshole.
p5686
aVWhile everyone else compares Rick Perry to a fucking moron.
p5687
aV&gt;"I may have the genetic coding that I\u2019m inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that - and I look at the homosexual issue the same way," Perry said.

aVOf all the truly idiotic things this man has said this quote barely registers.

p5699
aVThis title is highly misleading despite the "".
p5700
aVThere is probably a LOT more to this story then is being let on.
p5701
aVMy guess would be that: \u000a\u000aA) The student may have been a habitual bathroom break abuser and it warranted the teacher to make the human mistake of assuming it was a non-emergency\u000a\u000aB) The child did not make it clear that peeing was an emergency because she wanted popcorn\u000a\u000aand C) The teacher is probably a newbie and made a stupid mistake in assuming that the mind of a 9-10 yr old would correctly make a judicious decision on where to spend the "money"\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, it was most likely a huge accident but one that is something to be learned from....like the time a student (who was a habitual bathroom breaker that actually took off to roam the halls) asked to go to the bathroom and I said, "No, we have to finish this lesson and then we will all go" and she said "But I need to go" and I said, "IS it an emergency?
p5702
aVDo you feel like you need to pee within the next 5 minutes?
p5703
aV" and she shook her head no because I used the wrong verbiage...and then she threw up all over the table because no, she did not have to PEE, she had to vomit.
p5704
aVIn short, I just give my kids 12 bathroom passes a quarter (not to be docked during class visits to the bathroom or during recess, transition, or lunch) and help them learn to budget and I never say no.
p5705
aVI just talk to parents if a kid can't handle it.
p5706
aVI never want soggy, smelly vomit rolling off the table and onto my lap ever ever again.\u000a
p5707
aVI'd charge their little ass 75$... Those little cunts need to pony up that dough if they want to go potty on my time.
p5708
aVI'd charge those ungrateful little shits 100$, they are getting off easy.

aVExcept for fear of punishment if she just got up and went.
p5713
aVSeriously, why do we as a society allow ourselves to consider it rude when someone feels a strong need to do something like this that everyone needs to do?
p5714
aVActually she wanted to save her money for popcorn.\u000a\u000a

aV[deleted]
p5716
aVAre you telling me you have never had to use the restroom at an unexpected time?
p5717
aVYou have a bladder of steel?
p5718
aVMost children do not, it happens, and there's nothing wrong with needing to use the restroom.
p5719
aVShe chose too pee herself for some popcorn, not surprised she is a size 10...
p5720
aVI disagree.
p5721
aVThe time to go to go is when you have to go and the place is the bathroom.
p5722
aVI hope she sues the the school district and everyone involved personally just to make life hard on them.
p5723
aVApparently adults need to be taught a lesson and the only way to teach them a lesson they won't soon forget is to hit them in the wallet. 
p5724
aV[deleted]
p5725
aVYou're making a sweeping generalization and a rather pessimistic assumption that school aged kids are thoughtless monkeys.
p5726
aVA room of kids with no bathroom rules would be kind of like a room full of monkeys...but in all seriousness, at third grade, students need clear expectations of rules.
p5727
aVI have never had to "charge" but I am also mindful of giving bathroom breaks and giving them a limit to how many times they can ask.
p5728
aVEmergencies are always allowed but when it gets fishy it requires a really boring sit-down chat with myself on why this keeps happening. 
p5729
aVNot nearly as disruptive as kids pissing themselves

aVHe doesn't run anything.
p5736
aVHis job is to distract you from the people who do run the country.
p5737
aVThose people are rather clever.
p5738
aVYup, C.C.R.7.1 clearly says, "Compare and contrast literary works of the homosexual agenda and always agree that gay is the way.
p5739
aV" 
p5740
aVThey have a law enforcement entity (as a part of the forest service - very similar to park rangers or game wardens) that does deal with crimes, poaching, wildlife preservation, illegal growth operations, cartels, etc etc.
p5741
aVSo that answers the question, why they need firearms.
p5742
aVTo answer the specific model of firearms they ordered (.40 cal carbines), what would make the most sense is this:\u000a\u000a- their current stock, supply, and duty weapons are chambered in .40, thus making their purchase fit in with their current stock pile and future ordering of ammunition\u000a\u000a- these carbines could theoretically use the same magazines as their duty sidearms, increasing compatibility (such as Hipoint model carbines can use Glock or Sig Sauer magazines)\u000a\u000a- carbines inherently are easier to carry, lighter and more maneuverable in difficult terrain (such as one would fine in a forest)\u000a\u000a- carbines also allow for increased capacity, as well as increased accuracy over pistols, while allowing for all the above mentioned benefits. \u000a\u000a

aVWe have a overstocked DNS doing nothing and an FBI that handles all of those things domestically.
p5744
aVInstead of arming the USPS, SSA, Dept of Education, these people, private banks via FED police force, it would be appropriate to use them (DHS, FBI) for their intended purpose.
p5745
aVWe are at the point where government is creating more government and the left wants more government still to oversee this.
p5746
aVIt is insane.

p5751
aVBefore we make rash assumptions over someone we dont know, lets examine some facts.
p5752
aV&gt;  it would be appropriate to use them (DHS, FBI) for their intended purpose.
p5753
aVBranches of law enforcement that are COMPLETELY necessary (specialized training, terrain management, different fields) need tools to combat a variety of issues.
p5754
aVThese officers in the USDA are working with other LEO branches, as well as by themselves.
p5755
aVYou cannot possibly train one branch to do everything.
p5756
aVIts unreasonable, that actually causes problems, for instance look at the san Diego fires in 2003 and how some of the problems got exacerbated by people thinking Natl Guard can fight forest fires (spoilers, they cant).
p5757
aVSame goes here.
p5758
aV&gt; Go over to /r/bad_cop_no_donut and spend a few minutes.
p5759
aVIf you examine 4 cases from the media and believe that applies to EVERY single officer, youre sadly misinformed.
p5760
aVNo matter the profession, there will always be dicks, assholes, power abusers, and the like.
p5761
aVPolice get a terrible rap for things that happen to a few officers, deserved or otherwise.
p5762
aVIts what sells in the media, just like gun violence, meanwhile cases like the recent [shooting saved by legal citizens carrying was ignored by the media](http://buzzpo.com/mall-shooting-completely-debunks-gun-grabber-myths-lawful-carry/) Because it doesnt sell.
p5763
aVThere are plenty of stories of cops doing good.
p5764
aV&gt; spend a few minutes.
p5765
aVGranted, this is the internet, and this is internet commentary.
p5766
aVHowever, if you really want people to form and opinion, spend more than a few minutes on it.
p5767
aVLook at the story, look at the other side of the story, look at the background, training, policies, politics, who owns the news etc etc.
p5768
aVA few minutes looking at something?
p5769
aVTry a little more next time.
p5770

p5777
aV++++++.\u000a\u000a
p5778
aVMeh, they are just trying to push some visual methods of learning math.
p5779
aVThey typically require visual depictions or physical paper slips,  wheels, or other visual aids.
p5780
aVOf course they sound crazy with no context.
p5781
aVNone of those examples listed are common core standards....those are state based standards from New York.
p5782
aVThe actual standards are vague but New York's standards are more specific based on what they want done.
p5783
aVIn this case, they have curriculum that aligns with using tactile instruments for mathematics learning which is backed up by research to be beneficial, especially for younger children.
p5784
aVJust because a lay person doesn't understand it, doesn't mean it's wrong.
p5785
aVNot much of a surprise as his lawyer never contested his guilt.
p5786
aVThat said, have fun in prison asshole.
p5787
aVit's a formality.
p5788
aVI'm sure the jury will come back with the death sentence as well.
p5789
aVLiberal state.
p5790
aVIn this case the atty general had to actually ok the possibility of the death penalty.
p5791
aVIt's possible, but I'm not sure how likely. 
p5792
aVFederal case...state should have nothing to do with it.
p5793
aVThe jury pool is selected from the state.
p5794
aVRegardless of what kind of trial, you are always pulling from the states demographics. 
p5795
aVshocker. 
p5796
aVSeems like his defense threw the case.
p5797
aVThis whole thing is extremely bizarre. 
p5798
aVThere was literally never a shred of doubt that he was guilty.
p5799
aVThe trial of this case has been a build up to the sentencing phase.
p5800
aVThe real question all along has been Life w/o Parole or Death.
p5801
aVThat's why the prosecution paraded victim after victim in front of the jury to make sure they saw as much of devastation wrought by these two as often as possible and Why the defense has stated all along that he is guilty but it was really his brother calling the shots and Dzhokhar should only be given a life since because "he wasn't really the one responsible".
p5802
aVWell that's neat
p5803
aVGreat.
p5804
aVNow the gay community can go force all Christians to put the gay community's political agenda on cakes  called "wedding.
p5805
aV"\u000a\u000a"They won't do our wedding cake!
p5806
aV"\u000a\u000a"That's terrible, I mean it's just a cake with two names on it right?
p5807
aV"\u000a\u000a"Right.
p5808
aVExcept there was no names and it was just a cake that said 'support gay marriage.
p5809
aV'\u000a\u000a"Well that's not a wedding cake.
p5810
aVThat's a political statement.
p5811
aV"\u000a\u000a"How do they know that?
p5812
aVIt could be my wedding cake.
p5813
aV"\u000a\u000a"Yeah, I don't think your plan was as opaque as you think.
p5814
aVIt seems like you are antagonizing them then crying " I'm the victim.
p5815
aV"\u000a\u000a"Religious people should have to do what I say.
p5816
aV"\u000a\u000a"Why is that?
p5817
aV" \u000a\u000a"Because it's my right to have other people selectively set aside their personal beliefs in their personal business to make me feel better about me.
p5818
aV"\u000a\u000a"You, uh.... you think that the wisest course of action?
p5819
aV"\u000a\u000a"Yes, we will pressure all religious bakeries to cater to our political ideology.
p5820
aV"\u000a\u000a"OK.  Go ask that Muslim bakery over there to make you one.
p5821
aVWell, what are you waiting for?
p5822
aVGo on, slugger.
p5823
aVGo show us how much is about your "rights" and not about specifically harassing Christians.

aV"\u000a\u000a\u000a"....."\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is what I see.
p5825
aVAnd I'm a fucking atheist.
p5826
aVI can only imagine what they see. 
p5827
aVThe law is really more to protect businesses.
p5828
aVSome of these gay couples who are making such large waves are trying to get several differnt bakerys to make this cake and making it as obnoxious as possible so the business refuses.
p5829
aVWhich gives them a lawsuit for discrimination against the business.
p5830
aVPeople like that, fucking over and running small business into the ground, is the reason this law was passed.
p5831
aVSo the business can say, "No, im not going to make a cake that says 'Support gay marraige' or 'Butt budies 4 life' because i dont agree with it.
p5832
aV"\u000a\u000aThis is nothing new, every business has the right to refuse service to anyone without reason.
p5833
aVBut everyone wants that quick dollar from that lawsuit.
p5834
aVPay attention in school, go to college, save money, buy a house.
p5835
aVThe "american dream" doesn't fall out of the sky.
p5836
aVLike most of us, if you weren't lucky enough to have parents/family who already have it taken care of, you have to do things yourself to make it happen. 
p5837
aVYeah, I think this has a lot more to do with residual effects post-slavery than any discrimination against blacks.
p5838
aVSaving, investing, budgeting, and other finance skills are usually family or self taught.

p5936
aVIf it is killing around 28,000 birds as the article indicates, it is a rather insignificant cause of bird deaths.
p5937
aVHowever one should also consider that this power plant is producing about 0.001% of the energy used in the United States.
p5938
aVBased on these comments, it looks like the only way we can NOT kill birds is to move back into caves and kill our cats.
p5939
aVWell that sucks, but you know we could BURN COAL and kill them that way too.
p5940
aVSolar is still the least impactful means of generating energy, which we really have to do.

aVThat's probably only true for some schools.

aVWhy is that "news"?
p5945
aVActually, that's true for the entire population as a whole.
p5946
aVIt's been true for some schools for a very long time.
p5947
aVDid you read the article?
p5948
aVIt's *news* because it shows how American demographics continue to change.
p5949
aVOkay, so maybe it's true for the population as a whole, but it's still not true at all schools.
p5950
aVExample: The schools in most towns in West Virginia.
p5951
aVThe demographics continuing to change is cool and all, but I feel like announcing it in that fashion is meant to stir up trouble.
p5952
aVThat sounds like a headline meant to scare people.
p5953
aVSchools that were almost entirely white last year, will be almost entirely white this year too.
p5954
aVSchools that had shifting demographics, will continue to have shifting demographics with just ever so slightly more non-white students than last year.
p5955
aVThere is no significant change from last year, but the headline seems to treat it like a big event.
p5956
aVLike this year the president has ordered that non-white students be air lifted to your child's school to out number them.
p5957
aVIdk, maybe I'm being overly critical.
p5958
aVIt just seems like the kind of thing that doesn't need to be announced like that.
p5959
aVThe demographics are shifting, like they have been for decades, maybe centuries.
p5960
aVBut nobody said it's true for "all schools", and the only people a headline like that scares are racists.
p5961
aVWho, apparently, don't understand how demographics work.
p5962
aVOr how English works, for that matter.
p5963
aVWell okay, they're probably racist I guess.
p5964
aVA lot of Americans are.
p5965
aVOtherwise they wouldn't care about the demographics changing.

aVI'm just saying it seems like the title is meant to cause trouble.

p5974
aVVery true, but I believe one is a crime and the other isn't.

aVJust because it is possible to fake a DL doesn't mean we should just throw our hands in the air and say, "oh well", right?

aVWe could reasonably ask why Obama thinks it\u2019s cool to negotiate with the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d nation of Iran over the nuclear issue, but not with Russia over Ukraine.
p6045
aVAfter all, Iran doesn\u2019t even have a nuclear weapon, and on the evidence, isn\u2019t trying to build one, so these negotiations aren\u2019t really even preventing a nuclear war; they\u2019re just calming the nerves of some trigger happy paranoids in Israel and Washington.
p6046
aVBut Russia does have nuclear weapons, and has made it clear that if the US pushes too hard at putting NATO weapons and forces near the Russian border, or if it tries to undo the annexation of Crimea, it will use them.
p6047
aVShouldn\u2019t that kind of thing call for cool-headed negotiation, instead of aggressive moves like sending offensive armaments to Kiev?

p6056
aVI don't think felons should have guns, but I also think we make felons of too many people.
p6057
aVThe author is just as guilty of twisting facts and numbers towards his argument as those who argue for more gun control.

p6061
aVAlso according to the stats presented, 2/3rds of suicides are gun related.

aVWhy am I so liberal for thinking that the problem here is that our country doesn't take mental illness or criminal justice seriously enough?
p6081
aVSure you can just deport someone who already came here illegally and already knows exactly how to again, you can just keep doing that over and over until there's no money left.

aVIf he had put 1/2 as much work into growing the economy and making use you had JOBS when you got out of school, you wouldn't even be discussing this now.
p6181
aVI disagree.
p6182
aVThe job market has made a comeback, and people who graduate now are much better off than 2-3 years ago.
p6183
aVHowever, I actually think the root cause of the student loan problems is simply the cost of school.
p6184
aVWe've trapped ourselves in this mentality of "I can't afford to pay out of pocket anyways, so what's another $1000 on my tuition bill?
p6185
aV"  We should be attempting to reign in those costs, but for some reason we aren't.
p6186
aVThe "Job Market" here in Massachusetts isn't making a "Comeback" and we are one of the lowest unemployment states in the nation.
p6187
aVWhat I am finding is that at the 2 multi billion dollar companies I have worked at in the last few years is that people are being vended out.
p6188
aVWe are finding that premiums and deductibles are going thru the roof for health insurance.
p6189
aVSo I am not sure where "Jobs are picking up", but not around here.
p6190
aVWait what?
p6191
aVHow does capping the repayment of loans at 10% of your monthly income make you more dependent on the government???
p6192
aV?
aVDo the math.
p6193
aVYou leave school with $100k in debt.
p6194
aVIf you get out and work making $50k a year, after deductions, your taxable income will be what?
p6195
aV$40k without kids or a house?
p6196
aVWith a house and kids it will drop.
p6197
aVSo you start paying the government back.
p6198
aVWith no interest, that's what?
p6199
aV$4,000 a year?
p6200
aVNow add in 5% compounded interest.
p6201
aVIn short, you will never pay it off.
p6202
aVWhile your math is right, I don't see anything saying that you can't pay more if you want to.
p6203
aVBut you miss the point.
p6204
aVIf we tell people they don't have to pay anything more than 10% of their salary, we the taxpayer are picking up the tab.
p6205
aVSorry, but I've already paid off student loans.
p6206
aVDone my bit.
p6207
aVYou're on your own.
p6208
aVI read that as paying 10% at however long it takes to pay it off.
p6209
aVCrazy interest.
p6210
aVIncluded.
p6211
aVI'm not sure where anyone else is paying for my loan.
p6212
aVBut I'll admit that there's something I don't know here because the system as I understand it is way too simple. 
p6213
aVWhat a shame.
p6214

aVThe Ten Plagues That Are Hitting America Right Now\u000a\u000aMichael Snyder\u000a\u000a#1 The Plague Of Flies In The Upper Mississippi River Valley\u000a\u000aThis is perhaps the least dangerous plague, but it is also one of the most interesting.
p6313
aVJust recently, a plague of flies was so thick in the upper Mississippi River valley that it showed up on radar\u2026\u000a\u000aThe mayflies were detectable on radar around 845 pm and reports in the towns and cities began rolling in of the swarming and piles of mayflies.
p6314
aVNumerous videos and pictures were circulating on social media, some of which are posted below as well.
p6315
aVThe radar detected the flies about 845 pm, emanating from the river (the source) with echo values similar to that of light-moderate rain (35-40 dBZ).
p6316
aVWith a general south-to-north wind flow above the surface, the mayflies quickly moved north once in the air.
p6317
aVAs the flies dispersed moving north-northeast, they also gained altitude with some of the echo being detected as far north as Black River Falls and as high as 2500 feet above ground.
p6318
aVBy late evening, mayflies were swarming in La Crosse, La Crescent, Stoddard and points up and down the river.
p6319
aVWhile the emergence of mayflies from their river bottom mud dwelling can occur at various times through the warm season depending on the species, this particular emergence was that of the larger black/brown Bilineata species.
p6320
aV#2 The Chikungunya Virus\u000a\u000aAs I wrote about the other day, down in Florida health officials have discovered the very first confirmed cases of the chikungunya virus to be transmitted locally.
p6321
aVIn other words, it is now being passed to people that have not even traveled out of the country.
p6322
aVAn epidemic of the virus has already been declared down in Puerto Rico, and authorities are deeply concerned about the possibility of one up here as well.
p6323
aVAlready, cases of the virus have been reported in 30 different states and the total number of cases in the U.S. is more than five times higher than in any other recent year.
p6324
aVIf you live in an area that has a lot of mosquitoes, you might want to be very, very careful right about now because this is a virus that is exceedingly painful\u2026\u000a\u000aWith illness onset, the person develops high fever, chills, and joint pain, followed in some by a rash on the trunk, limbs and face lasting 3-4 days.
p6325
aVMuscle and joint pain last about one week.
p6326
aVJoint pain is often severe and in some people lasts longer, up to several months.
p6327
aV#3 The Wildfires Out West\u000a\u000aThe massive wildfires in Washington, Oregon and western Canada have spread clouds of smoke over vast areas of the northwest United States in recent days.
p6328
aVThe following excerpt comes from a recent CNN report\u2026\u000a\u000aWildfires spanning almost 170,000 acres are driving hundreds of people from their homes in Washington state and across the border in Canada, officials said.
p6329
aVWashington authorities say the fires surged overnight to 168,713 acres in the state.
p6330
aVThe flames have encroached on towns.
p6331
aVJanet Pearce of the Washington state Department of Natural Resources said the four fires had not been contained as of Friday morning.
p6332
aVAn estimated 80 homes were destroyed and cell phone service was knocked out.
p6333
aV#4 The Drought In California\u000a\u000aThe nightmarish multi-year drought in the state of California just continues to get even worse.
p6334
aVThis week it was reported that 81 percent of California is now experiencing \u201cextreme drought\u201d or worse.
p6335
aVThree months ago, that number was just 68 percent.
p6336
aVAnd we are being told that downtown Los Angeles is now the driest that it has been since rain records began in 1877.
p6337
aVFor much, much more on this, please see my recent article entitled "20 Signs The Epic Drought In The Western United States Is Starting To Become Apocalyptic".
p6338
aV#5 The Virus That Has Killed Millions Of Our Pigs\u000a\u000aA horrific pig virus known as porcine epidemic diarrhea came over from China a little over a year ago.
p6339
aVSince then, it has killed about 7 million pigs, and approximately 100,000 more are dying each week.
p6340
aV#6 Citrus Greening\u000a\u000aHave you ever heard of citrus greening disease?
p6341
aVPerhaps not, but it has gotten so bad down in Florida that experts are now saying that the entire citrus industry in the state \u201ccould be destroyed\u201d\u2026\u000a\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s horrible \u2014 it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d says Fred Gmitter, a professor of horticulture science at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center.
p6342
aVIt might be time to kiss your OJ goodbye, unless science steps in to save the day.
p6343
aVAt least 70% of Florida\u2019s citrus trees are already infected by the disease, known as citrus greening, huanglongbing, or occasionally just with an ominous \u201cit,\u201d as in \u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d\u000a\u000aFlorida\u2019s citrus crop this year is the lowest it\u2019s been in 30 years, and agricultural authorities have continued to lower their production estimates.
p6344
aVOrange-juice prices are up nearly 20% this year alone and will continue to rise.
p6345
aVThe disease was a major factor in the lime shortage that made the price of a box of Persian limes jump from $18 to $85 last December.
p6346
aVPrices could jump higher for oranges.
p6347
aVResearchers and growers say that if a cure isn\u2019t found, the entire $9 billion Florida citrus industry could be destroyed.
p6348
aV#7 Bananas Going Extinct?
p6349
aVYour bananas are not safe either.
p6350
aVAccording to CNBC, the TR4 fungus is spreading so rapidly that it could eventually totally wipe out the variety of bananas that we find in our grocery stores today\u2026\u000a\u000aBanana lovers take note: The world\u2019s supply of the fruit is under attack from a fungus strain that could wipe out the popular variety that Americans eat.
p6351
aV\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious situation,\u201d said Randy Ploetz, a professor of plant pathology at the University of Florida who in 1989 originally discovered a strain of Panama disease, called TR4, that may be growing into a serious threat to U.S. supplies of the fruit and Latin American producers.
p6352
aV\u201cThere\u2019s nothing at this point that really keeps the fungus from spreading,\u201d he said in an interview with CNBC.
p6353
aVWhile there are nearly 1,000 varieties of bananas, the most popular is the Cavendish, which accounts for 45 percent of the fruit\u2019s global crop\u2014and the one Americans mostly find in their supermarkets.
p6354
aV#8 The Number Of Earthquakes Is Increasing\u000a\u000aFor a long time, scientists tried to deny that the number of earthquakes is increasing.
p6355
aVBut now, the USGS is finally admitting that the number of big earthquakes has doubled\u2026\u000a\u000aIf you think there have been more earthquakes than usual this year, you\u2019re right.
p6356
aVA new study finds there were more than twice as many big earthquakes in the first quarter of 2014 as compared with the average since 1979.
p6357
aV\u201cWe have recently experienced a period that has had one of the highest rates of great earthquakes ever recorded,\u201d said lead study author Tom Parsons, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, California.
p6358
aVFortunately, most of the earthquakes in the U.S. so far this year have been relatively small or have been in isolated areas.
p6359
aVBut they have been popping up in very unusual areas (such as Oklahoma), and as seismic activity along the Ring of Fire continues to increase, it is probably only a matter of time before one of our major cities gets hit with a major tragedy.
p6360
aV#9 Superbugs\u000a\u000aThanks at least in part to the massive overuse of antibiotics, a new generation of superbugs is arising.
p6361
aVScientists have no way to kill these superbugs, and according to experts they are finding their way \u201cinto healthcare facilities nationwide\u201d\u2026\u000a\u000aDrug-resistant superbug infections have reached near-epidemic levels across U.S. hospitals, with an alarming 500% increase now documented in a study just published in the August issue of Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America).
p6362
aVLead author of the study, Dr. Joshua Thaden, warned \u201cThis dangerous bacteria is finding its way into healthcare facilities nationwide\u2026 A CRE epidemic is fast approaching\u2026 Even this marked increase likely underestimates the true scope of the problem given variations in hospital surveillance practices.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe study also found that an astonishing 94 percent of CRE infections were caused by healthcare activities or hospital procedures.
p6363
aV#10 Fukushima\u000a\u000aThe Fukushima nuclear disaster is the gift that just keeps on giving.
p6364
aVHundreds of tons of radioactive water are being released into the Pacific on a continual basis, and this could potentially affect our oceans and our food chain for generations to come.
p6365
aVBut it is a \u201cslow motion disaster\u201d that is already \u201cold news\u201d, so most Americans don\u2019t think about it anymore.
p6366
aVBut the truth is that there is a lot of evidence that it should be taken very seriously in this country.
p6367
aVIn Japan, of course, things are even worse.
p6368
aVIn fact, one Japanese doctor that was working in Tokyo says that radiation sickness is rampant in that city\u2026\u000a\u000aSince December 2011, I have conducted thyroid ultrasound examinations, thyroid function tests, general blood tests and biochemical tests on about 2000 people, mostly families in the Tokyo metropolitan area expressing concerns on the effects of radiation.
p6369
aVI have observed that white blood cells, especially neutrophils, are decreasing among children under the age of 10.
p6370
aVThere are cases of significant decline in the number of neutrophils in 0-1 year-olds born after the earthquake ( less than 1000)  \u000a\u000aIn both cases, conditions tend to improve by moving to Western Japan (Neutrophils 0\u2013&gt;4500).
p6371
aVPatients report nosebleed, hair loss, lack of energy, subcutaneous bleeding, visible urinary hemorrhage, skin inflammations, coughs and various other non-specific symptoms.
p6372
aVJust like with Chernobyl, this radioactive material is going to silently make people sick and kill people all over globe for years to come, and most of them will never have any idea what is really happening to them.

p6379
aVWhat you're thinking about is the difference between the long and short scale.
p6380
aVIn many parts of Europe, a billion means a million million, rather than a thousand million, as it does in the US.
p6381
aVSo, if it was a French news source reporting that it was 23 billion, there is the possibility (slight) that the award would actually be many time **larger** than a US billion.
p6382
aVAlso, Arabic speaking countries generally use the short scale as well.

p6385
aVThus, *[billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers\u005c)#1012)* means *a millionmillions* (10^12), *[trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers\u005c)#1018)* means *a millionbillions* (10^18), and so on.
p6386
aV&gt;&gt;__Short scale__: Every new term greater than *million* is one thousand times larger than the previous term.
p6387
aVThus, *[billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000)* means *a thousand millions* (10^9), *[trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers\u005c)#1012)* means *a thousandbillions* (10^12), and so on.

p6391
aVIf you've ever smoked you know that on the first puff it feels like it is killing you, then you get used to it, then after a while it feels like it is killing you again.
p6392
aVSmoking is terrible and the cigarette companies are liars and cheats, but nobody should need to tell you that inhaling smoke is not healthy.
p6393
aVit's 23 billion.
p6394
aVHow does a jury get to that number?
p6395
aVSome smokers believe if it's legal and sold everywhere it can't be all that bad.
p6396
aVIf it is poison, why are these companies allowed to sell it. 
p6397
aVWhats up baby?
p6398
aVYou are fine looking woman.
p6399
aVWTF would anyone care what he utters ?
p6400
aV!
aVI mean this is not really US news.
p6401
aVI live near Dartmouth.
p6402
aVIt isn't even really local news; nobody I know has yet mentioned it and I work with people who love to talk local politics.
p6403
aVIn a related story Tumblr has dubbed the EPA *The Eco-Patriarchy*. 
p6404
aVAs a pharmacy tech in Florida: this crackdown is needed.
p6405
aVI am sorry, Ma'am, but I can't fill your prescription for 240 Oxycodone from Dr. Nick's Pain Management Clinic because your leg is bothering you.
p6406
aVFlase Flag much?
p6407
aVSuspensions involving "imaginary" guns? 
p6408
aVIs Boner going to retroactively sue Bush too?
p6409

p6410
aVTabloids such as the Daily Mail aren't sources.
p6411
aVThis just in: Breitbsrt and the Republicans are terrified of small children, who will obviously overwhelm American civilization. 
p6412
aVWas Chairman Mao and his state media honest about the extent of the famine in the Great Leap Forward??
p6413
aVIf Chairman Mao and the Chinese government can hide tens of millions of deaths from famine from the world for decades, the US government can hide 25-50% unemployment for a long while.
p6414
aV"Just as the US government claims, falsely, that Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea..." Um what now?
p6415
aVAs a substitute for Goose Creek CISD, a district very near this one, I find it hard to take these allegations seriously.
p6416
aVI take a majority of my jobs at one of the junior highs here, and I can say from experience that the students these days possess a significant aptitude for fabrication and exaggeration.
p6417
aVThey are very aware of the legal ramifications that teachers face, and they will not hesitate to exploit them for any reason.
p6418
aVThe story doesn't include a statement from Smith herself, and the only time she's even asked about the allegations ([KPRC report](http://www.click2houston.com/news/aldine-isd-teacher-accused-of-improper-relationship-with-student/25655432) @ 0:37) they don't even run the footage of her answer.
p6419
aVI'd be willing to bet the case doesn't even make it to trial.
p6420
aVNice
p6421
aVNot buying it.
p6422

p6424
aV'\u000a\u000a&gt;Police say the boy did not [make it rain](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=make%20it%20rain) during the dance since Mrs. Smith is currently employed by the boy as his [bottom bitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_girl)\u000a\u000a
p6425
aV15yo still in middle school?
p6426
aVSeriously?
p6427
aVBecause nothing screams 'indoctrinated' like a population that has been conditioned to report each other.
p6428
aVParents of teenagers are going to have a field day with this

VDepends how you look at it.
p7257
aVIf the main goal of the attackers was to censor cartoons about Mohammed and Islam then maybe we should say: "fuck you!
p7258
aV" and publish as many as possible.
p7259
aVIf their goal was to increase western hostility towards Muslims and make moderate followers of Islam feel isolated in the west, then maybe we shouldn't.
p7260
aVThere have already been attacks on mosques in France as a response to the recent murders.
p7261
aVMany people would say this is exactly what ISIS wants.
p7262
aVI think it's important to consider whether insulting Islam as much as possible is the best route to peace.
p7263
aVI think you're dead right.
p7264
aVInsulting Islam is definitely not what I was suggesting though.
p7265
aVThere were cartoons from that publication that were insulting to Islam (anything showing their Prophet we know would be) but there were others that wouldn't have been insulting to moderate Muslims.
p7266
aVEven besides that, if the media didn't want to antagonise things so much, they should have not covered the story in the first place.
p7267
aVThat's done as much to raise tensions as included additional images would have. 
p7268
aVOf course there's a lot of supportive talk from the Met and politicians in the aftermath of yesterday's events.
p7269
aVBut the editors must worry on some level that there is legal precedent here for charging and imprisoning over cartoons deemed 'insensitive' or 'potentially offensive' to a religion, not to mention 'offensive' tweets.
p7270
aV[Atheist guilty over cartoons left at Liverpool airport](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8549613.stm)
p7271
aVThat's crazy.
p7272
aVDid they change the laws since do you know? \u000a
p7273
aVI completely agree with you there.
p7274
aVI was honestly quite surprised to not see any of the cartoons at the rallies and marches going on.
p7275
aVMakes me wonder what they really mean by "je suis charlie"? 
p7276
aVThat irony was actually lost on me until you pointed it out, cheers!
p7277
aVI'm not sure there's laws against it.
p7278
aVProbably just don't want to offend religious readers. 
p7279
aVBbc news 24 has a show real of images that they have been showing every few hours.....
p7280
aVThis is a myth right?
p7281
aVI haven't been able to catch the world service today.
p7282
aVWhat is it they are showing?
p7283
aVOK, this is my opinion on the matter.
p7284
aVFirst off, this shouldn't been required to say, but I'm going to anyway, the attacks on CH were terrible, when I heard the story I felt physically sick, so don't think for one second I'm sympathising with the terrorists....
p7285
aVBut why should the CH cartoons be put in newspapers, they *were*/are downright offensive, ok, they picked fun at everyone of all religons, I get that, I'm not saying the attacks were in any way excusable.
p7286
aVBut the attacks don't mean we should respond by covering the pages of our media in images people find offensive just because we can.
p7287
aVCH teased and belittled muslims and people of all religions, I don't agree with doing deliberately provocative things just to make a point about pissing people off, the same way I don't agree with people burning poppies.
p7288
aVI'm not saying burning poppies should be illegal, and I'm not saying cartoons should be censored, but these are things people found offensive, why would you *want* to deliberately offend people, and offend people (normal muslims living happily in the UK) who are already facing enough problems with people associating horrible things like these attacks with their religion.
p7289
aVPutting the cartoons on the covers of newspapers would solve nothing except offend people, people who have done absolutely nothing wrong.
p7290
aVJust because you *can* draw anything you want, it doesn't mean you should.
p7291
aVI think that's a really good argument on the matter W_U.

aVAnd you've definitely influenced by opinion on the matter.
p7293
aVI'm still not entirely convinced whether it would have been right or not to publish all the cartoons.
p7294
aVI think I come from a rather too privileged position to empathise with people when it comes to offence.
p7295
aVI'm a WASP, and tend to find that nothing I find in the media really offends me.
p7296
aVI often find the argument that anyone who is getting offended is taking something altogether too seriously, eg I would say that anyone getting offended by poppy burning should appreciate that the poppy is essentially a trivial symbol, and what it represents is far more important, and so the burning of said poppy is pretty much irrelevant.
p7297
aVI read a really good point made by a staff member at Al Jazeera:\u000a*If a large enough group of someone is willing to kill you for saying something, then it\u2019s something that almost certainly needs to be said, because otherwise the violent have veto power over liberal civilization, and when that scenario obtains it isn\u2019t really a liberal civilization any more\u2026.liberalism doesn\u2019t depend on everyone offending everyone else all the time, and it\u2019s okay to prefer a society where offense for its own sake is limited rather than pervasive.
p7298
aVBut when offenses are policed by murder, that\u2019s when we need more of them, not less, because the murderers cannot be allowed for a single moment to think that their strategy can succeed.

aVThey also have an 18 year old son so I'd hope he'd have spoken up if his father was as innocent as this article makes him out to be.

p7335
aVWhat was reported was exactly (for once) what was in the judgment, which should be taken as the major points of the previous court hearings (as the judge has read all the past transcripts and evidence).

aVMy comment: \u000a\u000a&gt; more women are in prison for less serious offences; \u000a\u000aAt the University of Michigan, Prof. Sonja Starr's found in "Estimating Gender Disparities in Federal Criminal Cases," that after controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, "men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do," and "[w]omen are\u2026twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.
p7433
aV"  I doubt UK is significantly tougher on women offenders than the United States.
p7434
aV&gt; they are more likely to have been victims of abuse; \u000a\u000aDiscrimination against boys and men who are victims of domestic and sexual violence is systematic in the UK.
p7435
aVFor instance, the British Home Secretary recently announced new anti-domestic violence measures that appear to specifically exclude men and boys who are victims, and also appear discriminatory towards LGBT victims "Bullying husbands who shout at their wives could be found guilty of domestic abuse under new crackdown" (daily mail)\u000a\u000a&gt; mental health problems are more prevalent in female than male prisoners; \u000a\u000aThe male suicide rate in the UK is 3 1/2 times higher than the female rate "There were 4,590 male suicides registered in 2012, compared with 1,391 female, equating to 18.2 per 100,000 men and 5.2 per 100,000 women, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

aVIt doesn't seem a long enough sentence to me...
p7568
aVI was mugged at knife-point by a heroin addict who put a blade to my throat, he got roughly the same stretch.
p7569
aVThey should send a louder message out to kiddie fiddlers...
p7570
aVApparently it's something to do with being charged with the sentence at the time of the crime. 
p7571
aVI think they are sending a very strong message to kiddie-fiddlers.
p7572
aVThe chance of getting caught is high and there are no exceptions for well connected people or celebrities.
p7573
aVLet's face it - at 84 and in poor health this is a life sentence so any increase in the term is only academic. 
p7574
aVI thought if they were ever going to get him they'd have got him either before now or on an Al Capone type alternative charge.
p7575
aVStill it's nice to see that she and the other victims during the troubles have not been entirely forgotten about.
p7576
aVI wonder if there will be sufficient evidence after all this time for a proper verdict or if the charges just won't stick.

p7597
aVI see UK inflation slowdown last month!
p7598
aVSeeing as the average age of first-time buyers is currently around 47, this should reduce demand for mortgages quite significantly.
p7599
aVApparently, property ownership is to become an elites-only undertaking, with the majority once again paying rent to support an elite minority.
p7600
aV&gt; the average age of first-time buyers is currently around 47\u000a\u000aMy bollocks-detector is tingling.
p7601
aVAre you sure that isn't average age for people to be completing their mortgages, or of the parents of first-time buyers?
p7602
aVAll the FTB'ers I know, and all the home owners I met when looking to buy my own property bought in their 20s or early 30s.
p7603
aVThe buyers in their 40s I know are all onto their second or third homes, several with a BTL or two to their names.
p7604
aV47 is the UK figure for the past 3 years.
p7605
aVI have no idea what it is anywhere else.
p7606
aVSource?
p7607
aVIt sounds absolutely unbelievable, especially considering the number of people *over* 47 buying for the first time that that figure would need to work out.
p7608
aVSo in other words, things are reverberating to the olden days where the well-to-do owned nice houses out in the burbs and the majority rented?
p7609
aVIf so, I'm guessing that, historically, mass mortgages will be a relatively short term blip on the historical radar? 
p7610
aVWell that's me completely fucked then.
p7611
aVDoesn't this constitute age discrimination?
p7612
aVGood point.
p7613
aVYou could probably make a case.
p7614
aVIt could also be a load of old scare mongering.
p7615
aVWhy is it always the ugly chavs that do these sorts of things?

aVSince when giving food lands you in jail?

aVWe definitely need something to break the UK news channels to get the conversation and debate open about marijuana in the UK.

aVBut I think this will ultimately be detrimental to what they're trying to achieve.
p7621
aVYeah, dumb fuck, it's not slander when you actually said those things...
p7622
aVThe thing with bigots is they CANNOT lie.
p7623
aVThey'll deny something that's plain in the face.
p7624
aVNo mention in the article of her Facebook posts regarding cannabis.
p7625
aVIs it just seen as a non issue?
p7626
aVThat's a good point!
p7627
aVWhat is it about Northern Ireland and bat shit crazy people?
p7628
aVIs it something in the water?
p7629
aVThis is somewhat puzzling.
p7630
aVI believe [this is the backstory](https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/articles/class/).
p7631
aVApparently, BBC Lab UK tests are [now closed](https://ssl.bbc.co.uk/labuk/experiments/class/).

p7633
aV??
p7634
aV?
aVWhy are you posting daily mail articles?
p7635
aVIs that a serious question?
p7636
aVIt's good to hear what people are writing/reading.
p7637
aVEven (especially) the confused masses!
p7638
aV:-P
p7639
aVWhy not? 
p7640
aVI honestly don't know when I last wrote a cheque and I'm not even sure where my cheque book is.
p7641
aVI was speaking to my dad yesterday, and he said he's had to write one for the first time in years a few days back.
p7642
aVNice though this is, I feel it's a little late! 
p7643
aVI have literally never written a cheque in my life.
p7644
aVI quite like the idea as a way of matching up old and new tech - e.g.
p7645
aVI know one person who is very much a cheque person, and this would let the rest of us interact in a way that suits our more modern preferences :)
p7646
aVThat seems a rather inconsistent verdict.
p7647
aVI guess it is true what they say about gender coming into play in criminal cases.
p7648
aVYes.
p7649
aVI wonder how a close, personal friend of the country's current prime minister, and a trusted member of the murdoch group get found not guilty.
p7650
aV?
aVOr a jury full of redheads. 
p7651
aVI can see his point about the timing being suspicious (if there is currently a  local election campaign going on in NI, as someone who lives in England their politics are even more weird and distant than those of Wales and Scotland, yet still their politicians get to mess around with my life), however as a representative of a political party that has generally accepted links with a terrorist group he has to accept that he will be formally questioned whenever relevant.
p7652
aVHm, the only thing is that he is a suspect in a murder case and he walked into a police station voluntarily to talk to them about that murder.
p7653
aVIf he hadn't of done that, the police probably would have waited, but he sort of forced their hand.
p7654
aVTo put it into context, if somebody was suspected of murdering somebody yesterday, and they presented themselves to police today but had a holiday planned tomorrow, would the police hold off until after their holiday to arrest them?
p7655
aVSpeaking as a person who actually has met women in my lifetime, and spoken with them about gender roles and the way colours are chosen for gender stereotypes, a better way to gather the attention of female voters would be to make it jetblack with flame decals and awesome spikes.
p7656
aVFemale=/= girly.
p7657
aVMost women appreciate awesomeness, just as much as most men do.
p7658
aVMake it (effing) metal, make it rad, make it an artifice of sheer win, and the people will support your cause.
p7659
aVI think the main issue she has here is that you don't see a story like this on the front page of a Sunday paper every time a popular clothing company utilises sweatshop labour.
p7660
aVYou can be critical of it, but I personally can't escape the feeling, that the company is getting a disproportionate amount of criticism for aligning itself as feminist.
p7661
aVI do believe it is fair for Mauritians to enjoy proper compensation for their efforts, certainly when compared to the plight of 1st world females.
p7662
aVHowever if you enforce a (western) living wage/standard of living where these sweatshops are, the factories disappear, and unfortunately they aren't replaced with universities, equality and other options for economic growth and mobility.
p7663
aVAlso bearing in mind that, for the most part, people work in these factories and live in these conditions, because it is the best option they have.
p7664
aVIndeed.
p7665
aVThe typical Daily Mail, very directed to suite their agenda.
p7666
aVThey don't really discuss the issue at all, they just use it to defame.. in fact I think you've covered the issue much more comprehensively than they have.
p7667
aVPapers, especially tabloids, give me nightmares...
p7668
aVThe sexually repressed culture has a secret porn habit?
p7669
aVno..
p7670
aVNot sure I've done this post right.
p7671
aVI wanted to make the point that the title is misleading, and my discontentment with the BBC for letting their standards get so low.
p7672
aVAnyone reading this title would assume that it referred to the general Saudi population.
p7673
aVGiven the first paragraph:\u000a\u000a&gt; Up to 70% of files exchanged between Saudi teenagers' mobile phones contain pornography, according to a study in the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom.
p7674
aVis also so misleading I think that a reader would be forgiven missing the crucial element that:\u000a\u000a&gt; The study quoted in Arab News focussed on the phones of teenagers detained by religious police for harassing girls.
p7675
aVI mean seriously?!
p7676
aVHow can you possibly extrapolate such a small and specific study group to "Saudi" or, only slightly less misleading "Saudi Teenagers".
p7677
aVI would expect better from the UK's publicly funded broadcaster.
p7678
aVThey should be setting the standard for journalism, not resorting to cheap and misleading titles to increase hits.
p7679
aVNB This article was on the top 10 trending articles they have on the side of their front page (why they don't highlight when the article isn't *new* is another question I'd like to ask them).  \u000a\u000a
p7680
aVYou definitely have a point, I'm not sure this is a trend among a large number of BBC articles though.
p7681
aVIt was also 7 1/2 years ago, I would think things had changed amongst bbc news web editors since.
p7682
aVSo although this is bad and perhaps should be removed/edited more recent examples would be good if there's an issue that needs addressing.
p7683
aVI've spotted it here and there.
p7684
aVThis was the most blatant.
p7685
aVYeah, apologies for the lack of relevance.
p7686
aVI only picked up on it because it was trending on the BBC front page, for some reason?
p7687
aVReally misleading headline, as you'd expect from a biased organisation, the MP in question was not involved but was simply a witness, she could have been walking by for christs sake.
p7688
aVAnd F4J have called for her to be investigated, what a load of bull
p7689
aVoh fuck off david.
p7690
aVyou've cried wolf and lied so much that now you've something important to say we can't believe you.
p7691
aVI like how were spinning a foreign policy problem to merit getting involved again in the region or militarisation of domestic law enforcement.
p7692
aVNot to say this isn't a problem though, I just feel that with the state of the UK's press its seems to be snowballing towards racist victimisation of immigrants and more stringent anti-terrorism measures. 
p7693
aVThe actual link http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31721334

aVPlain packaging isn't to stop young people being taken in with glitzy packaging, it's designed to avoid brand recognition and negate marketing.
p7695
aVIf a tobacco company can't show its brand on cigarettes then marketing them is a whole load harder.
p7696
aVIf plain packaging really made no difference, then the tobacco companies wouldn't care.
p7697
aVHowever, they have launched legal bids to get Australia to change the law and organised campaign groups to be vocal about it.
p7698
aVLastly, banning tobacco would be dumb because banning substances is dumb - prohibition and the war on drugs demonstrates that quite well.
p7699
aVThis really feels like a sponsored post to me...
p7700
aV"Since the ban on smoking in pubs 6000 have closed down" yup, it's all about not being able to smoke in them and totally nothing to do with the massive global downturn...
p7701
aVI'd rarely, if ever go to a pub if smoking were allowed in it as, I think would many people...
p7702
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lep6XIVPevk
p7703
aVFirstly,  I don't have a clue how the "Englishman"  making the post could dare to call himself English while making a bunch of frankly confusing messages that seem to revolve almost exclusively selfish arguments about the benefits he'd receive from being English are made from an office chair in Poland!
p7704
aVOp is Polish,  and frankly he's welcome to stay there for as long as humanly possible.
p7705
aVIt was a mistake letting the eastern bloc in the EU, and the UK have done nothing but suffer because of it. 
p7706
aVI think you've missed the point.
p7707
aVFirstly, he's not in Poland - he's in Germany.
p7708
aVSecondly, he was born in Britain and raised there but qualifies for Polish citizenship through heritage on one side of his family.
p7709
aVMaybe it is a personal reflection on the consequences of the current policy of the government, but it these affect millions of citizens of the UK.
p7710
aVMaybe you fancy answering some of the questions posed?
p7711
aVWhat is Britishness?
p7712
aVHow do English people with no contact with Scotland conceive of their Englishness?
p7713
aVThis.
p7714
aVThis truly hurts me.
p7715
aVWhat the fuck has happened to the world we live in?
