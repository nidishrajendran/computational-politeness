p54
aS"I can take that as an argument, as long as we're admitting that government and politics are inherently inseparable."
p55
aS'And politics is inherently evil.'

aS'It is a political issue, in every sense of the word.'
p57
aS'In fact, the whole point of freedom of speech being a right is to prevent politicians from becoming too powerful.'
p58
aS'It is criticizing the US government and media.'

p88
aS'Er, no.'
p89
aS'The whole point of freedom of speech being a right from the very day that it was conceived was entirely to prevent politicians from stopping people speaking out against them.'
p90
aS'It is a political issue in every sense of the word.'
p91
aS'Everything is political unless it is something everyone agrees with.'

aS"[Feel bad stuff about it's enemies](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ryd6l/russia_summarized_in_one_sentence/) isn't political humor either. "
p101
aS"Both of those examples don't talk about politics, they only vaguely include people from those countries."
p102
aS"The second example isn't even vaguely political, it's about Russians and alcohol."
p103
aS"Maybe you can argue they're racist and offensive, but that has nothing to with the Russian government."
p104
aS'Uncle Sam or America and Patriotism/Moralism versus two dollar money presidents or Russia and Alcoholism is not that much of a difference.'
p105
aS'Patriotism is distinctly different from politics.'
p106
aS"For example, I can be a proud New Yorker but that doesn't mean I necessarily support the state or city government of NY or NYC\n\nHow is George Washington and Kim Jong Un playing basketball political?"
p107
aS'What does Russian drinking alcohol have to do with the Russian Federation?'
p108
aS'I can literally say "there\'s nothing to do here except drink" about any country and no one would construe that as even remotely related to the government of said country (unless you very narrowly interpret the statement to mean that the government abolished/banned all recreational activity in a country except drinking alcohol, but that is obviously not the intention).'

p116
aS'&gt;How is uncle sam wrapping a present political?'
p117
aS"It's about the government overreach in the internet by manipulating public opinion during cherry-picked current events that the corporate media fixates on for implicit, and many times for overt, political purposes."
p118
aS'Compare that to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln playing basketball with Stalin and Kim Jong Un.'
p119
aS'The most you can say is the picture is saying "Murica is better than communism".'
p120
aS"That is blatant patriotism, it doesn't inform us if the basketball is a symbol for freedom or economic prosperity or military conquest, it's too vague for it to be political."
p121
aS"It's similar to when different countries mocks each other or satirizes winning a sports games, World Cup or Olympics with comics of world leaders facing each other."

p338
aS"Explain how multiple competitors would start providing service tomorrow morning if the government weren't around."
p339
aS'Even in the current system, pretty much anyone can start an ISP overnight, but the difficulty is getting a fiber connection (which takes a couple months in many cases) and deploying to customers (which is time consuming as fuck).'

aS"Building the infrastructure is expensive and requires permits, but ultimately isn't that time consuming."
p341
aS"I'm sympathetic to the notion that government should get out of everything because it doesn't handle a lot of things well, but at the same time I don't trust many internet providers at all to do the right thing by their customers."

p422
aS'Honest question.'
p423
aS'As it would seem that it inherently is the opposite. '
p424
aS'"Net neutrality" and "net neutrality *regulation*" are two entirely different things.'
p425
aS'Almost no one opposes net neutrality itself.'
p426
aS'Lots of people oppose net neutrality *regulation* not because of its *ostensible* purpose, but because of the likely *actual* consequences of enabling centralized bureaucratic power to control the internet -- regulatory power can almost always be co-opted by factional interests, and can be used as a lever to exercise much more de facto power then the formal authority given to the regulator would superficially suggest.'
p427
aS'"regulatory power can almost always be co-opted by factional interests"\n\nUpvoted, and I\'d go further saying that regulatory power is always co-opted by factional interests...\nBanks and financial institutions are probably the most regulated businesses in any country, and the people heading those regulatory agencies are almost exclusively either coming or going to work for those institutions, and their world views are normally the only ones taken into consideration.'
p428
aS'Same for the EPA...'
p429
aS'Almost exclusively populated by the environmental wackos.'
p430
aS"The only thing regulatory agencies accomplish is to make sure the big players in the field remain the big players field, by increasing costs of doing business, and going after those who don't conform to the way the game is being played :)\n "
p431
aS'Then what is the solution?'
p432
aS"Net neutrality is technically dead right now as there is zero over site on this issue currently and we know for a fact that isps don't want net neutrality "
p433
aS'I believe the point is there should be no "solution".'
p434
aS'If the government gets out of the way and let everyone play the game, the customers will decide who to make business with, the same way we all decide what clothes to buy.'

aS'I personally think that going south western bell on them is what is needed, I have a strong feeling this sub would hate that but I see little option.'
p443
aS'The other option I see is regulation.'
p444
aS'Not with an fcc type over sight just a law that states net neutrality is law and the fcc has to monitor isps for net neutrality instead of allowing the fcc to dictate anything.'

aS'Because of Tom Wheeler you can never trust the fcc to protect the Internet.'

p449
aS'My question is between the two what does this sub like.'
p450
aS"I feel that this sub would prefer to ignore the existence of power of the monopoly, which is fair to a degree because we are having this conversation and our fate hasn't been sealed behind closed doors yet."
p451
aS'At the same time though putting so much faith into capitalism to work in the favor of free speech and the flow of information is a problem.'
p452
aS"Capitalism isn't much of a fan of free speech at the level of hyper rich isps."
p453
aS'They have more invested in keeping the public down and information low.'
p454
aS'They have sealed the ability to keep us from breaking it with our wallet vote to.'
p455
aS'It is a nuanced problem.'
p456
aS"I don't identify as libertarian but I see libertarianism as a potential ally to a majority of my political beliefs."

aS"I don't mean anything inflammatory as it is more important to collaborate against the powers that be for the sake of the country."
p459
aS"Everytime there is something I view as nuanced I have to test the waters of libertarianism to see if it can over come it's core tenants."
p460
aS'My basic idea here is that there is great potential in libertarian ideology but that the ideology itself has the great potential to work against it self from a place of fear, if that makes since.'
p461
aS'Non the less I always welcome input from this sub. '
p462
aS'&gt;The same way we pick who to do isp business with now?'
p463
aS"Monopolies don't play that game."

p475
aS"The question now becomes what is the proper solution to limit the corruption of business on the market and it's corruption on the government."
p476
aS'When we try to limit the actions of business, or any entity with power, directly through state, local, or federal intervention the entity as a whole eventually over comes the regulatory body with enough time.'
p477
aS'That or the laws and regulatory body is self sustaining enough to not fall prey, an example would be the irs.'
p478
aS"It would appear that bureaucracy prevents internal corruption, bureaucracies create pseudo intelligent entities that aren't corruptible like people."
p479

p556
aS"There hasn't been a single instance, as far as I'm aware, of any ISP attempting to create a tiered-service arrangement which creates price gates on the basis of content."
p557
aS"Some ISPs have attempted to shake down internet content providers, and coerce them into subsidizing both ends of the network connection, but they've mostly failed at doing so."
p558
aS"There remains a vast coalition of parties with very deep pockets who would be just as threatened as anyone else by ISPs breaching net neutrality, and it's not clear that Comcast and Verizon are more likely to maneuver their way into coercive control of the internet than Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Microsoft, and the wider internet community are likely to foil their attempts."
p559
aS"In this instance, there seems to be a lot more creativity and resources on the pro-net-neutrality side than on the ostensibly anti-net-neutrality side of the issue; it's likely that *without* a regulatory regime, any attempt by the incumbent ISPs to damage the internet would result in an influx of competition from the very firms the ISPs are trying to shake down -- if the incumbent ISPs are going to strongarm Google into subsidizing their network infrastructure, why wouldn't Google just build out its own infrastructure with those resources instead?"

aS"They're less likely to go after women without cooperation than they would men."
p937
aS"That I would agree with....I think it may be that they think they have a smaller chance against a women without the man's cooperation and/or they (subconsciously or consciously) think it's not as big of a deal when a woman/girl does it. "

aS'Not in this case.'

aS"I don't know if that's necessarily true but I don't do criminal law, but if it is that is why this is ridiculous if both people broke the law and both people are victims of the same act how could you prosecute either, its like arresting a 16 year old for child pornography when they had pictures of themselves nude, you can't be the perpetrator and the victim of the same crime."

aS'Patriarchy implies a lot of fucked up things.'

p1871
aS'I think the customary tendency, for example, when it comes to the anti-pornography sentiments of many feminists (certainly not all), is to focus on the First Amendment-shredding implications first, and then leap straight to the conclusion that the point is to stomp a boot on male sexuality.'
p1872
aS'But honestly in defense of the opposition (and they are, especially when it comes to the state, the opposition), they have written plenty about the damage they insist pornography does to men, especially young ones who develop sexual attitudes (and even, disturbingly, vocabulary) based now on what they watch online.'

aS'I agree with some of it, disagree with some of it, but try to keep in mind, from moment-to-moment, what concept the word denotes.'
p1906
aS'Those who want to fight the definition because they find it anti-man are choosing an endless (it will be endless and unwinnable) semantic battle rather than a battle over actual philosophical and political concepts.'

aS"It's their choice, but it's a fool's errand."
p1908
aS"It's sort of like when anarchists (the left variety) want to make the point that there's nothing anarchist about stateless libertarianism -- I can fight the semantic battle, which is tedious, or get down to brass tacks and talk about property itself, and whether or not abolishing all manner of hierarchy in a society (that is, non-state varieties) makes any kind of sense."

p1913
aS'It is through classification and categorization that the human mind works.'
p1914
aS"Hell, that's why so many people who believe in the things Feminism claims to believe in refuse to call themselves Feminists."
p1915
aS'You\'ll find people saying "I support women\'s rights, but I\'m not a Feminist.'
p1916
aS'"   It\'s because of the words, the word choice...'
p1917
aS'The trouble with the word Patriarchy is that it attacks not only the belief system of far too many people, it attacks *them.'
p1918
aS'*  It says to them "*you, sir,* are the problem.'
p1919
aS'"  Certainly you can understand the importance of the distinction, yes?'
p1920

aS'If you condemn their *actions* that is something they see as changeable.'
p1922
aS'If you condemn *them* they resent you, because the self appears to be immutable, and the Target of Hate naturally tends to reciprocate with Hate.'

aS'Even Pope Franky acknowledged that.'
p1924
aS'It\'s like [Jay Smooth observed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0Ti-gkJiXc) there is a huge difference between a "What you did" conversation and a "Who you are" conversation.'
p1925
aS'"Patriarchy" and "Kyriarchy" may functionally refer to the same thing, but the former is a "who you are" conversation, and (again, quoting Jay) "that\'s not a bad idea because you may be wrong, it\'s a bad idea because you may be *right,*" because it lets people dismiss the entire concept because they believe themselves not part of any systematic *anything.'
p1926
aS"* \n\nKyriarchy, on the other hand, tells them that they've been manipulated into thinking, believing things that were not of their own ideation."
p1927
aS'Just like the difficulty in the movie Inception, an idea that is perceptibly external in origin is much easier to reject.'
p1928
aS'By giving them an out, by *pointing out* that their mind has been invaded by some nameless, faceless system *that they can blame some of their own problems on,* you induce a rejection of the idea.'

aS'*\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Patriarchy intimately links the idea to the person.'

aS"You make the problem a cancer, and wonder why the disease *you* told them was part of their own body isn't being rejected by their immune system?"
p1934

p1935
aS'"  \n\n*Everyone* is their own baseline.'
p1936
aS'Sure, people of minority classes attribute some of their experiences to race, but unless they consciously do that, everything is baseline, regardless of whether or not it actually *is* a "Baseline" experience or not.'
p1937
aS"That's why the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is a thing: unless acted upon by some other evidence, in one's own mind, *everyone* is (their perception of) the norm.\n"

p1963
aS"Just as white people don't generally consciously recognize that they're white and that has an impact on their lives, most minorities don't *fail* to consciously recognize that about their own ethnicity."
p1964
aS"What's more, the fact that so many minorities tend to be stuckin (forgive me for saying so) shitty situations, while white people tend to run the entire gamut from the Uber-Rich Bill Gates to the poor guy starving on the street means that white experience *is* more varied."
p1965
aS'White experience is demonstrably more varied than that of minorities in the US if only because we cover a wider range of social and economic classes.'

aS'So yes, this is how it works.'
p1985
aS'You have to prove your assertion.'
p1986

p2007
aS'Hahaha, you think anyone in this anti-intellectual circlejerk is interested in learning anything?'
p2008
aS'Probably not, but it is increasingly embarrassing to identify as a libertarian, which to me means "keep the fucking state out of my life and personal decisions" and increasingly, by association of its constituents, has something to do with conspiracies, "race realism," and gender politics.'
p2009
aS"There is something to be said for advocates of any idea passing, convincingly, an Ideological Turing Test, because what should be clear especially from listening to libertarianism's loudest critics, is just how little effort people make to truly understand opposing viewpoints."

aS"I just wish that the caricature of libertarians being straight white upper-middle class guys that are completely tone-deaf to social issues wasn't so depressingly often illustrated on this subreddit."
p2308
aS"Your comment does make sense, but to be fair, it's tricky logic."
p2309
aS'What confuses people is that feminists are typically the first people to support a woman in a rape/ violence case - so much so that men are almost guilty until proven innocent in these scenarios.'
p2310
aS'Feminists are also the ones who are supposed to bemoan the patriarchy and want equal rights for everyone.'
p2311
aS"It's a hypocritical stance to say that all should be equal under the law - while also supporting laws that favor one group over the other. "
p2312
aS'Unfortunately, some people who call themselves feminists take hypocritical stances, much like some nutjobs who call themselves libertarians take hypocritical stances.'
p2313
aS'Hardly all feminists use this logic and using the term to pigeon hole the entire group is no different than the bullshit "all men" line that radfems use.'
p2314
aS'Contextually it is pretty clear that you mean radical feminists when you say feminist but there is no harm in saying what you mean.'
p2315
aS"I get what you're saying, and obviously generalities don't apply to every member of the group, but I think the mindset is a little more pervasive than you think."
p2316
aS"I don't know.. for me this kinda manifested itself in the Ray Rice scenario."
p2317
aS'Most of the feminist-leaning crowd acted like it was a huge moral outrage that Goodell only suspended him two games after seeing the video and made it a big "domestic violence/violence against women" issue.'
p2318
aS'However, when you watch the video, she hits him twice before he makes physical contact.'
p2319
aS'Under the law, is a person not allowed to hit another person who initiates physical contact?'

p2324
aS"And I don't want to discount the role that domestic violence plays in society."
p2325
aS'But I do believe that everyone should be treated equally under the law (which SHOULD make me a feminist).. but I found myself on the opposite end of the spectrum. '
p2326
aS'It is myopic to suggest even for a moment that women are not disadvantaged and to equate advocates for equal treatment with rabid idiots calling for death to all men is equally idiotic.'
p2327
aS'Beyond that, using the same tactics (generalizing populations) as the groups you are criticizing only weakens your argument while contributing to the rhetoric.'
p2328
aS'It also brings me back to my original point of say what you mean.'
p2329
aS'Also, saying things such as\n&gt;I would never hit a woman because it goes against my personal beliefs\n\ndemonstrates that you are subject to the same beneficial sexism that you are condemning.'
p2330
aS'The rest of your points are valid but I would suggest that hitting someone who was hitting you is not appropriate, two rights not making a wrong or something like that.'
p2331
aS"I couldn't speak for Goodell or the league but I assume Ray Rice was punished according to the rules of the league."
p2332
aS'I think the problem is that most people are "libertarians" in name only, having read a blurb about what the ideology means and saying "that seems the most fair!'

aS"It'll be interesting to see how we can address this issue, or whether it's something that needs to be addressed at all."
p2337
aS"Anecdote here: all the libertarians I've met had a hard time understanding the patriarchy, sex and gender concepts, and how racism, sexism, and other discriminatory social happenings affect everyone."

aS'Whatever argument tactic you tried, failed. '
p2349
aS'You said "all the libertarians I\'ve met had a hard time understanding.'

aS"Well, it's his anecdotal experience - it could well be the case that the group of Libertarians he's met are not representative - perhaps he lives on a college campus in proximity to a frat house such that pretty much every Libertarian he's met is a Freshman Business major frat pledge."
p2356
aS"That particular situation obviously isn't *too* likely, but you get the point."

p2359
aS'In my experience, this is not true.'
p2360
aS'In my experience, people understand feminist concepts "perfectly well" in the same sense that you understand perfectly what I *mean* when I say that a hammer and a feather will fall at the same rate in a vacuum.'
p2361
aS"Just like someone who'd never seen it demonstrated would understand the *concept* perfectly well, but would likely disagree with it if they didn't understand the explanation of the underlying mechanics, people often understand what is meant by the the concept of the patriarchy when it's explained, but don't understand the explanation of systemic power structures that underlies the concept of patriarchy."
p2362
aS"&gt;Under the assumption that most people do in fact understand feminist ideas the assertion that your critics don't understand them is probably an unwarranted dismissal of valid criticism."
p2363
aS"This is a bit like saying that, since most proponents of intelligent design do in fact understand what is meant by evolution in the most general sense, the assertion by scientists that proponents of intelligent design don't *actually* understand evolution is probably an unwarranted dismissal of valid criticism."
p2364
aS'Simply understanding what a concept means in a general sense is not a strong enough understanding to be above dismissal for a lack of understanding.'
p2365
aS"So instead of actually arguing the merits of patriarchy theory you're going to compare its critics to creationists and people who don't understand gravity?"
p2366
aS"That's just another deflection. \n\n"
p2367
aS"Wanted to start by pointing out I'm not the same person you were initially replying to - not sure if you had already caught that, but it seemed possible that you hadn't."
p2368
aS"&gt;So instead of actually arguing the merits of patriarchy theory you're going to compare its critics to creationists and people who don't understand gravity?"
p2369
aS'You are being awfully defensive - I\'m not *equating* the two, I\'m simply providing an illustration of how a concept may be understood "perfectly well" at a linguistic level without understanding it at a deeper, mechanical level - an understanding of the "what?'

aS'" but not the "how?'
p2371
aS'" or the "why?".'
p2372
aS"I merely chose the hammer/feather experiment because it's well-known and because it's ideal for illustrating the difference, not to paint Libertarians as ignorant."

p2376
aS"You presented your anecdotal experience, which conflicted with /u/marymurrah's, as well as my own, and I presented my own anecdotal experience, along with some conjecture illustrating why there might be such a wide gulf between our respective experiences."
p2377
aS"I think it's easy to say that your point is very well constructed and sound."
p2378
aS"However strong your presentation and ideas are won't matter because it'll just fly right over their heads. "
p2379
aS"Meh, I can empathize with that position, but I also think it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy and therefore a potentially counterproductive position to occupy."
p2380
aS"Though I'll take a side in an argument, I try not to aim for convincing anyone of my own side - if I can help people understand what I'm saying well enough, hopefully it will give them a new perspective through which they can examine their own beliefs, and that's all I really hope to accomplish, even if that new perspective ultimately reinforces their own beliefs."

p2453
aS"There's correlation, certainly, but I reject the presupposition that men are seen as more valuable, because if that were the case, why is it that nobody's done a damn thing about the fact that there have been more women than men graduating university for over 30 years now?"

aS'When someone comes forth asserting they are the victim of a crime, they should be considered and treated as such until an investigation is completed.'
p3157
aS'The article is not interested in addressing any evidence (or lack thereof) of this claim, as the purpose is to make a point so those details are irrelevant.'
p3158
aS'I agree with the general point that underage consensual sex is a victimless "crime" in and of itself (edit: within certain context), and that neither child should be prosecuted if that\'s all it is.'

p3161
aS"I'm not going to presume to know what kind of evidence exists (again, not explored in the article), but we simply don't know the texts/calls/conversations that went on without having the details of the investigation. "
p3162
aS'OK true.'
p3163
aS'I guess I just take issue with labeling her as victim so quickly without any evidence to support, sometimes the word victim is immediate guilt for the then attacker.'
p3164
aS'Because of the nature of the case and their ages I would wait until I had more facts to really make any sort of judgement(deciding who is at fault, or preyed on who if any at all, who is the victim) etc.'
p3165
aS'I am not disregarding her claim altogether, but I am waiting to label her a victim of a crime until that crime is proven.'

p4050
aS"Brave New World was alright; I'm partial to Orwell for dystopian matters.  "
p4051
aS'Right, I agree with you in a philosophical sense of deserving rights essentially for being human, my point was only in the practical case where as nice as the philosophical case sounds it is little comfort to those whose governments deny them rights; I thus argue that practically speaking rights are granted by government, even if they should be inherent.'

aS'ControlThem was speaking in terms of absolutes.'
p4116
aS'I disagreed and said that all rights are not absolute, and thus wrongly called "rights" in the true sense.'
p4117
aS"On to your question:\n\nIt appears you want specifics, but I can't answer that."
p4118
aS'You can\'t say "what rights would you give up" without describing the environment in which we left the state of nature.'
p4119
aS"Forgive me if you're aware of this point, but so we're all on the same page, the state of nature is the point where humans transcended from individuals seeking to survive to a cruel, bitter world to a life where a government of different shape and sizes can exist."
p4120
aS'\\\n\nAnd to determine what rights we can give up in these situations we must determine what rights we have.'
p4121
aS"I'd argue with Locke in that we have the right to an existance, own things, and freedom."
p4122
aS'Unfortunately, I find freedom too broad a term for meaningful discourse.'
p4123
aS'So what is freedom, or rather, what amount of freedom can we assume is a basic right associated with human life?'
p4124
aS"Well JS Mills argues that as long as what you're doing doesn't harm others, you should be allowed to do it."
p4125
aS"I'd say that's a great point."
p4126
aS"You don't have right to go around hitting people in the face."
p4127
aS"So if we go on that idea, we'll both agree that total freedom without recourse is never really an option outside of total anarchy."
p4128
aS'But we can disregard the idea of anarchy because our conversation concerns living in a world with government.'
p4129
aS'And further how much of our life, property, and no-harm freedoms we have to yeild to that government.'
p4130
aS'Ok, back to the state of nature.'
p4131
aS"If you left the state of nature because you were being robbed, raided, and raped you certainly wouldn't agree to give up weapons for protection."
p4132
aS'But you might agree to being taxed for form a formal regulated army for defense.'
p4133
aS'Maybe everyone pays up their share, "taxes",  to build a wall for protection.'
p4134
aS'In this instance you have yielded some of your property for some protection afforded by the government.'
p4135
aS'However, what if in your state of nature you live in a utopian environment where the largest problem is your neighbors are farming too large an area and you feel he is encroaching on your property which is again, one of basic rights.'
p4136
aS"So now you and your neighboring people living in freedom want a government/committee/ruling body to determine where the lines are you wouldn't agree to yield much of your Life/Liberty/Property rights."
p4137
aS"You don't need much of a strong government to solve that problem so you certainly wouldn't agree to taxation."
p4138
aS'They just need to have a meeting and say, "Hey here are the property lines".'
p4139
aS'So, again, how many rights you want to sacrifice to the government is determined by how you entered in to the social contract with the government.'
p4140
aS'And continuing to allow yourself to be ruled by the government is tacit consent.'
p4141
aS'If you are not actively working on ending the government, or moving to a place where the government is more agreeable to you, you are agreeing to the rules set forth by that government.'
p4142
aS'So to recap, as far as our discussion is concerned I cannot answer what specific rights are agreeable to give up without you giving me a specific instance.'
p4143
aS'I feel like you\'re asking me, "is this shirt too blue for my new suit," but not showing me what suit.'

p4192
aS"The anti-Federalists thought a government that had sole control over the nation's defenses was too dangerous if it became tyrannical, they wanted the militia to be State controlled."

aS"Full disclosure: I'm one of the types that things modern weaponry was *completely* beyond the minds of the founding fathers and they did not anticipate them so A2 doesn't apply to current 'arms' (arms that make the 'arms' of yestercentury look like pea-shooters and are disruptive enough technologies to force us to reconsider the second *amendment*)."
p4499
aS"To be *extra clear*, I'm saying that the explicit protection of modern weapons is not through A2; the opposite of explicit protection is not banning."
p4500
aS"It's a reasonable discourse of making new laws/amendments to cover."
p4501
aS'I just hate the holier-than-thou attitude that people use when applying A2 to modern weaponry.'
p4502
aS"I agree that modern weaponry should be accessible to the people, I just don't like the means being used to defend it (the 'holy cow' approach that is detrimental to discourse)."

aS'Technologies evolve in ways that *nobody* can expect, not even genius inventors/scientists.'
p4504
aS"I don't understand what point you're trying to make here...?"

p4506
aS'That biological weapons would be easy to culture and spread?'
p4507

p4508
aS"Just because you know something will evolve doesn't mean you know how exactly it will."

aS'Disruptive technologies are, by definition, disruptive to contemporary understanding, expectations and dynamics.'
p4510
aS'They had no idea what "arms" would one day achieve and they couldn\'t have considered it when writing the 2A.'

aS'They *did* have the foresight of establishing an amendment system so that govt can adapt to the needs of the time.'
p4512
aS'And, to that extent, conversations about the future of the 2A are perfectly valid *and needed*.'
p4513
aS'Faster and more accurate guns is a pretty predictable evolution.'
p4514
aS'What isn\'t predictable is the paradigm shifts that can come about as a result of a "mere" increase in accuracy and firing rate.'
p4515
aS'While I\'d love to continue this branch of the conversation (I love analyzing the impact of military technologies on ; even simple "obvious" changes to technology can lead to very disruptive changes in the methodologies of war) this line of discussion is diverging a bit from the original point: the founding fathers could not have predicted the ease with which we can kill each other these days.'
p4516
aS"I don't think there's any reason to believe that."
p4517
aS'They had every reason to expect guns would become more advanced, the only things that were an unpredictable development were weapons of mass destruction (like explosive devices and chemical warfare).'

aS"It's a common principle in nonlinear, dynamic systems: if you steadily decrease one parameter of something you'll find this magical point where the system acts very, very differently than we expect and it isn't linear:\n\nGuns that fire once every week would probably never, ever be able to win a battle."
p4523
aS'Guns that are able to fire once every second allow a completely different dynamic to warfare that makes it so much more different than the gun that fires once a week, even though the "only difference" is the frequency that they can shoot.'
p4524
aS'Forget the rate of fire: an automatic weapon that can be carried by a single person wherever they go is *very* different from a massive ship that is limited to the ocean.'
p4525
aS"I'm a little disappointed that I even needed to type that sentence out..."
p4526

p5017
aS'If parity of power was the goal, then it would have protected the right to own the highest-power weaponry available -- which, of course, wouldn\'t be feasible today (or perhaps ever) considering we can\'t allow for a "right" to bear nuclear or thermobaric weapons (etc.).'
p5018
aS'What are your thoughts on that?'
p5019
aS"This has been covered already in this thread, but basically *I believe* that other sovereign nations have the role of 'balancing the higher weapons systems' to secure borderland peace, and the people are protecting their private residences to secure homeland peace with weaponry similar to local law enforcement."
p5020
aS"But that's not expressed in the Constitution or its Amendments, right?"
p5021
aS"In that case, I don't see how parity of power was the aim of the 2nd Amendment if it can't be achieved or relies upon the behavior of other nations to satisfy it (since I don't think the Constitution can outline the obligations of other nations or base the protection our rights conditionally upon the behavior of other nations)."
p5022
aS'And if we have the right to equal the force of our local law enforcement, does that mean we should have access to assault weapons, sniper rifles, tactical vests, cuncussive/flashbang grenades, C4 and bomb-defusing robots, tear gas, etc.?'

p5050
aS'The plan was to move quickly soon after dark with complete secrecy, be at Concord by dawn to seize the supplies, and then return to the garrison in Boston by midday before the colonists could even spread word of what had happened.'

aS'He slipped out of the city by rowboat, passing right under the bow of the British warship Somerset, and took a northerly route toward Concord.'

aS"How do we know the Framers didn't have in mind the right for the citizens to bear arms *through the proxy of local militia or police forces*?"
p5066
aS'The very first entity mentioned in the 2nd Amendment is "a well regulated militia," which does not seem particularly distinct from a police force.'
p5067
aS"Really what I'm asking is: how do we know specifically that the right *for individuals to bear cannons and other heavy artillery* was the right the 2nd Amendment was drafted to protect rather than the right for the people *through representation by a well regulated militia (of which they are members)* to bear heavy arms to protect the citizenry?"

p5090

aS'Honest question for /r/libertarian on this.'
p5663
aS'The constitution obviously doesn\'t say anything about "muskets", it says "the right to bear arms".'

p5692
aS'I believe they are surplus right?'
p5693
aS"That's probably why they are cheaper than the factory FMJ rounds."
p5694

aS"Everytime I'd shoot it I'd hear, chaching, chaching, chaching!"

aS'LOL   '
p5697

aS'I think he said the API rounds were something like $5 a round and the FMJ were somewhere around $7 a round.'

aS'EDIT: And the SLAP rounds are $125 for 5 rounds.'
p5700
aS'Pricey stuff.'
p5701
aS'Or... Claymores, grenades, TNT, C4.'
p5702
aS'Hell, give em [Suitcase Nukes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuke) since legally, according to the definition above on what counts as "arms", a suitcase nuke would be one. '

aS'So they can destroy tanks.'
p5710
aS"I don't know about you, but I don't do a lot of tank destroying on a day to day basis."
p5711

aS'Fine.'
p5716
aS"I'll go into the extremes a little bit."
p5717
aS'A [suitcase nuke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuke) is technically considered an "armament" since it can be operated by a single person.'

aS'How expensive are those things?'
p5720
aS'What use would an anti tank weapon be over say a machine gun, unless the government was using tanks against its own people?'
p5721
aS'You could blow up a car with it, for example.'

p5723
aS"If someone is intent on blowing up a car, they don't need an RPG to do it."
p5724
aS"This is technically correct; though an RPG can be used as a tactical anti-vehicle weapon, building and installing an IED is much cheaper and doesn't put your own personnel's lives at risk, assuming it was built correctly."
p5725
aS'Then why does Hamas regularly use rockets to attack Israel?'
p5726
aS'Are they ignorant of these "easier and cheaper" weapons you\'re referring to?'
p5727
aS"I don't think they are firing RPGs, they're a little more advanced than that:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qassam_rocket"
p5728
aS'What does Hamas using rockets to attack Israel have to do with someone using it to blow up a car?'
p5729
aS"If I wanted to blow up a car, I wouldn't need to track down an RPG to pull it off."
p5730
aS"For that reason, it makes no sense to be concerned about people owning RPG's and destroying cars with them."
p5731
aS'Those people have the ability to blow up a car independent of the RPG.'
p5732
aS"RPG's are designed to destroy stuff that isn't easily destroyed, like an armored car, a tank, a helicopter, etc."
p5733
aS'If you wanted to talk about someone taking down a helicopter, that would be a much more valid concern, as a normal citizen does not have the ability to take down a helicopter without a weapon like an RPG.'

p5746
aS'How do you feel about that?'
p5747
aS'He drove a over two tonnes of *homemade* explosives into a building.'
p5748
aS'From my understanding, he essentially created ammonium nitrate, which (I just checked), has an RE of 0.45.'
p5749
aS"Considering it's homemade, it's probably not very efficient."
p5750
aS'Now, imagine if he had 2 tonnes of something like... TNT.'
p5751
aS'Or C4.'
p5752
aS'The blast would be, at the very least, twice as big (in the case of TNT), and over three times as big (in the case of C4).'
p5753
aS'The number of deaths could potentially reach the thousands.'
p5754
aS'The numbers injured would be many times higher than that.'
p5755
aS"I realize that homemade explosives exist, but the thing is, they're *inefficient*, and thus, not NEARLY as dangerous as actual manufactured explosives... like C4. "
p5756
aS'C4 is not that difficult to make either, though it might take a bit more effort to find large quantities of the ingredients.'
p5757
aS"It's not a complicated chemical process, though."

p5762
aS'Yes, I realized that after my first few replies when I had to look stuff up.'
p5763
aS'Thanks for the heads up anyway (:\n\nAlso, if I understand it, the Destructive Device permit is only given out to people who work in very specific fields.'
p5764
aS'In addition, the government tracks all purchase, transport, and use of explosives by holders of permits. '
p5765
aS'A destructive device is not much different to get than a pre-86 machinegun.'

aS"IIRC it's an ATF form and a $200 tax stamp, plus the purchase price."
p5767
aS"There is no specific field requirement, and it's not the same thing as explosives."
p5768
aS'Also, "low grade" explosives (ANFO) don\'t require a license, just walk in and buy.'

p5781
aS'It seems almost... mind-boggling to me. '
p5782
aS"That's what a republic is."
p5783
aS'Mind boggling.'
p5784
aS'It is the power of the people.'
p5785
aS'Not government.'
p5786
aS"It's crazy how our framers debated the same stuff we are talking about now."

aS"In a republic, it's simply that we elect our leaders instead of them being appointed inherited."

aS'Our elected representatives act as proxies for the citizens in a a house of representatives, and, in a perfect world, they create laws to reflect the ideals and values of the people they represent.'
p5798
aS"The views views strictly libertarian, as libertarians still see some role for the government in the form of protection of an individual's rights."
p5799
aS'Instead, you seem to be delving into to the ideologies of anarchism, in which you believe that the government is detrimental to the people, and the laws should be ignored.'
p5800
aS"In addition, due to the fact that a democratic republic is flawed in that no politician can be perfect, the anarchistic views seem almost logical\n\nBut, in this circumstance, I'd have to disagree with you."
p5801
aS'To me, government is seen as a lesser evil to a truly government-free USA, especially with the slightly radical ideologies that fly around.'
p5802
aS'Elections is democracy.'
p5803
aS'A republic is government ruled by the law.'
p5804
aS'And it so happens that really smart people created the original law.'

aS'They even showed us, posterity, if we lost our way what government cannot do against the people and in hopes that we claim other rights for ourselves too in the Bill of Rights.'
p5806

aS'In a perfect world the government follows the law to a T.  In a perfect world the people do not have to go against their government not following the law to a T.  The law was created by intelligent people.'

p5811
aS'The in order to form a more perfect union part.'

aS'The people created the law...'
p5815
aS'If we believe our Constitution is the law of the land then we must believe in what it says.'
p5816

aS'Legally entitled?'
p5820

aS'Why should he need permission from the people acting as government in order to own one?'
p5822
aS'I realize now that my RPG comparison seems silly.'
p5823
aS'I should have said something along the line of grenades, since they would still technically be considered "arms".'
p5824
aS"Now, what's to stop a person on a psychotic break to purchasing them and just lobbing a few into a crowded area?"
p5825
aS"Yes, if everybody owned and carried a firearm, he'd be taken down pretty quickly."
p5826
aS'But the damage would have been done already.'
p5827
aS"You may use the argument for homemade explosives, and the fact that they don't seem to be seen in the news... except [law enforcement acknowledges that they are becoming a problem](http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2012/July/Colo-Tragedy-Highlights-Threat-of-Homemade-Bombs/)"

aS'Does that scare you?'
p5830
aS'It scares me.'
p5831
aS"But it doesn't scare me enough that I'd authorize people to use force against those who choose to own grenades in a peaceful manner."
p5832
aS'A person on a psychotic break could take a car and drive into a crowd and kill a few people.'
p5833
aS'Does that scare you?'
p5834
aS"It scares me, but again not enough that I'm going to use force against people who decide to own cars in a peaceful manner."
p5835
aS'You probably personally like cars, so if someone tries to take away cars on the basis that you could kill people with them if you went crazy one day, you would surely have a problem with that.'
p5836
aS"But when it's something someone else likes, you have no problem with that argument being applied."
p5837
aS'You will probably hide that your preference is purely personal by stating it in much more grandiose terms, like \'society is benefited by cars being around\', or "there\'s no legitimate reason to own a grenade", or whatever.'

aS'Or that an enemy would actually try to invade the USA by land?'
p5843
aS'Our government can barely do anything right now.'
p5844
aS'The president barely has any actual power in congress, and even then, his power seems to exist as a way to veto bills.'
p5845
aS"Congress is stuck in a gridlock, and will likely be stuck in that gridlock until something changes (Here's hoping for a third party candidate... maybe a successor to Ron Paul?"
p5846
aS'Because, while I remain hopeful, I doubt that the Libertarian movement will gain enough momentum in his lifetime).'
p5847
aS'Or do you really think that the President would be as overt as sending out tanks onto streets?'
p5848
aS"Should the President's military action turn towards the USA, I'm guessing that it would be a lot more subtle."
p5849
aS'In fact, he probably already has.'
p5850
aS'For the invasion... what do you think it is, WW2?'
p5851
aS'Any force that would try an invasion of US territory would probably use air strikes as their primary way of attacking.'
p5852
aS"And then there's the stupidly large number of nukes the USA has..."
p5853
aS"No I don't think it'll happen in my lifetime."

p5865
aS'It was simply the first thing that came to mind.'
p5866

p5902
aS"That's not a definition."

p5961
aS"That alone doesn't mean you're in more danger in the US because of laxer gun control legislation than in the UK, where firearms are all but entirely prohibited (hey, at least the police can check them out of the supply room under very extreme circumstances \xe2\x80\x94 right?)."
p5962
aS'&gt; Note that even the statistical comparisons I present here are not sufficient to prove a case.'
p5963
aS'There are too many other variables in comparisons between crime rates in the UK and in the US to reasonably expect any real certainty about exactly what effect gun control laws have in either country.'
p5964
aS'A far more reliable statistical comparison for purposes of determining the effect of gun control legislation is, as I pointed out in gun control arguments aren\'t exactly "rigorous", to compare crime statistics before the passage or repeal of a gun law to those after the passage of the law \xe2\x80\x94 say, the three years prior and the three years after.'

aS'Other factors will come into play, but given enough case studies, trends will definitely be seen to emerge.'

aS'The right is not given to the militia, members or organizers thereof, but to the people.'

p6540
aS'Which means there must be a third option.'
p6541
aS"So let's show the problems in the logic."
p6542
aS"I think I covered the 'Everyman has a right to defend themselves with what the government has' argument but here is an outline."
p6543
aS'We have rights to defend ourselves from out government\nTo do this effectively we need to be capable of resisting the government\nTherefore we need weapons roughly equal to the government\nList now includes A.A. guns, bombs, nukes?'

p6546
aS'Really if you are arguing that simple assault rifles are sufficient I would call you crazy.'
p6547
aS"Assault rifles really can't stop cannons, let alone predator drones..."
p6548
aS'The other side of the coin is, to people here at least, more obviously flawed.'
p6549
aS'The founding fathers only knew about muskets, and certain smaller cannons that were far less accurate when they wrote this, and therefore they could not imagine the destructive power of modern "arms" and therefore would not want us to have them.'
p6550
aS'All of this is true, except the last part.'
p6551
aS"They couldn't imagine modern weapons, but that does not mean they would want us to have them."
p6552
aS'Now the part nobody will like.'
p6553
aS'My OPINION: (note above is raw analysis, probably infallible with regards to the logic)\n\nWhile the constitution is quite explicit that we have the right to "bear arms" -- which strictly speaking does include nuclear weapons-- we may want to reconsider what rights we and the government have and find a new system of checks and balances.'
p6554
aS"I don't like the idea that the guy next store who works 60 hours a week at a minimum wage job and is on antidepressants because of whatever, has an M16 and a few grenades."
p6555
aS'That makes me uneasy and you should be able to see why.'
p6556
aS'However if we remove his right to bear arms we must surely reconstruct the way we run our military so that the military, and government monopoly on arms is more directly run by the citizenry.'
p6557
aS'Perhaps electing generals and removing the president as commander in chief and installing an elected person to top military posts?'
p6558
aS"I don't know for sure what the best solution looks like but this is the line of thinking I currently pursue."
p6559
aS'EDIT: tl;dr both points are valid, and invalid.'
p6560
aS'&gt;electing\n\nGood lord, if you look at the job the public does with electing officials, just imagine how fucking *terrible* it would be if they elected military personnel.'

p6562
aS"That's more than a fair point."

p6564
aS'Truthfully though beyond my stock "Council of Elders" option I like to throw out for solving leadership problems I got nothing here.'
p6565
aS'Maybe simply electing better politicians who we can trust not to enslave us is the best option... hard to tell'
p6566
aS'Wrong.'
p6567
aS'Read the Federalist papers.'
p6568
aS"It's quite clear what was meant, which was that every citizen is entitled to the armaments of the average *infantryman*."
p6569
aS'In 1787, this meant muskets and pistols, not cannons or galleons, both of which were typically owned by governments and large businesses.'
p6570
aS'In 2012, this means an M16 or M249, not nuclear weaponry or even most explosives.\n'
p6571
aS'Actually it does cover explosives.'
p6572
aS"But other than that, you're spot on. "
p6573
aS'This may be true, and the difference between ordinance and arms was covered well in another comment, but if the argument is your right to bear arms is preventative in that it creates a means to resist governmental tyranny by force then your entire point is already invalidated by my previous argument.'
p6574
aS'You cannot resist modern ordinance with M16 and M249 so where is the point?'
p6575
aS'Perhaps you can argue the second amendment is designed to protect you from criminal activity by other citizens.'
p6576
aS'However then you subject yourself to the argument that you only need equal firepower to what they have to defend yourself.'
p6577
aS'So any weapon not sold publicly, for non military use is off the table and the government certainly under the interstate commerce act has the ability to regulate that.'
p6578
aS'Also remember the federalist papers were a series of what were essentially essays that only reflected the views of some of the founding fathers.'
p6579
aS'They by no means are what all the founders intended.'
p6580
aS'In fact the Constitution was sent to the states in Sept 1787 for ratification the Federalist Papers were only published and written between October that year and August the following year.'
p6581
aS'So although they can help and be a guide to us.'
p6582
aS'There is no reason to regard them as the final say. '

p6584
aS"My rights don't cease to exist just because some coward perceives futility in the effort."

aS'My natural right to self-defense against any assailant exists regardless of my chances for success in any particular encounter.'
p6586
aS'My right to self-determination and self-selection of the most efficient tools to effect my own defense exists as an extension of my right to self-defense.'
p6587
aS'Also, your interpretation of the interstate commerce *clause* (not, itself, an act) is incorrect.'
p6588
aS'There are recent cases where Montana and other states have exercised their 10th Amendment rights and have asserted that the Fedoral government has no authority to regulate arms (or anything else) that is produced, used, and never leaves the borders of their state.'
p6589
aS'Your refutation of what the Federalist Papers say is equally incorrect and is at odds with both the Heller and McDonald decisions that clarify the meaning and intent of the Second Amendment and its incorporation against the states via the Fourteenth.'
p6590
aS"So I am ignoring your claim my argument is defeatist, because you invalidate it by claiming I said your rights to defend yourself didn't exist."
p6591
aS'Thats just not true.'
p6592
aS"I'm implying if you want to do it effectively it has the potential to to be a mexican standoff."
p6593
aS"Also emotional arguments calling me a coward are not required, it's just grandstanding."
p6594
aS'I am however very familiar with your reference to arms in Montana.'
p6595
aS'I use that same argument for marijuana legalization.'
p6596
aS"Pot grown in say NJ and sold in NJ can't be regulated by that clause."
p6597
aS"However, in both cases it's a argument of convenience."
p6598
aS'Tgif for different reasons with pot.'
p6599
aS'See although the government cannot regulate those guns it can try to buy those guns for a base in say Nevada.'
p6600
aS'Then the company either has to submit to regulation or pass on what could be a very lucrative prospect.'
p6601
aS'Now how effective would this be pet se I am not sure.'

aS'Though after 911 I remember stories of how easy it is to make a gun out of rubber bands pens and a few other fairly common materials.'
p6614
aS"That's always going to be true regardless of what is legal and illegal."
p6615
aS'However, people are lazy, stupid, and apathetic much of the time towards owning these sorts of ordinance and frankly I am ok with that.'
p6616
aS'I guess I sort of miss your point thought, sorry :/\n\nAre you implying people can still harm other people/the government without these?'
p6617
aS'Or just saying they can go have fun in the woods building them?'
p6618
aS'Also how does this affect any of the previous argument?'
p6619

p6628
aS"If it makes you uneasy that he might have an M16 (not sure why, as large-mag semi-auto rifles are fully legal and the full-auto isn't that useful anyway, especially compared to something like a 12-gauge,) then you should be uneasy about the potential of him building a bomb that can take out a city block as well."
p6629
aS"Fortunately, people generally don't do that."
p6630

p6636
aS'Thank you for this.'
p6637
aS"I couldn't agree with you more."
p6638
aS'In the second amendment, how do you define the word previous to arms?'
p6639
aS"The same way I would in a phrase like 'bear the burdon of truth' I suppose."
p6640
aS'To bear is to shoulder, or take responsibility.'
p6641
aS'So a right to best arms means you have the right to take responsibility our shoulder the burdon of keeping and maintaining arms, presumably against the government.'

aS'How do you reconcile that the amendment explicitly states that the right to bear arms is for \n\n&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State\n\nPersonally I am pro-gun rights, but I find it interestingly worded and perhaps open to future interpretation.'
p6809
aS'I think it may be because its in the federal bill of rights and was meant to protect the states from the federal government.'
p6810
aS'It meant the states can have their own militias as a defense against a possible all powerful federal govt.'
p6811
aS"It doesn't mean that anymore though since we added the 14th amendment and made all the BORs applicable to the whole country, and changed its meaning to that it protects individual rights."
p6812
aS"edit: Actually its both now, it protects against the gov't (Federal And State) and protects individual rights."
p6813
aS'Firstly, the 2A does not say that the right to bear arms is reserved for a well-regulated militia.'
p6814
aS'It says that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of the state AND that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed.'
p6815
aS'However, for those that believe the two are somehow connected, Title 10, Chapter 13 of the United States Code defines a militia as either the National Guard (organized militia) or any able-bodied man age 17-45 (unorganized militia).'

aS'and while i understand your underlying point, i have to highlight that no other item or source of death is specifically mentioned in our founding documents; only "arms" are.'
p7224
aS'why?'

aS'Why not?'

aS'A fully automatic firearm is no more dangerous than a semi automatic one.'

aS'In a close range shooting a shotgun would be among the most dangerous things you could be up against. '
p7239
aS'For the exact reasons you say.'
p7240
aS"Exactly, a shotgun is better in close situations and general home defense and you don't hunt with automatic ARs, They are used in combat situations to kill a large amount of people as quickly as possible, which is not unnecessary for citizen use. "

p7961
aS'But Im not way out of line to assume the chance of the assailant carrying a weapon as well, to be significantly higher in the US, legal or not?'
p7962
aS'I dont want to sound harah, but there are ways to protect oneself other than carrying a weapon.'
p7963

p8014
aS'I think this is where you are hugely misinformed.'
p8015
aS'There were riots in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of an African-American teenager by a white police officer.'
p8016
aS'However, the police officer in this scenario followed protocol correctly and was found largely innocent of wrongdoing.'
p8017
aS'The teenager had robbed a convenience store earlier, and when the white police office attempted to apprehend him, the teenager resisted arrest and attacked the police officer, which was when he shot and killed him.'
p8018
aS'The general consensus seems to be that, while tragic, it was the fault of the teenager in this case.'
p8019
aS'The police officer not being indicted was something else entirely.'
p8020
aS'It was a case where a police officer appeared to be attempting to arrest a man named Eric Garner without evidence of criminal activity, and in the process, the "suspect" was put into a dangerous choke-hold and killed.'
p8021
aS"In this case there is video evidence of the police officer committing, in most people's eyes, a murder."
p8022
aS'However, he was not indicted and essentially let off scot-free.'
p8023
aS"This incident is irrelevant to this topic as it pretty much didn't involve guns at all."
p8024
aS'Correct me if I was wrong with that, and link me to what you were thinking of, but it really seemed like you had those two stories mixed up.'
p8025
aS'[Here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html) is a good article about the Ferguson shooting and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner) is the Wikipedia page on the death of Eric Garner.'
p8026
aS"I know Wikipedia isn't always the most reliable, but I found it's fairly succinct and accurate on the incident."
p8027
aS'&gt; The general consensus seems to be that, while tragic, it was the fault of the teenager in this case.'
p8028
aS'This is not even remotely true.'
p8029
aS'The police officer shot him in the back when he was attempting to flee.'
p8030
aS"The cop said he thought he had a gun, but that's what they all say because they know they won't get called out on it."
p8031
aS'The DA made a weak case to the grand jury, including allowing people he knew were lying to testify, and the grand jury failed to indict him.'
p8032
aS'This happens all over America every week.'

aS'DAs will often joke about how they could get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich, but will rarely make a good case against a cop who was not harming other cops. '

aS'He fled initially, but charged the cop in the end.'
p8036
aS'*Every single gunshot* hit Brown on the front side, showing that he was at least facing the cop, and not once shot in the back.'
p8037
aS'Two seperate autopsies agree on this.'
p8038
aS"And I don't think the cop ever said he thought he had a gun; he always said that Brown, who was a HUGE dude btw, had charged at and attacked him."
p8039
aS'Ok, he was not shot in the back.'
p8040
aS'I was wrong about that.'
p8041
aS'But the police officers initial story was that there was a struggle and that Brown went for his gun, which was a lie.'
p8042
aS"Beyond that it's just what you choose to believe."
p8043
aS'You choose to believe cops who are proven liars.'
p8044
aS'Many witnesses say he just turned around.'
p8045
aS'So no, not everyone pretty much agrees that it was his fault. '
p8046
aS'&gt;But the police officers initial story was that there was a struggle and that Brown went for his gun, which was a lie.'
p8047
aS"Except they released the pics of the cop in the hospital with facial contusions and swelling, and some of the gunshots on Brown's body are consistent with the claim that he was standing over the cop, bent at the waist."
p8048
aS'As much as people want the cops to be guilty, in this case the grand jury made the right decision.'
p8049
aS'Eric Garner, on the other hand, is a whole other issue, more worthy of our ire.'
p8050
aS'&gt; cops who are proven liars\n\nYes, all cops *ever*, in any country, are all liars.'
p8051
aS'What a moronic statement.'
p8052
aS'Wow, way to take half a sentence out of context and then completely misinterpret it.'
p8053
aS"If that's what you got from that, you're an idiot."
p8054
aS'There is no context there, you literally just shoved that blanket statement of "all cops are liars" into your retarded ramblings.'
p8055
aS'Also, "many witnesses say he just turned around" is wrong.'
p8056
aS'From [this](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html) NYTimes article, "Most of the witnesses said the shots were fired as he moved toward Officer Wilson.'
p8057
aS'" So not only were you hugely misinformed when you said he was shot in the back, but you were wrong when you said most witnesses testified that he didn\'t charge the police officer.'
p8058
aS'See, you keep changing words and meaning and arguing against things I never said.'
p8059
aS'Most does not equal many, moving toward is not the same as charging and I never said all cops are liars.'
p8060
aS"It's obvious you have no formal education in logic."
p8061
aS'Edit: You seem to be adding a comma into my sentence that was left out on purpose.'
p8062
aS'There is a difference between "cops who are proven liars" and "cops, who are proven liars.'
p8063
aS'" Punctuation is important.'
p8064
aS'So yeah, I guess we should listen to those "many witnesses" as opposed to the majority of other witnesses who disagree with them.'
p8065
aS"Maybe just because it's convenient for your argument?"
p8066
aS'And if you read the article, or even the line I quoted, you would have seen this one directly after it "The St. Louis County prosecutor said the most credible witnesses reported that Mr. Brown charged toward the officer.'
p8067
aS'" And whether or not the officer was lying is out of the question considering that there were several witnesses who corroborated his story.'

p8085
aS'Right, I got those mixed up.'
p8086
aS'I have read both courtroom statements (the cop and the friend), and theyre both unreliable.'
p8087
aS'They both have reasons to twist the truth to protect themselves, even under oath.'
p8088
aS'Im pretty sure what actually happened is something of a mix between the two stories, but I think youre very  wrong about the general consensus of that case.'
p8089
aS'Well, ok, sure they can both be unreliable, but there were more witnesses than just the friend, so we have a pretty good idea of what happened.'
p8090
aS'This quote: \n\n&gt;The St. Louis County prosecutor said the most credible witnesses reported that Mr. Brown charged toward the officer.'
p8091
aS'Officer Wilson also said that Mr. Brown charged at him, making \xe2\x80\x9ca grunting, like aggravated sound.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nis the key piece in this case.'
p8092
aS'If a criminal has robbed a liquor store, attempted to flee on foot *after* an altercation with the police officer (during which the officer also pursued on foot, he did not fire his weapon), and then attempted to attack the police officer, there is good reason for the officer to open fire on him, especially when the perpetrator is considerably larger than him.'
p8093
aS"And I don't know, I saw most of the Reddit threads pertaining to this case and it seemed like there was agreement that the police officer hadn't followed protocol."

p8132
aS'QUICK EVERYONE THROW THEIR FRESHLY SHARPENED PENCILS'
p8133
aS'Yep then you can grab your gun and defend yourself..........oh wait'
p8134
aS"That's not the logic behind the law."
p8135
aS'The logic behind that law is that it would allow the police to treat anyone near a school carrying a gun as a criminal, thereby allowing a larger area between a high concentration of children and guns.'
p8136
aS'Without this law then the officers would have to observe the person doing something suspicious other than carrying a weapon in order to detain/arrest them, this law allows them to detain anyone wielding a weapon in close proximity to a school.'
p8137
aS"The purposes of laws aren't always their punishment, sometimes it's to allow police the authority to act in a way that prevents highly dangerous situations before they can start."
p8138
aS"That's all well and good, but if we look at ever school shooting in the past 20 years, the police aren't able to get there in time to do a damn thing, even if they're already on campus."
p8139
aS'I have read quite a few police blotters where they apprehended individuals with guns in school zones.'
p8140
aS'Who knows how many of those would have turned into school shootings.'
p8141
aS"I'm not saying what is right, but pointing out JUST failures isn't a reasonable way to evaluate a law."
p8142
aS"You don't know how many lives it has actually saved. "
p8143
aS'Or conversely, how many of those people had no ill intentions?  '
p8144
aS"But I'm sure most of those people were conscious of the law."
p8145
aS'It depends on whether being able to remove guns from a school is more effective than having more guns at a school at preventing shootings.'
p8146
aS"I don't know the studies, but I would expect being able to remove guns would be more effective at PREVENTING shootings."
p8147
aS'Having more guns might be more effective at STOPPING them.'
p8148
aS'Personally I think it makes sense to have a few authorized people at a school with weapons.'
p8149
aS"I think more people would FEEL secure that way at least, because you don't expect random people to have concealed weapons."
p8150
aS'How do you suppose removing guns will prevent shootings?'
p8151
aS'Wouldnt a shooter target schools with no protection as opposed to those with plenty?'
p8152
aS'Id argue the ability to stop violence is what prevents it, not the lack thereof'
p8153
aS"I'm pretty sure most shooters have a personal agenda and don't search for the school with the least amount of protection."
p8154
aS'Thats your argument for removing protection from the schools?'
p8155
aS'What?'
p8156
aS"I've already made my argument."
p8157
aS"I'm not sure what you're saying."
p8158
aS"I'm saying plenty of people are caught bringing guns into schools, and many of those might have turned out to be shootings."
p8159
aS'So the law has some merit.'
p8160
aS'Even in my highschool freshman year this kid was caught with a gun, and he was known to have a temper.'
p8161
aS'&gt;and ***many of those might have*** turned out to be shootings.'

aS'^\n\nThose kids that were arrested ***still*** brought a gun to school *despite* the law; most of them (if not all of them) had no intention of shooting up the school; and the possibility of a school shooting still exists.'
p8164
aS'If adding weapons to a school does not deter shootings, then removing them certainly will not- it only removes the ability for law abiding citizens to defend themselves against those intelligent enough to sneak a gun onto campus.'
p8165
aS'just.'
p8166
aS'one.'
p8167
aS'time. \n'
p8168
aS"But you're admitting that some of them might have been shootings."
p8169
aS'Which means the law had some effect.'
p8170
aS"I'm not convinced that people intentionally break the law and bring guns onto school premises, and none of them had an ill intent."
p8171
aS"I think you're being delusional, and want to believe the law is useless."
p8172
aS'I think the law has prevented a lot more shootings than having more guns in a school full of hot headed kids would prevent.'
p8173
aS'I went to a shitty school.'
p8174
aS"I don't want ANY of those kids around guns."
p8175
aS'The police officer that was there constantly was enough reassurance. '
p8176
aS"I'm talking about *licensed* people being permitted to carry guns wherever they like."
p8177
aS'Gun free zones result in the arrest of innocent people: perhaps they left their gun in their bag, or they needed the gun after school, or maybe they generally oppose the law and choose safety over legality- whatever the reason, these people (and many like them) have no intent to cause harm - yet they are subject to arrest.'
p8178
aS"I'm not convinced that there are enough licensed individuals who bring a gun into a GFZ with intent to cause harm that justify the arrest of those who no ill intent."
p8179
aS"and if one of them choose to cause harm, I'm arguing the best and immediate defense is anyone who is licensed and packing in the area."
p8180
aS'School shootings would have ended a lot quicker if the staff had access to weapons. \n'
p8181
aS"That's some messed up logic."

aS'Welcome to government and politics.'
p8183
aS'The job of the police is not to prevent crime, it is to investigate and clean up afterwards.'

p8185
aS'http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/28scotus.html\n\nNo duty to protect, thus they can watch a crime happen if they felt like it.'

aS"Obviously you don't know the difference between an individual and the public."
p8187
aS'The police do not have a duty to protect an individual, if they did they would become over stretched trying to protect every individual under threat (which is why we have the second amendment right to defend ourselves), they do have an obligation to protect the public, which is what they would be doing by using this law to detain anyone near a school with a gun.'

aS'They can not "watch a crime happen if they felt like it" without losing their jobs.'

p8192
aS"Um...That case literally says they don't have to do shit."

p8963
aS"I honestly don't know but I wouldn't doubt if legally the answer was no."
p8964
aS'That was sort of my question too -- but at the same time, violating a contract shouldn\'t count as espionage especially when the end result has nothing to do with providing intelligence to "enemies of our nation," but rather educating the general public that their constitutional rights are being violated by the very people they trust to protect their privacy.'

aS'There is also an issue of his employment status.'
p9347

p9375
aS'His amendment is based on little-known writings of James Madison, and he calls it "Madison\'s Lost Amendment".'
p9376
aS'Essentially it would allow a representative majority of state legislatures (i.e.'
p9377
aS"at least half of the state legislatures representing at least half of the union's population) repeal any Act of Congress, or any Executive Order."
p9378
aS"We know that written constitutions are necessary to protect the People, but as it stands now we don't have many tools at our disposal to enforce it."
p9379
aS"A state check on the federal government as Lloyd is proposing is the key to upholding the states' sovereignty and undoing bad laws, I think."
p9380
aS"Hmmm...I've never heard this idea proposed before....without having had time to give any serious thought yet, it sounds like a reasonable check on the federal government that makes a lot of sense."
p9381
aS"My thinking is that we desperately need to reopen the federalist debate that raged at our country's founding."
p9382
aS'We need to return to a confederation of independent states that cede a limited amount of power to a, highly restricted, federal government.'
p9383
aS'Making this happen in reality though...not sure how that will happen.'
p9384
aS"I agree that that's what we need to do, and I think a state repeal amendment like the one I described is the way to make it happen."
p9385
aS'Right now the federal government is "restricted" only by the parchment of the constitution, and sometimes by federal judges.'
p9386
aS'Allowing the states to have a direct check on Congress will ensure that when they overstep their bounds something is done about it.'
p9387
aS'Also, we should repeal the 17th amendment, which took the selection of Senators from the states and changed it to direct election.'
p9388
aS'Since then, special interests have bought Senate elections, and the states have lost their representation in Congress.'
p9389
aS'Actually I believe the federalist papers claimed that a last defense was actually not the supreme court as people think.'
p9390
aS"It's really the Jury that decides whenether a law that the courts rule constitutional can be enforced."

aS'Jury nullification is the last defense of our republic.'

aS"Of course it's a great example."
p10114
aS"It didn't pass even though everyone knew what it needed to do so, and look at the age demographics that voted."
p10115
aS'Take out the 65+ and it would have easily passed the 60% that was needed. '
p10116
aS'If I remember correctly, Florida only fell a few % points short of passing.'
p10117
aS'This was AFTER a Vegas casino owner dumped millions into negative campaigns about the law.'
p10118
aS'Without his influence it probably would have passed.'

p10122
aS"He's right"
p10123
aS'Ca voted it down too.'

aS'But it was the regular smokers who argued it should be kept as is.'
p10125
aS'otherwise they would have to follow the same laws like alcohol'
p10126
aS'It also has to do with the MMJ growers not wanting to legalize, since that would cut into their profits.'

aS'I came from a conservative family myself, but my views often sit between Libertarians and Republicans.\n'

p10134
aS'He\'s still correct in that decriminalization is not a "very libertarian" position on the issue. '

aS'Yes I know.'
p10136
aS"That's why I only said \n\n&gt; It's a step in the right direction"
p10137

p10146
aS'Speeding is decriminalized.'

aS'Wait what?'
p10159
aS"If the gay marriage and abortion arguments have taught me anything it's that decriminalization is better than legalization."
p10160
aS'It goes: Illegal &lt;-&gt; Decriminalized &lt;-&gt; Legal.'
p10161
aS"I don't even know what you're talking about with regards to marriage and abortion."
p10162
aS"It's a bit of a tongue-in-cheek remark on the fact that so many libertarians on here tend to argue that gay marriage shouldn't be legalized because it involves even more state influence in the process, whereas they jump on the chance to legalize marijuana.  "
p10163
aS"Yeah that's silly."
p10164
aS'Making gay marriage "legal" only means removing additional laws in the books that make them illegal, not making new ones that say it\'s legal.'

p10167

aS"That's not necessarily true."
p10175
aS'Here in Oregon under the new law that was voted in last week; yes it will be taxed like alcohol and tobacco when bought from a retailer but, the new law also states that 4 plants are allowed to be grown at a time in home. '

p10177
aS"It's legal to grow tobacco and brew beer at home in most places, why would marijuana be different?  "
p10178
aS'it would not be illegal to grow at home just as you can brew beer and grow tobacco'

aS"Status quo doesn't fix anything."

aS'It just keeps the country divided and in constant political warfare with itself.'
p10187
aS"There's also a concept called DECRIMINALIZATION."
p10188
aS'That alone would prevent all these problems, and that is far more libertarian than letting government tax it.'
p10189
aS'AFAIK decriminalization typically only effects possession.'
p10190

p10191
aS'Still makes it illegal to buy or sell.'
p10192
aS"It doesn't fix anything."
p10193
aS'If anything it is a tax on people who get caught in possession of it.'
p10194
aS"Fair enough perhaps, I'm going by the literal definition."
p10195
aS'Even so, at least fines would be more easily dodged than having to pay taxes while only idiots would likely ever get fined (reducing revenue for the government).'
p10196
aS"Then there's the fact we still have a federal layer that refuses to respect state rights, right now in Washington &amp; Colorado arresting cannabis users - which some would argue would not be happening nearly as much if the states treated it as a grey area (for the same reason only idiots would be fined: those smartening up won't be doing shit in the open)."
p10197
aS'I know plenty of people who have gotten in trouble for possession on the way back from a deal.'

p10203
aS'Of all drugs, too.'
p10204
aS"But isn't liberty the freedom to annoy each other?"
p10205
aS'Yet if we were talking about cigarettes people would say banning smoking outdoors is insane.'
p10206
aS"It's not libertarian, Bill just recognizes the futility of conservative efforts to continue enforcing prohibition."
p10207
aS'I could see a train of thought that gets you to "don\'t smoke in public".'
p10208
aS'Of course on private property it would be anything goes, but if you are in a state that has public territory that is considered the commons and the majority do not want smoking in it, for legitimate reasons like it does hurt to be around, that makes sense.'
p10209
aS'And in the same line of thinking, public intoxication can make sense for a state with a participatory commons to outlaw, because you are in a significantly mind-altered state, and the people may agree collectively they do not want you under the influence of substances in public, in the same way your neighbor could make you leave if you got drunk on their property and they did not want you around drunk.'
p10210
aS'Now, my experiences with those high on pot leads me to think they are not nearly as significantly mentally impaired as a drunk, but there is an effect there, and maybe some small community does not want that in the public park they are all paying for.'
p10211
aS'And there is the whole can of worms about fair representation in a statist political sytem to deal with as well.'
p10212
aS'Of course, I would want the marijuana smoker to be able to easily relocate somewhere with like minded minds if he wants to publicly smoke, under whatever political system he was interested in, or none at all.'
p10213
aS'The only reason an act should be outlawed in public is if it causes harm to others.'
p10214
aS'Public intoxication has a very minimal chance of causing harm to others.'
p10215
aS'The only possible libertarian argument against public smoking is that 2nd hand smoke is causing harm to others.'
p10216
aS'The majority wanting something is not grounds to revoke a personal freedom. '
p10217
aS'It is at the discretion of the social organization of persons if the inherent risks of intoxicated persons in public outweighs the loss of liberty in prohibiting it.'
p10218
aS'What you call minimal might mean a lot to someone else.'
p10219
aS'The point is more generally that anyone under the influence of drugs need not be in a rational mental state, and I see an argument for an accumulated persons to not want persons not in their base mental state out and about.'
p10220
aS'And there is a tangible difference in liberty between "you can\'t do X or we will inflict violence upon you" and "you can\'t do X in Y place because it is "common" ground, and the majority who own that ground don\'t want it".'
p10221
aS'The later I see as little different from a communal homestead "banning" alcohol in common areas, and the other tenants can move if they do not like it.'
p10222
aS'Of course, that is the slippery slope to mob rule in other circumstances.'
p10223
aS'Smoke shops or smoke friendly bar would be great.'
p10224
aS"I don't think openly smoking it in public is good for anyone."
p10225
aS"I don't feel that it actually really hurts anyone, but to keep any tension down it would be better if only allowed to smoke in private or publicly sanctioned places."
p10226
aS'Towns/cities would be allowed to make this distinction themselves.'
p10227
aS"I don't see why smoking bans are anti-libertarian unless I misunderstand the term."
p10228
aS"Isn't your smoke impinging my liberty?"
p10229
aS'I thought libertarianism meant "do what you like unless it affects or harms someone".'
p10230
aS'Which smoking does.'
p10231
aS'the effects of second hand smoke *outdoors* is largely exaggerated if not totally bullshit '
p10232

p10233
aS'you want to smoke a joint.'
p10234
aS"ain't no one around or the nearest people are like 30+ ft away..."
p10235
aS'If we go with the mentality "it affects someone else therefore it should be banned" you\'ll end up like Regressives that want to ban free speech because it affects someone else specially when it\'s something they disagree with.'
p10236
aS'That is the exact same stance that the vast majority of police departments in the country have.'
p10237
aS"People aren't getting arrested just for smoking a doobie in their own homes."
p10238
aS'Is this point directly at Bill or is the meme meant to address conservatives in general?'
p10239
aS'I would assume the latter considering the Hypocritical Liberal is addressing liberals in general. '
p10240
aS'Well yes, it should be taken as conservatives in general which would make the point accurate.'
p10241
aS"However given that this subreddit has basically become conservative there's nuance given in the conservative position, but the liberals are all gun snatchers."
p10242
aS'Bottom line: OP fucked up.'
p10243
aS'His claim is false.'
p10244
aS"Furthermore, the vast majority of those for criminalization of pot aren't arguing that it keeps it out of the hands of criminals."
p10245
aS"That's not only a straw-man, but it's also non-sensical (they are criminals by definition because they are circumventing the law)."
p10246
aS'People who oppose pot do so because they believe it is morally wrong for our society to endorse and allow it.'
p10247
aS'And on top of that, the gun issue and pot issue are not equivocal since the argument for guns is that if criminals have them, law abiding citizens should be able to have them too in order to protect themselves from criminals.'
p10248
aS"There is no analogy to draw there with pot (if they're getting high, we need to be able to get high too!"

aS'The University of Chicago put out a report on Chicago crime.'
p10655
aS'They mention much of what I have been arguing:\n\n\n&gt;These data suggest a pattern to much of the gun violence that occurs across the state of Illinois: **An\nargument in some public place turns deadly because someone often an impulsive young person\nhas a gun ready at hand.'
p10656
aS'Strategies that were capable of deterring illegal gun carrying could help reduce the\nlethality of violent crime**.'
p10657
aS'As Lawrence Sherman, Wolfson Professor of Criminology at Cambridge University (UK) noted, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the extent that homicide frequently occurs spontaneously among young men in public places, it is the\ncarrying of firearms, rather than the ownership that is the immediate proximate cause of criminal injury\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWe need tougher penalties.'
p10658
aS'&gt;While Hawaii HOPE provides compelling evidence that illegal drug use can be deterred through swift,\ncertain punishments, does the same hold true for decisions to carry guns illegally?'
p10659
aS'We believe the\nanswer is probably yes, based partly on studies that were conducted many years ago of a previous\npolicy in Massachusetts: the Bartley Fox amendment, which was enacted in 1975, created a mandatory.'

p10661
aS'Beha (1977) suggests that\nthis policy of increased certainty of punishment for illegal gun carrying helped deter criminal gun use\n(see also Cook, 1980).'
p10662
aS'A more current study by Cohen and Ludwig (2003) of a different intervention,\nanti-gun police patrols in the city of Pittsburgh, also finds evidence consistent with a large deterrent\neffect on illegal gun carrying from increased certainty of punishment.'
p10663
aS'It needs to be swift as well.'
p10664
aS'&gt;But the size of the deterrent effect on UUW could be quite large.'
p10665
aS'An increase in the\ncertainty of punishment for UUW (unlawful use of weapon) in Pittsburgh was found to reduce shots fired reports by 34 percent and hospital treated assault gunshot injuries by fully 71 percent (Cohen and Ludwig, 2003).'
p10666
aS'Zimring\n(2011) shows that as New York City policies changed in the direction of increasing the chances that\nUUW would result in arrest, and changed court practices to increase consistency of punishment for\nUUW cases, gun violence fell alongside reductions in total prison commitments.'
p10667
aS'**Put differently, as a logical matter if the deterrent effect of the law change on illegal gun carrying were large enough the prison costs of the new policy could in principle even be negative that is, reduce DOC costs**\n\n\n\nSo your whole "*As far as New York City goes, I\'d attribute their handling of the crack epidemic, stop and frisk, and the fact that they hired as many officers as they could swing had a lot more to do with their crime rates rather than any gun laws.'

p11429
aS"&gt; There aren't a ton of fully private prisons, but one source i found put the percentage of prisoners held in for-profit facilities at around 8%."
p11430
aS'But the point is that they are the vast minority, and as such they make money by competing for existing prisoners.'
p11431
aS'Ie There are x amount of prisoners in the system.'
p11432
aS'Public prisons house them for say a dollar a person per day (just for discussions sake) Private company A says he has capacity for Y amount of them for say 90 cents per person for day, so the government accepts and transfers the prisoners.'
p11433
aS"I don't see why private company A would have any incentive to create more prisoners (create a larger market) when their market share is so small (Only 8%) and their income is directly proportional to their capacity, not the size of the prison system."
p11434
aS"It seems to me that a prison seeking to make a profit from more prisoners wouldn't waste a dime on drug laws and instead expand their prison to hold more prisoners (get more of that 92%)."

p11442
aS'It is very much in their interest to invest in their own political future.'
p11443
aS'But that lobbying is directed at moving more prisoners from the public prisons to the private prisons.'
p11444
aS'Essentially they are marketing that they offer the same service for cheaper.'
p11445
aS"I don't see how that has anything to do with drug laws."
p11446
aS'&gt; Likewise, it is the overabundance of prisoners from things like drug sentencing that paved the way for privatized prisons to exist in the first place.'
p11447
aS'What?'
p11448
aS'How do you come to that conclusion?'
p11449
aS'Private prisons exist because somebody somewhere figured that he can reduce the costs of managing the prison and profit off the difference.'
p11450
aS"An overabundance doesn't seem like a necessary component to that business plan."
p11451
aS'It\'s more of a "there\'s a monopoly and I\'m gonna take a chunk outta that market"\n\n&gt; any increase in the prisoner population must be taken up by the for-profit sector.'
p11452
aS"That doesn't make any sense."
p11453
aS'Private prisons are going to get first dibs (because they are cheaper) and get filled up first.'
p11454
aS'Any excess is going into the public system.'
p11455
aS"They literally don't benefit from an excess at all."
p11456
aS"It doesn't matter if there are a million prisoners or a billion, if you can only house 1000, then you are only making money off of 1000."
p11457
aS'The public system on the other hand has to house them no matter what,\n\n&gt; In short, they are spending money to increase their market share, and the size of the market.'
p11458
aS'But  those are two completely different things.'
p11459
aS'You can lobby for one, or lobby for the other, or split your money between both.'
p11460
aS'Lobbying for more private prisons seems like a much more effective use of resources than lobbying for more prisoners (which mostly just get absorbed by the public system.'
p11461
aS"Shrug, I'm just not seeing any direct link here."
p11462
aS'I would find the idea more plausible if I saw a source (something that linked private prisons to drug laws) but right now it just seems like a reach.'
p11463
aS"It's not like there aren't already a bunch of reasons why the war on drugs exist, I don't think we need to try hard to find new ones."
p11464
aS'&gt;  influence on drug laws comes more from campaign funding and/or direct buyoffs.'
p11465
aS'Source?'
p11466
aS"I think it's clear that we disagree on whether they would have a clear motive to do so."
p11467
aS'Saying that a private industry is influencing the law like that is a pretty big allegation, and I see it quoted on reddit a lot but I have never once seen a source.'
p11468
aS'Personally I think that line of thinking is akin to jumping on a conspiracy theory when there are better explanation right in front of you.'
p11469
aS"I mean it's no secret why the government frowns on drugs and that doesn't rely on the existence of private prisons."
p11470
aS"The debate isn't over whether drugs should be disallowed or not, it's over whether the government has the right to make that decision on our behalf."
p11471
aS'&gt; Not only are for-profit prisons lobbying in multiple directions and buying politicians, they are also directly bribing[1] judges for harsher sentencing.'
p11472
aS"You can't just use a very specific and isolated example and say that it's an example of a system wide problem."
p11473
aS"That also doesn't link private prisons to *drug law*, which is what I was asking for."
p11474
aS'What it does implicate is that there are scumbags in the world, but I already knew that ;)'
p11475
aS'&gt; Corruption has gone way beyond the realm of conspiracy theory.'

p11478
aS"I'm not really sure why it's relevant though."
p11479
aS'Lobbying and corruption are two very different things, and I was under the impression that you were talking about the former, not the later.'
p11480
aS"&gt; The government's motivation behind drugs laws is anything but clear and likely has very little to do with the reasons they often put forward."
p11481
aS"It's pretty much exactly what they put forward."

aS"It's bad for society."
p11483

aS"Let's not pretend that you don't know anybody whose life was derailed by getting high everyday."
p11488
aS'So why does the government want it banned?'
p11489
aS'To prevent that small group of users from getting fucked over.'
p11490
aS"The problem is that just like alcohol or gambling, this restriction comes at the expense of the freedom of the majority who won't have a problem."
p11491
aS"With hard drugs it's the same thing except instead of a small portion of users getting fucked over, it's most of the users."
p11492

p13202
aS'Ex: If Walmart decided to fill every supercenter with btc mining equipment and try to mine all the btc for themselves, the difficulty factor built into the protocol would adjust drastically, making it so btc are only released at the same set rate they are being released now.'

aS"I am well aware the movement isn't new, but it has been sponsored largely by corporations since the 1980s, almost all its think tanks have connections to the Koch brothers; a notable one popular among non-Tea Partiers being the Cato Institute, which is just as guilty of elite funding."
p13544
aS"In addition the movement has had a massive surge in popularity lately thanks to propagation by the Tea Party among crazy Republicans, which has broadened its appeal and drawn in the more socially liberal and sane people in the world, who prefer to distance themselves from the Tea Party and attach themselves to the Libertarian Party (whom the Koch's also funded extensively)."
p13545

aS"They won't stop until America is a 3rd world sh*thole."
p13559
aS'I understand what they are doing to America, but why are they doing it?'
p13560
aS'because we are a country of consumers, not producers, due to our higher wages and costs for manufacturing.'
p13561
aS"Smaller countries have less regulation so it's less expensive in day to day operations and the workers are also allowed to be payed less."
p13562
aS'It is made there for cheap, then shipped here to sell for more where people have more money.'

p13564
aS"I just realized i didn't answer your question..."
p13565
aS"They're not intentionally driving businesses off, but it's a result of stricter regulations."
p13566
aS"It's also not their top priority because they are probably invested in the biggest multi nationals that have closed shop in the u.s., so they are still making money from the increased profits of outsourcing."
p13567
aS'Whether it is just bloated bureaucracy or essential to worker and consumer safety is a big point of debate and differs from matter to matter of course. '

aS"The USA produces more manufacturing than any other country\n\n[Source](http://greyhill.com/manufacturing-by-country/)  \nUSA $2,333,728,479,982  \nCHINA $2,049,898,658,612  \n\nAlthough it's believed that china is passing us either this year or next."
p13569
aS'Of course it does; American manufacturing is used when quality matters significantly more than cost (we and the Japanese have some of the best quality control programs anywhere, ever).'
p13570
aS"The problem is that America used be have a larger manufacturing industry than the rest of the world combined; now we're challenged for first place by a (basically) 50 year old upstart."
p13571
aS'This might just mean the things we produce are being sold for more money, not that we make more.'
p13572
aS'Yup, US workers in manufacturing are up to six times more productive than their Chinese counterparts as well.'
p13573
aS"If I'm not mistaken, US manufacturing is actually doing the best it ever has in terms of revenue, it's just that it's A) a far smaller percentage of the total economy (~10% iirc) than it once was and B) automation ended up making a lot of jobs (especially more stereotypical blue collar manufacturing jobs) obsolete."
p13574
aS'Thanks for the answer.'
p13575
aS'You reasonably explained why manufacturing has left the US over time, but how is it possible to reverse that trend?'
p13576
aS'Given the reasons you listed for the desertion, we would have to either pay our workers less, have them work more hours, give them less benefits, or cheapen the means of production via less regulation (whether it be safety, environmental, etc).'
p13577
aS'The ability to do this in other countries is why production has moved over seas, so should we subject the workers of this nation to the same conditions found in the textile mills of SE Asia or in the technology factories of China for the sake of these jobs returning stateside?'

p13582
aS"No, we shouldn't."
p13583
aS"In a perfect world, (and there are people who voice these views) the push would be to bring up the global standards for worker compensation and safety, which is a pretty daunting task considering you can't just walk in and tell people how to treat their companies (especially when they have the advantage over you because of it."
p13584
aS") However since we can't really dictate their laws, we need to make change on our end."
p13585

p21112

p21113
aS'I specifically remember a gas station manager outside of Denver talking my ear off about his love for W because he had maintained low gas prices.'
p21114
aS'However, I would never say "conservatives say the president can control gas prices" because I know plenty who are intelligent enough to recognize the complexity of the economic dynamics behind those prices. '

aS"Regarding that, yes there maybe people that treat homosexuality as a special kind of sin, but it's non-sense, in biblical categories homosexuality is worse than pre-marital sex, it's more like adultery, though, but Jesus's death and resurrection can pay even for the worst sin."

aS'Give it time.'
p22245
aS'so you are saying that there will be a total breakdown of marriage law, which by the way, we are talking about the secular definition of marriage which grants certain tax and employment benefits rather than the religious institution, if gay marriage is universal?'
p22246
aS'sorry, i dont follow.'
p22247
aS'i figure, due to the non establishment clause and the separation of church and state, there should be equal protection under the law for homosexuals just as there should for heterosexuals.'

aS'I wouldn\'t say "total breakdown", but I think we can agree on "slow erosion".'
p22250
aS'i disagree on that.'
p22251

p22259
aS'here is the issue.'
p22260
aS'a civil marriage license issued by the government allows certain privileges, such as tax benefits, inheritance rights, onward and so forth.'
p22261
aS'in addition there are nondiscrimination laws pointing directly at gender, race, and now sexual orientation.'
p22262
aS'marriage as a state institution is different from marriage as a religious institution.'
p22263
aS'the religious institution of marriage does not convey legal privilege.'
p22264
aS'due to the non establishment clause, the government should have a purely secular view.'
p22265
aS'due to the protections from discrimination, and the equal protection under the law parts of our system, the governments hands are almost tied.'
p22266
aS"the way in which you limit polygamy is by saying 'you can be married to whoever and how many of whoever you want, but we as a secular institution will only grant the tax and legal privileges to two people in one family group."
p22267
aS"' that is solely based on taxes and legal privileges (such as medical decisions in the case of emergency, only one person can have ultimate say etc)."
p22268
aS'and that clearly limits a state marriage to two people.'
p22269
aS'i dont think you will convince me that a state should be able to prosecute a person because of who they choose to live with.'
p22270
aS'prosecution based on cohabitation with multiple people is the direct part of the law which was declared unconsitutional.'
p22271

p22272
aS'thats utterly ridiculous.'

p22335
aS'so, no.'
p22336
aS'its not.'
p22337
aS'And so is rape'
p22338
aS'i disagree.'
p22339
aS'i do not believe rape is limited to only interaction with ones own species.'
p22340
aS'observations of sexual activity in primates (orangutans)shows forceful sexual activity after a new male gains primacy.'
p22341
aS'it also shows that these males kill the children of females in the tribe in order to bring on a mating heat to ensure its his children which propagate the tribe.'
p22342
aS'because complex sexual interactions are apparent in many other species, and sexual violence, it can be inferred that if an animal is unwilling to copulate and is forced to do so, it can be considered rape.'
p22343
aS'that is in fact the definition of rape.'
p22344
aS'according to the courts, when a person is passed out and unable to consent, sexual activity can be considered a rape, prominent example is date rape.'
p22345
aS'because there is no shared language, there is no communication of consent, and because sexual violence exists in the animal kingdom and has been observed, rape can happen in an interspecies manner.'
p22346
aS'the literal definition of cannibalism is eating ones own species.'
p22347
aS'rape is defined as forced sexual interaction.'
p22348
aS"I guess the point I was trying to convey was that consent isn't relevent when assessing whether bestiality is.moral unless you.reject abusing animals completely."
p22349
aS"Some animals probably ellicit pleasure from sex with humans,.they certainly don't from being eaten"
p22350
aS'eating an animal is a necessary part of our life.'
p22351
aS'even then there are those that do claim it is immoral or unethical.'
p22352
aS'i feel like the entire purpose of this conversation has been lost.'
p22353
aS'it was about the utah polygamy law which was struck down because you cant prosecute someone just because of who they lived with.'
p22354
aS'i feel like there has been enough exploration on why federal marriage law needs to be different from religious law as the government is a secular entity.'
p22355
aS'and because of that the legal advantages given by a marriage license, and the non discrimination laws determine the government must give equal protection under the law to homosexuals.'
p22356
aS'in addition i provided an acceptable way in which to limit the legal advantages, thereby outlawing bigamy through a non religious approach.'
p22357
aS'then came the comparison of homosexuality and bestiality on your part, or at least the implication of a comparison.'
p22358
aS'again, i responded in a reasonable fashion.'
p22359
aS'this conversation has gotten far off the beaten track and you are now claiming that animals gain pleasure from sex with humans (probably).'

aS'a 17 year old and a passed out 14 year old have sex.'
p22361
aS'the 14 year old could possibly find enjoyment in the act.'
p22362
aS'it is still rape.'
p22363
aS'in two ways, statutory and inability to give consent.'
p22364
aS'consent, or the ability to consent, in an estimation of morality is relevant as i began the premise of consent being the basis for whether sexual activity between two people, homosexual or heterosexual, being necessary to determine morality and then extrapolated that to bestiality.'
p22365
aS'so, consent is a measure of morality in that framework, the framework you originally accepted at the beginning of this tangent.'
p22366
aS'i feel like this has been a very long conversation, in which you have switched angles several times, without acknowledging why you decide to suddenly shift to a different tangent.'
p22367
aS'because of that, and because i feel like you now know my views to a sufficient detail, i believe this conversation has run its natural course.'

p26592
aS'Are you saying that the majority of crime is committed by black men (which I suspect is what you mean with your somewhat cryptic "6%") because of initiatives like affirmative action?'

aS'No, not as simple as affirmative action = crime.'

aS"Look at all the ways they're explicitly telling me that I'm different because of my skin color."
p26621
aS'" A really exaggerated version of this is the Native American community.'

aS'And while the relationship between black Americans and white Americans is different, in a lot of ways in echoes the relationship between Native Americans and white Americans.'
p26624
aS"Both peoples were displaced and/or had horrible injustices done to them, but I just don't think the best way to create a homogenous community is to continually draw these ethic and racial divides between us, especially when I just don't think it's necessary anymore."
p26625
aS"Anyway, not trying to belittle your intentions or those of your party, but to me it just makes sense that if we want to break down racial barriers, the best way to do that is to provide social programs that don't necessarily focus on race or ethnicity, but apply more to socioeconomic status, for instance."
p26626
aS"I guess I think you're looking at cause-and-effect a little backwards here."
p26627
aS'Do you suppose Native Americans receive more scholarships and assistance BECAUSE they are worse off, or do you think they are worse off because they receive assistance?'

aS"This isn't the chicken and the egg, we know which one came first."
p26629
aS"I don't presume that I'll convert you, but you seem pretty reasonable, so I'll just explain my position on this a little more."
p26630
aS'Racism isn\'t something that "ends;" across cultures, throughout history, humans have a well-documented tendency to "other" people-- that is, to label someone as different and therefore wrong.'
p26631
aS"It's not hard to figure out why this tendency was evolutionarily beneficial at an earlier stage of our development."
p26632
aS"It's not something we just stop doing; we must be vigilant against this subconscious impulse."
p26633
aS"And by the way, affirmative action is pretty poorly understood by a lot of its critics; I don't want a less-qualified person to get a job just because of their race, but when two people with EQUAL qualifications apply for a job then I think it's fair to consider the benefits of expanding corporate diversity, for example."
p26634
aS'AND I think we should offer assistance to make sure that those who are willing to work for it EARN those qualifications so that they are competitive in the job market.'
p26635
aS"So couple of things real quick, then I gotta get back to work (I'll read your response, I just might not respond to it, no offense or anything, I've just gotten into days-long debates before and they can be exhausting)."

aS'The chicken and the egg thing.'
p26637
aS'Lets talk about the Native Americans.'
p26638
aS'Our current relationship with the tribes is incredibly complicated and is different than any other ethnic group.'
p26639
aS'We essentially have around 800 treaties with sovereign nations that exist somewhat symbiotically within America.'
p26640
aS'However, they\'re tribal areas are what\'s known as "domestic dependent nations" which essentially renders them powerless, as long as they exist outside our domestic borders.'
p26641
aS"Consequently, the federal government's influence and jurisdiction into tribal affairs is murky at best."
p26642
aS'And without legal ramifications for their actions, and as any member of the tribes will tell you (there have been some AMAs over the years), corruption among the elders is rampant.'
p26643
aS'And this is where I make my point: The Native Americans have refused to assimilate into American culture.'
p26644
aS'And maybe for good reason.'
p26645
aS"And maybe it's the noble thing to do considering how poorly we treated them, but it also disconnects them from a society that has strict laws, protection from fraud (even though it's not perfect), clear and transparent elections (again, maybe not perfect), access to good education (again..), and upward mobility \xe2\x80\x94 all the tenets which Conservatives hold dear."
p26646
aS'So, these social programs, to a lesser extent mind you, but still significant, allow minorities to essentially act as a "sovereign nation.'
p26647
aS'" And as long as they exist, they draw a clear line between whites and minorities, which says "our relationship with you is murky at best.'
p26648
aS'" \n\nAs for affirmative action and corporate diversity, I\'m all for that.'
p26649
aS"With two identical candidates, maybe the one who historically hasn't had a presence at a college or in an industry should get preference."

p26657
aS"That's free-market capitalism."
p26658

p26892
aS'There have been very prominent anti-women cases, e.g.'
p26893
aS'Rep. Terry Richards(GA) with a bill forcing women to carry still-born fetuses to term like cows, Rep.

Pierce(AZ) with the illegal women came here to breed and drop a child, Akin with the legitimate rape comment.'
p26894
aS'It seems like there is a vocal group that believe women are sub-human (i.e.'
p26895
aS'like domesticated animals such as cows or pigs) and therefore we can infringe on privacy and rights of the women because they are not people. '

aS'Those... those are crazy.'

aS'Thanks for letting me know that those initiatives ever existed.'
p26898
aS"I've never really been on the same plane as many conservatives with regards to abortion and the like (I don't approve if you don't have a good reason but if you do, then I'm not going to stop you) but those are just insane."

aS'Does the government violate the rights of lawyers and judges in order to provide us the rest of us with due process and legal defense?'
p27841
aS'Of course not.'
p27842
aS"So why can't rights to healthcare, education, and housing be fulfilled the same way?"
p27843
aS"Also let's make a clear distinction about two different kind of rights here."
p27844
aS"We all have the right to having a house, it's a right to be able to have a house."
p27845
aS'What the socialists have equivocated, and the rest of the people seem to have accepted over time, is that such rights are not rights of the "to be able to" kind but rights of the "you ought to" kind.'
p27846
aS'Then they get to things like that everyone oughts to be made happy by the State, instead of being free to pursue happiness, and so on.'
p27847
aS'I think that to be clear against the revisionists those kind of things could be defined as obligations only.'
p27848
aS'Instead of right to live you have everyone being obligated not to murder, or instead of the right to pursue happiness you get the obligation of the State to no interfere into private affairs and limit itself to govern, and so on.'
p27849
aS'While maybe this has some flaws, I think this would cut that kind of purposefully deceitful argumentation the socialists love either because of indoctrination in this ignorance or who knows why.'
p27850
aS"Doesn't the death penalty kinda violate my right to live though? "
p27851
aS'Nope.'

aS'If you commit a crime worthy of the death penalty, you willingly surrender your right to life.'
p27853
aS"Let's pretend, for the sake of argument, the law of the state of California states that speeding is a capital offense."
p27854
aS'Do I deserve to die because I went 60 in a 55 today?'
p27855
aS'The point of my question is: who gets to decide what a capital crime is? '
p27856
aS'That is protected from in the 8th Amendment.'
p27857
aS'No cruel and unusual punishment.'
p27858
aS'To answer the specific question: state legislators decide what a capital crime is.'
p27859
aS'The Supreme Court determines if it violates the Constitution.'
p27860
aS"I think it's cruel and unusual for the state to murder a man who killed someone."
p27861
aS'Is my definition of cruel and unusual wrong?'
p27862
aS'People have been put to death recently for crimes such as robbery and kidnapping.'
p27863
aS"I guess the 8th amendment didn't help them there, eh?"
p27864
aS"Suppose the Supreme Court says that execution for speeding isn't cruel?"
p27865
aS'Capital punishment is simply a way that the state imposes its will over the people.'
p27866
aS'It is a "power" that limits my constitutional right to life. '
p27867
aS'So this murder is okay because why?'
p27868
aS'Because 8 people [of a jury] said so?'
p27869
aS'But the murder of a fetus which may or may not be a human life is wrong?'
p27870
aS'Do you see the inconsistency here?\n'
p27871
aS'Yeah because the fetus is guilty of being the patriarchal means oppressing the woman and obviously deserves to die for that.^/s\n\nLearn words.'
p27872
aS"Murder means it's *unlawful* killing of a human by another one."
p27873
aS'Murder and kill are not synonyms.'
p27874
aS'The fetus is not guilty of anything but as the US laws are currently written a fetus is not a human so from your words abortion is not murder.'
p27875
aS'If you want to argue that killing is wrong at least be consistent.'
p27876
aS"And if you don't want to see death penalty versus abortion how about war killing of civilians versus abortion?"
p27877
aS'Killing murderers is good.'
p27878
aS"I don't get why abortion was brought here at all, sorry."
p27879

aS'Killing criminals = good but Killing unborn fetuses = very bad.'
p27882
aS'Left:\n1.'

p27884
aS"If I was in r/liberal I'd be having the same argument just the inverse."
p27885
aS"I think I get it, but the problem with your argument is that killing has no inherent moral value attached to it, it's amoral."
p27886
aS'Murder, that is, a human killing of another human whom does not deserve to be killed, does have a negative moral value.'
p27887
aS"It's the same for freedom, removing a person's freedom is not immoral per se."
p27888
aS"That's why we have prisons, because we believe some people should be constrained against their will."
p27889
aS"I agree the way some of those concepts are put forward sometimes give the impression that freedom cannot be violated no matter what, or that a human life should be preserved no matter what, but that's a simplistic view."
p27890
aS'Even in documents like the U.S. Bill of Rights, the [French Declaration of the Rights of Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen), where it is spoken of rights as inalienable/sacred/intrinsic, it is granted that one could "lose" those rights by guilt.'
p27891

aS"Is 'more murder' by executing them\n\nAgree with you on abortion thoughts in theory however I suspect we disagree on when a fetus becomes a life that has a right to live."

p27909
aS'It starts as a fertilized cell that nobody will name or care if it ends up in the toilet or the trash, and ends as a laughing, crying little baby.'
p27910
aS'So at one end, we have a 0% human, whose right to life is clearly outweighed by the mothers personal freedoms, and the other, we have a 99% human, whose life is, quite temporarily, more important than the mothers personal freedoms.'
p27911
aS'Basically, imo the fetus *always* has the right to live.'
p27912
aS"But that right doesn't outweigh personal liberty until... honestly I have no idea."
p27913
aS'Its really just impossible to quantify such things.'
p27914
aS'I just know that at some point I start to get really uncomfortable with the idea.'

p27919
aS'I can agree there.'
p27920
aS"I would like to add I believe often times the people who feel that an abortion is their best option get to that point long before say the 3rd tri-mester so it's usually not about the mother's personal freedom vs the life of the fetus."

p27933
aS'Initially, the animal can take care of itself.'
p27934
aS'But the prospect of free food is nice, as hunting is unpredictable and hard, and the shelter is warm, etc.'

aS'etc.'
p27936
aS"Eventually the animal loses it's wild spirit, and would not survive if released back into the wild."
p27937
aS"It's survival now depends on the zookeeper."
p27938
aS'But the animal is happy because the zookeeper is good and life is easy.'
p27939
aS'Well one day the zookeeper is replaced by a evil/incompetent person, runs out of money, or something of the like.'
p27940
aS'The zookeeper may start beating some animals, forgetting to feed some, cannot afford to feed some, treat some better/worse, and/or etc.'
p27941
aS'The point is that liberals are that really nice zookeeper.'
p27942
aS'To extend metaphor, Conservatives generally believe in a safety net, which would be the equivalent of a wildlife rehabilitator.'
p27943
aS'When an animal is hurt the wildlife rehabilitator gives them care until they can take of themselves.'
p27944
aS'Sometimes the animal is too hurt, and will be taken care of for life if possible.'
p27945
aS'Libertarians believe a safety net can lead to moral hazard, and would ignore the animals.'
p27946
aS'But they believe other animals would naturally provide this safety net.'
p27947
aS'Nope, Nope nope nope nope, I think ya got some things backwards there or your muddling Liberal and Conservative... because Liberals would continue to give progressively changing safety nets until the net is needed no more.'
p27948
aS'Metaphor.'
p27949
aS'Its like a group of tight rope walkers tethered together who need a literal net while they practice (go forward in life, making mistakes along the way while being attached to everyone around you).'
p27950
aS'It may take a year or two before all of them can walk across that tight rope without a net and without falling or being pushed back to start over with the same things you had before (buying a house without a loan, getting affordable healthcare, not being imprisoned for living how you want to live, equality so some are not left behind).'
p27951
aS'But, once they are good enough to walk alone and can all make it.'
p27952
aS'Not just splinter groups because you are all tied together.'
p27953
aS"Only then can you remove the net or have a new harness so you don't fall as far each time, because the people (all of them) are able to walk across(being in good health, having stable jobs, a house, food and transportation)."
p27954
aS"And not just one leader with a big fat never breaking safety harness on to drag them all back up after they've undoubtedly fallen without hitting rock bottom."
p27955
aS'(i.e Big Banks, corporations) Conservatives DO NOT believe in a safety net, they believe in survival of the fittest.'
p27956
aS"And if you fall, well too bad for you, you shouldn't have sucked at walking."
p27957
aS"They would cut the tether so they wouldn't go with the ones falling."
p27958
aS'But they will bail you out one they notice your group is important to the ringmasters that they all support, no matter if they are bullies, steal, kill and lie as long as everything goes back to how it was, minus being attached to everyone.'
p27959
aS'Liberals believe in helping and reforming broken archaic policies and loopholes (like the ability to cut the cord, and that you HAVE to walk this rope in the first place), getting rid of segregation and creating a level playing field for everyone.'
p27960
aS"Living in facts and not faiths, acting on realizations and issues not supporting some divine intervention and throwing money at it, asking friends and family/communities to pitch in so everyone in the vicinity is helped instead of putting your faith in select groups or individuals who's self interests only help a select few."
p27961
aS'Liberals push boundaries so they know where we can go, they open doors that have ideas and information on the other side both good and bad.'
p27962
aS"Conservatives find things that work for certain periods of time, no matter what happens, preservation of everything, well besides the environment because we won't be here when it blows up in our faces."

p27964
aS'We need both have a functioning society.'

p27967
aS"We need people pushing boundaries or we don't grow."
p27968
aS'With time change they get better and that net can shrink, eventually everyone ends up making it or no one makes it.'
p27969
aS'Conservatives may not fight to keep that last bit of net because it helps Liberals, but they realize that if they are constantly walking this rope they may need it.'
p27970
aS'Libs may take it for granted or use it as a tool, either way they also have been looking forward and voicing another way to cross the rope instead of walking it.'
p27971
aS"You don't need to change the government to help people, give stuff to them or whatever you think may help them."
p27972
aS"If you're waiting for the Government for that then you're an hypocrite."
p27973
aS"To give it's a personal freedom you already have."
p27974
aS'On the other hand a Government that is just treats everyone equally (yay equality) and does not discriminate based upon whether you are rich or poor, like socialist policies obligate it to.'
p27975
aS'The Government does not have the right to treat people differently.'
p27976
aS'Socialism makes the Government unjust while at the same times tries to conveniently redefine what justice means: War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.'

aS"I disagree with a lot of that...but I don't have time to respond to it all now."
p27978
aS'Do you understand the effect of always having a big safety net will have on your ability to tightrope?'
p27979
aS'Conservatives do believe in a safety net, just a much smaller one, while libertarians do not want one.'
p27980
aS'However, all these groups believe deeply that charities and churches help the poor better, and donate their time and money to these groups.'
p27981
aS'The bailout is part of the reason the tea party was created, as the Republicans did not act conservative at all.'
p27982
aS'Segregation - no Conservative supports this.'
p27983

p27984
aS'Asking your friends/community to pitch in is very different then voting for higher taxes, as taxes are taken by force. '
p27985
aS'Honest question here,\n\nWhat happens when charity is gone (Either through disinterest, prejudice, unavailability, etc.'
p27986
aS'etc.)?'
p27987
aS"Is it still the person's responsibility to find charity or does it move onto the government?"
p27988
aS'If charities are better for the poor would you support government subsidies of charities, or government established charities provided that they were managed by an independent third party with no intention of profit? '
p27989
aS'I have not studied charity that much, but to comment on your question, government services decrease (crowd out) charities, and therefore reduce the charities available.'
p27990
aS'That being said, I assume people would still fall through the cracks so I do not know the answer.'
p27991
aS'Traditionally religious institutions and other groups took this role.'
p27992
aS'Charities are actually already subsidized by the Government as they are tax deductible.'
p27993
aS'Also, there are indeed government funded (not run) services, such as group homes.'
p27994
aS"By definition charities cannot make a profit, a hospital isn't charity unless donations are subsidzing/paying for the service."
p27995
aS'I do believe charities should have the equivalent intention of profit, which is highest value per dollar spent.'
p27996
aS'There are many services that rank charities based on how much money actually goes to the cause, and how well that money is spent.'
p27997
aS'Yeah I forgot that tax deductibles are considered subsidies.'
p27998
aS"However I meant direct subsidies in my question but I'll accept that, since it is already a system in place."
p27999
aS'I will take exception to the statement that charities do not make profit.'
p28000
aS'They may not make profit for the actual organization but many of the organizers and executives of charities can have high salaries, with the defense being that charities need to pay well to get quality workers.'
p28001
aS"It's something I find distasteful but it is how it is."
p28002
aS'I do like your definition of how a profit for a charity should work though.'
p28003
aS"Thanks for putting up with my questions, it's been informative and interesting. "
p28004
aS'I always say there is nothing inherently better about private organizations.'
p28005
aS'There are public services that are just as good, if not better than the private ones (though they tend to have unfair advantages).'
p28006
aS'The reason they are better is that if a private company is bad, like the charity stealing money, it fails, while the public one usually gets more money.'
p28007
aS'Also, you can choose in the private sector, so you can support the best and leave the worse, but you are stuck in the public sector. '

aS'And sodomy.'
p28010
aS"Talking to the prisoners and felons, forced sodomy isn't that common in prisons (my brother is serving time in a medium security state prison)\n\nNow, people want to get their rocks off so they have sex with each other."
p28011
aS'However, as prisoners cannot give consent to sex as they are held in loco parentis by the state, all sex is counted as rape.'
p28012
aS"So while prison rape is a bad things in general, unwilling sex isn't as prevalent as the lay person thinks."
p28013

p28120
aS'Well, I think both gay and straight couples should have the right to federal benefits that come with marriage.'
p28121
aS'I think the federal government should grant everyone civil unions and let churches decide who can be married.'
p28122
aS'But failing that, gay marriage should be a state issue.'
p28123
aS"And I'd say the federal government should give benefits to those couples who are married under whatever state law they fall under."

p28136
aS'I think the Supreme Court will ultimately decided this.'
p28137

p28138
aS"Yeah, I truly don't understand the position that it should be left up to the states."
p28139
aS"Should we have left segregation or women's rights up to the states?"
p28140
aS'You you hit it exactly right, mob rule cannot vote away inalienable rights.'
p28141
aS'But should we override the constitution to protect people from their state governments? '

p28144
aS"That's what amendments are..."
p28145
aS'I was thinking of judicial activism.  '
p28146
aS'There is an inalienable right to have the federal government recognize your marriage?'
p28147
aS'This not a correct argument, because the law does not say gay people cannot marry, the law say straight and gay people can equally marry someone of the other sex.'
p28148
aS'Sorry, maybe I am thick.'
p28149
aS'Does it also mean the government cannot ban bigamy or marrying minors or close relatives?'
p28150
aS"But see, the way I see this, this isn't applying rights equally across all marriages."
p28151
aS'This is altering the definition of marriage, THEN saying all rights must apply equally to them.'
p28152
aS"To me that's not the way it should be done."
p28153
aS'I also find it odd that marriage is apparently a requirement for personal fulfillment.'
p28154
aS"The constitution doesn't say anywhere what marriage is, or anything related to it."
p28155
aS'Though honestly, I would prefer at this point that "marriage" be done away with altogether as a legal institution, replaced with civil unions for everyone.'
p28156
aS"That way there won't be a redefinition of marriage, which is what gets people prickly in the first place."

aS'I have seen acceptance of homosexuality more common in some cultures than others, but I have not seen any study indicating homosexuality itself is more or less common.'

p28172

aS"It's uncalled-for."
p28198
aS'Not a "choice" man, get with it.'
p28199
aS'While I do believe there are people who are gay without choice as it is mostly a psychological or hormonal imbalance, I do also believe that there are people affected by society, personal experiences, coupled with the rise of acceptance and curiosity that does make it in fact a choice.'
p28200
aS"Hell, I've known so many people who have switched back and forth between homosexual and heterosexual lifestyles."
p28201
aS"If it wasn't a choice, they wouldn't."
p28202
aS'Choosing who you sleep with and choosing who you find attractive are not the same thing.'
p28203
aS'Nobody choses to find men or women or both attractive, they just do.'
p28204
aS'The decision they make is whether to act on that attraction or not.'
p28205
aS'Also, we moved beyond the "homosexuality is an illness" nonsense decades ago.'
p28206
aS"It's time to put that argument to rest."
p28207
aS'Then what causes it?'
p28208
aS'Scientifically speaking.'
p28209
aS"Correct me if I'm wrong but I never said it was an illness."
p28210
aS"There's something I've learned about other people that might help you understand this, as given my orientation and my understanding of other people's orientations I didn't get it at first: The people humans are attracted to is a spectrum, it's not just gay or straight."
p28211
aS"Sure, a lot of the population is just straight, and of those that aren't, a lot are just gay, but there are people that are inbetween."
p28212
aS'Using just reddit as as example, most male users would identify as straight, but many seem to find NPH attractive.'
p28213
aS'Given that, I would guess that a lot of people that "switch" seem to just be trying to figure out what they are.'
p28214
aS"Just because you are attracted to someone, doesn't necessarily mean you would sleep with them or enter a committed relationship with them."
p28215
aS"Also, don't mistake the influence of chemistry or society as a choice."
p28216
aS"Various factors may have influence on where in the spectrum a person's sexuality ends up, but then that's who they are."
p28217
aS"I think you're confusing outside forces defining that sexuality with personal choice."
p28218
aS"Think of it this way: just because you're heterosexual doesn't mean you can fall in love with just any woman; a person's personality and qualities are important too."
p28219
aS"Just because a person has been in love with a man in the past doesn't mean they can never fall in love with a woman."
p28220
aS"Maybe you would never consider the option that your best friend and life partner might just share your gender, but it's a pretty meaningless thing to exclude half the dating pool with if you enjoy the dynamics of either relationship."
p28221
aS'There are amazing people of either gender out there, and mutual attraction is a rare and sometimes very special thing.'
p28222
aS"I prefer to be in relationships with men but I've fallen for girls before."
p28223
aS"They're all just people."
p28224
aS"I've told this time and time again to many people."
p28225
aS'Hetero and Homo are sexual preferences...*sexual* preferences.'
p28226
aS'The idea behind the LBGT community is not about love, it never has been.'
p28227
aS"It's a facade created to instill pity in the side who opposes."
p28228

p28229
aS'For example, I love my mom.'
p28230
aS'I would not have sex with my mom.'

aS"However, that doesn't make it sexual."
p28238
aS'Love and sex are not the same thing.'
p28239
aS"Of course it is a choice, given that everybody can choose to for example live in celibacy - it is a choice to follow one's sexual desires."
p28240
aS"I don't understand the not a choice argument."
p28241
aS'Just because we have a desire, it does not mean we have no choice over following it.'
p28242
aS'So what is the argument in it?'
p28243
aS'Logically, liberals should argue that it is not a **bad** choice to follow this types of desires.'
p28244
aS'But to argue it is not a choice at all is entirely fallacious.'
p28245
aS'And dangerous, because basically it paints human natures as if everybody is just a slave to his desires.'
p28246
aS'What a person chooses to do with their life is a choice, but who they **are** is not a choice.'
p28247
aS"Humans can choose to not act on their desires, but it doesn't change the fact that those are their desires."
p28248
aS"And unlike the negative human desires that we outlaw, being gay doesn't infringe on anyone else's freedoms or rights."
p28249
aS'And what exactly are you suggesting a gay person does then, anyway?'
p28250
aS'Never have a relationship with anyone?'
p28251
aS'Have a relationship with someone of the opposite sex despite it being a sham?'
p28252
aS'What reason is there to not afford them the same rights straight people have throughout the country?'

aS'Gay rights are not an issue, no need to make special laws for special groups.'
p28255
aS'You are right, there should be no special laws.'
p28256
aS'The laws should simply include gay people.'
p28257
aS"That's why it is a civil rights issue"
p28258

aS'Marriage is a religious sacrament the government should not be performing them.'
p28260

aS"Under a state's rights government, that's the kind of decision you'd have to make. "

aS"Out of curiosity, did you also support the Obama DOJ's rejection of DOMA? "

aS"I don't like to make snap judgments on issues like this."
p28268
aS'I can see both sides.'
p28269
aS'I did, I have no idea where congress got the idea that it can decide to regulate a matter between a state marriage license and two people who are in the same state.'
p28270
aS"I'm much more amenable to an approach that removes government from marriage entirely."
p28271
aS'As long as marriage is rewarded with civic benefits and tax breaks, government is involved in the definition of marriage.'
p28272
aS'If there were no civic benefits to being married, opposing gay marriage would be an issue of pure religious freedom.'
p28273
aS"Under any system in which married people are entitled to benefits that the unmarried aren't, excluding gays from marriage will require a justification for awarding benefits that gays cannot access."
p28274
aS'Get government out of marriage?'
p28275
aS'Get rid of the civic and legal benefits of marriage, and then no one will give a damn how you define it.'
p28276

p28277
aS'First time here, I consider myself strong leaning libertarian.'
p28278
aS"Marijuania laws are certainly a state right issue, I don't think gay marriage is."
p28279
aS"I believe gay marriage is a first admentment issue, telling two consenting adults they can't marry is a violation of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
p28280
aS'And if you can vote to ban gay marriage, why not have ballot measure to ban certain type of free speach or certain types of religious liberties?'

p28285
aS'Jeffersonian-Democracy began with Thomas Jefferson.'

aS"It isn't very popular now-a-days, but I still like it."
p28287
aS'Of course, Jefferson was 200+ years ago, and times have *slightly* changed since then and therefore some things about Jeffersonian-Democracy have changed, [like how Great Britain totally sucks and France is full of the best people in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffersonian_Democracy#Core_ideals).'

aS'Among my views are:\n\n* The yeoman farmer should be central to a republic.'

aS'An agrarian society is superior to an industrialized one\n\n* Following from that, urbanization and industrialization lessen the freedom of the individual by (unintentionally) making people rely on others to earn their living\n\n* Power should be as locally as possible.'

aS'Maybe "localism" is the right word for that, but that word doesn\'t carry with it the sense of what power goes where\n\n* For the federal government, strict constitutionalism'

aS'I seen to recall that before it was outlawed, hemp was bigger than cotton.'

aS'I was reminded of the absurdity of this situation in the Fall of 2010.'
p28371
aS"Two things were in the news... Arizona was being told that just because Federal law said that suspected illegal immigrants could be stopped and carded, they couldn't actually stop and card suspected illegal immigrants."
p28372
aS"And California voters were told by the DoJ that just because their state might legalise marijuana, that didn't mean the Federal gov't was going to let them go about actually obeying their own state's law."
p28373
aS"I especially found it ironic that the same people screaming about how the state couldn't make its own immigration laws were saying the Feds couldn't tell the state how to make its own laws."

p28379
aS'that doesn\'t mean that federal laws "allow" you to rob people.'
p28380
aS'Right.'

p28382
aS"I'm next to next to positive the same thing will happen in Colorado."
p28383
aS"... that's because there are still federal laws against the production, sale, and consumption of marijuana."
p28384
aS'Whatever state laws California does or does not have in regard to marijuana are pretty much irrelevant to the enforcement activities of federal agents enforcing federal laws.'
p28385
aS'Exactly.'
p28386
aS"I think we're in agreement, actually, unless I'm missing something."
p28387
aS"This is different though because there's a much broader scope of people affected (so virtually every citizen of the state now has standing to sue rather than a few med mary j distributors)."
p28388
aS'I hope.'
p28389
aS"I haven't heard any statements from the DoJ about it... but they threatened to do just that in California."
p28390
aS"Personally, I can't stand the stuff, but I like the War On Drugs (tm) even less."
p28391
aS"No, but it could result in a significant legal challenge if someone feels that the Federal government is overstepping it's bounds by trying to regulate a state legalized controlled substance."

aS'If a majority of a state wants to allow gay marriage, then by all means. '
p28612
aS'It just depends on whether you see marriage as something that the constitution guarantees for all citizens.'
p28613
aS"The Supreme Court held that bans on interracial marriage faced this exact problem: it was a right guaranteed to all citizens, and that they couldn't discriminate based on race (which is a protected class)."
p28614
aS'The problem is that homosexuals are not currently recognized by the Court as a protected class, so any challenge to these laws would require the court to change that status, or to find them invalid under rational basis review. '

aS'[Interracial marriage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States), for instance, was legal on a state level in several states before the federal law was made, but there are still many states that held onto such discrimination until only 45 years ago.'
p28618
aS"I don't think anyone would suggest that be something that states could outlaw just because they really wanted to, and the same applies here."
p28619
aS'What if a state decided to ban only straight people from getting married, and wanted to only allow gay people to get married?'
p28620
aS'Would you feel that represented the intentions of the constitution or would you feel that "if the majority wants it, it\'s fine"?'
p28621
aS"At one point, the majority didn't want black people to have equal rights either, remember?"
p28622
aS'I see your point, but a *lot* of people see banning gay marriage as a form of discrimination.'
p28623
aS'Since race and sexual orientation are both things you are born with, a lot of people see banning same sex marriage as equivalent to banning African-American or interracial marriage.'
p28624
aS'You might not see it that way, but thats how a lot of people feel about it.'
p28625
aS"Besides, gay marriage never hurt anybody, and it doesn't impose anything on religions or churches (even if gay marriage is legalized, churches can refuse to marry gay people)."
p28626
aS'That is why people want it to be a national issue.'
p28627
aS"Allowing states to ban gay marriage by popular vote is discrimination, because it's basically Group A not allowing Group B to do something that Group A does, simply because Group A doesn't really care for Group B."
p28628
aS'Born with is up in the air.'
p28629
aS'I could (as a straight man) engage in a relationship with another male as a choice and there would be no difference.'
p28630
aS"So if it can't be distinguished from a choice, there is no objective metric."
p28631
aS"If you then say that an action can be classified as a protected class you'd have a legal nightmare."
p28632
aS"The organizational way to make this exemption that doesn't undermine your law is to ammend the constitution to make it a protected class in the same way religion is."
p28633
aS'I would support that without a problem.'
p28634
aS'\nBut there is a lot of evidence that it is *not* a choice.'
p28635
aS'[Numerous medical agencies and psychologists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=LYMjXucTFaM#t=222s) have stated that sexual orientation is *not* a choice, and research has revealed evidence of genetics being involved in sexual orientation (for example, if one person in a set of identical twins is gay, there is a 50-70% chance that the other twin will be gay too.'
p28636
aS'If genes played no role in sexual orientation, the chance that both twins are gay would be drastically lower.'
p28637
aS')\n\nI\'m straight, and I don\'t see how I could ever just "decide" to never think women are attractive ever again and suddenly find men attractive.'
p28638
aS"&gt; If you then say that an action can be classified as a protected class you'd have a legal nightmare."
p28639
aS'I understand what you mean by "protected class", but why would it be a "legal nightmare" to let anybody marry whoever they want?'
p28640
aS'To really drive your point home, if genes had no role at ALL in sexual orientation, the chance of two (identical) twins being gay would be expected to be approximately 1%.'
p28641
aS'However, being raised at the same time, often through the same activities and groups, by the same people may be just as important of a factor.'
p28642
aS'Twins are an interesting point, but it ventures into that correlation vs. causation idea.'
p28643
aS'It could be a sign that genes make people gay, or it could be a sign that parents/circumstances do.'
p28644
aS"I'd also like to point out, in response to the poster you're replying to, that being gay *isn't* an action, just like being straight isn't."
p28645
aS"You aren't straight *only* when you go home and have sex with your wife."
p28646
aS"People aren't gay only when they decide to engage in sexual activity."
p28647
aS"That isn't how sexual orientation works..."
p28648
aS"I'm straight, but I've been around so many people of so many orientations that this is something that's fairly obvious to me now."
p28649
aS'&gt;However, being raised at the same time, often through the same activities and groups, by the same people may be just as important of a factory.'
p28650
aS"True, I'm sure how they are raised certainly plays a roll in it as well, but this 50-70% chance isn't present in Fraternal Twins; only in identical twins, indicating that genes *definitely* play some sort of roll."
p28651
aS'Did they control for gender as well?'
p28652
aS"For instance, fraternal twins of opposite genders wouldn't participate in as many of the same activities or groups, although you would expect to see some increase."
p28653
aS'I agree, it certainly seems genes play an important role.'
p28654
aS"It's likely that circumstance and upbringing also play a role."
p28655
aS'I understand your point about sexual-orientation, but the point has to be made that homosexual acts are still a choice.'
p28656
aS"Therefore, you can't say that the government is discriminating against people with a specific sexual orientation because that isn't true."
p28657
aS'The barrier is met when a person makes a specific choice to pursue specific actions.'
p28658
aS'On the other hand, with the example of interracial marriage, those individuals were being discriminated against not on the basis of action but specifically because they were born black.'
p28659
aS"So, what I'm saying is that being born a specific sexual orientation does not force you into specific actions."
p28660
aS'The idea of a ban on same-sex marriage is non-discriminatory because someone who is oriented towards homosexuality is still capable of marrying.'
p28661
aS"It's when they choose to direct that marriage towards a member of the same sex that it becomes something the state can deny."
p28662
aS'If you had two men, one who has had sex with 10 guys and one who has not, can you tell if one is gay or not?'
p28663
aS'No.'
p28664
aS"So, actions don't dictate orientation."
p28665
aS"Therefore, you aren't discriminating against orientation by denying the choice of certain actions."
p28666
aS"Okay... but if it's the action and not the orientation that's being discriminated against, then there's SCOTUS rulings which prevent discriminations of this kind, notably in relation to sodomy."
p28667
aS'The legal nightmare comes in the fact that a perceived class can always be argued as a protected class if there is precedent and genetic correlation.'
p28668
aS'This encompasses a lot of different groups. '
p28669
aS'I\'m not sure where you\'re getting "50-70% chance" in regards to identical twins sharing sexual orientation from.'
p28670
aS'My Biological Psychology textbook that gets its source from a Bailey and Pillard study states that 52% monozygotic twins were homosexual and 22% dizygotic twins were (for males).'
p28671
aS'For females it was like 4% points lower with respect to each set of twins.'
p28672
aS"I don't think 50% is a good enough percentage to warrant ANYTHING conclusive."

aS'I digress.'
p28675
aS'I think people should be allowed to marry whoever they want, but with the huge amount of turmoil over this subject I think that state by state is a nice way to take it for now.'
p28676
aS'I also think we should definitely focus on the economy more and less on these social issues.'
p28677
aS'Not that it would ever happen, but hypothetically, if a state wanted to ban marriage altogether and invalidate all its previous marriages, would that be acceptable and something good to let them do if they wanted?'
p28678
aS'An interesting question, because the court has said that the ability to marry is a fundamental right.'
p28679
aS'From Zablocki v. Redhail:\n\n&gt; prior and subsequent decisions of this Court confirm that the right to marry is of fundamental importance for all individuals.... '

p28690
aS'You are absolutely right.'
p28691
aS'That was not a good articulation of why state rights are important, nor of why marriage should be a state right issue.'
p28692
aS'State rights--and not just state rights, *per se*, but really the concentration of power in local governments like cities and counties--give people a greater voice in the political process.'
p28693
aS'It is much easier for an individual or a group, even (or especially) a small minority group, to fight for change and have an impact at their local city hall than at Capitol Hill.'
p28694
aS'And if your local government proves incompetent or unduly burdensome, it is much easier to move to a better city than to move to a different country.'
p28695
aS'Local governments can be much more flexible and can change more quickly, which also allows people to see what works in other cities and adopt it in their own.'
p28696
aS'Adaptation towards better, more efficient government can then occur at a cultural level rather than being forced on unwilling communities by a faraway, detached, impersonal, and largely inaccessible government in Washington, D.C. as a result of the votes of strangers in distant cities.'
p28697
aS'Of course, "state rights" are no excuse for states to try to attract business, for example, by allowing people to dump waste in a river and pollute a neighboring state\'s water supply, just as property rights are no excuse for me to stink up my entire neighborhood by using my backyard as a trash bin.'
p28698
aS'Just as my local government will not allow me to use my own property in a way that damages others, the federal government needs to step in to prevent states from harming one another.'
p28699
aS'Keep in mind, if the states were all small independent nations, there would be no mechanism for dealing with this sort of problem save trade restrictions, treaties, wars, and the like.'
p28700
aS'That is part of the beauty of a federalist system: it removes the necessity of such measures and keeps trade open and free.'
p28701
aS'State rights are also no excuse for local governments to try to deny their citizens basic human rights.'
p28702
aS'Now, a nation with a handful of anti-miscegenist communities is much better than an entirely anti-miscegenist nation, and that is yet another reason for federalism: it is a protection of the tyranny of the national majority when the national majority has not yet recognized a certain evil for what it is.'
p28703
aS'But once the nation has come to recognize something--like "marriage," however you define that term--as a basic human right, it is absolutely appropriate to address that at the national level.'
p28704
aS'But it should be because the nation has come to recognize something as a denial of basic human rights, not because a majority of the nation\'s communities "wants to allow" something and has decided to enforce that preference on other communities.'
p28705
aS'So for gay marriage, the question is whether and in what sense there is a basic human right to certain relational arrangements, how those relational arrangements are defined, and what sort of government action or inaction is or is not a violation of that right.'
p28706
aS'And that, fundamentally, is the nature of the dispute.'

p29466
aS'For instance, there are 17 enumerated powers of Congress under Article I.'
p29467
aS"Without the Bill of Rights' reversal of the power dynamic, Congress would be limited to those 17 functions, because the assumption is that powers not listed are not within their scope."
p29468
aS'"Limited" means subject to limitation, which is a much more powerful government than one of enumerated powers, as the assumption is that powers not expressly forbidden or curtailed are within their scope.'

aS"He spent a year at Stanford in the mid-'60s, a hotbed of likeminded activism, without getting involved in anything of the sort there."
p29919
aS"I will certainly give him credit for the fact that he rushed for one of the few Stanford fraternities that was starting to embrace racial diversity (i.e., they accepted two black members the prior year), and it's nice to think some of his father's qualities rubbed off on him."
p29920
aS"But I could never use information about someone's parent in voting that person into the highest office."
p29921
aS"Mitt's father, moreover, seemed to embrace ideals entirely separate from what Mitt espouses--for instance, the former was pro-civil rights, pro-government housing for the poor and anti-Vietnam (which does somewhat stand in contrast to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s stated positions on what's arguably our modern-day Vietnam, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars)."
