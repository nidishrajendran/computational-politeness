aVIt came up in my front page and I clicked it without reading what subreddit it was from, only right at the end I twigged :D

aVIt's obviously not the first time you've acted the pillock, is it?
p11
aVEdit: hey /u/Alaukik, why so shy about what you wrote all of a sudden?
p12
aVWhat did /u/Alaukik write?
p13
aVFirst I asked him what was confusing about this post and in the second post I asked him if he had ever read satire before.
p14
aVI deleted it because after his reply I realised it came off as quite rude.

p31
aVSoon ukpolitics won't be taking these scot news, unless other stuff doesn't happen
p32
aVThis post as an incredible amount of upvotes for the subreddit....
p33
aVAs for a real answer, for any women in a similar predicament - a lot of medications interfere with mens' sex drives - I mean he's 46 afterall.
p34
aVThe ending cracked me up
p35
aVYou mean the funny bit in the joke was the punchline?
p36
aVAre we playing the blame game here?
p37
aVI think someone didn't read all the way through.
p38
aVCould you try that again but this time make sense?
p39
aVClicked on the link thinking this was /r/unitedkingdom.
p40
aVThen I [checked the comments.
p41
aV](http://i.imgur.com/OGfBeRl.gif)\u000a
p42
aVThere are only two of them and they're only visible because there are no other comments.
p43
aVI think they're downvoted.
p44
aVYeah, you are right.
p45
aVMy problem is that I've been conditioned by SRD to open pretty much every hidden comment chain I find...
p46
aVYou realise that you can change Reddit's settings to never hide comments right?
p47
aVI like it this way.
p48
aVIt's like a festive gift of drama whenever I come across one (so long as it's fun drama, not hate-filled drama!

aVsenorgif.com.
p53
aVIt could be best to counter them with an observation or two of your own.
p54
aVIt might raise the tone a few clicks.
p55
aVI've debated topics like this more than enough in my lifetime!
p56
aVinb4 people with closed minds insisting that "muslims have always been barbarians stop posting this propoganda that conflicts with my existing worldview"
p57
aVMmm, well done.
p58
aVVery much before.
p59
aVI've literally never heard anyone say that about Muslims.
p60
aVTry r/worldnews
p61
aVThen you keep very good company.
p62
aVBut they exist; and lots of them.
p63
aVThey won the European elections in France!
p64
aVAnd while UKIP aren't quite like that they certainly have significant elements of it.
p65
aVThat'd be because you're white and thus fail to notice racism because it's never directed at you.
p66
aVEDIT: whole lot of downvotes from upset white folks
p67
aVHey, you know it's still racial profiling if you've got no idea what racial background I'm from.
p68
aVTwo ignorances don't make an... unignorance.
p69
aVI apologise if that interferes with your worldview.
p70
aVRacism against white people is a vanishingly small problem and so I choose to channel my energy towards fighting problems that cause actual harm to large numbers of people.
p71
aVIsn't 1400 white children in 1 small town alone large enough for you?
p72
aVStill 'vanishingly small' when compared to the widespread institutional and societal racism against non-white people in Western countries.
p73
aVOf course, because "societal racism" is far far more serious than children being gang raped.
p74
aVIn fact, 11 year old children being gang raped whilst being called white slag and white prostitute is really a vanishingly small problem.
p75
aVWhat we really need to focus on is people using bad words, or the fact that black people get stopped and searched more often.
p76
aVThat should clearly be the priority. 
p77
aVYou seem to have read some things that I didn't write.
p78
aVThat is in effect what you are saying.
p79
aVPlease point out to me the "institutional raicsm" today in 2014 Britain? 
p80
aVThat was a joke, right?
p81
aVWhat makes you say that?
p82
aVThat's.
p83
aV...racist!
p84
aVoh no how will whitey cope
p85
aVAre you retarded?
p86
aVseriously when did we start using the word retarded as an insult if the UK its fucking spastic you twat.

p92

p93
aVYeah!
p94
aVHere on reddit we don't welcome people who are non-white or disabled!
p95
aV"on the wrong side"?
p96
aVBecause I'm sick of racism?
p97
aVBecause I think that using the word "retarded" as an insult is lazy and unnecessary?
p98
aVYou're hilarious because I bet you're one of those people who really hates seeing other websites act like Reddit has one opinion that every single user of the site agrees on.
p99
aVBut then you read what I'm saying and then you decide that my words don't fit into this convenient little idea of what you want to read on this site, and therefore I'm some invader who's come over from Tumblr to steal your mansrights.
p100
aVThere are plenty of people on Reddit who have the strength of character to stand up against oppression.
p101
aVYou're just terrified because you're part of the increasingly shrinking group that is too cowardly to start asking if you could be doing things better.
p102
aV&gt;tolerance\u000a\u000aYou mean when the Abbasids were the biggest slaving empire in the world to the point that they had a 500.000 thousand strong african zanj slave revolt (whom they wrote some very nasty racial things about as a people, comparing them to animals and calling them the least of mankind) and considered non-Arab muslims "mawali" banning them from proper Arabic muslim court rights and and representation in government?
p103
aVPresentism.
p104
aVThe Medieval Islamic world was certainly relatively tolerant for its time. 
p105
aVThe Abbasid Golden Age was nowhere near "relatively tolerant" for it's time, it was exactly as oppressive in it's second-class citizen notions of it's conquered people and far more so in those it made slaves.
p106
aVThat's the sort of moronic revisionism only found in the same shady orientalist circles that claim the Mongols were really merciful in reality.
p107
aVyep the abbasid golden age was an entirely monolithic period where everyone was universally oppressive of other religions and/or peoples.
p108
aVpeople all did the same bad things regardless of when and where in the empire they lived.
p109
aVRAAA I HATE MILD JOKES IN SATIRICAL MAGAZINES
p110
aVhello I am a commenter on the internet what is presentism and historical context
p111
aVI think I got this, in the context of this, presentism seems like comparing standards of the past to today's.
p112
aVAnd historical context is like what was going on around whatever it is that you're talking about. 
p113
aVI would like to read more on that.
p114
aVDo you have a source or the name of the book you read this in. 
p115
aVWhich in particular?
p116
aVIf you want to read about the Zanj Revolution there are numerous treatises including the nearly contemporary "History of the Prophets and Kings" by Tarikh al-Tabari (who also writes about Arabs rather pro-racially).
p117
aVFor their nasty writings on the Zanj there's Al-Muqaddasi, al-T\u016bs\u012b and the satirical works of al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 are common examples though there's no doubt more there if you can be bothered (i've heard that Avicenna said they were a natural [aristotelian] slave race though I haven't read his works myself).
p118
aVLots of denigration of their intellectual capabilities and some unfavorable comparisons with apes pop up.
p119
aVIf you want to know about the mawali situation then the general anti-Persianism ("red people" etc) and the arab tribal affiliations during the Umayyads and the Abbasids all tend to be treated by more serious history books.
p120
aVYes, the ancient Islamic/Arabian world was centuries ahead in mathematics, medicine etc., but for all the advancement of the civilization I've never heard of them being world leaders in tolerance.
p121
aV[The Islamic world was notably tolerant of Judaism at a time when Christian Europe really wasn't.
p122
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_under_Muslim_rule)
p123
aVThat's fascinating, thank you very much.
p124
aV&gt; Some historians refer to this time period as the "Golden Age" for the Jews as more opportunities became available to them.
p125
aV[9] But this approach is commonly referred to as a myth.
p126
aVThat's from your own link.
p127
aVSafe to say there isn't much of a consensus on this. 
p128
aVEven your own source makes light of that claim calling it a myth before the orientalist revisionist views are presented.
p129
aVSee the pogroms it links to such as examples [one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohads#Status_of_non-Muslims), [two](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_Fez_massacre) and [three.
p130
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_Granada_massacre) \u000a\u000aThey were all perpetrated during the height of their scientific and supposedly "tolerant" Golden Age.
p131
aV&gt;the ancient Islamic/Arabian world was centuries ahead in mathematics, medicine etc.
p132
aVCenturies ahead is still a bit of a stretch since it was mainly confined to Baghdad and it was heavily based on the works of previous and contemporary Greek and Chinese tracts but still I didn't really question that part since it specifies architecture and medicine (Rhazi could certainly be argued to have been at forefront of his field at the time for instance). 
p133
aVThing is the Islamic world was only ahead of Europe for about 4 centuries after Mohammed - until the 12th century or so.
p134
aVFrom then on, nothing of any real value was produced in the scientific realm.
p135
aVHere's a good article on it which is a bit long but worth the read.
p136
aVhttp://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-the-arabic-world-turned-away-from-science\u000a\u000a
p137
aV&gt; \u201cfor many centuries the world of Islam was in the forefront of human civilization and achievement.\u201d \u201cNothing in Europe,\u201d notes Jamil Ragep, a professor of the history of science at the University of Oklahoma, \u201ccould hold a candle to what was going on in the Islamic world until about 1600.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat seems to be quite a bit longer than 4 centuries.
p138
aVYes you read the first 4 paras but do read the rest.
p139
aVThe author then goes on to show why that quote isn't true.
p140
aVThe article doesn't say that.
p141
aVIt discusses how they succeeded, what was achieved and so on but there's nothing there which says that Europe eclipsed them at the 12th century.
p142
aVThat itself would be a peculiar claim since the Renaissance was still a few centuries away. 
p143
aVIt does, do a Ctrl + F for "Al-Ghazali", 2/3rds down read the paragraph.
p144
aV*It is an exaggeration to say, as Steven Weinberg claimed in the Times of London, that after al-Ghazali (died 1111) \u201cthere was no more science worth mentioning in Islamic countries\u201d; in some places, especially Central Asia, Arabic work in science continued for some time, and philosophy was still studied somewhat under Shi\u2019ite rule.
p145
aV(In the Sunni world, philosophy turned into mysticism.
p146
aV) But the fact is, Arab contributions to science became increasingly sporadic as the anti-rationalism sank in.
p147
aV*
aVNo one will dispute that there was a deterioration of their science, but you specifically claimed that they were only ahead of Europe until the 12th century, which isn't corroborated by the article.
p148
aVThe part about Al-Ghazali's influence speaks of there being a decline that started because of him, which isn't the same thing as saying that European scientists surpassed them.
p149
aVDepends what you mean by Europe.
p150
aVByzantium was never behind.
p151
aVWestern Europe only took off with the fall of Byzantium.
p152
aVThe flight of educated Greeks to the west sparked a massive cultural revival.
p153
aVSo longer than the current scientific revolution, Western democracy, the Enlightenment, Britain, the US, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, etc.
p154
aV7th century to 12th century is about 500 years.
p155
aV12th century to the 21st is 900 years.
p156
aVYes you can count.
p157
aVWhy are you measuring from the 12th Century though?
p158
aVIt seems a bit random.
p159
aVMore sensible to measure from the scientific revolution etc.
p160
aVThe 12th Century was still very much the middle ages.
p161
aVThere's no logic in starting your European count based on what the Islamic world *wasn't* doing!
p162
aVAlso, your 12th century cut off for the End of the golden age seems entirely arbitrary.
p163
aVThe Wikipedia article on the golden age says the end is described as being either the 13th (Mongol invasions) or end of the 15th century (Reconquista) and describes a number of achievements in this period.
p164
aVhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age\u000a\u000aIt would seem bizarre to describe a Western European golden age as being initiated by the mass invasion of Central Europe by the Mongols!
p165
aVHundreds of brilliant political cartoons in Private Eye, yet the one about extremist Muslims is the one that gets uploaded and upvoted on /r/ukpolitics.
p166
aVI've seen loads of Private Eye cartoons here over the years, don't be silly.
p167
aVLoads of stuff from PE has been posted here recently...
p168
aVInstead of moaning, why not post links to some of the funny or insightful cartoons?
p169
aVStop making sense!
p170
aVIt's accurate, relevant, and witty.
p171
aVWhy is it a problem that people are upvoting it?
p172
aVWhy wouldn't it be?
p173
aVISIS, you know, those people slaughtering/raping people in the middle east in the name of Islam are currently a hot topic.
p174
aVThis cartoon is relevant to that, so it makes perfect sense that it would get attention.
p175
aVAlso, the only people who should be offended by this are the Muslims who think the killing/raping etc is good.
p176
aVI am ok with offending them.
p177
aVinteresting\u000a\u000asadly, the islamic golden age is something of a myth.
p178
aVthe fabled, pioneering technological advancements purported to have come from the muslim world consisted of raising large armies, overwhelming more advanced cities (alexandria, byzantium, countless indian settlements lost to the ages), taking their works and claiming it as their own.
p179
aVthis is akin to little barry the bully beating up stewart the swot, taking stewart's homework, writing his own name over it, and handing it in for top marks.
p180
aVthis is demonstrated in their inability to rebuild after being wiped out by the mongols; it turns out that ibn ali baba never actually understood the treasures of the classical world he had stolen.
p181
aVthe muslim world was very good at subjugating non believers however, through things like the barbary coast, north african slave trade, janissaries and treatment of the dhimmis unfortunate enough to be trapped within the empire (syriacs, coptics, hindus etc.).
p182
aVof course, such things are common in all empires, but usually forgotten about in non-european ones, thus important to note and keep in mind
p183
aVPersonally, I couldn't disagree more.
p184
aVOur advancements in medicine came through the help of the islamic world, mainly through the crusades and the fall of Constantinople.
p185
aVIslamic countries were the first to heave modern hospitals which were far better than the Askelpios' that were found in the Greek and Roman world which were focused more on superstition than medical science.
p186
aV(Admittedly these were different ages, however after the collapse of the roman empire and the advancement of the dark ages, Europe fell into disrepair and it was just the works of Galen that were practiced.
p187
aV)\u000a\u000aDuring the dark ages and medieval period, the church controlled much of the medical world within Europe, with anyone whose ideas dissagreed with Galen were banned.
p188
aVIt took a further 500 years until the Renaissance for the western world to create ligatures (Ambrose Pare), which had been found in the islamic countries much before.
p189
aVThe fall of Constantinople meant that scholars fled to Europe and so much knowledge was brought alongside, including "The Canon of Medicine" by Aviccenna, who I feel that you wrongly do not give enough credit too.
p190
aVIslamic countries also had the idea of infection much before western civilisation, which can be seen in how hospitals were positioned.
p191
aVMeat was hung around Islamic cities, and depending on how long the meat to to rot, depended on whether a hospital was positioned there.
p192
aVThis idea was not known in medieval Britain, where years later people were still contracting diseases from cesspits, as well as the much later cholera outbreak which was determined to be caused by bacteria by Dr John Snow in the 1800's.
p193
aVI hold islamic medicine in high regard when considering that western cultures were too busy destroying what we had and plunging ourselves into the dark ages, where as medical knowledge pioneered in other parts of the world. 
p194
aVGreat post.
p195
aVBut the idea of a European dark age has been proven wrong aswell, although in decline after the fall of the western empire Rome made many great advancements - the heavy plow, a huge increase in water wheels etc. 
p196
aVThe area that we know as the dark ages has faced much controversy by historians, and i'm in the camp that say that it did in fact happen, although we do not know how long for.
p197
aVOur language was one of the few things to evolve during this time, which words that originated from the anglo saxons become present which were not used widely (or in some cases at all before).
p198
aVAlthough there were some improvements as you rightly say, such as water wheels, great works such as the aqueducts were lost as they did not spread across Europe.
p199
aVThe Phantom Time Hypothesis is also particularly interesting here, as we have no certain proof if the dark ages and middle ages ever happened, but I wouldn't say that this was proof.
p200
aVI believe it did happen, but the period of time is unknown to us, as many different things did happen during this time which otherwise could not be explained.
p201
aV- Thats not too say either of us are right, as it most certainly is a debatable point.
p202
aVMy apologies this post doesn't really make much sense, the ideas here are hard to articulate well.
p203
aVI believe it happened as its a method of explaining the time period and events that happened, but I may be wrong.
p204
aVIt does also help my argument about Islam's contribution to medicine.
p205
aVI think by saying it didn't really happen doesn't help explain why these events occurred, and looking at evidence in my opinion suggests it did.
p206
aVIt is really a matter of interpretation though, like all things in history!
p207
aVI think that as you say, "such things are common in all empires", and that while many practices of the Islamic world were undoubtedly cruel, they're really no more cruel than any other medieval kingdoms.
p208
aVI also don't really buy that all advancement was a result of theft from other cultures - it's a bold accusation and if you have any evidence I'd like to see it.
p209
aVI'm as antitheist as you like, but there's no denying the great leaps in mathematics and medicine of the ancient Arabic/Islamic world, and that their universities were the oldest and easily the best in the ancient world.

aVAlso, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world#Notable_scientists
p214
aVI disagree with him, but it's much better to debate the points he makes than assuming he's a raider.
p215
aVAs he points out, while his post may be (mildly) Islamophobic, your accusations are a bit over the top.
p216
aVI also think it's a bit ironic how paranoid you sound while accusing him of being a conspiracy theorist.
p217
aVThis sub is going to die if we just accuse anyone we disagree with of being a shill, as is mentioned at the top of the thread you linked.
p218
aVMate just look at his posting history.
p219
aVHuh, fair enough.
p220
aVHe even uses the absurd "Intolerance of racists is a contradiction!
p221
aV" argument thing.
p222
aVUgh.
p223
aVi would be interested to see if you can explain how 'intolerance will not be tolerated' is a sound statement \u000a\u000aalso, please respond directly to the contents of my post, rather than the score, or even the name attached to it.
p224
aVsuch is the way of proper discourse 
p225
aVBecause we don't have to live by extremes?
p226
aVIt isn't hypocritical nor impossible to tolerate most things while abhorring intolerance. 
p227
aVnot extremes, just logical standards.
p228
aVrelativism will get you into some sticky situations when you find someone who draws the arbitrary line unresolvably different from you.\u000a
p229
aVLuckily we are creatures of judgement and don't require absolute consensus.
p230
aVindeed, that way everybody can be right 
p231
aVBecause tolerating a different viewpoint allows discourse to move forwards.
p232
aVTolerating some people saying "these people are inherently inferior because of where they were born", "The Sky is pink and we're ruled by lizard people" etc etc doesn't actually advance anything and just wastes everyones time.
p233
aVIf you want the view to be tolerated you have to prove it, and just screaming "THEYRE ALL SUB-HUMAN RAPISTS, AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A RACIST!!
p234
aV" Isn't (contrary to /pol/) the same as a rational discussion, and nor is it a "debate" its just an attempt to shout your view and then shout down any opposing arguments, This is why everyone hates /pol/
p235
aVYou are an idiot.
p236
aVof the 4 charges you have laid against me, only 'islamophobia' could potentially be contained within my post.
p237
aVhowever, the events of history are not racist, nor 'white supremacist', nor a conspiracy theory; they are merely facts, things that were (as far as we can tell).

p239
aVnext time, perhaps a more measured response sans the charge of the light political correctness brigade would be better
p240
aVYeah, none of those links provide convincing evidence towards your key statement that 'all Islamic advancements were stolen'.
p241
aVevidently, making such an absolute statement such as that is foolish; i assumed people would be able to work that out.
p242
aVperhaps i should have said 'broadly consisted of', my apologies 
p243
aVWhy are some of the lefties on this site so fascist?
p244
aVIf you really believe in what you espouse you shouldn't fear a dissenting view point, you should welcome it and debate the point instead of screaming "racism" and "Islamophobia".

aVTo be fair, the reason why Pokémon prices are so high is that 1 Yen is roughly equal to 1 pence or 1 dollar.
p265
aVDid you actually put this up, or is it photoshopped?
p266
aVIt's real, I have an Epson 3800 which can make those :)
p267
aVAmazing printer.
p268
aVI used to have one.
p269
aVThem were the days (last year).
p270
aVWhat's so good about them is I expect they won't even get noticed for a while by guards and the like.
p271
aVJust don't get caught, unlike dropping kittens into a woodchipper, messing with paid advertising loses companies money, and therefore you'll be in big legal trouble :) However, please DO keep doing it, as I'm sure you're cheering up far more people than you're annoying.
p272
aVYeah I already considered that so I only use empty ad slots ;) It can take a while to track down trains with unused slots but this way no-one can claim I'm doing any harm.
p273
aVNice, I now have full support for you knowing I'm not encouraging you to get arrested :)
p274
aVAfter 2008 one thing I noticed was there were loads of empty slots.
p275
aVTFL even started putting in their own advertising/propaganda to make it less noticable.
p276
aVEvery time I heard Labour's "green shoots" rubbish I'd think of all those empty advertising slots and think "nope!

p285
aV&gt;ITT: Humourless right wingers.
p286
aVMakes a decent change from the typical humourless left wingers throughout this sub.
p287
aVRight wingers don't have jokes do they?
p288
aVThe only right wing comedians I can think of are Chubby Brown and Bernard Manning.
p289
aVEdit: Unless you count Nick Griffin as a joke because he most certainly is.
p290
aVPeter Hitchens is hilarious, too bad many miss his jokes, as he has quite a dry wit.
p291
aVI didn't realise Peter Hitchens was a comedian.
p292
aVI wouldn't mind watching one of his stand ups.
p293
aVDo you have a blog I can link to if i share on twitter?
p294
aVNice work!
p295
aV[deleted]
p296
aVYeah I don't really have a blog yet, but I put that specific image [on twitter](https://twitter.com/mudkip2014)
p297
aVI didn't see the twitter link for this, which I have totally theived.
p298
aVHave gold instead!
p299
aVI did put it up [on twitter](https://twitter.com/mudkip2014) so you could link to that, thanks
p300
aVThis is actually brilliant.
p301
aVI herd u liek Ukipz
p302
aVHaha, I saw this today!
p303
aVIt's a shame I can only upvote this once
p304
aVIf only we didn't use FPTP, we might have more than one vote!
p305
aVHow do people react if you put these up?
p306
aVBeing British... they ignore it!
p307
aVMaybe they were part of the huge majority of adults who don't watch childrens cartoons.
p308
aVWell, it would be pretty unusual for people to be putting *anything* in the tube ad slots, but, you know, what if they're *supposed* to be doing that?
p309
aVCan't possibly risk the potential embarrassment of asking them!
p310
aVFantastic.
p311
aVDo you have a collection of these somewhere online?
p312
aVYears ago I [tried to start a thing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/66766356@N06/), but didn't really have the time to devote to it to build it up so I've just been doing occasional stuff off the record since.
p313
aVIs it legal to put these on tubes?
p314
aVDo you pay a rent space or just do it sneakily? 
p315
aVSneakily of course, tho I only use already empty slots so no-one can claim I'm stealing ad space from anyone.
p316
aVIt amused me.
p317
aVPiccadilly line?
p318
aVI'd say please stick some in the Northern Line, but during commuting hours people are so crammed in there that nobody would even see them.
p319
aVActually that is the Northern line
p320
aVAh, I forgot that the zone labels are dark blue on all lines.
p321
aVCarry on!
p322
aVApologies for being a bit off-topic, but can you suggest a printer?
p323
aVI've got similar ambitions, but can't work out how to do a short run without it costing the earth. 
p324
aVthey said they were using an epson 3800
p325
aVCheers, I didn't get that far in the comments.
p326
aVAppreciated. 
p327
aVJust to add I bought my Epson 3800 2nd hand, they're too pricey new but they do come up used on ebay now and again.
p328
aVThe nice thing about them is while they're more expensive to buy than cheapo consumer printers, the ink is around 10x cheaper than consumer ink by volume (tho the cartridges are huge, so individually they're quite expensive)
p329
aVI nearly fell off my chair when I saw the price.
p330
aVIt is a beast though!
p331
aVI might start keeping an eye out on ebay just in case!
p332

p333
aVIts those dam fire types, with there red and there fire that always beat us.
p334
aVThey have such a advantage over us water types, we need them gone!
p335
aVIs this political?
p336
aVIsn't it a meme post?
p337
aVGoing to do some about the other parties?
p338
aVHe could probably do one that just, might, maybe, might fit all of your butthurt about this image onto a single poster.
p339
aVI did do some [for Cameron](https://www.flickr.com/photos/66766356@N06/sets/72157627510204256) after the riots, didn't really keep it up so haven't done any for a while tho.
p340
aVI did UKIP this time because they've been putting some rather silly ads out recently.
p341
aV[deleted]
p342
aVyou realise this isn't far off their actual posters
p343
aVIndeed, if UKIP didn't make it quite so easy to mock them I'm sure there wouldn't be so much like this :)\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also, angry about a pokemon parody, that's a lot of spare anger there!
p344
aVPut a little effort in at least
p345
aVLeftists can't make up their minds.
p346
aVThey say immigrants come to work and then they laugh at people who claim they;re taking jobs.
p347
aVDo they think there are infinite jobs?
p348
aVBizarre.
p349
aVThank you for illustrating the main problem, which is that it's impossible to have a sensible debate about things like this.
p350
aVFor a start jobs aren't a zero sum game so suggesting that every migrant employed has taken that job from a British person is just as nonsensical as suggesting there are infinite jobs.
p351
aVSecondly while I agree with a lot of Farage's finer points, I absolutely disagree with using dodgy statistics, exaggerated claims and completely unnecessary inflammatory images and statements.
p352
aVIt's quite unfortunate that UKIP has gone down this route really.
p353
aVOne thing I do find it funny tho is that the right-wing press, who for years have been printing inflammatory and exaggerated anti-EU stories which helped create this atmosphere, has now turned against UKIP for doing exactly the same thing.
p354
aVIf someone from a foreign country is more qualified than you then tough shit.
p355
aVI'd rather have someone who's more qualified and foreign then someone who's less qualified and English.
p356
aVDon't like it?
p357
aVBless.
p358
aVGo out and get more qualifications. 
p359
aVFirst of all:\u000a\u000aDon't like that people might vote against your immigration preference?
p360
aVTough shit.
p361
aVThis is democracy.
p362
aVYou can't always get what you want.
p363
aVSecond of all:\u000a\u000aThats exactly what UKIP is avocating.
p364
aVThe rest of the parties want to preference people simply because hey're citizens of "the EU" instead of  based on skills.
p365
aVThats part of why theres the new EU passports.
p366
aVThink clearly.
p367
aVThirdly:\u000a\u000aYour stance is a globalist one which is purely chasng GDP growth.
p368
aVIs GDP growth really worth the erosion of heterogeneity of race, culture and identity?
p369
aV---------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aTangent here:\u000a\u000aOnce we're all global citizen serving our corporate masters.
p370
aVOnce the English race has been de-constructed and Britain as a nation has seen its abolition.
p371
aVOnce thats happened its gone forever.
p372
aVIf its inevitable than so be it.
p373
aVBut for you to fob off the entire idea of the ethnic British person reeks of masochism and hatred.
p374
aVI think British culture is worth preserving.
p375
aVI think much of British history is worthy of praise.
p376
aVI think destroying it for the sake of your metric is a quite frankly disgusting.
p377
aVI know that we can't go back to the past, but we are in the process of choosing the wrong future.
p378
aVAsk yourself who you're serving.
p379
aVBecause to me, the final thing standing in the way of total globalism is the nation state and the ethnic identity of people.
p380
aVThe "nations" of the future will be McDonalds, Mars and Toyota.
p381
aVThe religion will be "GDP".
p382
aVWe forgot somewhere along the way that our increases in productivity and our progress in technology was supposed to serve and uplift man.
p383
aVAnd instead we're steeped in a left-wing who argue in the favour of macro-corporatists (multinationals) and right-wingers who argue in favour of same corporations but under the pretense that it will preserve nationality.
p384
aVLets face it the conservatives aren't conserving jack shit.
p385
aVThey bait their own members so they can shame them and remove all the old guard.
p386
aVLabour don't care about the poor and disenfranchised labour class of British people.
p387
aVThe EU doesn't care about Britain.
p388
aVIt has no reason to serve Britains interests exept for when they expressly match with its own.
p389
aVAnd it seems like few people can actually tell me what the EU stand for.
p390
aVIts "head" (although people on't even seem to agree who the head is) was a maoist.
p391
aVI know that I'm rambling but I think you'll come to regret your flippant attitude to british culture and the ethnic English/Irish/Scottish/Welsh.
p392
aVAre you ethnically from the UK and currently enjoying some masochism?
p393
aVOr are you advocating your own immigrant interests in an arrogant manner?
p394
aVI imagine you want to make me annoyed with your language but I've head it all before and you can't disenfranchise me any more with the state of politics across the West.
p395
aVWe're all living in quasi-America.
p396
aVand it won't take long before everyones culture is American.
p397
aV**I'll be shocked if anyone read all that**
p398
aVOk firstly: of course I don't like it, people don't like it when people disagree with their views.
p399
aVI strongly oppose them but I know they will vote.
p400
aVThat's democracy - just because it's democracy doesn't mean I have to like what they say.
p401
aVI don't really have a reason to use a phrase involving shit here but hey shit.
p402
aVNo their not.
p403
aVThey're saying (source recent radio interview with Farage) that they don't want people because of their race.
p404
aVThat's racist.
p405
aVNo I don't care about GDP.
p406
aVI care about what will kill us i.e.
p407
aVglobal warming, global food shortages and rising populations.
p408
aVI also believe in progression.
p409
aVNone of those things can be achieved with regressing back out of the EU.
p410
aVI believe these problems (not GDP) are worth erasing hetrogeneity of race, culture and identity.
p411
aVI see no problem with these being erased.
p412
aVI'd rather be a part of a United Europe than a United Kingdom, national divisions can lie in sport, elsewhere they're pointless.
p413
aVYour tangent seems to be based purely upon the assumption I care a lot about GDP.
p414
aVBeing in the EU benefits it but it's not my main point for arguing against UKIP.
p415
aVIll respond to your accusations and nothing else.
p416
aVI'm English but also 3/8ths Welsh.
p417
aVI'm not arrogant I just don't like this argument.
p418
aVI don't want to annoy you I just want to say why I don't agree with you.
p419
aVI won't regret my flippant attitude because I know a lot of people agree with me.
p420
aVUltimately it is the way forward.
p421
aVI love a lot of cultures, I love the Buddist culture, I love the Cornish culture.
p422
aVI love the Australian culture, the country's I have been I love what I've seen.
p423
aVI don't see mixing race, culture and identity as a problem.
p424
aVBecause it isn't.
p425
aVThe main technological advances have come from co-operation not one country rejecting all help from everyone else.
p426
aVYou can't destroy history.
p427
aVIt is there in the books and will forever be in our memories.
p428
aVDamn.
p429
aVThat was one hell of a tangent you got there.
p430
aV&gt;No their not.
p431
aVThey're saying (source recent radio interview with Farage) that they don't want people because of their race.
p432
aVThat's racist.
p433
aVNo.
p434
aVThey aren't.
p435
aVEven Milliband has disagreed with this.
p436
aV&gt;No I don't care about GDP.
p437
aVI care about what will kill us i.e.
p438
aVglobal warming, global food shortages and rising populations.
p439
aVI also believe in progression.
p440
aVNone of those things can be achieved with regressing back out of the EU.
p441
aVThe EU will stop rising populations?
p442
aVThe EU will stop food shortages despite being protectionist?
p443
aVI get the global warming argument, but cmon.
p444
aVAnd "progression".
p445
aVPlease.
p446
aVAbsolutely disgusting.
p447
aVProgressivism is just the destruction of society.
p448
aVThe erosion of standards, duty, the family and culture.
p449
aV&gt;I believe these problems (not GDP) are worth erasing hetrogeneity of race, culture and identity.
p450
aVWOW.
p451
aVJust... wow.
p452
aV&gt;I see no problem with these being erased.
p453
aVWhats the point of preserving humanity if we lose all of what makes us so great.
p454
aVWe're not numbers.
p455
aVWe're not a squirming brown mass of machine operators.
p456
aVThis sort of comment reeks of the sort of person who has never taken the time to enjoy education as more than getting a job.
p457
aVThe beauty of humanity is our diversity of thought.
p458
aVInto my heart an air that kills\u000a    From yon far country blows:\u000a    What are those blue remembered hills, \u000a    What spires, what farms are those?
p459
aVThat is the land of lost content,\u000a    I see it shining plain,\u000a    The happy highways where I went\u000a    And cannot come again.
p460
aV-------------------------------\u000a\u000a    He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,\u000a    That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,\u000a    But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust.
p461
aVIf we who sight along it round the world,\u000a    See nothing worthy to have been its mark,\u000a    It is because like men we look too near,\u000a    Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,\u000a    Our missiles always make too short an arc.
p462
aVThey fall, they rip the grass, they intersect\u000a    The curve of earth, and striking, break their own;\u000a    They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.
p463
aVBut this we know, the obstacle that checked\u000a    And tripped the body, shot the spirit on\u000a    Further than target ever showed or shone\u000a\u000a-------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aThere is more to life than living.
p464
aVThe human species is above merely surviving.
p465
aVI often reflect on my favourite poem.
p466
aVThe Charge of the Light Brigade.
p467
aVI had an ancestor who fought in that cavalry.
p468
aVAnd it strikes me that although men of so many nations fought in the same wars and battles, often alongside eachother as comrades.
p469
aVThat where the beauty of war comes from is not the exquisitely sharp tragedy, but in the difference in perspective.
p470
aVThe Eastern philosophy revolutionised Western thought.
p471
aVThe same way hat the Enlightenment shocked Prussia and created the German powerhouse.
p472
aVThe power of man is his isolation to brew his own thoughts.
p473
aVTo foster and nurture a new and radical idea.
p474
aVAnd then to unleash that idea upon his fellows and to watch it take wing and fight.
p475
aVPolitics is a war of ideas.
p476
aVWar is an evolution of human thought.
p477
aVYou think your homogenisation of humanity would be for its betterment when it would rob it of its entire soul.
p478
aVI'm not suggesting it should go, I just see no problem with walking down the road and having 7 or 8 different cultures of food available to me.
p479
aVI'm just saying I have no problem with cultures mixing.
p480
aVNot suggesting we should stop nurturing new ideas.
p481
aVWhats the point in preserving humanity?
p482
aVUh...I want to live.
p483
aVWhat makes the human race great is our ability to co-operate.
p484
aVYou and I wouldn't be alive if we hadn't.
p485
aVI personally believe discriminating against someone on grounds of their race to be racist.
p486
aVYOLO.
p487
aVYeah but I think we need to be as united as we can to face these issues.
p488
aVThey won't get solved by everyone doing their own thing.
p489
aVUnity will get us through it.
p490
aVProgression isn't disgusting.
p491
aVWe're moving towards a more united world.
p492
aVI want to see a more united world.
p493
aVShoot me.
p494
aVYeah I stand by what I said.
p495
aVI want to see the human race survive.
p496
aVI think culture being mixed is not a bad thing, actually I love what all these cultures have delivered.
p497
aVI want to survive and I want to see a united world, yeah it sounds naive.
p498
aVI hate some cultures where there is repression and an abuse of human rights.
p499
aVI just want a free united world. 
p500
aV&gt;I'm just saying I have no problem with cultures mixing.
p501
aVNot suggesting we should stop nurturing new ideas.
p502
aVYou can't have both.
p503
aVLocalised diversity applied to the whole globe (globalisation) is only diversity in the short run.
p504
aVOnce you mix all the paint you start off with interesting swirls and you end up with one colour.
p505
aVThe internet.
p506
aVTV.
p507
aVInternational banking.
p508
aVMultinational corporations.
p509
aVAlmost every country in the world eats mcdonalds and drinks coca cola.
p510
aVThats not diversity on a macro level.
p511
aVYou're looking too small.
p512
aV&gt;our ability to co-operate\u000a\u000aNo its our ability to compete.
p513
aVCommunism failed.
p514
aVDidn't you hear?
p515
aV&gt;I personally believe discriminating against someone on grounds of their race to be racist.
p516
aVYOLO.
p517
aVWhat does that have to do with anything I posted?
p518
aV&gt;Yeah but I think we need to be as united as we can to face these issues.
p519
aVThey won't get solved by everyone doing their own thing.
p520
aVUnity will get us through it.
p521
aVThey will be solved by everyone doing their own thing.
p522
aVThats the point.
p523
aVUnity is a farce.
p524
aVEuropean governments cannot be trusted with centralisation of power.
p525
aVYou would gamble everything for the sake of non-issues.
p526
aVGlobal warming needs solving.
p527
aVBut thats one problem.
p528
aVTo combat it you think we should throw caution to the wind and centralise power in the EU.
p529
aVA blatantly communist piece of trash.
p530
aV&gt;Progression isn't disgusting.
p531
aVWe're moving towards a more united world.
p532
aVI want to see a more united world.
p533
aVShoot me.
p534
aVI'll be he one getting shot when I'm seen as "delaying progress".
p535
aVThey'll march me out onto the cambodian killing fields.
p536
aVOr ship me off to the siberian gulags.
p537
aVOr have me starved of rice on a chinese farm I can't hope to farm.
p538
aVMarx believed that the classes were stuck in an endless war and the working class could prevail and overcome oppression.
p539
aVHe was proven wrong, repeatedly.
p540
aVBut his ideas were reborn in cultural marxism.
p541
aVAnd they now seek to open a million fronts against "oppression".
p542
aVRacism.
p543
aVSexism.
p544
aVAgeism.
p545
aVAbleism.
p546
aVTransgenderism.
p547
aVPolytheism.
p548
aVetc etc.
p549
aVSlowly but surely the population will divide internally.
p550
aVStripped of a national narrative, stripped of a cultural identity, stripped of race and name and creed.
p551
aVWe'll look about ourselves and see that there is no community but THE community.
p552
aVThere is no refuge.
p553
aVThere is no diversity.
p554
aVAnd then perhaps we'll shrug our shoulders and flip over to see the next episode of Big Brother.
p555
aV&gt;Yeah I stand by what I said.
p556
aVI want to see the human race survive.
p557
aVNo you don't.
p558
aVYou want its soul torn from its body.
p559
aVIts passions withered and quashed.
p560
aVIts hopes and faiths crushed.
p561
aVIts fire and fury forever quelled.
p562
aVYou want stability.
p563
aVYou want the pendulum to stop swinging and the chaos that is life to organise itself.
p564
aVYou're a communist.
p565
aV"Progression" is really erosion.
p566
aV&gt;I just want a free united world.
p567
aVAn oxymoron.
p568
aVWow.
p569
aVJust wow.
p570
aVI have better things to be doing, seriously it would take a while to explain what is wrong with what you have just said on what I have said.
p571
aVI need to revise and progress in my life.
p572
aVYou know, progression.
p573
aVOh please.
p574
aVSpare me.
p575
aVWow.
p576
aVDat hate...
p577
aVI don't hate you.
p578
aVYour post was just flippantly pretending that you could show I was wrong but have better things to do.
p579
aVWhich doesnt seem likely.
p580
aVAre you a communist?
p581
aVYou seem to take on the denial of reality and anti-culture.
p582
aVI could take a selfie with me and my work if you really like...?
p583
aVI honestly I have an exam in 14 hours time.
p584
aVThe length of the posts were taking up too much time.
p585
aVBelieve what you like :L\u000aNope.
p586
aVI very much disagree with communism.
p587
aVPlease don't degenerate to insults. 
p588
aV&gt; I very much disagree with communism\u000a\u000aOnly economically.
p589
aVYou could always come back after your exams.
p590
aVGet off reddit and go study.
p591
aVI want you to succeed. 
p592
aVNo, no I completely disagree with communism.
p593
aVEconomically I completely disagree with it, it just ends up being one silly dictatorship with no elections.
p594
aVAnd cheers, all the best with whatever you are doing an all!
p595
aV&gt; Do they think there are infinite jobs?
p596
aVDo you think the number of jobs in the economy is static, and doesn't vary with the population and the level of demand for goods and services?
p597
aVNo.
p598
aVAnd thats why you need a controlled immigration which targets jobs that need filling in skilled roles.
p599
aVLike UKIP advocates...
p600
aVI keep hearing about these mysterious "Leftists" but still don't know what they are
p601
aVEver boiled a frog?
p602
aVThe trick is to do it slow.
p603
aVI think their really laughing at people who claim they're taking jobs, who are usually the same people who claim they're taking benefits. 
p604
aVWhenever you create more competition for unskilled jobs in a pool of limited jobs you create unemployed people who have to resort to welfare.
p605
aVThis is undeniable.
p606
aVSo any immigration into the country which isn't managed in correlation to job availability (ie jobs that can't be filled) will result in unemployment.
p607
aVThis is undeniable.
p608
aVThere seems to be this strange paradigm where people think immigration can't cause an increase in unemployment, welfare and still be taking jobs.
p609
aVWhen really they are all tied together.
p610
aVActually you can make infinite jobs.
p611
aVHere is how: give spoons to workers instead of shovels, intentionally destroy bus stops (it creates new jobs!
p612
aV) etc.
p613
aVThis way you make a lot of jobs but no progress to society.

aV50% of welfare claimants are pensioners because they hide the cost of pensions under welfare and then constantly blame "lazy" people of working age.
p619
aVPension costs are set to rocket so "welfare" costs will too.
p620
aVInteresting to see Osbornes latest 'How did we spend your money' leaflet picked apart.
p621
aVFor instance slipping public sector pensions into the welfare section to increase its size, even tho they'd seperated the state pension from welfare so they could show how much they spent on their core voters.
p622
aVSpun to look like welfare is over a quarter of the budget, when work age benefits are under 14% and unemployment benefit a tiny sliver of that.
p623
aVInteresting picking apart of it, with the original pie chart Osborne released [here...]  (http://kittysjones.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/conservatives-should-repay-cost-of-misleading-tax-stunt-says-tuc/)\u000a\u000a
p624
aVPublic sector pensions as part of welfare is utterly bizarre.
p625
aVThat is going beyond simple misrepresentation and into the realm of outrageous lying.
p626
aVThe most honest thing would have been to include public sector pensions in the same section as public sector salaries (nurses' pensions in Health Spending, teachers' pensions in Education Spending, etc.
p627
aV) seeing as it's a cost of employing these people.
p628
aVIf you replaced these conventional salaries with modern DC personal pensions, the state's contribution would be counted as part of the salary.
p629
aVYet you just wait and watch people use that massive section of 'welfare spending' as a reason to blame the sick and unemployed for our financial woes.
p630
aVStep 1: have direct pension payment from the current public sector employees to the retired public sector employees (ie, no 'pension pot')\u000a\u000aStep 2: reduce the size of the public sector\u000a\u000aStep 3: claim the tax man has to 'step in' to pay public sector pensions which are 'out of proportion'\u000a\u000aStep 4: unilaterally smash public sector pensions\u000a\u000aStep 5: re-election?
p631
aV&gt; could show how much they spent on their core voters\u000a\u000aExcept that public-sector workers are largely Labour supporters (and are members of the trade unions that fund Labour), not Conservative supporters.
p632
aVEDIT: Apparently I misunderstood what was meant by that sentence.
p633
aVI think you misunderstood.
p634
aVThey distinguished state pensions - their core voters - whilst hiding public sector pensions in the welfare budget.
p635
aVYeah, I meant they'd seperated the state pension from welfare, so they can show their core pension age voters how nicely they're treating them.
p636
aVEDIT: Heh, sorry, didn't realise two other people had explained my meaning before I commented, came here from my mailbox, not the thread.
p637
aVCertainly explains why they want to lump typical labour voters in with the 'scroungers' too, tho.
p638
aVI think he was referring to the fact that they'd separated the state pension from welfare.
p639
aVBoth parties can shuffle away - the UK is going down.
p640
aVHardly.
p641
aVFastest growing economy in the West, and a bunch of other goodies.
p642
aVWages are being kept down by a variety of reasons, including immigration as one factor (immigrants willing to work in terrible conditions for very little money forces wages down).
p643
aV1 Million people in this country use food banks?
p644
aVout of a population of ~63 million?
p645
aVThats pretty good going, i'd say.
p646
aVA better position than most EU nations.
p647
aV13 million in 'poverty'?
p648
aVDefine poverty.
p649
aVI've been in the houses of people who are in 'poverty' and they have smartphones, large TV's, games consoles, computers, designer furniture and clothing etc etc etc.
p650
aVHardly poverty ridden.
p651
aV&gt; 50% of welfare claimants are pensioners because they hide the cost of pensions under welfare\u000a\u000aIt's more because the pension system in this country hasn't changed significantly in the last 40 years, yet life expectancy has increased and interest rates have fallen, making the system increasingly unsustainable.
p652
aVAdditionally, one of the main reasons for the increase in life expectancy are the improvements in geriatric medical care, which are expensive and have significantly increased the "cost of life" for older people.
p653
aVOf course, whenever any government tries to take steps to improve things (e.g.
p654
aVraising retirement age, increasing pension contributions), there are massive protests (particularly from the unions).
p655
aVFact is, a significant chunk of the average Briton's tax is going to provide a level of retirement income for the previous generation that unless major reforms are made soon, they won't get themselves.
p656
aVWe're taking money from the "pension poor" and giving it to the "pension rich".
p657
aVIt's ridiculous and unfair and needs to end.
p658
aV&gt; Of course, whenever any government tries to take steps to improve things\u000a...\u000a\u000athe boomers all vote to shaft the young!\u000a
p659
aVThe vast majority of people vote primarily in their own self-interest.
p660
aVAgreed, IMHO this is totally the wrong way to think about it.
p661
aVIt's just mob rule.
p662
aVThat's all democracy will ever be.
p663
aVI don't think it has to be like that.
p664
aVPerhaps my faith in man is too high...
p665
aVExcept the working class Tory lunatics who have happily stagnated wages for them and their sprogs and will more than likely vote for them forever.

aV£40 btw is about the same money that some one unemployed under 25 gets per week for unemployment benefits.
p670
aVUnemployed 24 year old here, £57.35 a week.
p671
aVGood point.
p672
aVWe should base all decisions on MP pay and expenses on what an under-25 unemployed person gets in benefits.
p673
aVthat was not what i was saying i just thought it was an interesting contrast
p674
aVIt's a relatively open secret that during the 80's, MP's salaries were intentionally stagnated because of the state of the wider economy so as not to kick up a shit-fit.
p675
aVThis meant that they had actually *not* seen a rise for a while and with a nod and a wink it was accepted that this rise would come in the form of expenses so that their living costs were lower even if their salaries couldn't be higher.
p676
aVFast forward 25 years and you have the expenses scandal when it reality the main cause for that was the fact wages for MPs - a serious and significant a job as exists, for the most part - wasn't as high as it should have been by historic standards (thus the non-historic abuse of the expenses system). 
p677
aVSo what, we should be grateful our benevolent overlords are not taking more? 
p678
aVBe grateful?
p679
aVI dunno, feel however you like.
p680
aVI'm just explaining why the expenses system is the way it is. 
p681
aVor we could pay them a decent wage.
p682
aVThere are middle managers in the BBC who earn more money than our Prime Minister for god sake.
p683
aVHow can that be justified by anyone?
p684
aVWe do pay them a decent wage.
p685
aVThe basic annual salary for an MP is £67,060.
p686
aVThere is no excuse for struggling to survive on that and still needing to claim tax payers money to buy duck islands and decadent breakfasts.
p687
aVMaybe these people shouldn't be MP's representing society if they are so disconnected from the reality of living as a normal person on an average wage. 
p688
aVAnd it is a part time job at that level. 
p689
aV£67k in London is barely enough to afford a one bedroom flat.
p690
aVIt's not a decent wage, however much you want to spin it.
p691
aV£40 breakfast - so what.
p692
aVThat's maybe 8 cups of starbucks coffee.
p693
aVWho cares.
p694
aVIt's not going to fix our massive deficit.
p695
aVDid you know the investigation into MPs expenses cost the tax payer more than the original expenses claimed?
p696
aVWhat the hell was the point of that?
p697
aV!
aVif you earn over £60,500 a year you are in the top decile.
p698
aVhttp://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/25/uk-incomes-how-salary-compare\u000a\u000aMP's are some of the highest earners in the UK.
p699
aVThere is no reason the taxpayer should have to fund MP's decadent lifestyles as expenses whilst putting them in the highest percentage of earners.
p700
aVThey are free to go and work in the private sector if they want more money, and many of them do whilst still being MP's.
p701
aV£40 for breakfast?
p702
aVYeah I care.
p703
aVWhy should I have to fund MP's extravagant lifestyles whilst I am financially crippled with student loans and declining wages.
p704
aV£40 could feed me for a week.
p705
aVThey preach austerity for the masses and live like kings on our tax money as expenses.
p706
aVI'm all for them spending their own wages however they like.
p707
aVI live in london, earn less than them and I don't receive additional expenses for my commute, food, work clothing and the cost of living within a certain proximity of the office.
p708
aVIt doesn't matter if the investigation was expensive.
p709
aVYou are saying we should tolerate the problems in our society because it's cheaper to just accept it.
p710
aVThis is a nonsense argument.
p711
aVShould we tolerate crime because it works out cheaper than maintaining a police force? 
p712
aV&gt; if you earn over £60,500 a year you are in the top decile.
p713
aVeg you're in London.
p714
aVYou get what you pay for.
p715
aVIf you pay MPs far less money than they could earn at an equivalent job in the private sector, or even as a manager at the BBC or some town council, then you will get two types of people become MP:\u000a\u000a    1.
p716
aVIndependently wealthy people who don't care about the money.
p717
aV2.
p718
aVIncompetent people who would never get a job in the private sector.
p719
aVThat's why MPs are so ridiculously bad at the moment.
p720
aVI personally wouldn't have launched a full scale investigation into MPs expenses no.
p721
aVIf they were paid properly you wouldn't get them trying to claim everything.
p722
aVThere's probably thousands of people claiming benefits who shouldn't be - which is a *real* problem, and adds up to a large amount of money.
p723
aVUnlike some government minister claiming £40.
p724
aVCan you explain how exactly you're "crippled" by student loan?
p725
aVCome on now.
p726
aVAnd if you can't afford to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, perhaps you shouldn't live there.
p727
aVThey are paid properly.
p728
aVThey're in the top 10% of UK earners.
p729
aVTo claim 67k a year isn't being paid properly is insane.
p730
aVIt is easily enough to live in london.
p731
aVTo claim it isn't is simply nonsense.
p732
aVAlso you haven't included the people that actually want to be in politics and aspire for that to be their career.
p733
aVYou personally would have accepted our politicians taking the piss out of the taxpayer to save a couple quid.
p734
aVThat isn't how the system works.
p735
aVBy your logic all court cases are a waste of time.  
p736
aV&gt; To claim 67k a year isn't being paid properly is insane.
p737
aVIt isn't when some of them work 100+ hrs a week, no.
p738
aVSorry, but constituency meetings, surgeries, paperwork at night and travel does all count as work.
p739
aVI know numerous high end professionals that work ridiculous hours and don't make anywhere near 67k.
p740
aVDoctors, accountants, barristers.
p741
aVNone of them are in the top 10%.
p742
aVBritish army officers with oxbridge backgrounds don't make that much money as a basic salary, and not just do they do more than 100 hours a week on deployment they actually risk their lives and their work is grueling.
p743
aVThey do however get to go on into high paying jobs afterwards in the private sector, just like MP's.
p744
aV67k a year as a basic salary is extremely good.
p745
aVYou can't in any way claim they are poorly paid. 
p746
aVOne of the arguments in favour of paying MPs a decent salary is that is raises them above the level of petty corruption, as it eliminates most of the temptation and makes it pretty difficult for someone to purchase a vote outright.
p747
aVYes there are some people with less than scrupulous morals, but on the whole I do think our politics is fairly clean by global standards.
p748
aV&gt; 67k a year as a basic salary is extremely good.
p749
aVThat depends.
p750
aVIf I had to travel between - for example - a Scottish constituency and London three times a week and had to spend significant amounts of time away from my partner and young children, I probably wouldn't think that would be an overly fantastic deal to tell the truth.
p751
aVIt's not a bad salary in terms of the money, but what you have to do to earn it and the conditions that come with it aren't all that brilliant.
p752
aVObviously if an MP has to travel, like from Scotland to London, as with all professions that should be covered as an expense.
p753
aVI'm not saying they should have to cover the expenses of their professional duties.
p754
aVI'm saying when they're in the top 10% of UK earners they can pay for their own bloody breakfasts, TV's, chocolate bars and furniture.
p755
aVThere is a subsidised canteen in the houses of parliament.
p756
aVOne does not need to spend 40 quid on breakfast at the expense of the taxpayer.
p757
aVBreakfasts do not cost 40 quid in London.
p758
aVJust because expensive breakfasts are available doesn't mean they can live outside of their financial means on the tax payers money.
p759
aVThe average Brit doesn't get to spend 40 quid on breakfast, so why should MP's at our expense?
p760
aVI don't expect them to cover the costs of performing their parliamentary duties.
p761
aVI expect them to cover their personal expenses out of their personal salary like everyone else.
p762
aVIt's not the common man's responsibility to fund the bourgeois lifestyles of the Aristocracy.
p763
aVTheir working conditions are a million times better than those in many, many of other occupations.
p764
aVLots and lots of people work long hours in physically demanding conditions and make a hell of a lot less than them, and have no additional expenses paid for them.
p765
aVBeing an MP really is not as bad as you are making it out to be.
p766
aVIt requires skilled, intelligent and committed individuals, and if they are suffering under the conditions of being an MP they are in the wrong line of work, because it is pretty cushdy compared to most menial jobs.  
p767
aVIf you are travelling for work then a breakfast isn't a personal expense, it's a business expense.
p768
aVLike I say, sometimes that hotel IS the only option available when your staying in a hotel and you have a 9am meeting - that's why hotels price it accordingly, as they know that nobody is ever going to paying out of their own pocket.
p769
aVHonestly, I have no problem with this *depending on the circumstances*.
p770
aVIf you are travelling for work then it's only fair for your employer to pick up the cost, including breakfast and snacks.
p771
aVBreakfast still doesn't cost 40 quid.
p772
aVThe problem was they were abusing the system.
p773
aVIf I went on a business trip and spent 40 quid on breakfast I would get in trouble.
p774
aVObviously there are some exceptions, like a breakfast meeting in which I cover the client.
p775
aVBut still them being in London isn't a business trip, it's a regular part of their job and there is a plethora of places to buy food for a reasonable price, including in the building in which they work. 
p776
aVDo you think a boss of a local council should be paid more than the prime minister of the country?
p777
aVDon't you think the prime minister of the country should be the highest paid public sector job?
p778
aVOr do you think "head of contemporary history at the BBC" should be paid higher?
p779
aVOnly a couple of MPs were actually prosecuted for fiddling expenses.
p780
aVThe majority were just taking what they were allowed.
p781
aVSo I'm not quite sure how you make the leap that all court cases are a waste of time.
p782
aVThe MP expenses "scandal" wasn't to do with the law.
p783
aVIt was about how much MPs should be able to claim expenses for to make up for their extremely bad pay.
p784
aVThat isn't even remotely how the world works.
p785
aVIt's the same as debating the fact that soldiers are paid less than footballers.
p786
aVBeing the PM is not about getting rich, although it is practically guaranteed that all PM's will end up rich.
p787
aVAlso being the PM is not a career.
p788
aVIt's a temporary elected position.
p789
aVNo one should aspire to be the PM for the paycheque.
p790
aVIf these people want to be rich they are free to go and work in the private sector.
p791
aVYou are simply deluded if you think 67k a year is "extremely bad pay".
p792
aVBeing in the top 10% of UK earners is extremely good pay.
p793
aVAlso the expenses scandal was about the widespread misuse and abuse of the system.
p794
aVYou are stating we should allow MP's to abuse their positions because doing something about it will cost more money than they have been pocketing at the taxpayers expense.
p795
aVDid you actually follow any of it whilst it was happening?
p796
aV&gt; No one should aspire to be the PM for the paycheque.
p797
aVIf these people want to be rich they are free to go and work in the private sector.
p798
aVeg you will only get independently wealthy people, or incompetent people being PM.
p799
aVLook at singapore.
p800
aVThey pay their officials millions, which makes them un-bribable.
p801
aVThey will not take bribes, and will not do what corporations ask them to.
p802
aVThey are paid handsomely by the state, and so their only allegiance is to serve the people.
p803
aVThis obsession with what other people earn is unhealthy.
p804
aVBeing in the top 10% of UK earners isn't hard.
p805
aVYes I followed the whole sordid Guardian lead waste of time and taxpayer money.
p806
aVIt was utterly pointless.
p807
aVSomeone accidentally claimed for a porn movie at a hotel which cost the taxpayer £10.
p808
aVBig deal.
p809
aVWho the hell cares.
p810
aVYep you don't live in the real world.
p811
aVBeing in the top 10% is hard, which is why only 10% of people manage it.
p812
aVThat's how percentages work.
p813
aVIf it was easy it would be a larger percentage.
p814
aVPeople go into vocations because that is what they aspire to do.
p815
aVTo suggest we pay MP's millions is totally absurd.
p816
aVWhat you are saying is the taxpayer should have to bribe MP's with extortionate salaries so as not to accept other bribes.
p817
aVThere are lots of positions open for bribes.
p818
aVDoesn't mean they should all be paid millions.
p819
aVIt means they should be arrested if they accept them.
p820
aVYou logic is totally flawed.
p821
aVYou claimed the expenses investigation was too expensive and we should have accepted MP's abusing the system and now you are claiming they should be paid millions.
p822
aVEvidently you didn't follow the expenses scandal, as it wasn't an accidental claim for porn.
p823
aVIt was Jacqui Smith's, the former home secretary's, husband who watched two porn films and then later he and his wife claimed it as an expense, despite arguing over it.
p824
aVThy knew it was wrong and still did it.
p825
aVRich people can pay for their own bloody pornography.
p826
aVYou literally can't defend these people spending taxpayers money on frivolous things when they all make more money than 90% of the rest of the country.   
p827
aVBS.
p828
aV90% of people are lazy and can't be bothered to try.
p829
aVThey'd rather watch X factor eating turkey twizzlers and playing candy crush.
p830
aVBeing in the top 10% of anything isn't an earth shattering achievement.
p831
aVThis is why arguments involving "most people", or "average wage" etc are silly.
p832
aVIf you really think they claimed two porn films "for the money", you're extremely deluded.
p833
aVThey obviously claimed for the hotel stay, which happened to include some films, which they forgot/couldn't be bothered to put on a separate bill.
p834
aVIt's hardly crime of the century, except in the world of self righteous Guardian readers.
p835
aVAnyone can be a soldier - shoot at stuff, try not to get killed etc.
p836
aVThat's why it's low pay.
p837
aVIt's manual labour.
p838
aVBeing a footballer requires a *lot* of skill, training, fitness, work.
p839
aVThat's why it's high pay.
p840
aVOnly a few people can do it.
p841
aVI would argue that the job of prime minister of an entire nation should require some pretty unique skills, risk, hard long hours of work, ridiculous scrutiny, loss of privacy etc that should mean it's high pay.
p842
aVThe PM should at least get a comparable amount to the CEO of an average sized company.
p843
aVSay £500k or something.
p844
aVNot the laughable £142k he gets.
p845
aVI believe when Tony Blair was PM, his wife earned considerably more than him as a barrister.
p846
aVWhich is pretty messed up.
p847
aVAnyway, you get what you pay for, and we have appalling politicians, because we pay them extremely badly.\u000a
p848
aV&gt; 90% of people are lazy and can't be bothered to try.
p849
aVThere goes 100% of the credibility of your opinions.
p850
aVAlso Jacqui Smith stated she knew her husband had watched the porn movies.
p851
aVIt wasn't accidental.
p852
aVShe was angry he did it and stated they had an argument over it.
p853
aVThere are a thousand news articles on the topic.
p854
aVIf I watched porn at my employers expense I, like virtually everyone else, would lose my job.
p855
aV67k a year is not extremely bad.
p856
aVIf you think it is you don't live in the real world.
p857
aVIt's more than 90% of the country earns.
p858
aVIt's more than a Lieutenant Colonel in the army earns and they are usually of the same educated background as an MP, have had more training, and have had to spend many years getting to that position.  
p859
aVYes.
p860
aVBy the same argument those who can't make a living in a low paid job would be OK to take up theft as it's justified in the same way.
p861
aVTheir wages have stagnated over the years in exactly the same way, add the 1980s in many parts of the UK and the government in power actively took their work away and devastated economies while the rich elite got richer.\u000a\u000a
p862
aVI'm not sure how that justifies thievery.
p863
aVTaking a £40 breakfast that's allowed might be in poor taste but it's entirely "allowed" by their employers accounts department (ie IPSA).
p864
aVIf he wasn't allowed and still did it then by all means, charge him with theft (as a few of the more obtuse expenses claimants were). 
p865
aV&gt; Taking a £40 breakfast that's allowed might be in poor taste but it's entirely "allowed" by their employers accounts department (ie IPSA).
p866
aVThere often isn't really any other option in some hotels.
p867
aVThat's the price they charge for the buffet because they know that pretty much everyone staying there will be putting it on expenses.
p868
aVIf you're travelling on business and have to get up early to meet a client or to be somewhere for 9pm (and want to do your teeth and freshen up after eating) then you either take the hotel breakfast or you go hungry.
p869
aVAnd no, staying in a Travelodge is NOT an option for some meetings - not when you have to be somewhere for 9pm.
p870
aVThe problem is that your first point is general to MPs but then you have dropped to the specific to defend your point here.
p871
aVAs stated above, I wasn't making a point, merely explaining why we have the system - a generous expenses system - that we do.
p872
aVYou then suggested this justified thievery.
p873
aVI wasn't expressing a view on the rights and wrongs of this policy, but you brought up a comparison to another situation and I'm explaining why I think it's a crap comparison.
p874
aVI used the example from the OP as an indicative case. 
p875
aV&gt; a serious and significant a job as exists\u000a\u000aHysterical.
p876
aVTry spin it harder mate.
p877
aVYou'll drill right through to Australia and you can join your brain dead buddy Abbott.
p878
aV&gt; Hysterical.
p879
aVTry spin it harder mate.
p880
aVHow many hours do you think the average MP actually works per week?
p881
aVIt varies from MP to MP.
p882
aVTo claim all of them are indispensable and doing the most important job in the country is sort of nulled when one of them keels over choking on a quails egg(bought on expenses of course) and there's no ambulances to save them.
p883
aVI don't really know what you're talking about re: Abbott.
p884
aVAs for the issue, well, I dunno - these people decide what happens to the NHS, who we kill with guns and bombs, who goes to prison, what you're taught in schools.
p885
aVI'm not sure why part of this isn't serious or significant.
p886
aVIf you think they don't do a decent job or contribute sufficiently, I'd like to know how you think paying them less will help fix this. 
p887
aVI'd like you to explain why you don't think they get paid enough(in a time of austerity) and why throwing money at them will fix that problem if you don't mind.
p888
aVWell I don't really think there is much of a problem in terms of the people in parliament.
p889
aVThere are problems with our system but I'm not convinced the caliber of MP's is one of them.
p890
aVAs such, I don't really want the system to change (though I do think that their pay should be in their own hands rather than outsourced to a quango as now).
p891
aVThat said, I don't want to see the caliber of MP *decrease* so I don't want to see the wages go down either.
p892
aVPeople often look at the job with slightly rose tinted specs and ask "Do you want the sort of people who only care about money running the show?
p893
aV" But I think that's a silly question, tbh.
p894
aVNurses don't *only* care about money, but I doubt many would show up to work if they weren't paid.
p895
aVIt doesn't mean they don't care and nor is their pursuit of money a sign they're a worse nurse than altruistic ones who would give their time for free.
p896
aVUltimately, I don't care what the motives of MPs are - can they legislate well, debate well, conduct informed and police local services for their constituencies and represent them as set out in their manifestos?
p897
aVThen I don't care if they're only in it for the pension.
p898
aVI don't believe it needs to increase from where it is right now to necessarily attract the right people, but if I saw evidence that the salaries were deterring decent, qualified people and leaving us with less qualified people, I'd absolutely support raising it and I'd question the orgasmic blood-lust of anyone that disagreed tbh. 
p899
aVSo again.
p900
aVIn a time of austerity, when across the board people are taking wage cuts and generally struggling, should MPs be exempt from a pay rise freeze?
p901
aV&gt;I'd question the orgasmic blood-lust of anyone that disagreed tbh.
p902
aVI think the allegations of pedophile rings in Westminster that have been raping children for decades along with a massive recession caused by a rampantly unregulated financial sector cause bitterness.
p903
aVThe MPs aren't doing a very good job.
p904
aVPeople don't want to pay them more.
p905
aV&gt; So again.
p906
aVIn a time of austerity, when across the board people are taking wage cuts and generally struggling, should MPs be exempt from a pay rise freeze?
p907
aVBut people aren't taking wage cuts?
p908
aVWages are going up.
p909
aVAnd I said their pay shouldn't change, so I'm not sure why you're addressing me as if I said they should all be given a bonus for being jolly good fellows.
p910
aV&gt;I think the allegations of pedophile rings in Westminster that have been raping children for decades along with a massive recession caused by a rampantly unregulated financial sector cause bitterness.
p911
aVThe MPs aren't doing a very good job.
p912
aVPeople don't want to pay them more.
p913
aV"People like Coldplay and voted for the Nazis, you can't trust people Jez.
p914
aV"\u000a\u000aBut really, the people generally want low taxes, high quality public servants and their politicians to lick their boots whilst having their reputations shredded on Have I Got News For You.
p915
aVWhat the public want doesn't impact what I feel is a justified wage for people.
p916
aVThe bit you quoted there - re: blood lust - was about a payrise with the caveat that there was evidence proving that increasing it would get better MPs.
p917
aVAgain - I'm not really sure how anyone could disagree with that unless they're a) actively revengeful towards politicians to the point of harming their own interests or b) anarchists. \u000a
p918
aV&gt; The MPs aren't doing a very good job.
p919
aVI'm curious what you base that on.
p920
aVI don't know if they're doing a good job or not - I don't know how to tell how much better or worse things could have been with a different batch of MPs.
p921
aVAre you just basing that on personal experience, or something substantial?
p922
aVJust to update you, Abbott is what you'd get if you managed to clone Neanderthal Man, put him in a suit and then let Australia vote for him.
p923
aVHe's on a mission to turn Australia backwards so hard his next policy is immigration, he's only going to take British prisoners.
p924
aV&gt;13 million\u000a\u000aI'm skeptical.
p925
aVHow does she define poverty?
p926
aV&gt;I'm skeptical.
p927
aVHow does she define poverty?
p928
aVMy guess is that she took her figures from the JRF, as they're the ones claiming 13 million in Britain live in poverty:\u000a\u000a"*People are counted as being in poverty if their household income is below 60 per cent of the median (mid-point) income for all UK households*"\u000a\u000ahttp://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/MPSE2013.pdf
p929
aVWhy isn't is gauged in absolute poverty terms?
p930
aVWouldn't that make targeting the poorest for support much easier?
p931
aVFurther by doing it based on a median in theory if everyone made a million but the richest made a lot more you would eventually have millionaires who were in "poverty".
p932
aVHaving seen actual poverty in the third world I highly doubt 1/4 of the country is living like that.
p933
aVNot to say that there aren't those in dire straights, I just think we need to be real about the situation to have any chance of addressing it.
p934
aVNobody here is actually giving you the reasons why people use relative poverty as a measure, so I'll go through a few of them.
p935
aV1.
p936
aVRelative poverty gives a good measure of social exclusion.
p937
aVSocial exclusion is defined, roughly, as not being able to do the sorts of things that we expect people to be able to do in society.
p938
aV2.
p939
aVIn terms of outcomes, relative poverty is a pretty good indicator.
p940
aVYou can look at health, education, imprisonment, mortality, or whatever, and see serious declines as incomes drop too far below the median.
p941
aVThis is largely a consequence of social exclusion (see above).
p942
aV3.
p943
aVIn rich countries like the UK, there are often expectations that people should be able to maintain a standard of living that is something above baseline survival.
p944
aV4.
p945
aVRelative poverty also gives a measure of the level of community deprivation.
p946
aVThis gives a sense of the lack of resources that particular communities have to deal with problems.
p947
aV5.
p948
aVAbsolute poverty is not overly easy to determine.
p949
aVWhat defines a basic need, and how o we know whether or not people are able to fulfil them?
p950
aVWhat level of access to housing, clothing, nutrition, medicine constitutes deprivation?
p951
aVThese things are not easy to agree on, in the first instance, and equally difficult to measure.
p952
aVYou might not agree with any or all of these factors, but it pays to know the reasons that things are measured in the way they are.\u000a
p953
aVThanks for the actual answer - I think most people thought I was attacking it but was genuinely interested in understanding where it comes from.
p954
aVYour answer makes a lot of sense, I think poverty is a very evocative word, especially so for me so I always take these stats with a grain of salt.
p955
aV&gt;if everyone made a million but the richest made a lot more you would eventually have millionaires who were in "poverty"\u000a\u000aNo, you wouldn't, that's not how medians work.
p956
aVIf practically everyone made £1,000,000 but a few percent made £1,000,000,000, then the median income would still be £1,000,000 and the poverty cutoff would be £600,000.
p957
aVAre you perhaps confusing the median with the mean?
p958
aVBecause if 'everyone' made a million but the top few made *billions* - then if it were calculated on the mean your statement would be true.
p959
aVAnd that's why you don't try and pick flaws in someone's argument without reading up on the difference between mode, median and mean
p960
aVYou're right but the stat is still disingenuous.
p961
aVIf all those 13mil were earning £25k (they arent) then you shouldnt say they are in poverty.
p962
aVIf you have basic needs met then you arent in poverty, there are many people who arent but nowhere near 13 million.
p963
aV&gt;If you have basic needs met then you arent in poverty\u000a\u000aI want to be clear precisely what you mean by this, because while it sounds like "Common sense" it's actually *more* extreme than even Victorian attitudes.
p964
aVSomeone in a Workhouse has their basic needs met, but the people running those weren't quite disingenuous enough to claim they had therefore eliminated poverty.
p965
aVNot that there aren't very valid reasons to distrust the report, or the idea of "relative poverty", but in my opinion, it's not just those at the absolute bottom who are deserved of assistance.
p966
aVNot sure if comparing living standards of our worst off to that of the "third world" is really something we should be too proud of either, I think we could at least do better than that.
p967
aVI get that - however it's the word "poverty" that I take issue with.
p968
aVI'm not suggesting we let people starve and say "well they starved slower than some Africans so it's not all so bad!
p969
aV"\u000a\u000aFor me I just feel that the word poverty is bandied about with out any context in this country.
p970
aVThere is a context.
p971
aVThere's fairly solid international consensus that 60% of median income represents poverty.
p972
aVIt's not simply an arbitrary number (although an arbitrary cut-off was made at some point); the 60% figure is where the effects of poverty are generally quite acute.
p973
aVThe trouble with that number is it gets better if people in the middle get poorer.
p974
aVIf the middle fifth of the population had a chunk of their incomes transferred to the top fifth, it would lift many lower earners out of poverty.
p975
aVThat is a problem, but it doesn't play out as simply as you might think.
p976
aVWhen median incomes drop, there is a removal of demand from the economy.
p977
aVThis lowers prices in many important areas, particularly housing.
p978
aVSimilarly, many realities of society are oriented around median incomes.
p979
aVThis includes social expectations, assumptions being made by schools, stigmatisation, expectations around transport and work equipment, and endless other factors.
p980
aVIt pans out that being relatively poor is significantly problematic.
p981
aV&gt; I get that - however it's the word "poverty" that I take issue with.
p982
aVPoverty just means scarcity of material goods or wealth; if you earn less than 60% of the bottom median UK income, I would say it's fair that is considered poverty.
p983
aVStarving in Africa or destitute in India would be an extreme example of poverty, but not the only one.
p984
aVOf course there will always be those who are considered to be living in poverty by the JRF's definition, but the point is that now 20% of Britain (if we are to trust their figures) live like that.
p985
aVEdit: I see this comment has been downvoted, anyone kindly care to say why this is the case?
p986
aVIt is easy to look at absolute poverty - it makes sense - if you don't have enough calories or good enough housing you're poor.
p987
aVIt's a lot harder to look at relative poverty and look at its effect.
p988
aVThese would be things likte social/political representation.
p989
aVIt is unlikely the 'relative poor' are able to get their voice heard.
p990
aVThey can live but they can't participate fully in society.
p991
aVPeople don't want to look at these questions.
p992
aVFor me, poverty means nothing if it isn't relative.
p993
aV&gt; It is easy to look at absolute poverty - it makes sense - if you don't have enough calories or good enough housing you're poor.
p994
aVTry to define "good enough"  housing in a way that most people would agree with and you'll find it's not even actually "easy" to define absolute poverty in the first place.
p995
aVA roof and four walls?
p996
aVRunning water and a toilet?
p997
aVElectricity and heating?
p998
aVHow much space per person?
p999
aVA room for every two children?
p1000
aVOr every four children?
p1001
aVOr every child?
p1002
aVWhat if someone can't afford the heating bill because the lack of, I dunno, double glazing makes it too high?
p1003
aVDouble glazing sure doesn't sound like a minimum requirement, that's luxury, right?
p1004
aVBut then someone not being able to pay the heating bill does sound like poverty.
p1005
aVEt cetera ad infinitum.
p1006
aVI mean, I obviously agree with your broader point - but even the idea that absolute poverty *would* be easy to define isn't all that clear.
p1007
aVWell, it is not 'easy', but it is certainly easier than relative poverty when you might be measuring political inclusiveness.
p1008
aVInstead the World Bank will use a dollar a day or whatever it is currently.... a lot easier to make graphs...
p1009
aVI don't really see how pegging an absolute poverty level at, say, 1 dollar a day is easier or less arbitrary than pegging a relative poverty level at, say, 60% of the median income, as the Brits appear to do.
p1010
aVBoth are fairly arbitrary but apparently do the job. 
p1011
aVI think I'd prefer it too, if you're on JSA, you're really living week to week and can't save money for emergencies, which means if and when you're sanctioned, and people still don't get this, you're left with nothing, zero money for a minimum of three weeks.
p1012
aVTHIS is why people need food banks, why they lose hope, and despair can set in and terrible things happen.
p1013
aVThere's multiple reasons people end up on welfare, and they're often single people with no family, and no friends, and then the state decides their lives don't even have the value of JSA.
p1014
aVIt might stop people being able to think that everyone's just fine because we're not living in shanty towns in Rwanda.
p1015
aVNO, we're not living as horribly as the poor in India, but should we not be aspiring to treat our poorest better than that in a first world country that deals in trillions each year?
p1016
aV&gt; emergencies\u000a\u000aWhat emergencies would there be that welfare wouldnt pay for?
p1017
aVYour freezer / oven / bike / car breaking for example.
p1018
aVYou pop in the Jobcentre, and let them know your freezer's broken, they tend to not just issue you with a voucher for £200 and tell you to pop next door to Currys.
p1019
aV(and I wouldn't expect them to, but perhaps all the cuts to emergency short term loans, grants to help people get back into work, and all the other little cuts designed to just make it that much harder to get back on your feet...aren't really helping.
p1020
aV)
aVOf course, if you're in rented accommodation then the landlord would have to replace those ... if you're not in rented accommodation then ... lucky you :D
p1021
aVI had to supply my own oven/fridge/freezer etc when I moved in.
p1022
aVThey have the responsibility of the boiler and the bathroom stuff, but afaik that's about it.
p1023
aVBare walls and bare stone floors, and every room empty except the bathroom.
p1024
aVAlso, had me and the parents spend about half a week cleaning the walls, ceilings and repainting it to remove the layer of smoke and grease left by the last lot.
p1025
aVStill hugely grateful for a roof over my head, but you don't just get a free fully furnished flat, and you can't just snap your fingers and get a free 50" flat screen with SKY subcription thrown in either :)
p1026
aVSomeone has never lived in a council house I see.
p1027
aVIm fairly certain you can get more then just JSA that will cover those.
p1028
aVCertainly used to be 'crisis loans' and 'emergency funds', but AFAIK they've been scrapped, after all, we have Wonga now.
p1029
aV[Not that I'm suggesting the Tories would have anything to gain by pushing people into the desperation of turning to payday loan companies.
p1030
aV](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/top-tory-funder-runs-highcost-loans-company-8656356.html)
p1031
aVPicking absolute numbers is difficult.
p1032
aVIf most people in the UK made a million, prices would also reflect that.
p1033
aVThe bus would cost thousands because where do you think the million for the driver come from?
p1034
aVBread would costs thousands because that's where the baker's million comes from.
p1035
aVThe NHS would cost (I don't have words big enough) so we can pay all the nurses their millions.
p1036
aVAnd very quickly you'd find that half a million just doesn't get you far.
p1037
aVAnd while I doubt many of us are living in 3rd-world style poverty - if stereotypical old lady is at risk of dying this winter because she can't afford heating, that's poverty.
p1038
aVMaybe not muddy water and mud hut poverty, but still an embarrassing standard for what's apparently the 5th?
p1039
aV6th?
p1040
aVlargest economy in the world.
p1041
aVSeriously.
p1042
aVLet that sink in.
p1043
aVWe are one of the largest economies in the world - and we're predicted to climb a few more rungs yet.
p1044
aVNow look around you?\u000a
p1045
aVAbsolute poverty is often used in studies, but absolute poverty by any measure has been always declining, and that's no use to attack your political opponents. 
p1046
aVAbsolute poverty may be declining, but relative poverty, globally and within many countries, is rising.
p1047
aVWhat is the effect of relative poverty?
p1048
aVIs it possible for a relatively poor person to properly engage in social decisions?
p1049
aVDo they have as much of a voice as the rich?
p1050
aVThat is where the problem comes.
p1051
aVI agree that reducing income inequality is beneficial.
p1052
aVBut you're deceptively using poverty to describe income inequality.
p1053
aVIf a minority (business owners) control resources, technology or the means to communicate it would obviously affect poor people's ability to shape and control their society.
p1054
aVPoverty is about power and income is a relatively good indicator of someone's power.
p1055
aV&gt;Why isn't is gauged in absolute poverty terms?
p1056
aVWouldn't that make targeting the poorest for support much easier?
p1057
aVBecause JRF, those who quote that figure like Ms. Yaqoob, and other organisations who use similar measures and call it "poverty" are much more interested in engaging in misleading political point scoring against the government than caring about the welfare of people in real poverty who can't provide for basic needs like food, water, heating and shelter.
p1058
aVIt's not often that I feel confident speaking in absolute statements when it comes to politics, but I am 100% confident in this; Never trust anyone who uses such measures and calls it "poverty" instead of a measure related to inequality.
p1059
aVThey have ulterior motives that don't include the welfare of the truly poor.
p1060
aV&gt; than caring about the welfare of people in real poverty who can't provide for basic needs like food, water, heating and shelter.
p1061
aVThe report considers any single person earning less than £128 per week, or £357 for a couple and two children to be in poverty (after housing costs are deducted).
p1062
aVWe could argue whether this counts as poverty or not, but I still think that's going to make living extremely difficult, especially if it's in London, even with access to basic amenities. 
p1063
aVOutside London that is a very livable wage.
p1064
aVThat might not be true in London, but in that case you should move.
p1065
aVAfter you take away costs of food, clothing, personal hygiene, transport, and non-household bills (like phones), there's next to nothing for savings left.
p1066
aVYes, it's theoretically possible, but even with the absolute tightest controls on spending and nothing on leisure.
p1067
aVAs for moving, that's not always going to be an option for everyone.
p1068
aV&gt;After you take away costs of food, clothing, personal hygiene, transport, and non-household bills (like phones), there's next to nothing for savings left.
p1069
aVNot really no.
p1070
aVIm not even sure why you brought up savings, presumably its for when they retire, but give them extra money on welfare (which in all likelihood theyll just spend anyway) and not just raise the pensions fund?
p1071
aV&gt;Not really no.
p1072
aVCare to show how this was worked out?
p1073
aVFood and transport alone could realistically alone make up much more than half of £130.
p1074
aVYes, £130 is possible to live off (the poor aren't by and large, dying in the streets), but looking at the ONS figures on average monthly expenditures, it's not much more than just living.
p1075
aVRemember, it is still £130 *or less* that counts as poverty, and London isn't the only expensive place to live in the UK.
p1076
aVAs for savings, no, I did not mean pensions, I meant savings for rainy-days, emergencies, financial security and future spendings.
p1077
aVIf your budget can't even allow for a measly £50 or so a month, that there is something you need to address.
p1078
aVYay for relative poverty, the idea the left had when they finally realized nobody cares about income inequality. 
p1079
aVThose damned Liberals trying to make us notice the peasants!
p1080
aVOr, those damned lefties trying to mislead people by re-branding income inequality as poverty, giving us numbers which bear no real relation to actual poverty.
p1081
aVI am living in poverty at the moment.
p1082
aVI'm telling you that from my laptop, because I just turned off my main pc, so I could get into bed in my reasonably comfortable house in a decent neighborhood.
p1083
aVBecause poverty, as defined by the lefties you deride, references median incomes, you can have increasing increasing inequality while poverty decreases.
p1084
aVIndeed, where high incomes increase, low incomes remain static, and median incomes decrease, you would expect this to happen.
p1085
aVEven as someone whos left, I think those statistics are skewed.
p1086
aVBeing below average doesn't mean you're impoverished
p1087
aV&gt; Being below average doesn't mean you're impoverished\u000a\u000aWhich is okay, because that's not the measure they used.
p1088
aVThis is the measure they used:\u000a\u000a&gt;  People are counted as being in poverty if their household income is below 60 per cent of the median (mid-point) income for all UK households.
p1089
aVGiven that median income is well below the mean, which is what is usually meant by 'average', and given we are talking about incomes significantly below the median, suggesting that the measure of poverty is what is 'below average' is a misrepresentation.
p1090
aVWhich is an absolutely batshit crazy measure of poverty.
p1091
aVExplain? 
p1092
aVpoverty should be defined in absolute terms - do you have the money to eat, clothe, shelter or not.
p1093
aV"poverty" in the UK is more like 'are you able to keep up with the joneses?
p1094
aV" "Do you have an ipad?
p1095
aV" etc.
p1096
aVIt's obscene.
p1097
aVThe left is absolutely obsessed with the rich, as if the rich being richer has some detrimental impact on their own lives.
p1098
aVIt doesn't.
p1099
aVThe gap between rich and poor is irrelevant if everyone is better off than previous generations, which we undoubtedly are.
p1100
aVAbsolute poverty is certainly the more important, but /u/MasterEk explained quite well why relative poverty is still important: \u000a\u000ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2rc8fe/on_austerity_in_the_uk/cneoeis\u000a\u000aSimply put, relative poverty is the standard and living and income far lower than those sitting in the middle of income distribution, to the point that excludes them from normal and expected patterns of living standards.
p1101
aVIpad is only a toy, but not being able to afford a computer and internet connection would only make it harder to find work or communicate with friends and family.
p1102
aVSure, I could live like a monk; without internet access, transportation, wear a hair shirt and eat only bread and water - and still be better off than I would be in 1200.
p1103
aVBut there isn't any reason why someone should be expected to live like that today.
p1104
aVThere will always be relative poverty, but if the JRF report is correct, that's 13 million people (or 20% of the population) who aren't even on 60% of the median income, the demographics is skewed too heavily on low income households. 
p1105
aVWe have different definitions of poverty then.
p1106
aVPoverty is not being able to eat, shelter or clothe yourself.
p1107
aVIt's not about if you're got an internet connection or not.
p1108
aVComparing yourself to the rest of society is simply "keeping up with the jonses" and a pretty pointless way to live.
p1109
aV&gt; We have different definitions of poverty then.
p1110
aVThe definition employed in the report is the same one used by the UK government, EU and other charities, it's not as if it was plucked right  out of thin air:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.poverty.org.uk/summary/social%20exclusion.shtml\u000a\u000a&gt;Poverty is not being able to eat, shelter or clothe yourself.
p1111
aVIf we are going by dictionary definitions, it just means "the state of being extremely poor", of which could just easily apply to either absolute or relative definitions of poverty.
p1112
aVLike I said, internet connection would make a good indication of poverty; not all family households without internet is poor, but poor households are less likely to have one.
p1113
aVAnd in either case, they are going to be at a relative disadvantage to those with. 
p1114
aV1st world problems really isn't it.
p1115
aVNo one's starving or having to walk 20 miles to get water.
p1116
aVWhat does an internet connection mean?
p1117
aVIt means the ability to spread your views, integrate yourself into social decision-making and get your voice heard.
p1118
aVMaybe 'poverty' should mean consumption, but really it should be a measure of your power within society.
p1119
aVDemocracy can't possibly work if one person has the economic power of 100.
p1120
aVRegardless of whether the 'poor' are getting enough calories, have adequate housing, or in fact, an internet connection.
p1121
aVThe key UK government measures take 60 per cent of median income as the poverty line.
p1122
aVAh, good old "relative poverty" - if the average family can afford two holidays a year, you are now officially poor if you can only afford one.
p1123
aVAlso, free time to vote, socialise, spread your ideas and agitate.... shouldn't be allowed that.
p1124
aVThe average British family can afford two holidays a year?
p1125
aVYou are right to be skeptical.
p1126
aVIn the UK, Poverty is defined relative to the average wage, which means there will *always* be a percentage of people living in "poverty", even if they aren't actually poor, especially by global standards.
p1127
aVDefining poverty in this way gives lefties something to unnecessarily kick up a fuss about, even though there were probably similar numbers of people in "poverty" under Labour.
p1128
aVIndeed, the biggest driver of the increase in poverty has probably been mass immigration from poor Eastern European countries within the EU. 
p1129
aVThat's not true.
p1130
aVGet better at maths.
p1131
aVIt is possible to have a distribution of income where there is no relative poverty.
p1132
aVIf the poverty rate is 60% of the median income then it is of course possible to have half the population between 60%-100% of median income.
p1133
aVSo if you killed off (for sake of argument) people at the top-end of the income scale, you'd improve the stats for those in relative poverty, as the median shifts downward?
p1134
aVThe median would likely shift downward in that situation, but not by as much as you'd imagine.
p1135
aVYou might be thinking of mean averages (where that shift would be more pronounced), whereas this measure uses median.
p1136
aVAs the richest several percent are dramatically richer than average (i.e.
p1137
aVthere are a very small number of millionaires and the gap between millionaire and average is much larger than between minimum wage and average), you could remove the top few percent without median being affected much or at all.
p1138
aVQuick GCSE refresher.
p1139
aVMedian works by lining everyone up in a row in order, counting exactly halfway along the row, and taking that middle person's value as the average.
p1140
aVImagine you had 100 people, the middle 60 earned £30k, the lowest 35 earned £10k, and the top 5 earned £1m.
p1141
aVThe median (the 50th person) would be £30k.
p1142
aVIf you remove the top 5%, the new median (the 47th person in our now shorter line) would still be £30k.
p1143
aVObviously that's over simplified, but the principle is correct.
p1144
aVEdit: I meant to include mean figures for the same sample set to illustrate the difference.
p1145
aVThe mean for the original set of 100 people would be a much larger £71.5k.
p1146
aVThe mean for the reduced 95 person set would be £22.6k.
p1147
aVThis shows that the mean is both far more volatile and a less realistic representation of reality (our original "average" is twice or more than what 95% of people earn).
p1148
aVAusterity in principle is a ridiculous economic concept to begin with.
p1149
aVAttempting to reduce the deficit while still undergoing economic difficulty, or before growth has even returned, is nothing short of economically suicidal.
p1150
aVAs opposed to shrinking, cutting spending and investment the state need to provide stimulus to the economy by devaluing the currency, investing in infrastructural investment projects thereby catalysing economic activity, boosting business confidence and in turn coercing private enterprise to invest and drive the economy out of a crisis.
p1151
aVBy shrinking the state does itself no favours, a lack of intervention on its behalf results in a blow to business and investor confidence thereby making companies more reluctant to invest and take on new workers.
p1152
aVIt's unreasonable to assume that private enterprise will pick up where the state has left off, it hasn't worked in the Eurozone and it never will.
p1153
aV&gt; devaluing the currency\u000a\u000aThat means taking money out of savings and assets (i.e., houses).
p1154
aVThat's not likely to go down well.
p1155
aVIt would make more sense, if that's the road they're going down, to either raise a one-time tax or increase income tax.
p1156
aVIt's also a pretty serious issue for anyone holding British debt (i.e., all other countries) - people don't like it when you just decide arbitrarily to pay them less back than they expected.
p1157
aVAnd when your country is dependent on selling debt (as we are) to fund the public sector, we really need confidence to be high that we will repay money.
p1158
aVCurrency devaluation would be [utterly catastrophic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso_crisis#Economic_impacts).
p1159
aV&gt; investing in infrastructural investment projects thereby catalysing economic activity\u000a\u000aThere's a strong argument that this is a good thing.
p1160
aVI think they probably should be doing this - perhaps a huge new social housing project, which would also help with the housing shortage.
p1161
aVUnfortunately, you do need to find some money to do this in the first place, and our deficit is already eye-watering.
p1162
aV&gt; boosting business confidence\u000a\u000aThat's more or less what austerity does.
p1163
aVIt boosts confidence for people investing in the UK, either through bonds or through business.
p1164
aVYou're sending a message that, even if times are tight, we'll bear the brunt and make sure we pay our debts.
p1165
aVAusterity is all about confidence.
p1166
aVI'd guess that we have two choices - levy a tax, or wait for economic growth.
p1167
aVI think a tax, probably a one-time progressive tax (maybe on property?
p1168
aV), is probably the sensible choice, with the money going exclusively to infrastructure investment.
p1169
aVBut that's not going to be a popular option, and will kill whatever party puts it into place.
p1170
aVAnd will likely prompt a flight of wealth out of the UK.
p1171
aVAnd a lot of households are just scraping by, so that would likely push them under.
p1172
aVSo ...
p1173
aVI guess ... it's complicated.

p1181
aVnot quite http://chrisbrosnahan.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/iain-duncan-smith-and-scrounger.html
p1182
aVThat that blog shows, to me, is the minister in charge of the DWP doing his job, answering questions about it and the papers running the story with 'scroungers' in the title.
p1183
aVThe blog suggests he should be complaining to the papers about their own narrative.
p1184
aVSo to follow that to its natural conclusion would such bloggers not take issue with cabinet ministers attempting to dictate how they should be reporting on?
p1185
aVOf course they would.
p1186
aVContrary twats.
p1187
aVperhaps because as has been pointed out the major issue with benefits is not people taking 'unfair' advantage of the system (ie scroungers) and the issue is quite a tougher question that cannot be summed up in a sound byte.
p1188
aVwhere the people on benefits are very very rarely to blame.
p1189
aVhowever the minister is happy to allow this misconception to not only hold but actively promote it as it give him excuses to cut more and more as people suffer while avoiding the real problems with low wages in both the private and public sector.
p1190
aVthat IMO makes him a bit of a twat.
p1191
aVIt's pretty clear to anyone with eyes or ears that that's what he thinks of people on benefits.
p1192
aVArguing over the semantics of what he has or hasn't said doesn't mean she's wrong. 
p1193
aVYou cant just make stuff up and claim you're "reading between the lines".
p1194
aVI don't need to read between IDS's lines. 
p1195
aVSure I can - I just did it.
p1196
aVJoking aside, why IDS making it so hard for people to get benefits?
p1197
aVWhy is he forcing people to go on courses that achieve nothing?
p1198
aVWhy is he forcing people to apply for jobs that they don't want to or physically cannot do?
p1199
aVWhy are there so many sanctions?
p1200
aVWhy are so many sanctions being appealed?
p1201
aVIt's because IDS thinks there is a significant portion of people on benefits who are not entitled to them, not deserving of them or not working hard enough for them.
p1202
aVThat's close enough to the definition of a "scrounger" for me. 
p1203
aV&gt; Arguing over the semantics of what he has or hasn't said doesn't mean she's wrong.
p1204
aVPutting words in his mouth isn't "semantics".
p1205
aVShe claims he "happily labels the poor people as 'scroungers'": a serious accusation she makes no attempt to substantiate. 
p1206
aVYou're just making stuff up, right?
p1207
aVSalma says that 50% of benefit claimants are pensioners (by definition out of work) and that another 50% are in work.
p1208
aVThat makes 100%.
p1209
aVIs she really suggesting that there are no out of work but non-retired benefit claimants?
p1210
aVOr is something wrong with my maths? \u000a
p1211
aVProbably poorly worded, but I would interpret that as 50% are pensioners, and 50% (of the rest) are in work.
p1212
aVthat leave 25% or total claimants now remove the short term unemployed and those receiving disability benefit and those working as carers for relatives, i am assuming the 50% in work also includes people who have children and are receiving some form of child benefit.
p1213
aVand you are left with very few scroungers, a lot less than people like the daily mail would want you to think.
p1214
aVWell the definition of a pensioner isn't someone who is out of work.
p1215
aVSo it theoretically could be the case that those two bouts of 50% are one and the same group of people.
p1216
aVObviously they aren't, but there's nothing impossible about there being an overlap. 
p1217
aVI had the same thought.
p1218
aVEven if you consider that pensioners might take on work to supplement the pensions (which have been utterly plundered by the Government and companies) it hardly seems to make enough room for claimants of working age.
p1219
aVThe fall in pension schemes has to do with the fact that pensions cost many times more than they used to on account of people living longer - so the pots have been drained dry.
p1220
aVThat, the Gov allowing pensions holidays during the good times and Gordon Brown quietly introducing taxation on them.

p1227
aVAnyways, it's surely just a temporary spike while it's highly visible, there's high voted comments.

p1249
aVThe thing about 'hard-working' is that it's a qualitative (and relative) measure, so it can mean pretty much anything.
p1250
aVThe man who works a 60-hour week and receives a generous salary sounds like he works hard.
p1251
aVBut what about the man who works a 60-hour week in a mine and receives fuck-all.

p1254

aVUnbelievable that people should have to explain simple market economics on here. 
p1284
aVI'm simply maintaining that it's absolutely balls, the continued use of 'hardworking' when it doesn't really mean anything except the gentle massage of people's ego while he's slipping it in from behind.
p1285
aVOF course I understand how it works.
p1286
aVI'm just suggesting we stop promoting the myth that anyone who's not successful just isn't hardworking enough.

aVYeah that's the thing, salary doesn't dictate how hard you work or how hard you studied.
p1288
aVI mean look at the remuneration people in finance get.

p1300
aVthis is a very small problem within the system and the truth is much more complex that we could be having constructive argument about.
p1301
aVbut for the minister it is easier to push the 'scroungers' narrative (of course he will never actually use the word when its so easy to insinuate), while cutting more and more , and implementing more red tape that attack the weakest in society as people struggle (such as the massively misjudged changes to disability allowance saving us almost nothing after costs and cause a lot of distress for many people), with out have to address the real problems of both public and private sector wages being well under the true cost of living.

p1304

aVExcept he doesn't label the poor as scroungers, claiming for breakfast sounds quite legitimate; and since it's unlikely he chose that hotel we can't really blame him for the price, and the £1.5 million in taxpayer money goes to the Swanbourne Estate as part of EU farming subsidies that *reduce food prices for the poor*, and it isn't even his wife's estate (she's a trustee, not an owner).
p1310

p1318
aVI know people who live on much less.
p1319
aVYes, I find the idea of this overweight, bald headed scrotal sack claiming more than my weekly food budget on one sodding meal and charging it back to the tax payer ludicrously offensive.
p1320
aVHave you ever been obliged to stay at a hotel as part of your job?
p1321
aVIf you were then would you expect your employer to also pay for breakfast?
p1322
aVBut I guess you're slim with a full head of hair so different rules apply. 
p1323
aVYes and they do.
p1324
aVOnly I am not getting paid £67,000 a year for a part time job, I am not a multi millionaire and I am obliged not to eat at 4 and 5 star hotels for a living.
p1325
aVIt is ludicrous to compare.
p1326
aVYou still cost your employer several days worth of your food budget if you get the hotel breakfast.

aVIf you're a busy person, what are you more likely to do, carefully sort through all of your expenses and which will then go for assessment for eligibility, or just dump all expenses on the bean-counters who make the assessment and save yourself some bother?
p1344
aVThat's how you get people making claims for things like duck houses which would never be approved and the people making the claim know that they wouldn't be approved.
p1345
aVIf my accounts department would allow me to dump receipts on them and they'd take care of the rest, that's what I'd do, bloody hate doing expenses.
p1346
aVThat is not to say that the expense system was not used as a pay-rise by the back door, or that some MPs did not take advantage of the system way beyond the spirit and at times the letter of the law.
p1347
aVHowever using a cost that was never incurred as the basis for an attack is utterly disingenuous and detracts from all other arguments because it demonstrates bad faith.

aVIf you're going to attack him, do it on the grounds on the subsidised bars in parliament, on the expensive lunches they are allowed to claim which are also subsidised by the tax payer.
p1353
aVThere's no need to make piss-poor, disingenuous arguments when MPs do have their noses deep in the trough and the whole system leans to their benefit.
p1354
aVNo, we attack them on all of those, including this ridiculous £39 breakfast. 
p1355
aV&gt;duck houses which would never be approved\u000a\u000aDidn't the duck house get approved?
p1356
aVI don't believe so.
p1357
aVIt was marked "Unallowable" or some such but the press said that there was no concrete proof that it had not been paid - because proving a negative is such an easy thing to do, especially when no one anticipates the need.
p1358
aVNo, he intended to claim for the breakfast.
p1359
aVHe just didn't actually get any money.
p1360
aV...that's what I said?
p1361
aVHe doesn't get off the hook just because he didn't get away with it
p1362
aV[deleted]
p1363
aVI don't know anyone in my company who would behave that way.
p1364
aVI think you'll find that most people are more honest and honourable than that.
p1365
aVUmm me?
p1366
aVWhen I do fieldwork I get to claim £50 a day for sustinence and I just have to write down what I spent.
p1367
aVI literally only claim for bare essential food and drink because I have to buy ready to eat stuff as opposed to cook my own food which is much cheaper.
p1368
aVIf I go for beers later, I pay myself, even though technically I can claim the tab for networking with the other researchers.
p1369
aVI could just say "I spent £50 every day eating at resturaunts, and spent £20 on taxis and took the workers to the bar and spent £30 on a round for them" and that money would go into my account, no questions, no enquiry.
p1370
aVI don't ask for the money because it's not mine. 
p1371
aVAnd, of course, the kicker is that the money he was trying to claim actually *is* yours (well, all of ours).
p1372
aVYup.
p1373
aVTechnically Im funded by a research council so mine is public cash too.
p1374
aVMe too!
p1375
aVI'm also a researcher and funded by a research council.
p1376
aVI always try to buy the cheapest train tickets, stay in budget hotels, avoid taxis if I can and don't take the piss on food &amp; drink (most of my expenses claims are boots/sainsburys meal deals), although I have claimed for a pint on occasion.
p1377
aVI know the money I'm funded by comes from public funds and I feel it is my duty to get the best value for that money.
p1378
aVI had to buy a fairly high end workstation recently and took a little time to bargain with the supplier in order to keep the budget sane - I know plenty of others who just accept the first quote they get (I'd have spent £3000 more if I'd done that...).
p1379
aVYeah I spent 3 weeks (which was maybe too long) reducing the costs of my supplies for the lab.
p1380
aVIn the end I brought it down about £300.... which when you take into account my wages was probably wasting cash... but the university hadn't had any discounts with them yet, so hopefully in the long run this will help.
p1381
aVukpolitics sciencecrew ASSEMBLEEEEE \u000a\u000a    *blows bugle*
p1382
aVI have no research costs, as I sit in a dark room on my computer all day. 
p1383
aVWhat is it you do that requires a £3000 workstation?
p1384
aVJust wondering.
p1385
aVI'm doing research into solving inverse imaging problems and electromagnetic problems.
p1386
aVMostly high-order finite element methods for the bulk of it, which I write code (C++ and MATLAB for testing) for.
p1387
aVIt basically boils down to iterations of very large linear algebra problems, so I need lots of memory and a quick CPU (or several CPUs - although the parallel stuff is probs a year away).
p1388
aVThe idea is to recover information about an object in terms of it's electromagnetic properties based only on measurements you take using electro-magnets e.g.
p1389
aVif you want to detect an iron object inside something you know it'll be highly conductive, etc.
p1390
aVI've got access to much larger machines, but this is a lot more useful for testing and development than having to use time on a cluster.
p1391
aVI was going to say, I would have thought working on a cluster would have been easier/cheaper for most purposes.
p1392
aVI have access to a departmental cluster and we have a HPC cluster if the department cluster isn't fast enough (although I have limited time on that).
p1393
aVI do most of my work on there. 
p1394
aVYeah, there are arguments for it but I need so much memory and I when I'm developing the code I don't really want to sit in a PBS queue waiting while twiddling my thumbs!
p1395
aVThe grant had money set aside for it and I got pretty good value for money given that they'd basically budgeted for something fairly weak in the proposal.
p1396
aVI'm allowed to claim £15 a day for my lunch.
p1397
aVI get a £3 meal deal from the Co-op.
p1398
aVOne time I got a Nando's and felt like I was taking the piss so didn't do it again.
p1399
aVExactly the same, I'd be embarrassed personally to spend to the expenses limit just because I could, even more so if I was a public servant.
p1400
aVTrouble is, he sees everyone in the light he sees himself in, which means he thinks everyone's out to fuck the system for every penny they can get.
p1401
aVEDIT: I remember getting a £10 lunch allowance on a training course on a job, and while I admit I went 'large' in BK, I still used a voucher and spent about £5, I could have spent a tenner I'm sure but I'd have felt like I was taking advantage for the sake of it.
p1402
aVLast time I was at a conference I decided to sleep on the floor of a friend's living room rather than claim for a hotel.
p1403
aVNot everyone's out to grab as much as they can.
p1404
aVI pity you for having such a grim view of humanity.
p1405
aV*\u000a''I'm a bit of a prick so everyone else must be too, they all just pretend to be nice in public so they can get what they want''*\u000a\u000aama rite r ama rite?

aV&gt; Find me someone who does not try to push work expenses to the limit and you may have a point.
p1407
aV\u005c*Raises hand*
p1408
aVI've done a lot of travelling and I've had a lot of food on expenses as part of my academic travels.
p1409
aVIt would take serious effort for me to spend £40 on breakfast.
p1410
aVI would probably not be able to move afterwards.
p1411
aVhttp://www.roast-restaurant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/breakfast-menu-web1.pdf\u000a\u000aOne of those, a couple of coffees and 12.5% service charge should do it.\u000a
p1412
aVYeah, I am not sure a restaurant with a website that slick and a page entitled "Our Philosophy" is really the example to use.
p1413
aVWhilst I appreciate he could've gone to a greasy spoon, it's not atypical for somewhere to go for a breakfast meeting, especially for someone of the stature of a cabinet minister.
p1414
aVI picked that one as I've had AM meetings over bacon and eggs in there myself, and I'm no one special. 
p1415
aVIt is a bit different when it is a pool of finite public money, i.e.
p1416
aVit gets taken from someone that actually needs it - the money doesn't appear out of thin air.
p1417
aVSimple, we take the money from G4S, ATOS, Maximus, Avanta, and dozens of other shitty private companies providing less than zero value to taxpayers, and use that.
p1418
aVGlad to help.
p1419
aVPrivate money is finite too. 
p1420
aVLiberals don't understand this.
p1421
aV&gt; When and who did he call scroungers?
p1422
aVI googled "Iain Duncan Smith scroungers" and all I got in return was click-baity web articles going back to the video clip from Question Time.
p1423
aVAs far as I can tell, IDS had never used that term in public.
p1424
aVIt was a cheap but effective sound-bite.
p1425
aV[deleted]
p1426
aVHe was telling the truth, he's hit the middle classes, the low paid and those on welfare instead.
p1427
aVI agree, trouble is, with IDS, it's not about what he says, but what he does.
p1428
aVHe strips away benefits from the most vulnerable, and then claims he's 'encouraging them back to work'.
p1429
aVHe's spent SO much taxpayer money on all manner of various ways to ensure that that money doesn't reach those in need, but instead gets siphoned off to incompetent private companies.
p1430
aVHe's not daft, but he IS a sociopath with no empathy for the the race of humans his kind shares a planet with.
p1431
aV&gt; he IS a sociopath with no empathy for the the race of humans his kind shares a planet with.
p1432
aVWow, you went off the deep end kind of fast there didn't you.
p1433
aVThere is no universal agreement on the effect of providing welfare to people long-term.
p1434
aVNo country has unemployment support, housing support, and so on, completely worked out.
p1435
aVThe aim is to provide help for those in need, but not to have a system that allows people to simply not bother trying to work.
p1436
aVThe perception, right or wrong, is that there are a lot of people not bothering.
p1437
aVSo the politicians are fighting over them.
p1438
aVBecause there's an election coming up.
p1439
aVSo, Tories are saying that the scrounging should be prevented, and Labour are painting that as an attack on anybody claiming benefits.
p1440
aVPerhaps Labour think there are no scroungers and everybody who has ever claimed benefits is doing everything in their power to find work?
p1441
aVPerhaps the Tories think everybody claiming is a scrounger who actually has a job and is just claiming on the side, or a family of 12 kids and never worked a day?
p1442
aVOr, perhaps, both are actually somewhere in the middle, and are both aiming to improve the system, and in doing so improve the standard of living for everybody.
p1443
aVThe problem with politics, at least at the moment (and typified by your post), is that people seem incapable of assuming good faith from anybody they disagree with.
p1444
aVTry that for a bit - try understanding that there's more than one point of view, and that yours isn't necessarily automatically correct just because it's yours.
p1445
aVOh indeed, I realise there's a minority that are taking the piss, but sadly, the measures taken to deal with them, they easily dance around the checks, while it hits those claiming honestly.
p1446
aVIt's mainly the things IDS has done just don't seem to have any basis in economics or common sense, they tend to just be designed to make life harder for people just trying to get by.
p1447
aVWe don't need more pressure on people to find work, we need more assistance to help people find work, and in the end, either more work, or an acceptance that full an employment is a thing of the past.
p1448
aVEDIT: In short, he's convinced that everyone not working is choosing that way of life, and if you've been on JSA in the last few years, you'd be so crazy to choose that, that you'd not pass a mental health assessment by ATOS.
p1449
aVIn the end, not enough paid work, too many people, it's generally not a simple case of 'lazy people who just need to be punished into getting a job'.
p1450
aVI admit I can't help but be genuinely angry at the things IDS has done as I see the effects of what he's done, and it's clear it's not helping anyone, and to me it's purely being done ideologically and to sate the nastier urges of the Daily Mail demographic.
p1451
aV&gt; The perception, right or wrong, is that there are a lot of people not bothering.
p1452
aVAre you confusing cause an effect?
p1453
aVDoes this perception originate with the general public, or has it been fed to the public by right-wing media anxious to support government policy?
p1454
aV&gt; Does this perception originate with the general public, or has it been fed to the public by right-wing media anxious to support government policy?
p1455
aVThe idea that people claiming jobseekers or housing benefit are sometimes (or often) scroungers is not new.
p1456
aVWhen there are cuts, welfare becomes a controversial topic.
p1457
aVI have no idea when that originated, but it's not a recent addition to political discussion.
p1458
aVIf a government applies cuts everywhere it can, at some point it's going to try to cut welfare.
p1459
aVWhether that's through efficiency, removing management, closing branches, or reducing payments, every government tries it.
p1460
aVAs it happens, Labour did most of that, except reducing payments, in 2004-2006, as part of the "Efficiency Savings Programme" - closed lots of branches, reduced management, etc.
p1461
aVAnd I think you have the media backwards.
p1462
aVRight-wing media aims to sell papers to right-wing readers.
p1463
aVThey are going to write stories that reinforce the views of their target audience, and they are going to use headlines that entice those people to buy.
p1464
aVExactly the same as the left-wing media.
p1465
aVThat's how you end up with the right wing media headline "migrants cost £120bn" and left wing headline "migrants contribute £20bn" - for the exact same story, and the exact same figures.
p1466
aVI'd agree that the phenomen isn't new.
p1467
aVIt was definitely active during the Thatcher years, and I wouldn't be surprised if it dates back to the 1930s or earlier.
p1468
aVHowever I'd disagree with your assertion that right wing newspapers sell exclusively to right-wing readers.
p1469
aVIn particular I'd suggest that the average "Sun" reader is probably either apathetic, or centrist politically, although the paper is definitely right wing.
p1470
aVEven more blatantly right wing newspapers, still don't have an exclusively right wing readership.
p1471
aVFor example [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/05/sun-labour-newspapers-support-elections#zoomed-picture) points out that in 2005, 38% of Daily Mail readers who voted chose either Labour or Liberal Democrat. 
p1472
aV&gt; However I'd disagree with your assertion that right wing newspapers sell exclusively to right-wing readers.
p1473
aVSo would I, and that's lucky because it wasn't an assertion that I made.
p1474
aVGood point.
p1475
aVI guess I read your post too quickly.
p1476
aVMay I instead suggest that "aiming to sell to right-wing readers" isn't the only motivation behind right wing headlines?
p1477
aVSometimes these newspapers are pushing an agenda prompted by either their owners, or their advertisers?
p1478
aVI'd also suggest that sometimes the influence is more subtle.
p1479
aVRight wing owners tend to appoint and promote journalists and editors with right wing views.
p1480
aVThis means that these right-wing views are automatically pushed, without any day-to-day oversight.
p1481
aVSelling newspapers isn't the only motivation.
p1482
aVSure, there's probably a bit of that too.
p1483
aVIt's not exclusive to right wing media though, that's common to all media. 
p1484
aVthis is government not a for profit organisation.
p1485
aVperhaps they should be allowed the same lunch allowance as state school students.
p1486
aVhttp://chrisbrosnahan.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/iain-duncan-smith-and-scrounger.html\u000a\u000ahe certainly pushes that narrative.
p1487
aV&gt; this is government not a for profit organisation.
p1488
aVperhaps they should be allowed the same lunch allowance as state school students.
p1489
aVAnd it would seem the fees office agreed with you and the expense was turned down.
p1490
aVWhether Iain submitted it maliciously or (I believe more likely) included it as part of a wad of monthly receipts for his PA to enter into the system, the checks and balances in place have done their job.
p1491
aVI can say hand on heart that I've worked for many companies where the staff with assistants don't bother entering their own expenses - their PAs do - and that in most situations something like this would get rubber-stamped anyway.

aVI understand where you're coming from, but in this case u/ProfessorZOOM literally did nothing but an ad hominem.
p1502
aVIf you want to be technical, he didn't because he didn't make an argument.
p1503
aVIf I wanted to be technical, I'd argue that there was an implied argument being made, and that it was an ad hominem.
p1504
aVI feel that that's largely the point.
p1505
aVIt's a passive-aggressive way to tell someone they're being a dick.
p1506
aVIt's not passive-aggressive.
p1507
aVIt's explicitly critical.

aVYou'd have a point if he did anything in his reply but an ad hominem.

aVI fucking hate all of you and anyone else on reddit who thinks its ok to link these 'logical fallacies'.
p1520

p1523
aV***It is fucking impossible to reply to a point without breaking half a dozen of these 'rules'***.
p1524
aVStop it, stop it right now.
p1525
aVYou might hate logical fallacies and everyone on Reddit who uses them, but they're a useful tool to measure the correctness and intellectual honesty of a person's argument.
p1526
aVPeople who are interested in having honest debates (which is an art in of itself and within exists the idea of logic as a form of rhetoric) find it frustrating and somewhat difficult trying to argue against a flawed argument that has not been reached through a correct and logical thought process.
p1527
aVPossibly even as much as you find their logic intolerable.
p1528
aVHighlighting the existence of a fallacy and therefore putting the opposition in the position of justifying why their original argument should be considered at all is a perfectly reasonable thing to do if having honest debates is something we're interested in.
p1529
aVNo, people use them as a snide, condescending way to kill debate.
p1530
aVPeople forget about the argument and start arguing about whether they were 'appealing to authority' or asking 'loaded questions'.
p1531
aVExactly what happened above and is happening consistently now that people are learning about more of these 'fallacies'.
p1532
aVPlease pull your head out of your arse.
p1533
aVYou are not the shining beacon of logic that you think you are.
p1534
aVYour past comments are all the same; telling the other person that they are ignorant about the topic whilst  bigging yourself up as a rational genius.

aVYou're not here to debate, you're here to feed your precious little ego.
p1536
aV/u/TinyMarsh master of logic and expert in the art of debate!
p1537
aVHooray!
p1538
aVAnd by the way, assuming a argument is invalid because a fallacy has been committed is known as the [fallacy fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/poster).
p1539
aVSEE HERE http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fallacy_fallacy.

p1542
aVAn argument however is generally invalid and shitty if it only contains ad hominem.
p1543
aVIt is the worst style of argument and should always be pointed out.
p1544
aVSometimes people have good reasons for doing so.
p1545
aVAgain, it's not the concept of fallacies I'm against, it's just the mindset of some people where if you dare commit one of these logical sins, then the debate is over.
p1546
aVTrue enough.

aVWhat does her opinion on Trojan Horse Schools, however wrong it is, have to do with this?
p1552
aVFair, I just don't like people linking to a wiki page on 'Ad Hominem' or 'Strawman'; its patronizing and condesending.
p1553
aVIt's easier and more social to attack it directly by saying what you just did.

aVI still don't understand why people are relying on food banks.
p1562
aVFood is really cheap.
p1563
aVWe do need educated people more on how to look after themselves and how to work there finances.
p1564
aVThere are scroungers but there are also those who don't help themselves out of poverty either, making poor decisions or over spending.
p1565
aVWe need to educate people as well as give them enough to live on. \u000a\u000a
p1566
aVMany peoples finances are tight, meaning there is no fallback short of getting a short term loan at an exhorbitant rate.
p1567
aVSo if something unexpected comes up in finances, you have to make massively tough \u000adecisions.

p1573
aVA topic for another debate, I saw a TED talk where a doctor prescribed his poorest customers money, and they nearly all found themselves feeling healthier very quickly, being able to afford to eat properly, have the heating on, etc.
p1574
aVI wonder how much we'd save on the NHS if we weren't quite so tight to those at the bottom, and I include full time workers on minimum wage in that.
p1575
aVI'm in full time employment and barely spend over £20 a week on food.

p1582
aVMany just cannot gather the willpower to change.\u000a
p1583
aVA big factor in the increase of the need for food banks are payday loans.
p1584
aVThey take advantage of people who may want to make it to the end of the month if they run out of money and are not educated enough to understand the consequences of a 4000% interest rate.
p1585
aVWhen they end up paying more and more of their income on these interest payments, and many people have found themselves homeless and/or relying on food banks.
p1586
aVThese payday lenders do not want their customers to pay back the loan straight away, that isn't where the money is.
p1587
aVIt is in getting people hooked into the trap, and then getting them to pay indefinitely.
p1588
aVThere is a reason that they are outlawed in the rest of Europe and half of the US.

aVThey are seriously dodgy, two thirds of the people who use them are on less than £25,000.

aVTry not to assume everyone can afford food like you or I, there are a shocking number of people in the UK who are in absolute poverty (not relative poverty, not that the inequality gap isn't a problem).
p1593
aVFood may not be that expensive, but good, healthy food is, and for people on benefits, zero hour contracts or whatever it can be extremely difficult to give your family a good, healthy meal.\u000a\u000a\u000a

aV&gt;not educated enough to understand the consequences of a 4000% interest rate.
p1595
aVNot mine, yours or anyone elses problem but their own.
p1596
aVI almost feel sorry for them.
p1597
aVBanks spend a hell of a lot of money on marketing, telling everyone that living in debt is ok. Want a big tv?
p1598
aVTake a loan!
p1599
aVWant a holiday?
p1600
aVTake a loan!
p1601
aVIt is utterly irresponsible to get into debt for that kind of purchase.
p1602
aVThen when the banks stopped lending - due to the inevitable outcome of irresponsible lending, people who had been "educated" to live in debt turned to the next lender.
p1603
aVI agree with you though.
p1604
aVIt's their money, their life and their debt.
p1605
aVIt should be a problem between the lender and borrower.
p1606
aVIt would likely be good for society if a large number of people went bankrupt so the lesson that borrowing is bad sank back into the national consciousness.
p1607
aVPeople defaulting on their payday loans would be good to see to.
p1608
aVNot sure where I get it from, but I thought there was a law against usury.
p1609
aVThat is your view of it, I suppose it depends on your empathy and how much you care for a stranger.
p1610
aVIt sort of is our problem when our country allows people to be exploited for the benefit of the richer in society.
p1611
aVI just don't see how you could not want to help the 1 million people who need to use food banks but that's just my opinion.
p1612
aVIt has nothing to do with empathy.
p1613
aVIt's about understanding that the tax payer is not responsible for the bad decisions you make in your own personal life.
p1614
aVJust because you advocate taking money away from people and giving it to those that have squandered their own does not make you empathetic. 
p1615
aVI am not advocating giving people money, I advocate educating people with their finances and outlawing payday lenders.
p1616
aVI did not once say we should give them money.
p1617
aVMorally perhaps, but surely economically a large group of people in that situation is bad for us all, no?
p1618
aVThe main reason has been clearly stated repeatedly, sanctions, often applied unfairly for spurious reasons, and people often don't even get told they've been sanctioned, finding out when they've suddenly got no money.
p1619
aVIn the end, you can't make 'zero' stretch very far even if you buy budget range foods.
p1620
aVPeople have returned food to food banks, because they don't have the money to turn the gas or electric on to cook anything.
p1621
aV&gt; People have returned food to food banks, because they don't have the money to turn the gas or electric on to cook anything.
p1622
aVThis is shocking.
p1623
aVI can't believe the UK has become this way.
p1624
aVGive it a couple of more years and people will be taking to the streets.  
p1625
aV&gt;indignity of relying on food banks \u000a\u000aPenn Jillette:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u201cIt's amazing to me how many people think that voting to have the government give poor people money is compassion.
p1626
aVHelping poor and suffering people is compassion.
p1627
aVVoting for our government to use guns to give money to help poor and suffering people is immoral self-righteous bullying laziness.
p1628
aVPeople need to be fed, medicated, educated, clothed, and sheltered, and if we're compassionate we'll help them, but you get no moral credit for forcing other people to do what you think is right.
p1629
aVThere is great joy in helping people, but no joy in doing it at gunpoint.
p1630
aVPeople try to argue that government isn't really force.
p1631
aVYou believe that?
p1632
aVTry not paying your taxes. 
p1633
aV&gt;People try to argue that government isn't really force.
p1634
aVWho tries to argue this, exactly?
p1635
aVThe world is full of 'Libertarian' havens with no taxes and weak government.
p1636
aVTake your pick from the underdeveloped hell-holes where no one will bother you to fund things you don't want to.
p1637
aVGo to north Korea If you like powerful governments. 
p1638
aVWhy?
p1639
aVI'm happy with the extent of the state we have evolved here.
p1640
aVI'm not the one under the impression the development of the Social Contract was a backward step.
p1641
aVHaha social contract, good one.
p1642
aVThere is no social contract.
p1643
aVI'm not happy and will vote/debate accordingly as our democracy and current state allows despite how much you might dislike it. 
p1644
aV&gt;I'm not happy and will vote/debate accordingly as our democracy and current state allows despite how much you might dislike it.
p1645
aVGood, I'm pleased, and I will *continue* to point out that you enjoy that right because our society is cohesive enough to support a representative government strong enough to compel people to pay for a police force and schools.
p1646
aVThe genuine irony is that if we ever *did* find ourselves living in a Libertarian society I'm all set to fund a private army and become God-Emperor - however much you may dislike that.
p1647
aVIf we did find ourselves in a Libertarian paradise I don't suppose your funds would be much use.
p1648
aVUnless you've been stockpiling tinned food and ammo?
p1649
aVOr go to Somalia if you like no government.
p1650
aVExcept the current situation is in your philosophy taking money from the middle and lower classes to subsidise corporations and the city.
p1651
aVStraw man. 
p1652
aVNot really, simply making a point about the current allocation of tax.
p1653
aVTrue, I misread what you said. 
p1654
aVI never get this opinion, and I like Penn Jillette on a fair few things.
p1655
aVIn the end, we all live as part of society, and it just makes sense that when society needs a thing, like law enforcers, roads, schools, etc., it makes more sense to charge everyone an amount they can afford according to their ability to pay, to ensure it's there for everyone, rather than just allowing the richest to have access to say, the legal system.
p1656
aVAlthough it's slowly shifting that way.
p1657
aVIn the UK we expand that to welfare and healthcare among other things, and while that's debatable, the idea that you should have zero taxes and want to live in a chaotic wasteland of no laws, no rubbish collection, and no street repairs etc... well, that's a bit wild.
p1658
aVAgain, I understand the view of being against welfare, and to an extent healthcare, tho I don't agree, but the idea of wanting zero taxes because you think it's theft and would rather live in a bunker somewhere constantly alert to anyone who might attack rather than pay for police and other emergency services is a bit mad.
p1659
aVThis is also why we should close tax loopholes, places like Top Shop would be fucked without the emergency services, the NHS and schools to help their staff do their jobs and keep the stores open.
p1660
aVOf course the Government collects by force, I imagine they tried just leaving it up to people to send in a third of their wages voluntarily, and gave up on that idea pretty quickly when it was evident that people, while wanting a safe, clean, and good society, don't want to pay for it, even tho they know it's in their best interest.
p1661
aVI think what libertarians would like is to be able to choose where to spend their money.
p1662
aVSo instead of an inefficient government monopoly collecting their waste, you could choose from a host a companies (that might offer slightly different services at different prices).
p1663
aVThis would create competition and likely bring down the price.
p1664
aVIt's not about not wanting to pay for it, it's about having the choice to pay for it and the choice of who they pay to do it.
p1665
aVPoverty is proportional to wealth of the country - so is a bizarre statistic, as it can improve despite everyone being better off.
p1666
aVAs to food banks - We had almost none 10 years ago, so obviously if you build them, and subsidize them, more people will use them.
p1667
aVIt's a point that no one wants to talk about but safety nets must be very carefully managed.
p1668
aVThere's a reason JSA isn't £300 a week - people would rely on it.
p1669
aVWe may yet get to a situation where people don't save money for food because they can just go down the food bank, then there'll need to be another support system in place to support that.
p1670
aVCarrot AND stick. 
p1671
aVYeah, we sure could use some carrot, like bringing back 'back to work grants', crisis loans etc, instead of expecting charities to step in.
p1672
aVHonestly, even from the right, I can't see the sense in stripping away small grants to help people get thru the first month of work when their benefits have stopped but they're over a month away from seeing any pay.
p1673
aVRKO from outta nowhere!
p1674
aVWhy don't we lower the poverty line?
p1675
aVWe could lift the majority out of poverty just by doing that
p1676
aVHitler sort of did that by saying that Jews, women, gays etc weren't included in employment figures.
p1677
aVUnemployment almost disappeared!
p1678
aV[deleted]
p1679
aVFirst off, "poverty isn't a bad thing" is a serious contender for the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.
p1680
aVSecond, I don't know why rich people think that poor people should only be provided just enough to avoid death. 
p1681
aV[deleted]
p1682
aV&gt; Without poverty, you have no reason to do anything.
p1683
aVIf everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1684
aVI think you are mixing up inequality with poverty.
p1685
aVIf someone is working and still in poverty, that's pretty fucked up.
p1686
aVTo be above the "relative poverty" line, you have work 47 hours a week on minimum wage.
p1687
aVIt's not difficult to do that. 
p1688
aVThat's close to the maximum work week for any one job.
p1689
aVIf you work shifts, it might be the case you have to look for a second job (or third) for those extra hours, hard enough to find even the one depending on where in the UK you live, and skills you have.
p1690
aVAnd then there are those with additional responsibilities, like those with young children.
p1691
aVAll this just to be above the bottom 60% of the median household income...
p1692
aVThat's true.
p1693
aVBut that doesn't mean it's not possible.
p1694
aVAs for children - if you're poor, don't have them.
p1695
aVThat's really quite simple in my honest opinion.
p1696
aVYes accidents happen, I am aware of that.
p1697
aVIf you can't afford it, get a termination.
p1698
aVI have no sympathy for religious views in general, certainly not when you're choosing between having a job and making something of yourself, or bringing a child into an impoverished family where it's going to have an awful upbringing.
p1699
aVHaving child benefits doesn't really help the case...\u000a\u000aMaybe I'm just cold and have no empathy but that just seems pretty obvious to me. 
p1700
aV"Not being impossible" is not a good argument; it's not impossible to win the lottery jackpot either, don't mean you should treat buying lottery tickets as a sound financial investment.
p1701
aVAs for children, people's employment situation changes, couples split up and so on.
p1702
aVDo you really think the children ought to be punished too?
p1703
aVTo suggest working 7 days a week or day and night shifts on the same day is not even an lack of empathy (it's not something you should be proud of either) , it demonstrates exactly what's wrong: the only way for those 13 million to escape poverty is to work inhuman hours. 
p1704
aV47 hours a week is easily doable.
p1705
aVIt's effectively 8-6 (with 1 hour lunch break).
p1706
aVThen perhaps two extra shifts per year (or probably only one of you got paid extra for overtime).
p1707
aVMany many many people work longer hours than that.
p1708
aVIn the case of divorces, you get child support, if one parent tragically dies, there's life insurance, and so on.
p1709
aVThat should be a non-issue.
p1710
aVI don't think children should be punished for their parents' actions, no, but I feel no sympathy for the parents who complain about the cost of children when they had children despite knowing they couldn't afford them. 
p1711
aV&gt; 47 hours a week is easily doable.
p1712
aVIt's effectively 8-6 (with 1 hour lunch break).
p1713
aVThen perhaps two extra shifts per year (or probably only one of you got paid extra for overtime).
p1714
aVMany many many people work longer hours than that.
p1715
aV8-6 shift workweek shifts are not acceptable.
p1716
aV48 hours is the working limit, but even then not many people do or could work up to the maximum, nor would they for long.
p1717
aVWe aren't even talking about directors for major companies who are rewarded with an large salary and company car, but the *minimum to get out of poverty*.
p1718
aV&gt;In the case of divorces, you get child support, if one parent tragically dies, there's life insurance, and so on.
p1719
aVThat should be a non-issue.
p1720
aVI don't think children should be punished for their parents' actions, no\u000a\u000aBut then you go on to say that 8-6 day shifts for their parents are acceptable, so yes, that would hurt children too.
p1721
aVLife insurance is not a solution either.
p1722
aVahh your an edgy middle class 17 year old with no life experience, got it.
p1723
aVBootstraps, yada yada.
p1724
aV&gt;If everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1725
aVNobody implied that because that would never happen and would never work as a system.
p1726
aVExactly.
p1727
aVBut that's why you need inequality and poverty is a consequence of inequality.  
p1728
aVBootstraps, yada yada.
p1729
aV&gt;If everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1730
aVNobody implied that because that would never happen and would never work as a system.
p1731
aVApparently 'not letting people starve' = 'full on Communism'. 
p1732
aVIf poverty gives people an incentive to better themselves then why do people born in poverty tend to stay in poverty?
p1733
aVHead to any council estate and point out all the people trying to better themselves, please. 
p1734
aVBecause they've resigned themselves to the fact they can have a life on benefits which may not be "comfortable" by our standards but to them it's reasonable enough because they've grown up with it.
p1735
aVIf we cut the benefits cap to 10% below minimum wage of 40 hours a week (~£12,000) then you'll see a lot more people looking to better themselves. 
p1736
aV&gt;  If everyone earns the same, why train for 7 years to be a doctor when you can work behind a bar for the same wage?
p1737
aVNone of the doctors I know do it for the money.
p1738
aVUnbelievably, some of us aren't all that motivated by cash- if anything, I'd say it's a necessary evil.
p1739
aV&gt;it provides people with an incentive.
p1740
aVreally i was under the assumption that is usually causes depressions and a higher chance of alcohol dependence.
p1741
aVi though giving people the opportunity to better them selves gives them an incentive.
p1742
aVat least i know i was very depressed when we could not afford heating in the middle of the winter and there was no work available.
p1743
aV&gt;and you will get a job that pays enough to not be poor.
p1744
aVliving in LALA land here.\u000a\u000a
p1745
aVThe coalition has eradicated unemployment!
p1746
aVAccording to her, yes. 
p1747
aVJust the same old David Cameron.
p1748
aVHe'll say anything to gain favour even if it means contradicting himself.
p1749
aVHis first proper job was in public relations fer christ sake, he is a manipulator.
p1750
aVI don't know how anybody who identifies on the right of British politics can not throw up when voting for his party. 
p1751
aVAs the old saying goes: In the UK we don't vote people in... we vote people out. 
p1752
aVI HOPE WE'RE NOT SUPPORTING UKIP NOW\u000a\u000aand Islamist is definitely a 'scare word'\u000a\u000athere's 1,800,000,000 muslims on earth
p1753
aV&gt; He'll say anything to gain favour even if it means contradicting himself.
p1754
aVI don't get why it's considered "bad" for a politician to change their views in response to events.
p1755
aVSurely we want a responsive government, rather than one that sticks rigidly to ideologies regardless of the circumstances?
p1756
aVChanging policy isn't bad.
p1757
aVWhen your entire framework of principles is fluid you cannot be trusted.
p1758
aVIdeally politicians should hold solid principles and vary policy to suit said principles based upon the facts as they arise.
p1759
aVNot have no principles at all.
p1760
aV&gt;When your entire framework of principles is fluid\u000a\u000a8 years =/= fluid.
p1761
aVChanging your basic principles in 8 years is pretty fluid.
p1762
aVThe first quote's arn't necessarily contradictory, as no context is given it is a null point.
p1763
aVThe second point, the rise of ISIS and generally very active middle east is plenty reason to change the opinion.
p1764
aVAlso he says not to label the threat as Islamist.
p1765
aVHe then labels it as Islamist Extremism.
p1766
aVThere is a difference between the two.
p1767
aVThe third point.
p1768
aVIn the first he is saying the whole labour market.
p1769
aVIn the second he is specifically talking about factories.
p1770
aVMacro =/= Micro.
p1771
aVThese arn't contradictory statements and with no context given we can't see if the intent is contradictory either.
p1772
aVAre you in politics ?
p1773
aVNo?
p1774
aVYou should be.
p1775
aVI'm not sure if you are trying to be edgy or pay me a compliment?
p1776
aVThanks either way.
p1777
aVBit of both really.
p1778
aVI get the feeling you could argue white is black, which (if you're a politician) is a redeemable quality. 
p1779
aVThese trashposts just bug me.
p1780
aVIf UKIP made a poster like this you can bet the comments would be full of people condemning 'crappy propoganda'.
p1781
aVTo a blind person white is black, it's all about perspective.
p1782
aVAre these basic principles though?
p1783
aVI think so.
p1784
aVThe latter quote especially shows he's gone from being a defender of a free labour market to taking a view that could almost be French.
p1785
aVI sincerely doubt the original statement are even his views.
p1786
aVWhat people are saying is that he sees that UKIP has found support and are taking supporters from the Tories so he is leaning more to the right in order to try and keep those leaving.
p1787
aVIts not responsive, its reactionary.
p1788
aVA few reasons.
p1789
aVFirst it suggests that perhaps their original understanding of the situation was poor.
p1790
aVFor example policy u turns are seen as a bad thing because it means that for whatever reason the policy was not fit for purpose and time and money has been wasted following through anyway.
p1791
aVSimilar thing with broad policy.
p1792
aVWhy have migrant workers suddenly become a bad thing?
p1793
aVDoes that mean they were always bad and you just didn't see it?
p1794
aVAnother big reason is that this is just populist pandering.
p1795
aVWe expect our leaders to do and say, within the realms of possibility, what they consider to be the correct thing rather than the popular thing.
p1796
aVIf the right thing isn't popular, then you make it popular.
p1797
aVThat's a huge part of being a leader- getting people to understand and accept the what and why of things they don't like.
p1798
aVIt's also very hard to do, so many just slip into this pandering.
p1799
aVWe've all that boss, the person who expects to be obeyed without question regardless of how stupid or crazy their instructions are.
p1800
aVIn short there is nothing wrong with a sincere change in view or policy, but it opens the box as to what you got wrong before and why.
p1801
aVPlus it has to be a sincere change, not sound bite slinging to try and get on the fence conservatives on side.
p1802
aV&gt; First it suggests that perhaps their original understanding of the situation was poor.
p1803
aVOr, it means that the situation has changed or that a particular policy theory didn't pan out (nobody can be right every time, even the best experts on economics and social policy frequently disagree).
p1804
aVI'd have a huge amount of respect for a politician who could say "I honestly and reasonably thought that this policy would improve things, but events have proved me wrong, so I'll reverse it".
p1805
aV&gt; Similar thing with broad policy.
p1806
aVWhy have migrant workers suddenly become a bad thing?
p1807
aVDoes that mean they were always bad and you just didn't see it?
p1808
aVMaybe because in 2007, we didn't have an imminent "wave" of new immigration approaching.
p1809
aVi.e.
p1810
aVthe 2007 levels were "good", but higher levels are "bad"?
p1811
aVOr because in dealing with immigration and its effects on society over the last few years, his opinion of the net effect of immigration has changed?
p1812
aV&gt; We expect our leaders to do and say, within the realms of possibility, what they consider to be the correct thing rather than the popular thing.
p1813
aVBut they only get to become our leaders if they say the "populist" thing...
p1814
aVSeems to be a bit of a contradiction there.
p1815
aVWe want them to be democratically subject to the "will of the people", but when they acknowledge that will, we accuse them of being "populist"...\u000a\u000a&gt; If the right thing isn't popular, then you make it popular.
p1816
aVYou mean through propaganda campaigns?
p1817
aV"Spin"?
p1818
aVWe rightly disliked the previous government's blatant manipulation of the media for propaganda purposes and you're suggesting that there should be more of that?
p1819
aVYes situations change.
p1820
aVThat's why I didn't use absolute language.
p1821
aVThank you for ensuring the point was driven home.
p1822
aVI thought I managed it the closing lines but the post was truly enriched by your contribution to that key facet.
p1823
aVThe populist versus 'correct' policy is a key flaw in how democracy works with a largely apathetic pool of voters.
p1824
aVIt's not a contradiction of the argument, it's hilgihting a key flaw that causes a rift between how democracy should work and how it works in reality.
p1825
aVThere's a massive difference between using obfuscation, selective material and double speak to bluff and badger your point into something acceptable, and making a genuine argument to the people to justify your decisions.
p1826
aVI argue for the latter, not the former, so that should make you happier.
p1827
aVAgain, this doesn't invalidate the point, it just hilights why the desire is not the reality- it's easier to spout populist rhetoric and then spin the decisions that really annoy the mostly passive electorate.
p1828
aVIt all depends on the context.
p1829
aVTake the first quote on intergration.
p1830
aVAt first he says the British should intergrate with the Asian community and in the 2nd quote he promotes the opposite, where we encourage "liberal" values.
p1831
aVHow much has changed from 2006 - 2014 to make such a turnaround?
p1832
aVIt's quite clear in quote (1) he is courting the Asian vote and in quote (2) he is riding on the anti-immigration / multiculturalism wave of the last few years.
p1833
aVIt is sheer spin-docterism from the doctrine of Blair. 
p1834
aVContext.
p1835
aVContext and timing.
p1836
aVAt this time, he was in opposition and Blair was dishing it out to Muslims willy nilly .
p1837
aVWhat's surprised me, is that people seem to  still think 'principles and conviction' play any part in setting policy.
p1838
aVOf the 2 main parties, both are only interesting in serving their funders by winning re election.
p1839
aVBelief and conviction just don't feature.
p1840
aVPolicy is set by public opinion and the agenda of funders.
p1841
aVThat's really all there is to it, isn't it ?
p1842
aVI'm not so sure, both of those statements are devoid of all context for a start, but notice that the first statement doesn't say "Asian", it says "British Asian".
p1843
aVTherefore the "British values" mentioned in the second statement could easily be interpreted to include "British Asian" values (since "British Asian" could be considered a subset of "British").
p1844
aVIf you change your opinion you should say why it changed.
p1845
aVYet he would never do this, as with most politicians they just present their "new viewpoint" as fact and hope the vast majority of people forgot the last one.
p1846
aVLook at the reasoning though.
p1847
aVDo you think he's changing his views because immigration is harming the economy or social fabric of Britain more today than it was several years ago?
p1848
aVNo.
p1849
aVHe's changing his views because UKIP are gaining strength and changing the political landscape.
p1850
aVThey have forced issues into the spotlight the he would have rather remained stifled.
p1851
aVTherefor he's not changing his views for a greater good.
p1852
aVHe's changing his views to remain electable and not lose out to UKIP.
p1853
aVI'll cut the deficit, not the NHS
p1854
aVHe actually followed through on that.
p1855
aVI think you're thinking of, 'No top-down reorganisation of the NHS'.
p1856
aVHe still cut the NHS.
p1857
aVThe "Nicholson Challenge" wasn't optional, it was cuts by another name. 
p1858
aVNo he hasn't, spending has increased in real-terms.
p1859
aVHe might not be spending enough in order to keep up with demand, but in no way can you describe an increase in spending as a cut.
p1860
aVHas it really?
p1861
aVWhat does real terms mean? 
p1862
aVNothing it's a political buzzword.
p1863
aVIt is calculated on an ever changing basket,  does the NHS spend a lot of money on MP3s?
p1864
aVIf your rent went up by less than inflation would you call that a real terms cut?
p1865
aVOr would you say your rent went up? 
p1866
aVIt went up in proportion with the value of inflation calculated by the bank of England which means that the amount of money spent on the NHS today should buy the same amount of stuff as the amount of money spent on the NHS five years ago (even though the actual quantity of money is greater - £140 billion this year compared to £119 billion five years ago).
p1867
aVOne can dispute whether or not the Bank of England measures inflation accurately, but that's what the government relies on for its economic planning.
p1868
aVThe Social Protection budget and spending on debt interest are the only other parts of the budget that haven't been cut in real terms.
p1869
aVEducation spending has been reduced by ~5%, partly because the government no longer contributes as much to university tuition as it did, and partly because of the ways schools are being reorganized.
p1870
aVAll other arms of the government have been cut by 15% or more.
p1871
aVAll totaled, government spending excluding that on debt interest has decreased by 10%.
p1872
aVTotal government spending has decreased by 7%.
p1873
aVI'm sure you hold all the same opinions from 8 years ago.
p1874
aVEven when the facts have changed.
p1875
aVIsn't that right?
p1876
aVPoliticians!
p1877
aVhaving the nerve to change their opinion when confronted with a changing situation.
p1878
aVAbsolutely terrible.\u000a
p1879
aVFirst of all, don't get so personal and leary.
p1880
aVIn Cameron's word's "calm down dear".
p1881
aVI'm not automatically opposed to changes of heart providing the facts on the ground have changed.
p1882
aVTake the first quote, Cameron goes from extolling the values of "British Asians" and believes that non-Asian British people should emulate those values.
p1883
aV8 years later he is now advocating for typical western liberal values.
p1884
aVProviding those two sets of values are distinct (only Cameron can decide that) than he has changed his mind.
p1885
aVSo what has changed in those 8 years to have altered his mind?
p1886
aVRemember, values don't change over peroids of 8 years.
p1887
aVMore like generations.
p1888
aVTherefore I can't take Cameron's change of heart seriously and I'll put this down to hypocritical politics. 
p1889
aV&gt;First of all, don't get so personal and leary.
p1890
aVIn Cameron's word's "calm down dear".
p1891
aVRight, because asking you to hold yourself to the same standards as you hold others is personal.
p1892
aV&gt;I'm not automatically opposed to changes of heart providing the facts on the ground have changed.
p1893
aVTake the first quote, Cameron goes from extolling the values of "British Asians" and believes that non-Asian British people should emulate those values.
p1894
aV8 years later he is now advocating for typical western liberal values.
p1895
aVProviding those two sets of values are distinct (only Cameron can decide that) than he has changed his mind.
p1896
aVAll of these quotes are taken completely out of context, it's cheap propaganda and not worth looking into.
p1897
aVFor instance these British Asians are a part of British culture already.
p1898
aVThe second quote therefore already includes those values and is arguing against outside influences.
p1899
aVEither I or you could build countless context's around these quotes to make him look good or bad, without the context this is just a cheap gimmick.
p1900
aV&gt;So what has changed in those 8 years to have altered his mind?
p1901
aVRemember, values don't change over peroids of 8 years.
p1902
aVMore like generations.
p1903
aVTherefore I can't take Cameron's change of heart seriously and I'll put this down to hypocritical politics.
p1904
aVAnd in doing so you show one of the worst traits of British political support.
p1905
aVThe instant, oh tories?
p1906
aVfuck them.
p1907
aVOr Labour?
p1908
aVfuck them.
p1909
aVYou make snap judgements without looking for context or the reason behind the statements.
p1910
aVThis picture doesn't promote conversation, it promotes knee jerk reactions from people who have already decided they don't like the conservatives.\u000a\u000a
p1911
aV&gt; Right, because asking you to hold yourself to the same standards as you hold others is personal.
p1912
aVEh?
p1913
aVYou wrote a post dripping with a mean brand of sarcasm.
p1914
aVAnd yeah I do hold my politicians to a higher standard than I do for a normal member of the public.
p1915
aVThey have far greater responsibility on their shoulders.
p1916
aV&gt; All of these quotes are taken completely out of context, it's cheap propaganda and not worth looking into.
p1917
aVSo you say the above...but then:\u000a\u000a&gt;For instance these British Asians are a part of British culture already.
p1918
aVThe second quote therefore already includes those values and is arguing against outside influences\u000a\u000aSo you acknowledge they're out of context and "not worth looking into" but you try to explain them anyway.
p1919
aVSo why are you allowed to explain these quotations but not me?
p1920
aV&gt; Either I or you could build countless context's around these quotes to make him look good or bad, without the context this is just a cheap gimmick.
p1921
aVFair enough I agree with that.
p1922
aVIf you read my first comment on this thread, I barely make any reference to the actual content of the image.
p1923
aVHowever, it did chime with my view of DC, as a dishonest, snake oil salesman.
p1924
aVI think he will say whatever is the most politically advantageous with the view of winning an election, not any moral conviction based on a vision for the country.
p1925
aVAs Douglas Caswell said, DC and his cronies just want to sit on the sofa.
p1926
aV&gt; And in doing so you show one of the worst traits of British political support.
p1927
aVThe instant, oh tories?
p1928
aVfuck them.
p1929
aVOr Labour?
p1930
aVfuck them.
p1931
aVYou make snap judgements without looking for context or the reason behind the statements.
p1932
aVYou're confusing me with somebody who takes their political input from these sort of images.
p1933
aVBelieve me, I read manifestos.
p1934
aVI watch the news I'm interested in politics, I'm still disillusioned with all three main parties.\u000a\u000a
p1935
aV&gt;Eh?
p1936
aVYou wrote a post dripping with a mean brand of sarcasm.
p1937
aVAnd yeah I do hold my politicians to a higher standard than I do for a normal member of the public.
p1938
aVThey have far greater responsibility on their shoulders.
p1939
aVAnd you wrote a post just plain out being rude based on cheap propaganda.
p1940
aV&gt;So you acknowledge they're out of context and "not worth looking into" but you try to explain them anyway.
p1941
aVSo why are you allowed to explain these quotations but not me?
p1942
aVI am not explaining, I am creating a context to demonstrate my point.
p1943
aV&gt;I barely make any reference to the actual content of the image.
p1944
aVWell I'm sorry if you were in fact not talking in relation to the post.
p1945
aVHowever this is the comments section of the post and it is implied that you are talking about the post, if not maybe say otherwise.
p1946
aV&gt;You're confusing me with somebody who takes their political input from these sort of images.
p1947
aVBelieve me, I read manifestos.
p1948
aVI watch the news I'm interested in politics, I'm still disillusioned with all three main parties.
p1949
aVThen you probably don't need this self validation propaganda do you?
p1950
aV&gt; I don't know how anybody who identifies on the right of British politics can not throw up when voting for his party.
p1951
aVSomething tells me you don't know many of the 10,703,654 people who voted conservative in 2010 then.
p1952
aVYes David Cameron is a politician.
p1953
aVI'm not sure why this angers you so
p1954
aVWhen he was asked why he wanted to be PM, he said because he thought he'd be rather good at it.
p1955
aVThat's it.
p1956
aVNo vision, just pure self-indulgence from the man who already has everything.
p1957
aVAnd he wasn't even right.
p1958
aVI don't say this because I don't like his politics or anything...
p1959
aVI think even Tories agree, he's not particularly good at his job.
p1960
aVHe's just a caretaker PM - we won't remember him in ten years except as the PM who lost Scotland.
p1961
aVWell, all the tory voters I've spoken too have either gone for:\u000a\u000aa/ they stand for something.
p1962
aVWhatever that means, and if it means traditional old fashioned values I'm perplexed on so many levels.
p1963
aVEspecially since this man stands only really for himself.
p1964
aVb/ They save me having to pay taxes to help poor people who deserve it.
p1965
aVWhich would lose the Tories their UKIP swing voters if they just came out straight and said it.
p1966
aVIt's that last one which really gets me.
p1967
aV* [University rates are climbing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17069298)\u000a* [Graduation rates are dropping](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/07/education-graduation-oecd-university)\u000a* [Employers need more skilled labor](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10424148/Immigrants-fill-one-in-five-skilled-British-jobs.html)\u000a* [Non-EU immigration is capped at 20,700 per year](http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hro/news/1072802/immigration-cap-set-remain-700-2014)\u000a\u000aSo ... the UK is producing fewer skilled workers *and* refusing to import them.
p1968
aVSomeone tell me how this situation isn't totally fucked.
p1969
aVPart of the problem with point 3 is that employers don't actually want to pay skilled workers adequate salary/wages, so obviously they don't get any employees.

p1988
aVI think people just need to be more informed when they choose a degree, because if you choose something like philosophy with barely any prospects you can't blame anyone but yourself for the lack of employers who want to hire you.
p1989
aVSame goes for if people choose a mad competitive degree like law.
p1990
aVat the same time, this country would be all the poorer if ALL we offered was computing/engineering...\u000a\u000aso basically if your not good at maths you don't belong at university, you can't narrow the frame of what constitutes an intellectual by that much and expect good things..\u000a\u000ai was in awe of my old head of department when i was in uni.
p1991
aVHe couldn't code a "hello world" in c# or design a bridge, does that mean he doesn't belong at uni teaching because his subject wasn't computing/engineering?\u000a\u000a
p1992
aVYou read into that way too much.
p1993
aVI never said people who aren't good at maths don't belong at uni, I never tried to define what constitutes an intellectual, I never said your head of department didn't belong at uni because of his chosen field.
p1994
aVWhat I did say was people need to be more realistic when choosing what they study.
p1995
aVFact of the matter is there aren't many jobs out there for people with humanities degrees.
p1996
aVWhat I'm saying is don't go to university to study a course with terrible job prospects then get uppity when you have a hard time finding a job after uni.
p1997
aVI personally would've loved to have done history, but took the safer bet of computer science.
p1998
aVCan't believe people dislike the idea of compromise and being realistic with what they choose to do.

aVWell 'ish' the problem isn't so much what they deserve.
p2011
aVA worrying number of graduates enter professions where there degrees aren't directly applicable thus they aren't so much skilled as they are showing promise, other graduates with career specific degrees fall foul of the well where else are you going to go trap.

p2014
aV&gt; A worrying number of graduates enter professions where there degrees aren't directly applicable thus they aren't so much skilled as they are showing promise\u000a\u000aThis is how it's always been.

p2022
aVIn fact, if you read through the above list, you'll find right-wing sources, left-wing sources, "neutral" sources, etc.
p2023
aVNobody who is paying attention is ignorant of the problem.
p2024
aVThe government knows this.
p2025
aVBusiness knows this.
p2026
aVIt's the retarded UKIP and BNP fucks with their heads up their arses who are *completely* clueless as to how economies work.
p2027
aVThe UK has a fucking problem.
p2028
aVUnfortunately, people who are in complete denial of said problem have an annoying tendency to both a), vote, and b) scream loud enough about "immigrants takin' are jerbs" that a completely ignorant public starts to hyperventilate about a non-problem whilst ignoring a real one.
p2029
aV**Update**: for anyone who shrugs and says "so what", it means that the UK, long term, will be less competitive, will turn out fewer new technologies, will have fewer entrepreneurs, will attract fewer businesses.
p2030
aVThis is a **serious problem**, but I actually feel bad for politicians.
p2031
aVThey know that the short term "anti-immigrant" solutions they talk about are a disaster for the UK, but they risk getting voted out in favor of someone who really *is* anti-immigrant if they don't do a bit of pandering.
p2032
aVShort-term, lowering tuition won't solve this problem because the UK needs these workers *now*.
p2033
aVMedium term, it's unclear if lowering tuition will work because countries like France have dirt-cheap tuition, but not enough students enrolling in STEM fields.
p2034
aVLong-term, the UK needs to get those workers, but that's either going to be skilled immigrant labor (which is being turned away) or skilled domestic labor (which isn't being created).
p2035
aVVery interesting stuff.
p2036
aVOut of curiosity, what's your political persuasion.
p2037
aV&gt; Out of curiosity, what's your political persuasion.
p2038
aVDamn it, I'm about to out myself.
p2039
aVI don't *have* a political persuasion any more.
p2040
aVI'm an American who's lived in the US, the Netherlands, Japan, France (currently) and in the UK for several years, of during most of which I found myself working for the BBC.
p2041
aVI originally went to Uni to be an economist, but stopped taking economics classes because I took all of them.
p2042
aVI'm now living in various countries with my wife and daughter and I see the same fundamental problem over and over again: people want "one size fits all" economic and social solutions to problems and *it ain't gonna happen*.
p2043
aVAny economist (I'm lookin' at you, Austrians!
p2044
aV) who tries to claim their preferred system is the only way to go is full of shit.
p2045
aVI sort of liked Cameron when I first moved to the UK in 2006, but I didn't like the Tories due to their slavish worship of US Republicans (my wife worked as a political advisor and got to see Tory functions first hand).
p2046
aVI definitely *didn't* like Vice President Blair, as I called him, but sort of preferred Labour to Tories, except that Labor, under Blair, were going nowhere.
p2047
aVThen there were the LibDems whose *ideas* I sort of liked, but whose policy positions were often incomprehensible to me (and a hearty round of applause for the comedy performance of Nick Clegg for completely failing to realize that Cameron's promise of a referendum on a voting system that would gut the Tory party was worth as much as one might think it would be).
p2048
aVIn short, there are many brilliant ideas out there and no one party has the monopoly on them (even here in France, the disgusting Marine Le Pen is raising issues that, damn it, need to be raised \u2014 talk about mixed emotions on my part).
p2049
aVI don't stand for any sort of bigotry or other forms of discriminations against race, creed, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender identification, blah, blah, blah.
p2050
aVBut other than that, my political beliefs don't fit too neatly into any category.
p2051
aVBravo. 
p2052
aV&gt;I actually feel bad for politicians.
p2053
aVThey know that the short term "anti-immigrant" solutions they talk about are a disaster for the UK, but they risk getting voted out in favor of someone who really is anti-immigrant if they don't do a bit of pandering.
p2054
aVWhy feel bad?
p2055
aVThey are being fundamentally dishonest.
p2056
aVPeople have two issues with immigration: one is that it is perceived as depressing wages and hoovering up unskilled employment opportunities, the other is that the numbers are simply so large.
p2057
aVThey could do what the people want and implement a Canadian / American / Australian style policy to *every* foreign country, but they won't.
p2058
aVThey are committed to the EU and must mislead the public.
p2059
aVThey are intentionally bringing about a situation whereby Indian doctors get excluded and any unemployable thug from the former Soviet Bloc can walk right in.
p2060
aV&gt; Why feel bad?
p2061
aVThey are being fundamentally dishonest.
p2062
aVI sympathize with that point of view, but let's assume that you're a really, really good person and you're also a politician.
p2063
aVHowever, through no fault of your own, the economy has gone to shit, you're sinking in the polls, and a large part of your electorate is out of work and buying the whole "immigrant job" line that the BNP candidate is giving.
p2064
aVNo matter how hard you try, he's steadily eating into your voter base.
p2065
aVSo now you have a choice:\u000a\u000a1.
p2066
aVContinue to be true to your values and risk a BNP thug take your job and start calling the shots.
p2067
aV2.
p2068
aVAbandon your values and start fighting immigration.
p2069
aV3.
p2070
aV*Say* that you're fighting immigration, but quietly working to support the UK economy anyway.
p2071
aVThis is effectively the position Obama was in in his first term: he tried to push through a lot of policies he believed in, but his own party said "we won't support you because we won't get re-elected.
p2072
aV" As a result, he could have appeared to have been a good-hearted but ineffective leader, but instead took paths 2/3 above (you decide).
p2073
aVI sincerely believe that some politicians find room to compromise because the alternative, in their minds, would be much worse.
p2074
aVIt's a problem which can only be alleviated by a deep education of the public, but we've already seen that this isn't going to happen.
p2075
aVThinking "the alternative to me is much worse" is fine, but actively misleading people so they are voting for you when you don't plan to do what you're saying is just plain wrong.
p2076
aV3 is a terrible way to do politics.
p2077
aV2 is clearly off the table.

aVIf we lack skilled workers it is because our government is retarded, they let abundances of talent do useless degrees that simply have no demand.
p2082
aVThe solution is not immigration, the solution is proper education and that doesn't involve throwing money at it, it just means the government giving people less freedom to study what they want. 
p2083
aVYeah because people should not be able to pick what they study.

p2092
aVOh, so the retarded government is supposed to decide which degrees are worthwhile?
p2093
aVThe *government* can decide if it will *let* you follow a given degree?
p2094
aVAre you fucking insane?
p2095
aVI'm not going to respond to that lest I invoke the wrath of Godwin, but I don't think too many people are going to be comfortable with the "retarded government" telling them what they can and can not study.
p2096
aV&gt; The solution is not immigration, the solution is proper education\u000a\u000aWhich involves:\u000a\u000a* Convincing people to take degrees which will benefit the economy\u000a* And convincing them to graduate *today*\u000a\u000aThis isn't a problem that might happen in a few years.
p2097
aVThis is happening now.
p2098
aVThis is a real problem *now*.
p2099
aVThe UK economy has been sputtering along for years and it might finally be coming out of it, but it's unclear.
p2100
aVThe unwillingness (actually, the inability) of the government to address the problems which exist *now* isn't helping the UK, it's hurting the UK.
p2101
aVOf course, if you have a solution that will help solve the **known problem that exists now**, I'd love to hear it.

aV**Update**: as an aside, I like how you first made the blanket assertion that there's no lack of skilled workers, and then you responded to my response with "if we lack skilled workers it's because ...".
p2115

p2119
aVAre you fucking insane?
p2120
aVThat guy you're talking at is clearly not too smart, but this part got to me.
p2121
aVWhy would it be so bad for the government to subsidise certain degrees more?
p2122
aVSTEM subjects being half the price of non-STEM subjects *as an example* would be a degree of control without the government just telling someone outright what degree they can do.
p2123
aVIf that's what he meant, I could be less concerned about that, but that's not what he said.
p2124
aVIn fact, I'm unsure that's what he meant because he repeated that idiocy *twice*:\u000a\u000a* *[the government] let abundances of talent do useless degrees that simply have no demand*\u000a* *it just means the government giving people less freedom to study what they want.
p2125
aV*\u000a\u000aI could easily see the government supporting STEM degrees.
p2126
aVI do have a concern, though, about how the university system itself is managed.
p2127
aVThere are many "useless" degrees (history, art, literature, philosophy, and so on) which nonetheless broaden the experience of the entire country.
p2128
aVWe don't want those taken away, but neither do we wish to go the American route of unrelenting student debt crushing down on those who study degrees which enrich in ways other than money.
p2129
aVFurthering the divide between the "haves" and "have nots" by punishing with debt those whose degrees we don't value isn't helping.
p2130
aVThe UK should ask itself: do we want to continue to promote a society where *money* is seen as the primary objective of learning?
p2131
aVTolkien was a uni professor, but he wasn't teaching STEM.
p2132
aVOr consider [Deidre Hyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_Hyde), an exceptionally talented British artist who graduated with a fine arts degree and today paints incredible works or art.
p2133
aVOr what about almost every teacher teaching our children today?
p2134
aVMany of them have acquired "useless" degrees and yet are today shaping the future.
p2135
aV[Prior to 1998, tuition fees weren't charged](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students).
p2136
aVUniversity was part of a continuum of the free public education process where you could finally choose your specialty.
p2137
aVWhy isn't the government charging for, say, primary or secondary?
p2138
aVBecause *that's an investment in the future of the UK*.
p2139
aVUnfortunately, when you start getting a short-sighted "we need to balance everything *now*" attitude towards government, it makes it much harder to start laying out long-term plans.
p2140
aVRather than subsidizing STEM, I'd rather see a return to subsidizing the nation's future, regardless of whether or not we necessarily understand or approve of it, and roll back the tuition fees altogether.
p2141
aVHowever, it will never happen.
p2142
aVStudents are now a source of revenue and the politicians are quite happy with that.
p2143
aV&gt;If that's what he meant, I could be less concerned about that, but that's not what he said.
p2144
aVIn fact, I'm unsure that's what he meant because he repeated that idiocy twice:\u000a\u000aYeah, I have no clue what that guy was chatting about.
p2145
aVI just thought I'd raise what I saw as an interesting possibility.
p2146
aV&gt;Furthering the divide between...
p2147
aVI think I should be clearer here, I meant the monetary support as an example of the government having some control over which degrees people do without having outright control.
p2148
aVPersonally, I think things like education should be free as there's nothing more valuable to a country than an educated population, but that's beside the point I was making: There are ways the government can have control over what happens at universities that aren't absolute control, there are degrees(badumtsh!
p2149
aV) of control.
p2150
aVI hadn't read the rest of your post until this point, but I must say we completely agree.
p2151
aVI think the only thing that should dictate whether or not you do a degree is your willingness to learn it, and the only real way to measure that at the moment is through grades.
p2152
aVI also think we should promote other means of higher education than just universities, as there are people who go to university just for the sake of it, rather than to learn something at degree level; promoting tradeskills, which to me are another form of higher education, for reasons other than monetary would be very beneficial to the UK.
p2153
aVAs an Englishman more skilled workers does nothing to benefit me it will just lower wages and force me to up my standards for the same wage I can get now.

aVFuck off.
p2174
aV2) So?
p2175
aVWhy do we care about their past all we care about is their ability to contribute to our country now, whether we trained them or not is no concern once they are an adult, besides it doesn't seem like a lot of them have an education.

aVDoes anyone have a source for the last 'after UKIP' quote?
p2188
aVnotice the years, I don't think it's as much a case as before and after UKIP, more before the 2010 general election, and after it. 
p2189
aVGovernments are supposed to represent their people.
p2190
aVIf David Cameron is changing what he says to reflect general opinion, it isn't a bad thing.
p2191
aVTo be fair, how much of this is up to UKIP, and how much is it up to him not being in power in 2006/7.
p2192
aVLots of politicians say lots of things when they aren't in power, but they all start sounding strangely similar when they are. 
p2193
aVI see nothing wrong in changing one's position when events &amp; circumstances demand it. 
p2194
aVBut broadly speaking the events are similar and the circumstances haven't changed.
p2195
aVWe had substantial immigration 7 years ago and our borders were open to everyone in the EU.
p2196
aVWe had an issue with islamic extremism, indeed some of those Before quotes are only 4 years after 9/11.
p2197
aVYeah, he's lurched to the right on rhetoric, but there's no real changes of policy there.
p2198
aVWhen more than half of immigration, and a larger proportion of unskilled and low skilled immigration is from the EU, there's no point talking tough unless you're talking about leaving.
p2199
aV&gt;  When more than half of immigration, and a larger proportion of unskilled and low skilled immigration is from the EU\u000a\u000aOnly 38% of immigration is from the EU (47% from outside the EU and the rest Brits coming back).
p2200
aVIf you meant Net migration, then sure 54% of it is from the EU.
p2201
aVBut 67% of it is from outside of the EU (the difference is the fact more Britons leave than come back).
p2202
aVIt also turns out that Immigrants tend to be more educated than natives (although this could be function of the age of people we attract):\u000a\u000a&gt; By 2011, the percentage of natives with a degree had nearly doubled, to 21%, while the percentage of EEA and non-EEA immigrants had increased even further, to 32% and 38%, respectively.
p2203
aVSimilarly, about one in two native born individuals fall into the \u201clow education\u201d category (defined as those who left full- time education before 17), while only one in five EEA immigrants and one in four non-EEA immigrants do so\u000a\u000a[source](http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/CDP_22_13.pdf)\u000a\u000aBut let's not let either of these get in the way of (yet another) good circlejerk about the EU.
p2204
aV&gt; Immigrants tend to be more educated than natives\u000a\u000aFor both EU and non-EU immigrants?
p2205
aVAlso one of the problems is the 2nd generation immigrants.
p2206
aV2nd generation Muslim immigrants are far more radicalised than their parents.
p2207
aVFar more likely to support killing people for apostasy etc.
p2208
aV&gt; For both EU and non-EU immigrants?
p2209
aVEEA stands for European Economic Area.
p2210
aVSo yes - 32% for EEA immigrants had a degree and 38% for non-EEA (compared to 21% native).
p2211
aV&gt; 2nd generation Muslim immigrants are far more radicalised than their parents\u000a\u000aI'm sure 2nd generation Muslim immigrants are also far more likely to be educated and employed than their parents as well (and I suspect far less likely to value their religion).
p2212
aVWhether any of these 'facts' are because of their religion or immigration status or because of their socio-economic status is another question.
p2213
aV&gt; EEA stands for European Economic Area.
p2214
aVSo yes - 32% for EEA immigrants had a degree and 38% for non-EEA (compared to 21% native).
p2215
aVThanks.
p2216
aV&gt; (and I suspect far less likely to value their religion)\u000a\u000aActually it's well known that British Muslim youths are more radicalised than their parents.
p2217
aV[Here's an paper that discusses it](http://www.academia.edu/1063860/British_Muslim_Young_People_Facts_Features_and_Religious_Trends).
p2218
aVAnd here's a newspaper article about it:  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1540895/Young-British-Muslims-getting-more-radical.html  \u000a\u000a&gt; I'm sure 2nd generation Muslim immigrants are also far more likely to be educated and employed than their parents\u000a\u000a\u000aWhy would you expect that?
p2219
aVYou said yourself that the parent are likely highly educated.
p2220
aVThat makes it unlikely that their children are even more educated than their parents.
p2221
aVWhat we are seeing is high unemployment among Muslim youths.
p2222
aV&gt; While the greatestnumbers of Muslim young people appear to have only cultural attachments to theirfaith, a signi\ufb01cant, visible number are increasingly turning towards religion\u000a\u000aThe paper you linked only seemed to show the cultural influences of the religion.
p2223
aVIt made no mention of how young people are being radicalised.
p2224
aVHere:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/29/thinktanks.religion\u000a\u000aAnd\u000a\u000a&gt; A 2007 poll by Policy Exchange revealed that 31% of British Muslims believed that leaving the Muslim religion should be punishable by death\u000a\u000ahttp://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/living%20apart%20together%20-%20jan%2007.pdf\u000a
p2225
aV&gt; Why would you expect that?
p2226
aVYou said yourself that the parent are likely highly educated.
p2227
aVThat makes it unlikely that their children are even more educated than their parents.
p2228
aVYounger people tend to be more educated than older people generally: the number of people going to university from School is rising.
p2229
aVYounger people also tend to have less interest in religion that older people - the census demographic data backs this up.
p2230
aVThere's no real reason to suggest it is different for immigrants or Muslims (or a combination thereof).
p2231
aV&gt; Younger people tend to be more educated than older people generally\u000a\u000aYes, but we're dealing a group that is already highly educated to start with.
p2232
aVIf you looked at only university professors, for example, then you'd expect their children to be less educated than their parents.\u000a\u000a
p2233
aVI don't really see many people complaining about immigration from the EU.
p2234
aVI think people only complain about the Romani gypsies in general.
p2235
aVI haven't personally seen people complain about Polish people - is that really a thing?
p2236
aVAside from Romani gypsies, pretty much all the complaints that I hear about immigration is about 3rd world cultures and Islam.
p2237
aVIt isn't UKIP.
p2238
aVThe Electorate want a financially competent nice party.
p2239
aVThe Tories lost in 97 because they were financially questionable and generally arseholes and while Labour weren't better on the issue of money they were nicer, ergo landslide.
p2240
aVThey then spent 10 years borrowing money to keep everything afloat while being generally nice other than on civil liberties and Iraq, hence they won 2 elections against Tories who remained stuck in their fiscally questionable arsehole phase.
p2241
aVCameron comes along and realises that the only way to get power at this point is to be even nicer than Labour while being as fiscally competent, so signs up to their spending plans and starts saying nice things to pretend his party of arseholes seems nice.
p2242
aVWhen the financial crisis comes along both sides are harmed, but Cameron gets the most seats because he is a bit more competent than Brown while seeming like he is nice.
p2243
aVMove to now.
p2244
aVThe Tories have an advantage on the economy, the nice people weren't enough to get Cameron a majority.
p2245
aVHowever there are a lot of arseholes out there.
p2246
aVHis plan therefore is to make a fiscally competent nice party which appeals to arseholes.
p2247
aV&gt; while Labour weren't better on the issue of money they were nicer, ergo landslide.
p2248
aVThey then spent 10 years borrowing money to keep everything afloat while being generally nice other than on civil liberties and Iraq\u000a\u000aActually, Labour was running a budget surplus in 2002 and 2003.
p2249
aVThe first surplus in decades.
p2250
aVIt was Iraq what scuppered it.
p2251
aVIt was supposed to last 6 months and be paid out of the reserves, but lasted 8 years and sucked a whole lot of money.
p2252
aVAnd the Labour govt didn't dare cut spending to pay for war, people were angry enough about Iraq.
p2253
aVSo they borrowed.
p2254
aVUnfortunately, it suits a lot of people to gloss over how **very expensive** war is.
p2255
aVThey like to pretend its all down to public spending and blowing up millions of pounds (literally) every time you launch a Tomahawk costs nothing.
p2256
aVThat was a very entertaining read!
p2257
aVNecessarily simplified but good.

p2261
aVHe actually had some fair points back in the day.
p2262
aVNow he is just being pushed further and further right which is both a mistake for him and for the country.
p2263
aVthe huge upsurge in UKIP support shows a large percentage of our country wants a hard stance on immigration, why would he not jump at the chance to appeal to them?
p2264
aVYeah people cry that Miliband refuses to offer a referendum and thus appeal to those who want nothing to do with the UKIP agenda.
p2265
aV&gt;the huge upsurge in UKIP from having no members of Parliament and no local councils to no members of Parliament and no local councils shows a large percentage of our country don't.
p2266
aVFTFY
p2267
aVThey've gone from having no local Councillors to having some local Councillors.
p2268
aVJust because they don't control any councils doesn't mean they don't have a voice.
p2269
aVI am vehemently against pretty much everything they stand for but diversity in politics is a good thing. 
p2270
aV1.
p2271
aVI was just trying to point out there was no "huge upsurge".
p2272
aV2.
p2273
aVThere were definitely UKIP Councillors already before media started paying attention to them.
p2274
aV12 MEPs to 24 MEPs might suggest otherwise about the huge upsurge. 
p2275
aVWhile increased diversity is good thing, increased extremism and nationalism are not.
p2276
aVThere will always be a fringe at either end of the scale, hiving them off into their own marginal party is better in my mind than poisoning the ideology of the moderates.
p2277
aVFPTP
p2278
aVI enjoyed that
p2279
aVWell most people have a reasoned and principled stance on these issues, rather than just adopting whatever fits to appeal to people.
p2280
aVIn reality we all know, if a politician changes his view constantly, it's probably because he is manipulating voters and has intention of carrying through with his rhetoric.
p2281
aVNo, nonononono.
p2282
aV**Edit:** Well, that was not a very good argument of my part...
p2283
aVQuite the transformation.
p2284
aVIt always makes me laugh thinking how much influence UKIP has already, they haven't even got an MP yet (not counting Carswell until after the by-election) and they've got the Prime Minister whistling their tune.
p2285
aVIf he was really whistling their tune instead of pretending to do so, wouldn't you think he'd be proposing an EU referendum sooner?
p2286
aVYou're otherwise right, though, UKIP does have a lot of influence.
p2287
aVIt doesn't matter if he's pretending or not.
p2288
aVHe's still whistling UKIP's tune and it's effecting the direction of the tories. 
p2289
aV&gt; If he was really whistling their tune instead of pretending to do so, wouldn't you think he'd be proposing an EU referendum sooner?
p2290
aVYou're otherwise right, though, UKIP does have a lot of influence.
p2291
aVHe can't get it earlier.
p2292
aVThere is no way that it would pass through parliament at the moment because Labour and the Lib Dems would vote against it and together they have more votes than the Tories.
p2293
aVWell if Cameron managed to get even half of UKIP's supporters back to the Tories, than he would win the election easily.
p2294
aVSo it's easy to see why he's sucking up to them.
p2295
aVAh yes, because things can't change over an 8 year gap?

aVWhen will we get robot overlords whose unwavering opinions are completely immune to a constantly changing world?
p2317
aVHas he thrown out all his principles like Blair did in the 1990s, or is it just this one thing?
p2318
aV&gt;When will we get robot overlordsNext year, if Milliband gets in to office.
p2319
aVcome on now sir.
p2320
aVat a time when negotiations are still going on i think it's unwise to post negative comments about the millibot\u000a\u000aand what i mean by that is that negotiations are still going on and it's unwise to offer negative opinion on a currently untested millibot at a time when the negotiations are still going on  
p2321
aVHave you tried switching him off and on?
p2322
aVWe tried that AND we've patched his bacon sandwhich protocol \u000a\u000afear not citizen.
p2323
aVYou're millibot will be fully functional in time to take high office in 2015
p2324
aVI'd prefer one that can also pass the Turing test.
p2325
aVEDIT: Forgot the word "pass".
p2326
aVI think I would also fail the Turing test.
p2327
aVIt's almost as if politicians say things to get votes rather than say things they actually believe.
p2328
aVor as if things change over an 8 year gap and people's opinion's change to meet those.
p2329
aVPerhaps, I think David Cameron is a conservative, Ed Milliband is a social democrat.
p2330
aVBut I also think that on some issues their opinions matter far less than what will get them votes. 
p2331
aVYou may well be right.
p2332
aVBut this is a garbage post and proves nothing.
p2333
aVOh yeah definitely.
p2334
aVWas just a little joke, didn't mean it as a wholesale statement.
p2335
aVI seem to recall there were some whispers of this years ago when Obama first met Cameron pre-election describing him as a "lightweight" \u000a\u000ahttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/8169382/WikiLeaks-Barack-Obama-regarded-David-Cameron-as-lightweight.html\u000a\u000a
p2336
aVFuck, I'd say whatever the hell I felt the British people wanted if they would make me pm. 
p2337
aVHe flips more than a pancake.
p2338
aVYou have to remember that Cameron said this stuff when the Conservatives were almost dead as a political force.
p2339
aVHe had to appear to be ultra-liberal to get press attention.
p2340
aVSaying stuff like 'Hug a hoodie' was never meant to be a serious political point, just a way of garnering attention during a time of liberal popularity. 
p2341
aVThis makes Cameron c. 2006-07 sound vaguely reasonable. 
p2342
aVBritain having to conform to asian values is reasonable and makes sense?
p2343
aVDude you should just move to sweden and check your privilege on a daily basis.
p2344
aVNot what he said, and I did say vaguely
p2345
aVNah you support this.
p2346
aVYou support Britain having to integrate to "asian values" because you are insane and hate your own culture. 
p2347
aVAlright, sure.
p2348
aVYou're quoting something that he simply didn't say.
p2349
aVHe said:\u000a\u000a&gt;Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around.
p2350
aVIntegrating doesn't mean taking on another cultures values, but instead respecting them and not marginalising them.
p2351
aVGoogle's definition:\u000a\u000a&gt;bring (people or groups with particular characteristics or needs) into equal participation in or membership of a social group or institution.
p2352
aVMeanwhile we let them rape our little girls for years yet we need to be more tolerant of them?
p2353
aVAh yes, let's take a small sample size and totally ignore the fact that White British people commit similar crimes
p2354
aV&gt; 1400 girls getting raped in one town alone by muslims and progressives such as me covering it up is a small sample size as if that makes any sense.
p2355
aV&gt; white British people form rape gangs where they molest children!
p2356
aVBELIEVE ME\u000a\u000aYou are pathetic. 
p2357
aVNo, because what you've done is taken one town in an entire country.
p2358
aVOf course it's a terrible,terrible thing that happened in Rotherham but don't paint all Muslims on the actions of that.
p2359
aVIn 2011 220 people of Asian descent went to jail on sexual offences - a tiny, tiny part of the Asian population and very very similar to the same proportion as white people in jail for similar offences in the same period. 
p2360
aVIt's not even one town.
p2361
aVAlso they don't get arrested because they get called racist by people like you.
p2362
aVWho have I called racist?
p2363
aV"One town" is your words, not mine. 
p2364
aVI said just one town as in one town alone.
p2365
aVThis is likely happening in many muslim areas across england.
p2366
aVAhem, those jobs still existed before the immigrants came.
p2367
aVFucking UKIP
p2368
aVSo what he's a lier and will say what ever he has to in order to get votes.
p2369
aVNo news there.
p2370
aVThe key to being a politician is being able to distance yourself from your words.
p2371
aVSo much for "conservative"
p2372
aVThis makes me sick.
p2373
aVFucking David Cameron, WHATTA DICKHEAD.
p2374
aV45 years ago David Cameron hated bath time, now he bathes everyday.
p2375
aVPS, fuck conservatives. 
p2376
aVI thought this was quite good, actually.
p2377
aVVery Benjamin-Franklin-esque. 
p2378
aVWell spotted.
p2379
aVThe quote in full:\u000a\u000a"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.
p2380
aV" - Benjamin Franklin
p2381
aVI find the spotlight-esque lighting quite disquieting.
p2382
aVThere should be holes in the security fence.
p2383
aVOr the security fence should be made out of cling film or something.
p2384
aVThe type of security people are asking for is of course impossible.
p2385
aVI think it's fitting how the artist doesn't detail any of the builder's faces - it shows how with no privacy, everyone will have to conform and it will be the death of individuality.
p2386
aVAnyone who thinks that privacy is coming back is deluded.
p2387
aVI agree it's annoying but privacy is never coming back.
p2388
aVDoesn't make much sense since their privacy walls ought to double up as a security measure anyway.
p2389
aVThe point is that they're losing elements of their privacy to live within the confines of security - which now includes the security workers \u000a\u000aBrilliant cartoon.
p2390
aVI know what the point is m8.
p2391
aVI just felt like pointing out that it's a bit unrealistic.
p2392
aVThen again, it's a cartoon so it's probably meant to be ;)
p2393
aVThere should be more than one house within the fence.
p2394
aVYeah, at least them and their neighbours exchanging nervous glances, that'd be perfect.
p2395
aVI find these things facile, and it's been done so many times before.
p2396
aVIf they gave a description of the scene instead of drawing it, it wouldn't look so goddamned out of place when they use words to explain the joke.
p2397
aVWow, The Sun behaved unprofessionally I'm so surprised 
p2398
aVThis is outrageous no matter how unsurprising it is.
p2399
aVRupert Murdoch is trying his hardest to subvert our democracy, it's a big deal.
p2400
aVDon't give in to outrage fatigue.
p2401
aV"The Sun: News before it happens!
p2402
aV"\u000a\u000atbh, it's kind of inevitable, I mean, various people have been reporting things that come out of twitter without varifying the facts around them for a while now, why not just go a step further and just make shit up?
p2403
aVIt's ridiculous and hideous and people need to be encouraged to read news from multiple sources.
p2404
aVDoes this not remind you of  the bond villain who creates news for his company to profit on?
p2405
aVHalk confirms this revelation will have exactly zero effect because anyone dumb enough to get their politics from the Sun will be dumb enough not to care.
p2406
aVSadly.
p2407
aVWhat about those smart enough to realise the other papers aren't much better?
p2408
aVThat would be most of the public given current paper circulation figures.
p2409
aVUmm, internet?
p2410
aVInternet media is completely different to print media though.
p2411
aVMainly because people tend to not be inside a political echo chamber.
p2412
aVIt is harder to control the narrative on the internet.
p2413
aVBut most of the people that read the Sun, Times or Grauniad on paper probably read the same online and not necessarily looking for a broader picture. 
p2414
aVI'm just glad you used 'Grauniad' while commenting on a Private Eye post.
p2415
aVThey go on Reddit ;)
p2416
aVI see little point in belittling people who read The Sun.
p2417
aVThey might on average not be the brightest sparks but they're clever enough to earn and buy a paper for a break from something.
p2418
aVIt does matter that a national newspaper is lying to try and influence an election, no matter the peecieved intelligence of the reader.
p2419
aVIntelligent people swallow lies just as well, making yourself feel superior doesn't make you exempt.
p2420
aVIt's not the first time they've made shit up though.
p2421
aVAll that will happen is they'll print a retraction somewhere in the depths of the paper if they're wrong.
p2422
aVWhat needs to happen is some rule gets put in place that says "if something is reported faulsly or incorrectly, then the correction needs to take up the same space and position as the original mistake"\u000a\u000aAlthough then the Sun headlines would alternate between "SHOCKING SHIT THAT HAPPENED!!!!
p2423
aV" and "YESTERDAYS HEADLINE WASN'T BASED ON ANY FACTS OR EVIDENCE!!!
p2424
aV"
aVIt should be written by an independent adjudicator, too.
p2425
aVI'd vote for someone who had that as a policy!
p2426
aVOf course it matters that the paper is lying, that lie will have an effect on the reader's political choice.
p2427
aVWhat OP is saying is that exposing the lie changes nothing.
p2428
aV&gt;Intelligent people swallow lies just as well, making yourself feel superior doesn't make you exempt.
p2429
aVThey really don't.\u000a\u000a
p2430
aVIf the Nazis can happen, they do.
p2431
aVWe're talking about blatant, simple lies in the tabloid press here... Not the nazis.
p2432
aVI'm just saying, if you think intelligent people are less likely to be coehersed then you are mistaken.
p2433
aVI invoke the nazi card legitimately to show that propaganda works on all levels of society.
p2434
aVIts quite simple really.
p2435
aVIf you don't understand something like basic statistics, its ridiculously easy to be mislead by a dramatic looking graph that is actually total bollocks.
p2436
aVHappens all the time.
p2437
aVIf you have a basic grasp of statistics its pretty easy to know if the wool is being pulled over your eyes when people fuck about with graphs.
p2438
aVAlso general knowledge and experience counts for a lot.
p2439
aVLook at how skewed peoples views are about the number of single mothers, immigrants, muslims etc.... are compared to the reality.
p2440
aVI get what you're saying about whole nations occasionally being moved towards extreme ideologies.
p2441
aVBut I think theres a difference between that and people just being told bare faced lies by media that they trust in an effort to make them believe certain things.
p2442
aVThe Sun for example would have a much easier time of manipulating a story than The Guardian or the financial times.
p2443
aVI'm making a distinction here between two people who have the same comprehensive understanding of a subject, but holding different views because of their personal leanings, and two people where one or both of them simply don't understand the subject and for that reason come to different views based on flawed premises.
p2444
aVHey, Godwin!
p2445
aVGodwin be damned, we're talking about propaganda-fuelled populism here. 
p2446
aVThey may still swallow lies, but that does not mean they "swallow lies just as well".
p2447
aVIf intelligence means anything, surely it means the ability to see flaws in reasoning?
p2448
aVWe're not going to get to the bottom of this without a physiologist, really.
p2449
aVI think there is a case for saying intelligent people can be minipulated just as well.
p2450
aVThe approach might be different between intelligence levels of the mark but it could reach the same end.
p2451
aVYour spelling and grammar isn't doing much for your case.
p2452
aVYou have to actually be intelligent before you can make generalisations about intelligent people.
p2453
aVI'm a dyslexic typing on a phone, what going to do about it?
p2454
aVBut cheers for your insult, point well made!
p2455
aVThis is absolutely wrong.
p2456
aVThe Sun plays a huge part.
p2457
aVAbsolutely everybody is encouraged to vote these days and people with no knowledge, pressured to vote, will read this and immediately say "well I better not vote for this guy". 
p2458
aVYou didn't understand what I said, please read it again.
p2459
aVI'm saying that revealing the Sun has a bias will have no effect.
p2460
aVAbsolutely not what you said in anyway.
p2461
aVYour comment was that people dumb enough to get their politics from the Sun are dumb enough not to care.
p2462
aVWell I couldn't disagree more.
p2463
aVPeople are encouraged to vote vociferously, there is no IQ test.
p2464
aVThe Sun is a very influential paper, whether those people have a high IQ or not.
p2465
aVI don't take my views from that paper and I don't suppose you do either but I would certainly guard against assuming others wouldn't. 
p2466
aV&gt;Absolutely not what you said in anyway.
p2467
aVEverybody else seems to have understood it apart from one other guy who apologised for reading it wrong.
p2468
aVDo we have to do this internet thing where you steadfastly refuse to admit you got something wrong?
p2469
aVI'm not saying what the other guy was saying at all.
p2470
aVI have read it over and over again, and I have even used your exact words.
p2471
aVI have a different view to you and automatically I'm refusing I got something wrong?
p2472
aV&gt;Do we have to do this internet thing where you steadfastly refuse to admit you got something wrong?
p2473
aVYes, we do by the looks of things.
p2474
aVYeah ...
p2475
aVI'm not wrong.
p2476
aVYeah I think they're preaching to a mixture of the choir and the bored schoolkids not really paying attention during the sermon. 
p2477
aVLearn some history.
p2478
aVThe sun had a rather large affect in the past.
p2479
aVIt might not even be taken seriously by the people that read it but day after day properganda tends to wear in to people's minds.
p2480
aVLearn to read.
p2481
aVYou did not understand my post.
p2482
aVI'm saying Private Eye exposing the Sun does not matter at all.
p2483
aVOh fair enough that was a failure in my reading compression.
p2484
aVI'll take the hits.
p2485
aVI'd say it's questionable how much effect the Sun has actually had on elections, it's more a case of backing winners than making them.
p2486
aVCertainly when Murdoch shifted the Sun from the left to the right, it's readership remained Labour voting (that was at the time, it's readership may have shifted over the long term, I've not seen any work on that).
p2487
aVYou are right that the real effect they (and our overwhelmingly right wing press in general) have is in framing and limiting the debate, which pushes previously mainstream policy positions to the fringes.
p2488
aVOverall the evidence is that the population as a whole are incredibly discerning when it comes to how they engage with the media (which is a relief), so whilst there are questions about media plurality and press accuracy, we shouldn't worry too much about undue influence directly on our democracy. 
p2489
aVOh, well thats ok then.
p2490
aVDo you have links for the sources?
p2491
aVMore an accumulation from my undergrad and masters years.
p2492
aVI'd say 'Power Without Responsibility' by James Curran and Jean Seaton is a must read if you want a comprehensive introduction to media history and press issues (actually I think the stuff about voting intention of Sun readers is in there)

p2496
aVWell, that's a libel case in the offing then. 
p2497
aVNothing new for the Eye then
p2498
aVTo me what's more egregious is the Mail's reporting - which was after the fact but encouraged a complete misread of the figures\u000a\u000aEd Miliband comes in top of the "who won" poll at 35%.
p2499
aVMail headline?
p2500
aV"Miliband comes out bruised from debate that only a third say he won"\u000a\u000aFuckers.
p2501
aVWhat if...
p2502
aVThe entire debate was heavily scripted.
p2503
aVAnd the sun managed to get their hands on a copy of it.
p2504
aVJust asking questions people.
p2505
aVI really want to quote that bit from Tomorrow Never Dies while he's writing about the fishermen killed in the South China sea and changing the numbers of people killed!
p2506
aV&gt;I really want to quote that bit from Tomorrow Never Dies\u000a\u000aGo on then.
p2507
aVI won't stop you.
p2508
aVYou can't seriously defend this.
p2509
aVYou just look unreasonable. 
p2510
aVIt's a joke. 
p2511
aVGood one. 
p2512
aVI chortled savagely.
p2513
aVMe too.
p2514
aVI honestly can't contain myself.
p2515
aVA lot of people are denying this.
p2516
aVNick Sutton has already tweeted that he only received the page at 10:51, quite a few Sun people are tweeting that the page was designed after 10. 
p2517
aVYup - it's been denied very strenuously.
p2518
aVGiven how tone deaf it was compared to what people really thought of the debate, frankly I'd be more surprised if they hadn't pre-written it.
p2519
aVAs Labours lead continues we're only going to see more of this.
p2520
aVIt's amazing how blatantly misleading and deceitful papers can be without it being illegal.
p2521
aVIt's really bad this time round because Milliband has promised to implement Leveson and clamp down on tax avoidance.
p2522
aVSo it's personal.
p2523
aVits a rag anyway.
p2524
aVif you look at the front pages of the last few weeks, about two thirds of them manage to squeeze a non-story about milliband onto them.
p2525
aVlike "whitehall officials fear milliband as pm", "experts say milliband will steal office of pm with the help of SNP despite having less seats and less votes than the tories"[clearly they dont read their own opinion polls], even bringing the two kitchens thing back for a full page spread a couple of days ago.
p2526
aVpictures of milliband are almost always captioned "failure", "loser"\u000a\u000a      \u000ai cant imagine who is actually persuaded by this
p2527
aVTo be fair to them, you can only judge who "wins" a debate like this subjectively anyway.
p2528
aVIf you are against a certain party, then you'll always find ways to paint things negatively.
p2529
aVThe Sun would never have written anything good, even if Miliband stormed it somehow.
p2530
aV&gt; To be fair to them\u000a\u000aWhy, the fuck, would you want to do that?!
p2531
aV?  
p2532
aVIt'll have a massive impact on voting, because all the Sun readers will believe what they read.
p2533
aVThe Sun can literally print anything and nothing will happen to them, but it'll effect everyone.
p2534
aVIsn't this been standard pratics for quite some time?
p2535
aVI remember the DM accidentally published an article about a court verdict that was the wrong one
p2536
aV&gt;accidentally \u000a\u000a" "
p2537
aVThat's a bit different.
p2538
aVWith that, there were two clear outcomes: guilty or not.
p2539
aVThey'll have had stories written for either eventuality ahead of time in an effort to be first with the news, perhaps with little details left to add in once the verdict was through, and just published the wrong one by mistake.
p2540
aVSloppy, sure, and the DM *are* a shower of shite, but it wasn't quite the same as outright making up a result to fit your narrative before it's even happened.
p2541
aVWhite van man supports UKIP but is too dumb to register to vote.
p2542
aVSee, this is when I don't like Private Eye, when it's being the news equivalent of "Watchdog" and misrepresenting things it either doesn't understand, or worse, does.
p2543
aVIt would seem to me to be entirely standard practise to prep some likely outcomes of a particular event.
p2544
aVI mean, Nigel was always going to stand firm on immigration, and the Sun was always going to say that Miliband had lost the argument.
p2545
aVAdditonally, these were the few words that represent the front pages, not the story within.
p2546
aVThe papers can and do change their headlines after the first edition anyway.
p2547
aVAnd childish downvotes don't make it any less true. 
p2548
aVPrepping likely outcomes is standard practice, publishing them before they've happened isn't.
p2549
aVI think the issue is that it was sent out before the debate had even started.
p2550
aVI would have thought it was bloody well obvious that was the issue.
p2551
aVOh come on.
p2552
aVSee, this is why I don't like you.
p2553
aVSorry, but I just can't join in on every outrage, no matter how well intentioned.
p2554
aVI swear every comment I see from you bitches about downvotes.
p2555
aVSee what you've done /u/Lolworth, you've made me agree with /u/ANAL_McDICK_RAPE

p2559
aVGood to see that the English bar continues to uphold high standards of precision. 
p2560
aVThe two aren't mutually exclusive
p2561
aVTrue, but I would think that being a 'fucking dickhead' is considerably less hateful than being a 'cunt'.
p2562
aVif someone was a fucking dickhead AND a cunt, could you legitimately tell them to go fuck themselves? 
p2563
aVYou could, I think.
p2564
aVFurthermore, I imagine some people would pay a lot of money to see it happen.
p2565
aVparticularly if there was a cheeky girl involved too.
p2566
aVDepends.
p2567
aVIn the UK we can use cunt to describe a best friend or a worst enemy. 
p2568
aVTrue, but then in context any number of words can act as either insult or otherwise.
p2569
aVI don't know.
p2570
aVCunt seems to be one of the words the Americans won't touch with a barge pole.
p2571
aVThe UK and Australia are fine about it, I'm not sure how different countries in Europe feel, nor Africa or Asia, but I often feel that it's like the last 'offensive' word to some people.
p2572
aVTaboo, if you will.  
p2573
aVYes, calling someone a dick is only offensive to the person whereas calling someone a cunt is offensive to all women past, present and future the world over because feminist logic.
p2574
aVYup, that's why, it's not simply because 'cunt' is considered to be a harsher insult than 'dickhead'.
p2575
aVIt's actually all about feminist women and how stupid they are.
p2576
aVIn fact, everything is!
p2577
aVWho decided cunt is a harsher insult than dick then?
p2578
aVThe weighted meanings of insults are not exactly decided by one person.
p2579
aVIt's also not a gender thing, either.
p2580
aVTwat, for example, is roughly similar to dick in terms of offensiveness.  
p2581
aVLike all swear words, the level of insult is purely down to the recipient.
p2582
aVIf you choose to be more insulted by 'dick' than 'cunt', that is entirely your prerogative - perhaps you think 'ham' is more insulting than both.
p2583
aVSaying one word is more insulting than another is like saying apple juice is better than orange juice, it is entirely down to the individual.
p2584
aVThat being said, the media does have a tendency to be less approving of 'cunt', but that doesn't actually mean anything.
p2585
aVThe Daily Mail are more favourable towards the Tories than Labour, doesn't actually mean the Tories are better. 
p2586
aVIf I call someone a cunt though, it's much more likely that a bystander will take offence as well as the person it was aimed at, than if I were to use dick.
p2587
aVOrange juice is also better.
p2588
aVThis is one of those online phenomenons where people pick you apart for not outright stating something that is left implicit in most human speech for the sake of sanity.
p2589
aVIn this case, append "*'cunt' is considered to be a harsher insult than 'dickhead'*" with "*by the majority of individuals*". 
p2590
aVthis has made my day
p2591
aVMet Lembit several times.
p2592
aVCan confirm what the judge said.
p2593
aVHm.
p2594
aVI've met him a few times, and I'd definitely go with the original descriptions.
p2595
aVBit of an over-eager eejit than a proper evil twunt.
p2596
aVAbsolutely right. 
p2597
aVPure gold, love this.
p2598
aVI'd love to know which newspaper has the balls to print those words without asterisks.
p2599
aVLooks like Private Eye
p2600
aVPretty much the only rag worth reading.
p2601
aVI'm always amused at the notion that asterisks make everything ok.
p2602
aVI've seen front page headlines with "F**K" in quite clear view.
p2603
aVWe all know what it says, so I don't quite understand what the point in that pathetic censorship is. 
p2604
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg-Ke36aBh4\u000a\u000a"f**k means fuck more than fuck means fuck".
p2605
aVAh I knew there was something out there.
p2606
aVMany thanks :)
p2607
aVMy favourite use of asterisks was in The Metro some years ago - they quoted someone as calling someone else a "M****rfucker"
p2608
aVYou're kidding?!
p2609
aVThat's amazing!
p2610
aVAh but sure it could have been "feck"
p2611
aVIt's Private eye.
p2612
aVTry a copy, it's very entertaining/outrage inducing reading.
p2613
aV(They don't really believe in the web, but some articles are available there, and some scanned articles can be seen in /r/PrivateEye)
p2614
aVTry a subscription!
p2615
aVIt's ~£20 a year and the best value for money of anything I buy
p2616
aVThanks Ian.
p2617
aVIt took me a while to work up to a subscription as for such a small paper its unbelievably dense so I hadn't always finished it before the new issue was out.
p2618
aVNow I happily subscribe (although I kinda miss being able to buy it before a long train journey or on holidays etc...)
p2619
aVI love Private Eye, but I find it a very depressing read, knowing to what extent our political class is open to lobbying and corruption, and how a great many of our civil servants are hopelessly inept.
p2620
aVIt's Grauniad policy to print swear words in full.
p2621
aVThe asterisks are the preserve of the 'moral outrage' peddling shit-sheets.
p2622
aVBut not necessarily to spell them correctly.
p2623
aVIt is a pity that the Grauniad didn't use technology to simulate the random creativity of their alcoholic typesetter.
p2624
aVWhy haven't I heard about this on BBC News ?
p2625
aVProbably because pre-watershed the content would be confusing and pointless
p2626
aVI'd love to see them try and explain it on the morning news.
p2627
aVDelete as applicable.
p2628
aVWell this sure is a first for me, seeing a political party (of any colour) reject a perfectly legal donation pre-emptively out of ethical rigour.
p2629
aVI can't imagine any of the "Big 3" doing anything quite like this.
p2630
aVIf anyone can point me to any other cases similar to this I would be grateful.
p2631
aVI can imagine more likely is take it, and then beg for forgiveness if they get caught out for it. 
p2632
aVThey rejected £7,000 so I donated £25.
p2633
aVHopefully ~280 other people will do the same and for the first time in a generation we can have a party not in the pocket of special interests.
p2634
aVToday I am mildly ashamed of my overwhelming cynicism towards UKPolitics.
p2635
aVwhere can i donate?
p2636
aVThere's a section on their website:\u000ahttp://greenparty.org.uk/donate/
p2637
aVIt took me two stabs at it as I got 404'd the first time!
p2638
aVdon't feel too bad, you're just being realistic.
p2639
aVUnfortunately, cynicism and realism go hand and hand with regards to politics.
p2640
aVsaid Gordon to Tony, as the tanks rolled into Baghdad
p2641
aVThanks, Satan.
p2642
aV&gt; we can have a party not in the pocket of special interests.
p2643
aVOh my god, those illusions...\u000a\u000aKeep talking the talk greenies, but we've all seen what you do when you're elected.
p2644
aVCuts, cuts, scab, and cuts. 
p2645
aVCan you give some examples of what you mean?
p2646
aVGreen Party is the strongest in two places: Brighton and Bristol.
p2647
aVIf you looked at Green records, Tory records, Labour records, and Lib Dem records, in terms of austerity measures and cuts, they are absolutely indistinguishable.
p2648
aVThat's not hyperbole, I'm being totally serious.
p2649
aVWhere they aren't in power, but have a lot of councillors, they just form coalitions with whoever else and vote for cuts, closures, and attacks just as the other big parties do.
p2650
aVWhere they are in control, like Brighton, they act no different than the tory government.
p2651
aVClose this, shut that, cut this, end that.
p2652
aVIt's as much as bloodbath as Labour council.
p2653
aVAnd when I say scabs, it's because they are.
p2654
aVThey don't support workers fighting to protect their pay or keep their jobs.
p2655
aVCaroline Lucas, for example, during a binmen strike led a group of people to go remove all the waste the binmen weren't removing until they were met in negotiations.
p2656
aVYou might be saying "well it needed to be moved!
p2657
aV", right, but the entire point is that the people removing this waste are under attack, so they're not removing it in order to be able to bargain.
p2658
aVCaroline Lucas, darling of the Green Party, completely undermined it.
p2659
aVIf they'd just come out and say "We don't support worker's rights" then that's one thing, but they have the gall to tell people they do.
p2660
aVActions speak much, much louder than words. 
p2661
aV&gt;Green Party is the strongest in two places: Brighton and Bristol.
p2662
aVIf you looked at Green records, Tory records, Labour records, and Lib Dem records, in terms of austerity measures and cuts, they are absolutely indistinguishable.
p2663
aVThat's not hyperbole, I'm being totally serious.
p2664
aVWhere they aren't in power, but have a lot of councillors, they just form coalitions with whoever else and vote for cuts, closures, and attacks just as the other big parties do.
p2665
aVWhere they are in control, like Brighton, they act no different than the tory government.
p2666
aVClose this, shut that, cut this, end that.
p2667
aVIt's as much as bloodbath as Labour council.
p2668
aVCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't council funding set by central government?
p2669
aVIf the government is giving the councils less money to spend, it seems a bit harsh to then blame the council for spending less money.
p2670
aVPeople usually think this because it's what Labour councils, Lib Dem councils and Green councils love to say as a sort of "wash my hands of any blame".
p2671
aVBut councils can, and have in the past, run on a needs budget - scrapping vanity projects, using reserves, and if absolutely necessary their borrowing power (which sounds scary, but councils borrow money all the time).
p2672
aVIf the Greens acted on their words - they wouldn't enter coalitions with the big three, they wouldn't vote for and support the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres, and homeless support services.
p2673
aVThey could use their national reach, and strength in quite a lot of councils, to oppose the cuts, to prevent Labour, Tory, and Lib Dem minority councils from passing on these cuts.
p2674
aVAnd in places like Brighton, put together a needs budget and force the government to provide more money by refusing to pass on their cuts and by spending the money they should be receiving.
p2675
aVWhen one council does it, it looks like Liverpool Council 1983-87 - alone but fighting for the rights of people in Liverpool to have basic services.
p2676
aVWhen it's done on a larger scale, the government are forced into concessions, because there's nothing else they can do. \u000a
p2677
aV&gt;If the Greens acted on their words - they wouldn't enter coalitions with the big three, they wouldn't vote for and support the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres, and homeless support services.
p2678
aVThey could use their national reach, and strength in quite a lot of councils, to oppose the cuts, to prevent Labour, Tory, and Lib Dem minority councils from passing on these cuts.
p2679
aVAnd in places like Brighton, put together a needs budget and force the government to provide more money by refusing to pass on their cuts and by spending the money they should be receiving.
p2680
aVCan you show some examples of the Greens supporting the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services?
p2681
aVCan you show that the greens promised a needs budget before being elected to council positions?
p2682
aV&gt; Can you show some examples of the Greens supporting the closure of elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services?
p2683
aVI don't really know where I can get examples of this online?
p2684
aVBest I can do is put you in touch with someone who can?
p2685
aVhttp://michaeljamesbarker.wordpress.com/  &lt;---- This guy lives in Leicester, and you'll have to forgive the amateurish design, but he's probably the best person I personally know for writing criticisms of the Green Party. \u000a\u000a
p2686
aVSo just some guy talking shite on his blog?
p2687
aVNo, he's a published academic, he writes for journals and all that other stuff they do.
p2688
aVI just linked to the blog because that's how I personally read his stuff, otherwise I'd have to pay to use a university library to access the journals and stuff. 
p2689
aV&gt; No, he's a published academic, he writes for journals and all that other stuff they do.
p2690
aVAppeal to authority.
p2691
aVSo, I can't win?
p2692
aVHe's a qualified and established academic writer, and that's no good, but if he ISN'T that, then he's just "some guy talking shite on his blog".\u000a
p2693
aVI just read [this](http://leicestersocialists.org.uk/?p=2510) article and that guy isn't making anything like the same claims you do. 
p2694
aVNo, he's not me, he has his own opinions.
p2695
aVI linked to him because they asked for some more specific information, and I think that guy will be able to get it. 
p2696
aVI'm not going to go and find your evidence for you.
p2697
aVYou've made it clear you don't have anything to back up anything you've said, that's all I needed to know.
p2698
aVWhat I said was, I don't know how to access council voting records for all the Green dominant councils, and I'm not going to go and google the names of every green councillor and cross reference if with their voting record (assuming such a website exists, like the one for MPs) - and if you believe me not willing to spend the next 5/6 hours doing this is me not having anything to back that particular thing up, then whatever.
p2699
aVYou've chosen to ignore all of my other accusations and the evidences I gave.
p2700
aVIf you had clicked onto some of the articles, you'd have seen his commentary on his experience with Bristol greens.
p2701
aVBut you've chosen to decide he isn't legitimate, without having even looked at it.
p2702
aVAm I restricted to only using people you personally know? 
p2703
aV&gt;You've chosen to ignore all of my other accusations and the evidences I gave.

aVBut you've chosen to decide he isn't legitimate, without having even looked at it.

aVAm I restricted to only using people you personally know?
p2707
aVNobody's opinion is good evidence.
p2708
aVLink to a Green Party candidate or councillor or manifesto declaring their support for a "needs budget".
p2709
aVIf you can't do this, there is absolutely no reason for anything in this thread to believe that the Green Party have gone back on their word by not implementing one.
p2710
aVOr, alternatively, link to anywhere where the Green Party declares their support for closing elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services, or a manifesto declaring that they intend to.
p2711
aVIf you can't produce any of this, why should anyone in this thread believe you when you accuse them of it?
p2712
aVI didn't say they supported a needs budget - they absolutely don't, because they're as bad as the big three - do you even know what a needs budget is?
p2713
aVIf you did, you would have understood my point - they COULD adopt one and run a council that way, they won't, ever, that is my entire bloody point.
p2714
aVJesus Christ this is irritating, I didn't respond to your request for evidence of a green needs budget because it didn't make sense... You might as well have said "Show me evidence the greens support turning david cameron into a hoola-hoop", because they're both something I didn't say.
p2715
aV&gt; Or, alternatively, link to anywhere where the Green Party declares their support for closing elderly care homes, children's centres and homeless support services, or a manifesto declaring that they intend to\u000a\u000aAgain, did you read what I said?
p2716
aVTHIS IS NOT IN THEIR MANIFESTO.
p2717
aVPlease, please read my bloody comment.
p2718
aV"They're all chat", they talk about how they DON'T do this stuff.
p2719
aVDo you understand?
p2720
aVThey say they DO NOT DO THIS STUFF EVER EVER EVER.
p2721
aVAs for the others, they're EXAMPLES of the kinds of cuts these councils are passing on.
p2722
aVI have ALREADY SAID that I don't know where I can find you an online source for this info.
p2723
aVDo you have any suggestions of a place online?
p2724
aVI don't work online.
p2725
aVWhen I'm active, it's on stalls, with physical leaflets and info.
p2726
aVIs there a repository for this information online?
p2727
aVI'm not saying "I don't have evidence", I'm saying "There's fucking tons of evidence, but you won't accept as evidence me going to council meetings to lobby green councillors only for them to vote for cuts" as evidence, and that's fine, but I don't know how to give you the evidence.
p2728
aVI honestly don't.
p2729
aVYou won't accept me just posting this stuff.
p2730
aVYou want an official document.
p2731
aVAnd if I knew where I could find a link online to give you, I'd fucking give you it.\u000a\u000a
p2732
aVThis is really good news.
p2733
aVAt least politics to them is not all about the money.
p2734
aVOk, they probably did it for a little bit more publicity but it is right that they rejected it in the first place.
p2735
aVGood on the Greens
p2736
aVAgreed, I'd rather hear about parties behaving responsibly by their own accord than after weeks of public pressure in a desperate backtrack.
p2737
aVGood for them, thats what actual "anti-establishment" behaviour in a political party looks like.
p2738
aVMight disagree with them but if all parties were like this we wouldn't be so fucked politically.
p2739
aVcue "hurrdurr" from cynics I guess. 
p2740
aVWhat do you disagree with them on?
p2741
aVI'm pretty sure I'm going to vote for them on Thursday, but if there are good reasons not to, I'd like to know now!
p2742
aV(Other than their nuclear policy)
p2743
aVYep the hysterical absolutism on nuclear power mainly and a couple of other bits where I think its a bit too "anti-market" (Im no free-marketer but there's definitely strong reasons for a lot of it).
p2744
aVI don't think its a deal breaker for me but I'll decide when I vote on thursday between them and Lib Dems, Im fairly pro-europe and have benefited myself from free movement of labour and the single market so thats a main point for me that a party is clear in their policy and their reasoning behind it.
p2745
aVI think they'll come round eventually, and I can understand their point of view as its the same one as here in germany (the point about diverting that investment to renewables is a lot more feasible than people think), even if it was still a dumb decision. 
p2746
aVI gather they are directed on policy by membership votes, the more pro-nuclear members the sooner the party will change position.\u000a
p2747
aVTheir manifesto says no new nuclear power stations, rather than a blanket ban.
p2748
aVI think they're evolving on the issue of nuclear finally...
p2749
aVNuclear power, that is the no.1 thing most people disagree with them on.
p2750
aVI think though that if the party increases in size they may be forced to dump that policy, they have already changed their tone about the reasoning behind the policy maybe it will change further as greater scrutiny is brought to bear.
p2751
aVIt's the same single reason I'm not a green party member/donor.
p2752
aVI always assumed they were too tightly bound to CND etc to ever change their mind on it.
p2753
aVI'd be thrilled to be wrong though.
p2754
aVThey are led by their membership though so perhaps if more pro-nuclear power people joined their views could be changed.
p2755
aVHowever I am one to talk, I have an aversion to joining political parties as I feel you have to accept some degree of hypocrisy by doing so (as you are unlikely to agree with every single policy of the party you join).
p2756
aVTheir aversion to nuclear isn't singularly linked to the waste produced, its also that mining uranium (non-renewable) is very carbon intensive, building the plants is incredibly expensive and it's simply not a viable option to fill the energy gap on the planet because even if we built a 1GW reactor every 1.6 days for 45 years, it would only generate 8TW a year, with a life span of 100 years before we run out of uranium.
p2757
aVWith the expected energy usage of the planet doubling in the near future, that's nowhere NEAR the amount we'd require.
p2758
aVIt is more cost effective, and sensible, to invest in renewable energy and further research into grid level storage.
p2759
aVStats from [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHkWGoD1Ap8)
p2760
aVthere is a difference between UK energy policy and planet wide energy policy :)\u000a\u000aNuclear is a stopgap, but it's a very good stopgap.
p2761
aVhave a play here,it's based on Mcaky's book that is namechecked as the first thing in your linked lecture:\u000a\u000a http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways/31111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111/primary_energy_chart
p2762
aVI like this calculator, and while I accept there is a difference, I wish the world could be a bit more united when it came to having an energy policy that provides energy to the entire planet.
p2763
aVwe can't even manage water or food yet.
p2764
aVmaybe one day :)
p2765
aVI've played with this before, here [my attempt](http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways/20d22g2111cj11110233422001412430244402102303440310231/primary_energy_chart) at meeting our emissions targets for anyone who's interested.
p2766
aVMost 'renewable' energy comes from burning biomass.
p2767
aVGermany tried to cut out nuclear while increasing renewables but the result has been: increased use of coal, increase production of CO2, and some of the highest energy bills in the world.
p2768
aVNuclear isn't just about Uranium and nuclear 'waste' isn't waste at all; it can be re-used by fast-breeder reactors and the like.
p2769
aVThorium, modern fission and, finally, fusion would enable civilisation to flourish for thousands of years.
p2770
aVAlso, to address the numbers you gave: 8 TW would produce something like 70,000 TWh per year (half global energy consumption) for a total of 7,000,000 TWh over 100 years.
p2771
aVI'd like to know how much it would cost to produce 7,000,000 TWh with solar or wind (and I mean real production, not just capacity).
p2772
aVIs that hypocrisy?
p2773
aVIt sounds like compromise to me.
p2774
aVI see voting for a party as the compromise.
p2775
aVIt's just a personal matter, I'm not really a joiner I instead give support from the sidelines to those I think deserve it.
p2776
aVI have no issue with those who do want to join a party of course.
p2777
aVThey change their tone and suddenly find nuclear power to be safe (when it's not being attacked by tsunamis), and you get a bunch of people saying how they're just like all the other parties, changing their mind with the tide.
p2778
aVMy problem with them is that they have made a complete pigs ear of running Brighton and have proven themselves completely incapable of holding real responsibility. 
p2779
aVI have decided to vote green on thursday partly because of this.
p2780
aVThis is the right attitude from a political party.
p2781
aVPutting principles ahead of gain.
p2782
aVIt's such a shame that maintaining such ethics will be to their disadvantage in the political world.
p2783
aVA party...with integrity?
p2784
aVOh my.
p2785
aVThe people who criticise them for this would be just as quick to criticise them for the hypocrisy of accepting the donation.
p2786
aVI guess some people are just hard to please. 
p2787
aV"Green Party decides publicity worth more than £7k donation.
p2788
aV"
aV"Green Party upholds ethics policy on donations which has been in place for... how many years?
p2789
aVQuite a number, I'd wager.
p2790
aV"
aVI doubt there will be anything about this in major papers.
p2791
aVhttp://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1412136.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2014_05_17
p2792
aVNo, what they decided is that morale/publicity of this rejection is worth this 7k aswell as every other prospective donation from similar circumstances.
p2793
aVExactly, the guy was worth £500 million, £7K is peanuts to him.
p2794
aVHe may well have given them more later on.
p2795
aVI hope the extra support they get from the public makes up for their potential losses, but I do honestly think this was a decision based on principle rather than a cold calculation based on the total revenue/support they would gain.
p2796
aVIf they'd have accepted it, the other parties would have shouted hypocrisy.
p2797
aVThat bad publicity would more than negate the £7k.
p2798
aV'Ow that hurt my head' cried the nail.
p2799
aVomg just take all my votes
p2800
aVIt's a gut reaction because it's a moral choice.
p2801
aVIf you made your fortune in a country and rely on that country's infrastructure and people for your wealth, IMO you owe that country to pay your full taxes there.
p2802
aVOther people paid their taxes for you and you benefitted.
p2803
aVWhat puts you, as a successful businesses person, above the community that raised you?
p2804
aVThey will be the ones who suffer, in the long run.
p2805
aVyoung voter here.
p2806
aVIs the Green party against science?
p2807
aVEdit: Forgive my ignorance.
p2808
aV&gt;  Is the Green party against science?
p2809
aVNo.
p2810
aVThat is just a view perpetuated because of the fact that they are against nuclear energy (and to a certain extent GMOs, but they're more against the way that the patent systems exist than GMOs themselves).
p2811
aVThey have a whole, detailed section on their site about their [science and technology policies](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/st.html).
p2812
aVRead it and decide for yourself whether you agree with it or not.
p2813
aVThat cleared some things up, thanks.
p2814
aV&gt; and to a certain extent GMOs, but they're more against the way that the patent systems exist than GMOs themselves\u000a\u000aIf that were true, they wouldn't have advocated destroying an experiment at a research facility where there were no patent issues.
p2815
aVOne of their elected representatives was also planning to attend this stupid event.
p2816
aVThey are anti-GMO because they have a tendency to be reactionaries.

aVsource?

aVhttp://www.latentexistence.me.uk/why-take-the-flour-back-are-wrong-and-im-leaving-the-green-party/
p2819
aVNo the Greens (despite a few digressions, because hey there are idiots everywhere) are probably the most pro science party in the UK
p2820
aVI am curious as to why you ask that.
p2821
aVBeing anti-nuclear and anti-GMO gives them a bad rep.
p2822
aVI don't understand why the Greens are considered anti science for their policy on nuclear and GM while UKIP who are climate change deniers get a clean rap.
p2823
aVI will be voting Green despite being pro GM myself and having nothing against nuclear.
p2824
aVThere are no parties that I agree with 100%.
p2825
aVPersonally I don't think the greens are anti-science, I was simply explaining as to why a person may think they were.
p2826
aVI agree, UKIP are a joke in terms of their stance on climate change.
p2827
aVI think the problem with them and reason that they're getting away with it is that everybody is spending so much time branding them as racist that it's strangling all chance of outing UKIP on some of their more ridiculous policies.
p2828
aVSome science, they'll believe in the overwhelming scientific consensus about global warming but ignore the overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety of genetically modified food. 
p2829
aVSafety is a small part of the argument.
p2830
aVThe real reason to reject GMO is because the process of copywriting that which springs forth from the earth is massively unethical and hands control of the most basic resources to Corporation, who will then decide who eats what.  \u000a  \u000a 
p2831
aVPatent law protection ensures that those who invest billions in advancing technology and science are able to make their investors' money back so they can continue employing people and developing new things.
p2832
aVIf I invest a billion into developing a new technology and then Bob can take my research for free and use it to make stuff, leaving me high and dry with no way to make my initial money back, then that's not very fair imho. 
p2833
aV\u000aPotatoes exist already.
p2834
aVThey do not need inventing by 'advance technology and science'.
p2835
aVTry innovating.\u000a 
p2836
aVLuckily potatoes aren't patented.
p2837
aVNew, superior varieties of potatoes that companies have spent many years and much money developing, however, may be.
p2838
aVBut based on a stolen design.\u000a
p2839
aV&gt;The real reason to reject GMO is because the process of copywriting that which springs forth from the earth is massively unethical and hands control of the most basic resources to Corporation, who will then decide who eats what.
p2840
aVIt's precisely attitudes like this that turn people off the green party.. Just fantastical hippy dippy nonsense.
p2841
aV&gt;Copyrighting that which springs forth from the ground \u000a\u000aYea 'springs forth', after years of R&amp;D and billions of dollars of investment.
p2842
aV&gt; hands control of the most basic resources to Corporation, who will then decide who eats what.
p2843
aVThis is just bizarre.
p2844
aVHow precisely do you see this happening? 
p2845
aVNo.
p2846
aVAnd being young isn't sufficient disclaimer for saying dumb things.
p2847
aVThey asked a question - that's not dumb.
p2848
aVAll questions are clever ?
p2849
aVNot necessarily clever =) But asking a question is never dumb, unless you're just asking so that you can then steamroll in with some 'answer' you already had in mind to rant about.
p2850
aVI don't think it's helpful to call someone stupid for asking something, personally.
p2851
aVEverybody's ignorant about something.
p2852
aVYes.
p2853
aVThe publicity this move will generate is worth 100 000.
p2854
aVSmart move
p2855
aVI hope it does, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even mentioned in the national press.
p2856
aVFirstly it's a good news story, and secondly it's not about UKIP.
p2857
aVWhen's the last time we read 'Political Party does something ethical'?\u000a
p2858
aV[deleted]
p2859
aVI'd say they're against using non-dom status as a tax avoidance loophole. 
p2860
aVGiven this... yeah, I imagine they are.
p2861
aVI am a UKIP voter but credit to the Greens for standing by what they support and not buckling.
p2862
aVI actually admire the Greens for going against the main three parties like UKIP and have no issues due to my true socialist roots with people voting Green.
p2863
aVI want out of the EU and then I can go back to voting for a socialist party that serves purely in the interests of Britain.
p2864
aVPretty sure the Greens want out of EU too, its not just UKIP.
p2865
aVThe Greens are pro-EU.
p2866
aVTalk about shooting yourself in the foot.
p2867
aVIt's all very well patting themselves on their collective back for the ethical fortitude, but when they cry about not having the exposure coverage of the other parties, I will sit back and laugh.
p2868
aVHad it been a £1m donation they would have taken it and shut up.
p2869
aV£7000 is nothing to even a medium sized political party.
p2870
aVTheir publicity is worth more than that.
p2871
aVAnd as to the article itself, I hardly think not paying income tax on money which you *didn't even make in the UK* is really tax evasion.
p2872
aVPresumably his operations in other countries are taxed at the local rate there? 
p2873
aVThis is why they can't get anywhere as a party. 
p2874
aVSo you say reject principle and take cold, hard cash?
p2875
aVNoble, but foolish.
p2876
aVNobody's going to remember this next week and they will still be un-elected.
p2877
aV£7 000 wouldn't get them elected either but it does give them some positive press coverage today and the ability to criticise others who do accept donations from non-tax payers in the future.
p2878
aVCrucially though, it is also doing right by their supporters which is where the green party derives most of its power from.
p2879
aVHell yes, lets face it, there's few massive corporations who want the Green Party to win... so they may as well not bend over for them and stick with people power.
p2880
aVThey have more MPs than UKIP
p2881
aVWith about a third of the votes.
p2882
aVHurray for FPTP, as I'm sure you meant to add?
p2883
aVI'm not a great fan of FPTP but the greens won that seat because they were the most popular in that area.
p2884
aVOn a micro scale it's a success that they won.
p2885
aVCertainly helps when all three major parties also have substantial votes, resulting in a four-way split - she had the [thirteenth lowest winning share of the vote since 1945](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election_records#Lowest_winning_share_of_the_vote), less than a third of the votes cast...\u000a\u000aWould be interesting to see what would've happened there under an alternate voting system, where would the Lib Dem and Tory votes have gone had their candidates been eliminated I wonder.
p2886
aVAh didn't realise that, pretty stupid then.
p2887
aVI reckon even more people would have had green as their first choice.
p2888
aVOh of course
p2889
aVbecause we'll elect the Lying Crooks again ?
p2890
aVUnfortunately putting ideology over practicality isn't the best idea if you want to accomplish anything outside of a sense of personal pride, in my experience atleast.
p2891
aVI assume you oppose UKIP putting ideology over practicality by repeatedly refusing to vote in the European Parliament, then?
p2892
aVThere isn't much practicality in voting in the EU at all though.
p2893
aVWhy not?
p2894
aVThe votes don't mean anything, if something doesn't pass, the comissioners can just keep putting it through until it does.
p2895
aVAnd our MEPs comprise only 8.6% of the EU parliament.
p2896
aV&gt;  if something doesn't pass, the comissioners can just keep putting it through until it does.
p2897
aVDoes our Parliament operate in a substantially different way?
p2898
aVI'm not too sure on the precise mechanics of either.
p2899
aVAlso, if something doesn't pass at first, putting it through again and again doesn't make it magically more likely to pass.
p2900
aVIt's not a fruit machine.
p2901
aV&gt; And our MEPs comprise only 8.6% of the EU parliament.
p2902
aVWell, yeah.
p2903
aVWhat's your point?
p2904
aVUKIP make up about 3% of the vote, so their votes are pointless.
p2905
aVThat's the same logic that leads people not to vote at all, because "one vote won't make a difference.
p2906
aV"
aVThey do vote though.
p2907
aVThey vote no, which is in interest of everyone who votes for them
p2908
aVThat just seems petulant, especially when you're voting against [tackling the ivory trade](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-criticised-after-its-meps-vote-no-on-a-resolution-to-tackle-world-ivory-trade-9278390.html).
p2909
aVThe ivory trade  is already illegal in the UK, why should we be forcing laws on other countries instead of letting them decide for themselves?
p2910
aVSo they should have  taken the money to advance their ideology ?
p2911
aVOr refused the money to demonstrate their practicality ?
p2912
aVWhy are people even saying this is an ethical decision?
p2913
aVIt's a shameless attempt to link to the recent leitmotif of tax evasion, yet he's done nothing wrong!
p2914
aVWhy should he have no right to donate?
p2915
aVHe's done nothing *illegal*.
p2916
aVCheating on your partner isn't *illegal*, but I still would rather not be friends with you.
p2917
aVRestrain having a gut reaction about this - think about what I said.
p2918
aVWhy should someone be forced to pay taxes in just one country if you live in one and do the majority of your business in another?
p2919
aVHow would it be socially equitable to remove the the requirement to pay tax in either the country you do business OR the country you are living in?
p2920
aVYou should pay tax in both as you have a stake in both. 
p2921
aVIt's a gut reaction because it's a moral choice, not just a legal one, IMO.
p2922
aVWhen you're taxed after creating a successful businesses, those taxes aren't just about what you're doing now.
p2923
aVYou're paying back all the state funds you - we all - benefit from when we don't have a successful business or a nice hedge fund to support ourselves.
p2924
aVBusiness people are helping support the community they were raised in with that money, and by leaving they're cutting off support to many people they actually owe somewhat for their success.
p2925
aVThat's true on a national scale or a local one.
p2926
aVIf he created a successful business in the UK - he was taxed at the time.
p2927
aVSo, a quick question.
p2928
aVWhere do you think he should be paying his tax?
p2929
aVI could understand the issue if he wasn't a UK tax payer at all but he pays in both countries!
p2930
aVI fail to see the furore over this. 
p2931
aV"Business people are helping support the community they were raised in with that money, and by leaving they're cutting off support to many people they actually owe somewhat for their success.
p2932
aVThat's true on a national scale or a local one.
p2933
aV"\u000a\u000aSo what about individuals that migrate?
p2934
aVOr does this perspective only apply to average working people and not business owners?
p2935
aVIf they've genuinely migrated then so be it.
p2936
aVThere's nothing the government could do.
p2937
aVIf they're returning after arbitrary deadlines as a way of avoiding paying the standard amount of tax, then they're cheating the system and should feel bad about it.
p2938
aVSo there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with paying tax in two countries then, and the judgement we're making (with very little information to go on) is that he's gaming the system?
p2939
aVIs that it?
p2940
aV&gt;Mr Tabatznik is registered to vote in the UK and has a house here  \u000a  \u000a&gt;However, his non-dom tax status means while he pays tax on his UK income, money accrued abroad is out of reach of the taxman  \u000a  \u000aHe is gaming the system.
p2941
aV"money accrued abroad is out of reach of the taxman".
p2942
aVThat's not gaming the system.
p2943
aVGo ask migrant British labour in Dubai whether they're gaming the system?
p2944
aVThat's perceived differently despite being pretty much identical. 
p2945
aVDo they vote in the UK?
p2946
aVYes, they do.
p2947
aV"If you are a British citizen living overseas you are entitled to vote in UK general elections and European elections for up to 15 years after moving abroad.
p2948
aV"
aVSo he should pay all his tax in the UK including tax on income made entirely outside the UK should he?
p2949
aVHow is that fair?
p2950
aVDownvotes, but no actual explanation as to why you think this is unethical.
p2951
aVI would certainly like to hear one but I won't hold my breath. 
p2952
aVThis is very good reason why you should NOT vote on them.
p2953
aVThey don't know how to manage money.
p2954
aVSeeing the leader's debate, I think Cameron felt a little extra betrayed every time Clegg insulted coalition policies. 
p2955
aVI would expect he's pretty damn frustrated after being so close, yet so far from being able to exact any of the changes he wanted to.
p2956
aVI can't imagine his job has been a happy one at all.
p2957
aVNot surprised at all.
p2958
aVLol this was originally from /r/blackpeopletwitter when they switched to "whitepeopletwitter" on April Fool's Day.

aV**I doubt Nick's allowed to touch.
p2975
aVAnd definitely not on the mouth.
p2976
aV**\u000a\u000a'Hm what?
p2977
aV' he replied, reluctantly opening his eyes and looking up, seeing the face of his deputy.
p2978
aV'You can't fall asleep here,' Nick said, lightly chuckling.
p2979
aV'Is there something wrong, David?
p2980
aV**Are you having guilt about rising tuition fees and cutting benefits for the disabled?
p2981

p2982
aV**Unfortunately it's a 4 hour wait at A&amp;E and a two week wait for a GP appointment**'\u000a\u000a'Mm headache,' the Prime Minister muttered, rather uncharacteristically as he rubbed at his eyes again.
p2983
aVNick hadn't moved his hand, he also noted.
p2984
aVNot that he was complaining.
p2985
aVThe touch of the other man was quite\u2026comforting\u2026 **as it had been many years since Eton**\u000a\u000a'Let me get you something for it,' **a shotgun?

p2989

aV'I do, but so do you.

aVCheryl Gillan, I think
p3015
aVLooks like a traitor. 
p3016
aVClegg has done such a great job and all people ever talk about are those bloody fees.
p3017
aVNick Clegg is a great politician and the Liberal Democrats are a great party, they're going to do terribly in the election and it is an absolute shame. 
p3018
aV&gt;all people ever talk about are those bloody fees.
p3019
aVWell if you make something a centerpiece of your election campaign and sign a pledge publicly to do the same people will remember it.
p3020
aV&gt;they're going to do terribly in the election and it is an absolute shame.
p3021
aVShouldn't have gone into coalition with the Tories then.
p3022
aVMost people who voted Lib Dem last time did not want their vote propping up a Conservative government.
p3023
aVI will concede they have done [some positive things in the coalition](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/) but most of their voters(at the 2010 election) did not want their vote to contribute towards Cameron being PM.\u000a
p3024
aVI think the Lib Dems did what any reasonably large third party would have done.
p3025
aVStaying in opposition at the time of worst economic crisis in living memory would not have been good for their polling either.
p3026
aVAny third party?
p3027
aVI think UKIP are a bunch of rats, but can you see them getting into a coalition by voting no on having an EU referedum?
p3028
aVNo, because fucked as their priorities are, they'll stick to them.
p3029
aVopposition polls better during economic problems, not worse.
p3030
aVThey would have been accused of bottling their big chance to have an impact.
p3031
aVThere would have been outrage had they tried to prop up labour, too.
p3032
aVBasically there was no scenario in which they didn't get burned.
p3033
aVReally?
p3034
aVI think if they had said the tories had wanted them to act against their principles and so agreement could not be met, and then let the government run in minority, then people would have respected that.
p3035
aVThey would have had more compromising power, they wouldn't have had to threaten their own MPs to vote against their wishes.
p3036
aVThey'd have had more respect than trading anything for the first taste of power, which is what we see this as now.
p3037
aVBesides, each MP had a choice on the fees vote.
p3038
aVThey could do what Mr Bossman whip said, and be given a treat like 28 did, or keep their word and be a real democratic representitive, taking the hit to career chances that that costs, like 21 did.
p3039
aVNot if they've shirked all responsibility and left the UK with a government that can't pass any policies. 
p3040
aVReally?
p3041
aVShirked responsibility?
p3042
aVIt was their responsibility to go against their principles and promises so a few guys could get ministry jobs?
p3043
aVI think they did shirk their responsibilities as it happens.
p3044
aVIf we'd had leadership by minority we could still have passed policies but they would have been a LOT more compromised.
p3045
aVAnd either way, yes the opposition of a hands tied government still polls higher when the country is doing badly.
p3046
aVLook, firstly I don't think they did go against their principals by entering government.
p3047
aVThey got far more of their policies passed than they would have done if they had gone with confidence and supply and picked and chose which Tory bills to pass.
p3048
aVYes maybe they made mistakes in the negotiating processes but I think the idea that they gave up all they believed in is simply untrue.
p3049
aVSecondly, even if you completely disagree with what I just said, if the UK had been left with a minority government, it's likely there would have been a confidence crisis and the economy would have crashed even further.
p3050
aVNow whether that wily have actually been the Lib Dem's fault or not, many would see that they had a chance to form a stable government and they didn't.
p3051
aVIt wouldn't be hard to spin it as if they were to blame and I think they would almost certainly suffer in popularity. \u000a\u000a
p3052
aVI didn't say they went against their principles by going into government, I said they went against their principles TO get into government.
p3053
aVI think all the rest is just an attempt at after the fact reasoning.
p3054
aVIt's not like people are bemoaning them that they didn't get lords reform, or make strides in drug reform or bring in PR.
p3055
aVThese are things they said they would do if in power, but they didn't have the chance to do, so we get that.
p3056
aVThe difference with the fees vote was that they **100% had the ability to keep their word!
p3057
aV** They didn't promise that fees wouldn't go up, they promised (and campaigned around the country signing documents that stated) **they would never vote for a rise** all that would have taken was voting how they had promised, which 21 lib dems MPs did, against whip wishes.
p3058
aV28 went against their word.
p3059
aVAn MP has the power to vote how he wishes even if the whips threaten repercussions to their career.
p3060
aVThat is what people are pissed off about, that's why nobody can trust them again.
p3061
aVI feel bad for the 21 (and 8 or so who abstained) but the leadership and high players in the party sold out a generation and then harped on about fairness the whole next five years.
p3062
aVThey said they'd never do something, then did it.
p3063
aVWhen your job is being sent to run the country how you said you would, thats unrecoverable.
p3064
aVAnd now you know how the yanks felt with Obama. 
p3065
aVAs far as I know the only promise he made was to shut down guantanamo, then he started the process on day one, but congress repeatedly blocked any legislation to do anything else about it.
p3066
aVSo he didn't have the power to do what he wanted, he didn't outright vote against shutting it down.
p3067
aVWhilst I agree with your point, I feel it's essential to look back to five years ago when the idea of a coalition was very alien to English voters (Scotland and Wales having had them, not sure on NI) and the view being that without a formal arrangement the minority Tory government would limp on, blame the lack of seats and call a snap election which all indications said that a country sick of inaction in the face of global financial meltdown would deliver a Tory majority.
p3068
aVSo, it was Lib-Lab ("coalition of losers") or an eventual Tory majority.
p3069
aVIt's easy to forget how weak the LDs bargaining position was as the Tories would have preferred to say "see these LD oiks wouldn't think of the country, so give us a proper mandate this time".
p3070
aVHaving said all that, not making It clear that tuition fees was a red line was stupid and has damaged them.
p3071
aVGetting in bed with the Tories?
p3072
aVPersonally, I won't vote for them until I see change because I was very uncomfortable with them propping up the right-wing agenda but many others would have punished them for not taking the chance to get to power.
p3073
aVWho will ever know which would have cost them more?
p3074
aVThis time, the LDs have a strong bargaining position as Lab won't want to go back to the polls quickly.
p3075
aVIronically, if they can really pull off the 'moderating influence' bit again they will look like the more experienced party in a Lib-Lab coalition. 
p3076
aV&gt; call a snap election which all indications said that a country sick of inaction in the face of global financial meltdown would deliver a Tory majority.
p3077
aVSource.
p3078
aVLib Dem proponents use this excuse every time and there is no evidence to support it.
p3079
aVThe evidence and polls actually suggest Labour would have closed the gap once GB had stood down and before the anti Ed propaganda machine kicked in. 
p3080
aVThe Tories had money left in their campaign chest, nobody else did... 
p3081
aVAll the new lib voters would have gone hard onto labour to keep tories out once it was clear what would happen.
p3082
aVVarious polls after showed lib dem voters said they would have voted labour had they known lib dems would have joined tories.
p3083
aVMoney is one aspect but don't forget the disarray that Gordon Brown's summary exit would have caused (a house divided...).
p3084
aVAlso, the Tories would have had all the economy stuff (Greece, Spain) in the background and the Liam Byrne note in their pockets. 
p3085
aV[deleted]
p3086
aVWhat they did wasn't popular but it was what needed to be done to get this country moving forward.
p3087
aVThe collapse of a coalition would have been terrible in a time of economic crisis.
p3088
aVHe put the interests of the country ahead of political points and he has been punished for it and that is bad for our political system.\u000a\u000a
p3089
aV[deleted]
p3090
aVYeah...
p3091
aVExactly, the coalition would have collapsed and we would have had to have gone through another period of political stagnation as they tried to form a new government and that would be terrible for the country. 
p3092
aV[deleted]
p3093
aVThe Lib Dems would not have gained votes through bringing down the coalition and forcing another election.
p3094
aVIf they had done it early in 2010 the further uncertainty would have been economically damaging and would be spun as the fault of the Lib Dems.
p3095
aVAccording to commentators Labour were bankrupt and unable to afford another election fight.
p3096
aVYou would most likely have given the Conservatives more votes after a difficult few months.
p3097
aVI think that would have been worse for the country.
p3098
aVIt might have resulted in the Lib Dems getting more votes at this election having not signed off on tuition fees and still playing the underdog.
p3099
aVHence I agree with /u/mixturemash - the decision of the Lib Dems to form a coalition was better for the country and damaging for the party.
p3100
aVThe Tories would have likely taken a majority with the Lib Dems and Labour losing seats and the Lib Dems taking a serious credibility hit when it came out the Tories were offering them in terms of a coalition agreement.
p3101
aVTuition fees would have come in regardless, possibly unlimited tuition fees and they would have lost credibility as a possible party of government having plunged the country into political and economic turmoil, there was no good solution for the Lib Dems after they made a promise they couldn't fulfil given the likely hung parliament and probable coalition.
p3102
aVIn the event of a GE following the Lib Dems leaving the coalition, why would you expect the Tories to gain a majority?
p3103
aVMost likely outcome would be the way the polls are now (without the SNP swing if before the referendum, so maybe even a Labour majority).
p3104
aVEven with a Labour government you would have almost certainly had an increase in tuition fees, for the constituency of people who voted Lib Dems because of their pledge to not vote for tuition fees there was no good outcome available.
p3105
aVThe only mistake they made was making that pledge.
p3106
aVNo, you're twisting.
p3107
aVIf there is need for a No Confidence Motion there should be, despite the political stagnation it causes.
p3108
aVBut the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were able to come to a very reasonable agreement so it is right that they did that because in this case there was clearly no need for unnecessary political stagnation. 
p3109
aV[deleted]
p3110
aVSure.
p3111
aVI see your point, but leaving the Conservatives in an unworkable place would mean a worse off economy. 
p3112
aV&gt;Well if you make something a centerpiece of your election campaign and sign a pledge publicly to do the same people will remember it.
p3113
aVExactly... hilariously, this little gem of a campaign video begins with a shot of a flyer that says "no student tuition fees"\u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLR8R9JXz4\u000a\u000aClegg did well in the debate but stands a good chance of losing his seat at the election, because he's like an inverse Farage - prepared to do what's needed instead of what's popular, and totally clueless about what's popular.
p3114
aV[MFW OP expects the Lib Dems to deliver on promises made on the premise of a majority as a minority government.
p3115
aV](http://i.imgur.com/6cwz4ll.gif)\u000a\u000aGod knows I won't vote Lib Dem in May, but I don't think Clegg entered the coalition to willingly renege on his policies and deliberately make life worse for his voters.
p3116
aVAnyone who criticises him for 'a lack of effort' and the like should spend a month in his position and try and get some extremely left-wing legislation of their own passed in the Commons.
p3117
aVGood fucking luck.
p3118
aVWhat else were they supposed to do, contradict their much larger coalition partner at the first hurdle?
p3119
aVYes it was a flagship policy that won them a lot of support, but on the premise that they would have a majority, like all political policies.
p3120
aVYou're criticising them for not enacting a policy that they couldn't enact in the first place.
p3121
aVThey didn't have a majority, and their dominant coalition partners were hostile to the proposal.
p3122
aVYeah, he could have ended it by switching sides and working with the opposition to force a vote of no confidence on his own government, which would have been perhaps the single greatest act of political suicide ever seen in Westminster.
p3123
aVNo one would ever agree to work with him again after he had deliberately co-operated with the leader of the opposition.
p3124
aVIt would tarnish the Lib Dem's reputation as a party, and they would undoubtedly lose seats in the subsequent election because who would vote for a party that doesn't have confidence in its own position?
p3125
aVThere would never be a Con/Lab coalition, especially not after a Labour-backed vote of no confidence.
p3126
aVSo what result could you possibly have except the same coalition as before, but with Clegg hounded out of Parliament and the Lib Dems having fewer seats (thus less influence in the Commons) than they had in the first place?
p3127
aV**TL;DR: Stop ragging on Clegg guys, I won't vote for the man but holy shit you couldn't do any fucking better in his position**
p3128
aVYou clearly don't grasp what actually happened.
p3129
aVThe tuition fee promise was absolutely not contingent on winning a majority.
p3130
aVThey sign promises with the NUS that they would not vote to raise tuition fees in the next Parliament and would lobby the government to scrap them.
p3131
aVI would still say LibDems are most in line with my political views, I rank the treasonous erosion of our civil liberties as the single most important issue, but the LibDems who voted for the increase after promising not to are straight up cunts.
p3132
aVYou clearly don't grasp what actually happened.
p3133
aVThey signed promises that they would not vote to raise tuition fees, yes, but then find themselves as the sole party capable of creating a government, *by forming the minority part of a coalition with a party that ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THIS.
p3134
aV*\u000a\u000aThey had the choice of genuinely influencing government policy on a massive range of issues, [as has been pointed out](http://whatthehellhavethelibdemsdone.com/), or alternatively sacrificing five years of parliamentary power over a single issue that the majority of the electorate doesn't give a flying fuck about.
p3135
aVWhat would you do?
p3136
aVOh don't be so obtuse.
p3137
aVThey promised not to vote for an increase.
p3138
aVThey should have at the very least abstained.
p3139
aVPeople like you would allow politics to remain morally bankrupt in this country. 
p3140
aVYeah, they promised not to vote for an increase, *whilst campaigning*.
p3141
aVCircumstances change.
p3142
aVI'm not being obstuse, I'm being pragmatic, as they were.
p3143
aVThey should have abstained from what, forming a coalition?
p3144
aVThe exact same result would have happened, only they would have had absolutely no parliamentary influence for five years, rather than some.
p3145
aVBut go ahead and tell me that I'm the problem if it makes you feel better.
p3146
aVNo one cares whether or not you think they're morally bankrupt for acting as they did.
p3147
aVThe world isn't run on ideals.
p3148
aVWe'll see how much people care after the next election.
p3149
aVI strongly suspect that people will be annoyed that the LibDems broke their word and opinions of people like you who excuse them will be a fart in the wind.
p3150
aVWell yes, the Lib Dems are not going to fare well.
p3151
aVI strongly suspect that people will be incapable of appreciating the position they found themselves in and opinions of people like me who have a perspective that is wider than just university fees will be like a fart in the wind.
p3152
aVI should make clear that I have no issue with the LibDems forming a government with the Conservatives.
p3153
aVThe country needed a strong government and the LibDems tonned down Tory efforts to do things like repeal the HRA.
p3154
aVMy issue is not that they did not introduce a manifesto promise but they signed a declaration with the NUS stating they would not vote for an increase and broke it very quickly.
p3155
aVAnyway it's a shame the party is done for.
p3156
aVI have no issues with the LibDems who abstained. 
p3157
aVSo what would you have had them done?
p3158
aVEndanger that strong government you said the country needed over an issue they couldn't hope to win?
p3159
aVMy word is my bond.
p3160
aVI would have said I promised not to do this so I won't.
p3161
aVThe coalition agreement would have gone ahead anyway. 
p3162
aVThug4lyfe.
p3163
aVThere is absolutely no certainty whatsoever that the coalition agreement would have gone ahead anyway, and the chances of the Tories simply letting this issue slide were precisely jack shit.
p3164
aVEither the Lib Dems dropped this issue, or the coalition didn't form.
p3165
aVYou can't create a government out of two parties and then expect it to function when one immediately advocates a policy that the other detests.
p3166
aVSo it was fine for the Tories to advocate for a rise in tuition fees a policy the LibDems detest? 
p3167
aVUh, yeah, why shouldn't the Tories advocate for it?
p3168
aVThey could actually enact it.
p3169
aV100% my 2010 thinking !
p3170
aVThe global economy *was* crashing at the time of 2010 general election.
p3171
aVSo Nick Clegg made a brave choice to give the British people the stable government they needed to help them through the crash and was able to be major influence stopping alot of tory policies and putting through some lib dem ones
p3172
aVI don't think it's strictly to do with what they did (even if this is important too), but also to do with the fact that we have more than three parties competing at the moment. 
p3173
aVI was at the Lib Dem special conference in Birmingham, at which the members officially endorsed the coalition.
p3174
aVMost were so excited about finally being in government, and finally able to enact some 'liberal policy', that they failed to grasp the inevitable outcome.
p3175
aVThe recently dethroned Dr Evan Harris, stepped up to give a speech.
p3176
aVHe received a rapturous ovation.
p3177
aVHe warned the crowd that the coalition will be a big mistake, that teaming up with the Tories will inevitably isolate vast sections of Lib Dem support.
p3178
aVHe received many cheers of agreement during the speech.
p3179
aVAfter the speech, he received another rapturous ovation.
p3180
aVThey then voted unanimously to join the coalition.
p3181
aVA student stepped up to make a speech about an amendment to the coalition agreement, to ensure no Lib Dem support for increasing tuition fees.
p3182
aVHe received many cheers of support from the crowd.
p3183
aVA Lib Dem Councillor, sat to my right, whispered to me "but where do these people think the money is going to come from?
p3184
aVIf the students don't pay, then the money has to come from somewhere, and we just can't afford it.
p3185
aV" She then voted in favour of the amendment, along with the crowd.
p3186
aVThe party subsequently ignored the amendment.
p3187
aVThere was the leader of a large, northern city council, giddy with excitement at forming a government for the first time in his life time.
p3188
aV12 months later, he was shocked and despondent at losing his seat, and control of the council, in the local elections.
p3189
aVThe trouble with the Lib Dems, as I observed during my time as a Lib Dem activist, is that while most of their members are well-meaning individuals, they tend to be naive, and gullible to their own propaganda.
p3190
aVThey allowed the party leadership to be taken over by 'Tories in disguise'.
p3191
aVWhen faced with a choice between Chris Huhne, a much respected party stalwart, and Nick Clegg, they chose the latter, because he was saying the exact same things as Huhne, but with more charisma and with a more handsome face.
p3192
aVWhen they started to regret this decision, Huhne was eliminated over a rather petty 'scandal', involving a driving offence and a disgruntled ex-wife.
p3193
aVThe coalition was safe.
p3194
aVAfter the annihilation of the Lib Dems at the 2011 local elections, a clear backlash for coalition policy, I drank through the early hours of the morning with some of the fallen Councillors.
p3195
aVEven after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, few were able to admit to any perspective on their downfall.
p3196
aVAs if there was nothing they could do about it, and blamed the electorate for being stupid.
p3197
aVTheir tactics at the 2010 General Election, in an attempt to win a seat in a Labour stronghold, was to 'squeeze the Tory vote'.
p3198
aVIt almost worked, but it meant being disingenuous about things like immigration.
p3199
aVRather than to emphasise their left-wing policies, to a predominantly Labour (albeit disgruntled with New Labour) electorate.
p3200
aVI finally gave up all hope for the party after the response to the London riots in 2011.
p3201
aVSuddenly these 'liberals' became knee-jerk fascists, wanting to 'throw the book' at anyone involved.
p3202
aVAs for Clegg doing a 'great job'.
p3203
aVDoes this include agreeing to invade Libya, on evidence which turned out to be false?
p3204
aVPart of the reason I supported Lib Dems in 2010 was their anti-war sentiment.
p3205
aVClegg shit all over that theory\u000a
p3206
aVInteresting read, thanks for the perspective.
p3207
aVTrials of a party with little in government experience I suppose. 
p3208
aVI actually thought Clegg did the best in the Magnificent 7, \u000aand i am a YES voter.
p3209
aVYes to what?
p3210
aVhashtagindyref
p3211
aVWell when you go round the country promising to never vote a certain way on something, and the.
p3212
aVimmediately vote that way, adding £18,000 of debt to hundreds of thousands.... people will tend to remember that.
p3213
aVThey didn't "immediately" vote that way, they were forced by the Conservatives to compromise on that commitment.
p3214
aVWhilst it's understandable for students and those with concerns over fees to be annoyed, they should be annoyed with the Conservatives first and LibDems second.
p3215
aVThey were probably already annoyed with the Conservatives, that's why they voted Lib Dem.
p3216
aVand the tories ran saying they would increase fees, so hard to blame them for doing that.
p3217
aVforced?
p3218
aVReally?
p3219
aVThey chose to enter the agreement, and yes it was immediately.
p3220
aVThey could just as easily let the tories have to rule in minority, which would have meant a hell of a lot more compromise as they'd have to agree with labour or lib dems on EVERY VOTE.
p3221
aVWhy would I blame the tories, who ran saying they would do what they did?
p3222
aVNo, I blame the individual MPs and leadership who campaigned saying and promising and holding up signed fucking pieces of paper declaring their pledges that they would never vote yes on an increase in fees (when the increase we were talking about was to £7,000 by the way), and then DID vote that way in order to get some government positions for the leadership.
p3223
aVWhy would anyone ever  trust them again?
p3224
aVThey'll betray their principles in a heartbeat for a shiny new title and ministerial car.
p3225
aVI'm not too sure that they did it for cars.
p3226
aVPolitics is a very hidden and tricky subject.
p3227
aVI highly doubt the Lib Dems took it lightly to turn their back on their plans.
p3228
aVIt is much more likely that they used it as a giant bargaining chip to push through a series of policies using the Tories as a political pawn so they could make their mark on the current state of the government.
p3229
aVThere have been a ridiculous amount of sensible policies pushed through by the Lib Dems that push the country forwards.
p3230
aVSorry to use the chess analogy, but even the Queen must be sacrificed in order to gain ground.
p3231
aVDon't tell me you wouldn't do the same.
p3232
aVBecause that would mean you're a terrible chess player.
p3233
aVOh bugger right off.
p3234
aVMasses of students and young people across the country voted lib dem based largely on that single policy.
p3235
aVIt wasn't some small side policy, it was front and centre key political commitment that a huge chunk of their voters based their vote on.
p3236
aVThey betrayed every single one of those people.
p3237
aVThey deserve to burn as a party and sink back into obscurity.
p3238
aVBut the Lib Dems had the audacity to pretend they were different.
p3239
aVBut they're worse.
p3240
aVEven worse than tories.
p3241
aVEven a tory government would be better than the Lib Dems being back in power.
p3242
aVAt least with the tories you know where they stand, and you know exactly what they're going to do.
p3243
aVFuck the Liberal Democrats.
p3244
aVThey're a disgrace to politics.
p3245
aVComplete scum. 
p3246
aVWell my flatmates and I certainly don't mind the debt and apparently neither do the record number of my fellow students, especially poor students, who have gone to uni.
p3247
aVThe debt may have increased but the deal isn't that bad.
p3248
aVBut regardless of that, you might not have realised this, but the liberal democrats didn't win!
p3249
aVThere is no reason to expect them to implement policies that are promised on a majority win scenario.
p3250
aVThey entered a coalition and that means compromising so they can do the best for the people and they have done exactly that.
p3251
aVThey have done a lot of good in this term. 
p3252
aVI can't believe how many times this needs to be said.
p3253
aVThey promised not to vote for an increase in the next Parliament.
p3254
aVNothing to do with their policy of scrapping them. 
p3255
aVThe broken promise on fees is one thing.
p3256
aVShutting down the investigation into Cyril Smith is another.
p3257
aVThey aren't.
p3258
aVI wouldn't trust them further than I can throw John Prescott.
p3259
aVThey make 'commitments' to things like an EU referendum and PR to hoover up votes and then as soon as push comes to shove they flake.
p3260
aVNick Clegg is the ultimate sophist.
p3261
aVHe's a great debater, but he's talking shit.
p3262
aVAt no point has Clegg promised an EU referendum.
p3263
aVYour opinion seems to be based on misinformation...
p3264
aV[deleted]
p3265
aV"We have this referendum next time (and every time) there is a large new treaty being proposed.
p3266
aVIn fact, we've even made this law.
p3267
aV" That is the key bit.
p3268
aVUnless there is a new treaty it isn't happening. 
p3269
aVIt won't happen because there won't be a treaty change ever again.
p3270
aVLisbon gave the EC enough power to expand its powers without constitutional assent of member nations.
p3271
aVThe Passerelle clause was most recently used to give birth to the EU Stability Mechanism without a single national referendum.
p3272
aVEven when memeber (or rather, constituent nations at this point) are given permission to hold a referendum, the EU will just make then re-do their referenda until they vote *correctly* (see: Ireland).
p3273
aVThe EU truly is a menace to self-determination and democracy. 
p3274
aV&gt; The EU truly is a menace to self-determination and democracy.
p3275
aVMatter of opinion but okay.
p3276
aVWithout going into the academic grievances of the democratic deficit of the EU's organs, the turnout is damning enough.
p3277
aVI can't see how the EU can claim a mandate in the UK when the turnout was 35.6%, and the single largest voting block was anti-EU.
p3278
aVOf the entire electorate, from whom all de jure power comes, 75% either abstained or voted for an anti-EU party.
p3279
aVBanana Republics have more convincing elections.
p3280
aVWell, our country let it happen and we the voters didn't really care, in fact if you take polls into account, 85% of people in this country are going to vote for a party that wants to be a part of the EU and by default will end up giving more power to it.
p3281
aVIf people really hate the EU that much they should vote for anti-EU parties, but they don't so they keep voting for pro-EU parties.
p3282
aVIt's either that or we as a country aren't very democratic at all, which would make your point moot, seeing as you are speaking out against the threat of our democracy, so it can only be that people are actually indifferent to the EU, they are neither for or against it or they just don't care enough.
p3283
aVThe Conservatives demanded that it just be a referendum on PR instead of actually implementing it, then they threw the full force of their party resources and donors to defeat it.
p3284
aVHardly Clegg's fault.
p3285
aVThe yes vote was better funded.
p3286
aVThe yes vote wouldn't campaign with Farage because they wanted to be idealogically pure rather than win the vote.
p3287
aVMeanwhile the no vote had recognisable politicians from left, right and centre representing their side resulting in an easy win.
p3288
aVExcept it wasn't PR it was AV, hardly worth breaking your promises over. 
p3289
aVWell, Clegg did kind of sit back believing the Conservatives would take a softcore approach to it then acted with total shock when they didn't, but I put that to political inexperience for trusting the Conservatives to keep their word rather than just shoddy thinking on his part.
p3290

p3323
aVLiam Fox, a former GP, takes on the position of health secretary then moves to Minister for defense.
p3324
aVWhy would you move someone with intimate experience of his portfolio from the ground up into something he has no experience of?
p3325
aV2.
p3326
aVAlistair Darling - marxist to DWP, then minister of transport then to chancellor\u000a\u000aAre these people polymaths or bullshitters?
p3327
aVThe thing is the role of secretary of state for X is supposed to be kind of a managerial post.
p3328
aVThere are committees and white papers and civil servants to actually create the policy, all the minister has to do is make sure the project moves along.
p3329
aVIt's a rare minister who can set their ego aside to do this, however. 
p3330
aVThat sounds like our democracy is a waste of time.

aVAs a citizen of the former Colonies, this boggles my mind and im not sure where will smith's character comes in, can someone please explain?

aVFormer colonies doesn't really narrow it down old chap.

aVThat's about a quarter of the world.
p3335
aVAs to your main point, the Will Smith character is the former education secretary Micheal Gove.
p3336
aVHe had made a number of reforms which were pretty unpopular with teachers, and seemed to not really listen despite very limited (read no) experience with education policy.
p3337
aVDespite this he was supremely confident in his own position.
p3338
aVI just love this comic, it's perfect.
p3339
aVIt always drives me to fits of giggles I rarely find outside of the Far Side.
p3340
aVI don't get it?
p3341
aVIt's depicting Gove as completely inept and useless at something he thinks he can do.
p3342
aVA lot of people think this about his stint as Education Secretary.
p3343
aVa lot of idiots.
p3344
aVI have yet to meet a teacher who doesn't hate Gove, and have met one who encouraged murdering him.
p3345
aVHas there been an education minister that any teacher ever liked?
p3346
aVNot "liked" in the sense that history noted "*x*, in their stint in government, served as a unifying figure, to which teachers, parents, and pupils rallied behind, in pursuit of the educational standards set forward in their party's manifesto.
p3347
aV" But Gove is the only secretary of state for education to have a motion of no-confidence passed against him by the NUT
p3348
aVI didn't say people liked him, I was arguing that he is not inept.
p3349
aVHe is trying to undo the flittering away of standards in education as we have turned into continuous assessment city.
p3350
aVLearning should not be compartmentalised in its current "modular" form.
p3351
aVI don't like him as a person but we have to do something. 
p3352
aVMany teachers don't like continuous assessment, nor LEA control, nor any of the other things that Gove tried to tackle.
p3353
aVBut he didn't take much time to listen to their professional ideas and opinions on how to do things better, and instead ploughed on with ill thought-out schemes which were seemingly pulled out of thin air.
p3354
aVHis intention might have been good but frankly it was based on a lot of assumption and ignorance.
p3355
aVWhen teachers protested or questioned his decisions, his reaction often constitued an "[I'm right, you're wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QriZJ-X3wbU)" dressed up in polite rhetoric.
p3356
aVYou can see how they ended up despising him.
p3357
aVThe pensions and pay issues have just made things worse.
p3358
aVedit: 'Many teachers' rather than just 'teachers'.
p3359
aVI know I can't speak for every teacher out there!\u000a
p3360
aVI feel like he's taking the wrong steps though.
p3361
aVWasting money on sending every school a Bible, for instance (my school used it *once* for a mock court case).
p3362
aVAnother area I feel he's being narrow minded in is stripping non-British literature from the English curriculum.
p3363
aVI agree with you're point completely, but the the money for the bibles was privately sourced.
p3364
aV^^^sorry ^^^for ^^^playing ^^^devils ^^^advocate
p3365
aVStill indicates the backwards thinking.
p3366
aVPlease justify your conclusions; it's easy to write off your opinion if you don't.
p3367
aV[deleted]
p3368
aVRegardless it's historically important; one of the most influential pieces of literature ever written.
p3369
aVI wouldn't oppose students studying Hamlet just because there's a little murder in it.
p3370
aVTo be fair, if you're learning English in a British school it ought to be British English and not American English or some other variant.
p3371
aVIt's bad enough in science where sulphur and foetus are taught as "sulfur" and "fetus".
p3372
aV[However, the IUPAC adopted the spelling sulfur in 1990, as did the Nomenclature Committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1992, restoring the spelling sulfur to Britain.
p3373
aVThe Oxford Dictionaries note that "in chemistry ... the -f- spelling is now the standard form in all related words in the field in both British and US contexts.
p3374
aV"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur)
p3375
aVI'm a developmental biologist - if I used foetus in a paper my colleagues would laugh at me.
p3376
aVedit: for those silly downvoters, from the OED: [In technical usage fetus is now the standard spelling throughout the English-speaking world](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fetus).
p3377
aVIn developmental biology it is categorically wrong to use foetus.
p3378
aVYes, and the first thing you should probably do is get the teachers on board with you...
p3379
aVTo be fair, teachers hate anything that's not bigger pay or less work.
p3380
aVI'm not saying this is true for just teachers btw, it's pretty much human nature
p3381
aVLargely, the more recent strikes were against Gove's changes to the curriculum.
p3382
aVI've yet to meet a teacher that I could consider a capable and competent person though...
p3383
aVYou must not meet many teachers. 
p3384
aVi agree actually \u000a\u000ayou surround yourself in lessons and rhetoric designed for 4-16 year old's, standards start to slip.. \u000a\u000awhen was the last time a GCSE english teacher had to give an intensive 2 hour lecture and Q n A on chaucer or milton ?
p3385
aVinstead it's *maybe if i teach my year 11's all year on of mice and men, they might pick up on the themes of the impossibility of the american dream and the predatory nature of humanity to cough up in the exam god i hope so* \u000a\u000ait must be so very dull 
p3386
aVI realised that around the time I was subjected to Mice &amp; Men by Mrs. Wall.
p3387
aVI resolved never to become a teacher because it was so obviously repetitive and boring.
p3388
aVI am not an english teacher (or a teacher) but i know many who are.
p3389
aVif you're talking about the lower ability classes, then yes, it looks dull and they dont really cover what an intelligent person would think worthwile.
p3390
aVhowever, it's important to remember that these are generally kids who have NEVER read anything other than the tv guide or the captions on a computer game.
p3391
aVI shit you not, many of them can't even tell the freakin time, despite being teenagers.
p3392
aVWhile what they achieve might be superficial and banal to you, its a pretty monumental achievement to get these kids to take any interest at all, and actually a lot of them do find it empowering.
p3393
aVit's all relative.
p3394
aVthe higher sets do cover things like chaucer, and even old english.
p3395
aVhowever old you are, I can assure you education has come a long way, while the raw material the teachers have to deal with has deteriorated massively, due to mindless or sometimes rotten home lives, that are increasingly common.
p3396
aVI've been through your posting history (because I agreed with most of it) but please try to respond politely if you respond at all.
p3397
aVan enlightening comment.
p3398
aVhowever the joy of posting anonymously on the internet, is i don't have to be polite aha \u000a\u000ait's like a safety valve so i'm not a rude bastard in the real world \u000a\u000aand more on topic still... \u000a\u000awhile i appreciate where you're coming from, *from my perspective* i would be incredibly bored, going over the same source material *every year* i'm guessing one could even recycle lesson plans once that year has moved on/up?
p3399
aVi guess for some, the joy of teaching is it's own reward, but stimulation in a job is what keeps you getting up and putting 2 feet on the floor every morning.
p3400
aV&gt;however the joy of posting anonymously on the internet, is i don't have to be polite aha \u000a\u000a&gt;it's like a safety valve so i'm not a rude bastard in the real world \u000a\u000aI hear ya, and definitely relate.
p3401
aVI'm generally OK unless people are being rude or irrational, then I might flip.
p3402
aV====\u000a\u000aEDIT: I think if english teaching was exactly as you imagine, anyone would be bored.
p3403
aVI don't think they have time to be.
p3404
aVThey have to choose the material each year and they will be teaching lots of different classes of kids, so it's more relentless than boring.
p3405
aVThey all hate the teaching system, but they feel its worth it when they make a difference to the kids.
p3406
aVI couldn't do it, and neither would i go through that hell, 70 hours a week, plus the constant insults from the parents and the public for a pathetically meagre £25k p/a.
p3407
aVThet's not even half my salary, and my job is half those hours and an utter and total peice of piss!
p3408
aVThey need proper performance-related pay and salaries much more commensurate with the time, stress and aggravation the job entails.
p3409
aVHowever the biggest thing holding them back are their own unions, who resist every change claiming its the end of the world as we know it (#standard).
p3410

aVReally, I shan't be accepting of anything post-1910.

aV1913 at the latest.

aVI do support the proposal for the new Number 10, probably a lot cheaper plus that Van can transport the whole cabinet so bonus 
p3425
aVThe cabinet, or a cabinet? 
p3426
aVAn inanimate object would probably do a considerably better job than politicians.
p3427
aVYeah, an inanimate object can't make things worse.
p3428
aVEither or 
p3429
aVThink they're taking English votes for English laws a little too far with the new number 10.
p3430
aVAnd I understand that they're trying to cut costs, but I think a new build is a little too modern.
p3431
aVHow about something more traditional and ten times as patriotic: http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3668323.ece/alternates/s615/PAY-Patriotic-house.jpg Bonus England flags covering the windows for privacy.
p3432
aVerror: The length of the value of the variable vPatriotism exceeds the maximum length.

p3444
aVYou are a broken record, aren't you?
p3445
aV&gt; The likes of you\u000a\u000a\u000aJust have a bit more respect for people who don't agree with everything you think hook line and sinker.
p3446
aVI'm really sick of the brigading accompanied by claims of being victims, this isnt that site for angsty teenagers. 
p3447
aV&gt; Have a bit more respect\u000a\u000aWhy are you telling me this?
p3448
aVYou should probably pay more attention to who is replying to you, as I am not the OP, and no, I am not from /pol/ either.
p3449
aVWait until you see the karma scores in this thread, then show me the evidence of vote manipulation.
p3450
aVIf this sub is being brigaded as much as you say, where are the endless Ukip posts on the front page?
p3451
aVI counted about three, and two of those were negative.
p3452
aVWhy is the top comment ITT one that is in total agreement with the Private Eye front page, despite it being satirical in nature?
p3453
aVIt's a joke, the same as Bacon sandwiches et al.
p3454
aVStop lashing out at everyone because someone was mean about a party that's in the news a lot that you happen to like. 
p3455
aVYou are truly the king of straw men.
p3456
aVI am not having a go at Private Eye, I thought it was funny.
p3457
aVI'm calling you out on your paranoia about this endless /pol/ brigading.

p3462
aVThere may be about five or ten of them.
p3463
aVIt is getting to the stage that people gets called a /pol/ shill simply because of their support of Ukip.
p3464
aVNo, that would be your sub.
p3465
aVAs much as I enjoy the personal attacks, would you mind specifying which one?
p3466
aV&gt; personal attacks\u000a\u000aIt was nothing personal.
p3467
aVI was referring to your silent little britpol sub, the one that has tried to emulate how this sub was back in the day when you could count on any Ukip post being pummelled into the turf and circled by baying leftist hyenas.
p3468
aVThat one.\u000a\u000a
p3469
aVI think you mean the sub that is blissfully free of a large cadre of people trying to impose their UKIP-aligned view and similarly a lack of a disturbing trend towards ethnocentric nationalism.
p3470
aVAs I have remarked before, it is incredibly ironic that for all your "circling by baying leftist hyenas" claims you are incredibly blind to the equivalent UKIP circle of hyenas now present. 
p3471
aVIt's just the opposite way around.
p3472
aVInstead of a UKIP circlejerk its a left-wing circlejerk.
p3473
aVI think I'm the only right wing guy who posts there.
p3474
aVI'm fairly sure your impression of what goes on here is vastly different to what actually transpires.
p3475
aVWhat we have now is rather balanced.
p3476
aVAttempts to stifle a chuckle
p3477
aVTake a good look at the front page.
p3478
aVPlease explain  how that equates to a "cadre of people trying to impose their UKIP-aligned view"?
p3479
aVIf that is what a Ukip echo chamber looks like, then the "imposers" are rather lacking in vigour.
p3480
aVEdit: I didn't think I'd get a response.
p3481
aVFor a party with two seats there seems to be a lot being posted about them...
p3482
aVWhere?
p3483
aVBy the way, two seats and consistently polling between 15-19%, you mean?
p3484
aVNot to mention taking the lead on matters that the other parties have found it in their best interests to follow.
p3485
aV&gt; Not to mention taking the lead on matters that the other parties have found it in their best interests to follow.
p3486
aVYes, the EU and immigration are the most important issues in this country today.

p3489
aVThe biggest scam perpetuated by the elite has been to convince people that immigrants and Europe are to blame for most of their problems.
p3490
aVIt simply isn't true.
p3491
aVUKIP is just an exercise in cynical anti-intellectual demagoguery.
p3492
aVThis is the politics of fear and ignorance.
p3493
aVBut thats life...
p3494
aVVery, very strange comment.
p3495
aVIt's like you just woke up yesterday.
p3496
aVThe immigration issue had been swept under the rug for *decades* by the political elite, since Powell dared to mention it.
p3497
aVIt is only in the last few years that the debate has been able to proceed without as many shrill cries of "racist" because of grassroots concerns, and those concerns have found a voice in Ukip.
p3498
aV&gt; UKIP is just an exercise in cynical anti-intellectual demagoguery.
p3499
aVThis is where your side of the argument really falls down.
p3500
aVIt is not anti-intellectual to be concerned with the explosion in immigration and the rate of change in cities and towns across the UK.
p3501
aVYou will no doubt retort with the economics of it all, but that is just a smokescreen that can easily be seen through.
p3502
aVYou might even say "What British culture?
p3503
aV" like so many others do.
p3504
aVThat borders on treason, and won't be looked kindly upon by future generations of Britons, reduced to making up 5% of their country and asking their great-grandparents why they sold their country out for the sake of "diversity" and economics.
p3505
aVI really have no interest in debating this with you.
p3506
aVNobody will win, and we wouldn't agree on anything.
p3507
aVI just think its a sad turn of events to see the political elite jump on the "all my problems are caused by other people" bandwagon.
p3508
aVIts really boring to read how people like you think people like me are the reason why people who aren't like either of us can't get a job. 
p3509
aV&gt; I really have no interest in debating this with you.
p3510
aVBecause you would lose.
p3511
aVHe is right, immigration has been swept under the carpet and ignored by the politicians, even while the public were going out of their minds over the issue.
p3512
aVLabour have now admitted they "made mistakes" on immigration, by opening a door to unlimited numbers of people from Eastern Europe back in 2004, and Boris Johnson has admitted it was a "deceit" when his party claimed they could control the numbers - they can not.
p3513
aV&gt;Nobody will win, \u000a\u000aNo, he would win, because you are lying\u000a\u000a&gt;and we wouldn't agree on anything\u000a\u000aBecause you are denying facts. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p3514
aVLying?
p3515
aVYes, lying.
p3516
aVWhen you said this : -\u000a\u000a&gt;The biggest scam perpetuated by the elite has been to convince people that immigrants and Europe are to blame for most of their problems.
p3517
aVIt simply isn't true.
p3518
aVThe political elite have avoided, obfuscated and danced around the issue of open door immigration, preferring not to discuss it, and lying when they do.
p3519
aVIt is the *public*, not the political elites, that have demanded the issue be brought to the table, and this is why UKIP has succeeded, because they haven't been afraid to address the matter, despite the elite's politically correct silencing tactics used to attempt to shut down the discussion, accusing anyone that does not have an 100% positive view of immigration of being a "racist".
p3520
aVIt's a lie when you claim the political elites have told the public all their problems come from immigration.
p3521
aVThe elites only ever try to claim that immigration is a net benefit to the country, economically, and culturally.
p3522
aVThey ignore the truth, that mass immigration has driven down wages, and pushed up house and rent prices due to increased demand on a limited supply of housing.
p3523
aVThe UK is one of the most crowded countries in Europe, and has a growing population mainly because of mass immigration.
p3524
aVNo mainstream politician has a ever admitted that.
p3525
aVHonest question - Would you rather that every government policy or piece of legislation was decided by public referendum?
p3526
aVIf anything the biggest scam perpetuated by the elite is the constant bashing of UKIP in the media by "mock the week" style cretins.
p3527
aVHow dare those proles not accept that immigration and more competition in the work place is good for them, eh?
p3528
aVIts hardly a scam.
p3529
aVUKIP don't seem to be too popular amongst satirical show producers, so their attempts to ridicule mostly backfire.
p3530
aVThe fact is that many people don't really have a clue what the EU is, or why we're in it, so when people come along and say they'll pull us out and save money, its something they want to hear.
p3531
aVSatirists are saying "Look at these crackpots, they think immigrants are the number one problem with this country!
p3532
aVHah!
p3533
aV" and Johnny Electorate is seeing nothing wrong with that...\u000a\u000aIts depressing - And it happens in the mainstream news too.
p3534
aVThe BBC for example tells a story about how Mark Reckless kinda, almost, sorta says he's going to deport europeans, isn't this horrible?
p3535
aVAnd a significant proportion of the public agrees with what he's implying.
p3536
aVI think the media mocking and bashing UKIP is 90% of the reason why they're seeing a relative surge in support...
p3537
aV&gt;I'm fairly sure your impression of what goes on here is vastly different to what actually transpires.
p3538
aVLikewise. 
p3539
aVI would enjoy being able to fly an English flag and not feel like a scumbag because of it.
p3540
aVMaybe I should get a St. George duvet so I can feel patriotic before I nod off.
p3541
aVI don't like the St. George's flag from a design point of view, its pretty dull 
p3542
aVThat's true, but luckily the Union Jack is the best flag there is.
p3543
aVI think you misspelled ugliest.
p3544
aVBoo!
p3545
aVI think people misread joke.
p3546
aVI think you misread our hatred of traitors.
p3547
aVTo be fair a good fabric one looks a million times better than the £3 nylon ones most people fly.
p3548
aVMaybe I could get a matching union jack pajamas.
p3549
aV&gt; I don't like the St. George's flag from a design point of view, its pretty dull \u000a\u000aWith a cross on background it looks pretty similar to generic North West European flags - Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland...
p3550
aVUnion Jack is way better.
p3551
aV^(or the EU flag)
p3552
aVThe EU would be greatly improved if we agreed to call it the HRE and used the double headed HRE eagle.

aVBy that time, France is in a revolution and Poland is way behind on tech, so we would be *fucked*.  
p3556
aVLooks like EU4 is creeping in here...

aVWe need an imperial double headed Robin.
p3561
aVThe EU flag is pretty meaningless, especially when its also used by unrelated bodies 
p3562
aVI'd settle for the 1980s.
p3563
aVYou mean when there was a backward thinking Conservative in charge and riots and strikes up and down the country led by people that were being put out of work because of cuts after a recession?
p3564
aVAnd the heir to the throne was expecting, Bob Geldof made a charity record and an upstart political party was benefitting from defecting MPs.

aV&gt; backward thinking\u000a\u000a[read: non-progressive]
p3569
aVMaggie was the epitome of progressive, a little too much for some.
p3570
aVI have never heard of anyone saying she was 'backward thinking'.
p3571
aVIn terms of business, yes progressive.
p3572
aVIn terms of human rights, happiness, culture, wellbeing, etc etc, she wasn't just backward thinking, she was completely bankrupt
p3573
aVCan't worry about human rights when your best friends with Jimmy Saville now can you? 
p3574
aVIs that you, Arthur?
p3575
aVSome of us won't be forgetting Section 28 any time soon. 
p3576
aVIt was tongue in cheek mate basically saying today is no different.

aVAlso the knight character has St. George's flags

aVNo one should be beyond taking a ribbing, should they?

p3581
aVIs Private Eye like a left-wing foil to the Daily Mail?
p3582
aVBecause that's the impression I'm getting here.
p3583
aVNot really.
p3584
aVIt's a parody magazine that also has a sideline as the watcher-of-the-watchers, reporting on interesting/scandalous news about the other newspapers, including things like D-notices (government censorship of a particular story) and things other newspaper won't report on because they are scared of rich folks' lawyers.
p3585
aVThey get sued.
p3586
aVA lot.
p3587
aVThey are, probably, a little left of centre, if only because they are so firmly in opposition to powerful monied interests, but they are most on the "taking the piss out of everyone"-wing with a side of anti-corruption.
p3588
aVSuch is the way of the most esteemed organ.

aVPeople in power in general.
p3592
aVIt's not like they lay off the shadow cabinet...
p3593
aVI do feel that Ian Hislop himself is probably a bit left leaning though.
p3594
aVAt least that's what I gather from the various talk shows he's been on over the years.
p3595
aVI like that man.
p3596
aVYeah he appears that way on HIGNFY, but he also appears to be fairly critical of very left wing people like Livingstone 
p3597
aVThink The Onion, but with serious investigative journalism and 50 year old in-jokes (*eyes passim*)
p3598
aVThe other reply more-or-less covered it, although I'd say it's more "an investigative journalism magazine with a sideline in parody" than vice-versa.
p3599
aVThey frequently put the rest of the British press to shame when it comes to actually doing proper journalism, IMO - their [special reports](https://privateeye.subscribeonline.co.uk/Products/digital-editions) (not free to read online, unfortunately, but the gists are there) in particular are always fantastic pieces of investigative work, of a depth &amp; rigour so rarely seen these days.
p3600
aVIf you're thinking they're left-wing because of this cover, note [the previous issue's cover](http://private-eye.co.uk/covers.php?showme=1379) was mocking the head of the Labour party... and [this one during the recent European parliament elections](http://private-eye.co.uk/covers.php?showme=1367) made fun of everyone.
p3601
aVIt's pretty common for them to attack "both sides" of a story, even in the same issue.
p3602
aVProbably worth mentioning they also satirize international politicians as well \u000a\u000ahttp://private-eye.co.uk/pictures/covers/full/1372_big.jpg
p3603
aVAnd journalists, and bankers, and CEOs... no-one is safe!
p3604
aVI'm pretty confident I'm safe.
p3605
aVSouth of the river?
p3606
aVThis time of day?
p3607
aVI should coco.
p3608
aVAh yes.
p3609
aVIf you walk up to someone and say \u000a\u000a\u000a"Do you think the UK has enough capability to house so many immigrants from Europe?
p3610
aVIt seems unfair that our Government can't do anything about it because the EU dictates our terms.
p3611
aVPerhaps we should ask the UK to vote on whether they agree?
p3612
aV"\u000a\u000a\u000aIs equivalent to wanting to go back to 1950.
p3613
aVAlso implying that 1950 were apparently horrible.
p3614
aVWhich would be a reasonable thing to discuss if it was based on, you know, facts and stuff like that.
p3615
aVRight now, there are more immigrants from outside Europe than inside, EU migrants tend to be profitable and healthy, and the government doesn't use the tools it has to send home those (very few) who can't support themselves.
p3616
aVAlso, the UK government, which UK voters put there, approved both free movement *and* no restrictions on A8 workers when they joined.
p3617
aVVoters agreed all along.
p3618
aVAs one of those pesky EEA migrants, I'd love a discussion that acknowledged these things.
p3619
aV&gt; more immigrants from outside Europe than inside\u000a\u000aHow does that negate the idea that there are too many?
p3620
aV&gt; EU migrants tend to be profitable\u000a\u000aAlways with the cold economics of it all.
p3621
aV&gt; \u000a&gt; the government doesn't use the tools it has to send home those (very few) who can't support themselves\u000a\u000aHence the dissatisfaction with them and the rise of Ukip.
p3622
aV&gt; the UK government, which UK voters put there, approved both free movement and no restrictions on A8 workers when they joined.
p3623
aVVoters agreed all along.
p3624
aVFigures were spouted of 10,000 to 15,000 coming per annum.
p3625
aVDo you think everyone would have agreed to 220,000+?
p3626
aVAnd what choice did people have?
p3627
aVWho would people have voted for if they didn't want free movement/no restrictions?
p3628
aVBoth Labour and the Tories were keen on the idea.
p3629
aV&gt; &gt; more immigrants from outside Europe than inside  \u000a\u000a&gt; How does that negate the idea that there are too many?
p3630
aVIt doesn't, but it illustrates that the debate is incredibly skewed for some reason.
p3631
aV&gt; &gt; EU migrants tend to be profitable\u000a\u000a&gt; Always with the cold economics of it all.
p3632
aVWhat else do you want?
p3633
aVIf migrants pay for their use of public services and then some, don't affect salary levels a whole lot for British people, create as many or more jobs as they take, what's required to keep you satisfied?
p3634
aVAnd why aren't we talking about fixing those things instead of clouding everything with wrong information?
p3635
aVEdit: That your politicians are lying to you is also not the fault of migrants, but there was a lot of wilful ignorance from both politicians and public regarding those figures.
p3636
aVThe growth in migrants from Europe is flattening, so hopefully we can all get over this in a few years.
p3637
aV&gt; what's required to keep you satisfied?
p3638
aVIt's not about the problem, it's about the solution.
p3639
aVIf this problem stops fitting the solution too much, a different problem for the solution will be concentrated on.
p3640
aVIf you look at the data surrounding this current one, "EU immigration" already doesn't really work.
p3641
aVAs they are a net gain to the economy.
p3642
aVBut right now, people are relying on "common sense", not data, so the problem can still be used.
p3643
aVWell they should start looking at the data, then.
p3644
aVPeople root up their lives to come here and try to make a better future for themselves and their families and to contribute to the UK, the least people could do before shutting the door is to try to learn some damn facts.
p3645
aVOh I agree, but it's all about easy blame.
p3646
aVIs very poisonous.
p3647
aV&gt; the debate is incredibly skewed\u000a\u000aIt's not, really.
p3648
aVPeople are just as concerned with immigration from outside the EU.
p3649
aVWe have just been hearing a great deal about the EU because of the recent election results and the prominence of Ukip.
p3650
aV&gt; pay for their use of public services and then some\u000a\u000aThe issue is not the payment for, but availability of such services.
p3651
aV&gt; don't affect salary levels a whole lot for British people\u000a\u000aThat depends on your profession.
p3652
aV&gt; create as many or more jobs as they take\u000a\u000aCitation please.
p3653
aV&gt; And why aren't we talking about fixing those things instead of clouding everything with wrong information?
p3654
aVI thought you said they aren't problems, so why would they need fixing?
p3655
aV&gt; not the fault of migrants\u000a\u000aNo one is blaming the migrants themselves.
p3656
aV&gt; The growth in migrants from Europe is flattening\u000a\u000a[What?
p3657
aV](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/28/statistically-significant-increase-net-migration-uk-key-charts)\u000a\u000a*The net migration for the year ending March 2014 was 243,000, a year-on-year increase of 38% that seems to end Coalition government hopes of a significant drop before the end of the parliament*
p3658
aVThe jobs argument doesn't hold up for me.
p3659
aVPeople paying less than minimum wage should be prosecuted, as they are breaking the law.
p3660
aVThe problem is that a lot of immigrants from the EU have better skills than a lot of the UK population.
p3661
aVAre businesses suppose to hire worse people?
p3662
aVIs it worse for a country to have the best skilled people in each job?
p3663
aVThe issue isn't with immigrants.
p3664
aVIt's that a huge number of British people don't have the skills required to get a job, and that's a mixture of the government's fault and theirs. 
p3665
aVAh, my old chum Doug.
p3666
aVStill waiting on you to take back your sweeping generalisations.
p3667
aV&gt; The issue is not the payment for, but availability of such services.
p3668
aVWhich migrants use less of than native Britons, and are also hired to provide.
p3669
aVIs government just static?
p3670
aVIsn't it supposed to adapt to the population?
p3671
aVEspecially when the population in question is paying the bill and then some?
p3672
aV&gt; That depends on your profession.
p3673
aVYes, EU migrant workers negatively affect salary levels [very slightly for some people](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/labour-market-effects-immigration\u000a), and more positively for others.
p3674
aV&gt; &gt; create as many or more jobs as they take\u000a\u000a&gt; Citation please.
p3675
aVSame source as above: "Research does not find a significant impact of overall immigration on unemployment in the UK"\u000a\u000a&gt; I thought you said they aren't problems, so why would they need fixing?
p3676
aVI never said there were NO problems with migration.
p3677
aVThat would be delusional.
p3678
aVI believe they can be handled, however, and that the problems people mostly talk about are nonexistent.
p3679
aV&gt; What?
p3680
aVOkay, I ignored latest quarterlies for that statement.
p3681
aVConsidering the new August report, I'll have to retune that to a "we'll see" after 2013/2014 yearlies are ready.
p3682
aVThere's a new report in two days that'll make it easier to see if the recent increase is seasonal or not.
p3683
aV&gt; Is government just static?
p3684
aVIsn't it supposed to adapt to the population?
p3685
aV[Seems not to be coping too well at all](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/20/nhs-hospitals-failing-meet-targets-waiting-times-treatment).
p3686
aV&gt; &gt; create as many or more jobs as they take\u000a&gt; &gt; Citation please.
p3687
aV&gt; &gt; &gt; Same source as above:\u000a\u000aThat doesn't tell you that they are the ones creating as many jobs as they take, and especially doesn't mention anything about creating *more* jobs.
p3688
aVGovernments around the world have those kinds of problems, immigration or not.
p3689
aVAgeing native populations are a much bigger issue for the NHS.
p3690
aVThat should be obvious.
p3691
aVIt's impossible to blame NHS capacity issues on EEA immigrants primarily, because EEA immigrants consume much less of those services than natives, and are generally young and healthy, so you won't see many of them in a cancer ward.
p3692
aVAlso, the figures fluctuate wildly over a period of immigration.
p3693
aVGiven that EEA migrants are a [net positive](http://www.itv.com/news/story/2014-11-05/research-shows-eu-migrants-positive-tax-contribution/) to government funds, feel free to spend some of that money on improving the NHS.
p3694
aVYou're welcome.
p3695
aVApparently to be good enough for you immigrants have to come here, consume very few services whatsoever, but pay for them still, and not have any impact on anything a Briton ever does but preferably create *more* jobs for those who live here... anything I missed?
p3696
aV&gt; Governments around the world have those kinds of problems, immigration or not.
p3697
aVThe problem is exacerbated by mass immigration.
p3698
aVThe article mentions nothing about Britain's ageing population as a cause, but does state that hospitals as a whole breached the requirement to treat 95% of A&amp;E patients within four hours during both December and January, [as does this one about a new report which found that waiting times for A&amp;E patients have hit a nine-year high and that the number of people waiting more than four hours to see a doctor has almost doubled since last year](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10097888/Migrants-partly-to-blame-for-AandE-waiting-times-Tory-MP-says.html).
p3699
aV&gt; anything I missed?
p3700
aVJust a limit on the numbers.
p3701
aVAnd you were the one going on about them creating more jobs.
p3702
aVI said that there was no proof whatsoever in your claims.
p3703
aVGive me some data, not what some MP just pulls out of his ass.
p3704
aVThe actual scientist quoted in the article says it may account for a small part but isn't a significant factor \u2013 and apparently the problems can be solved by teaching immigrants how to register with a GP.
p3705
aVAgain, feel free to spend some of the extra money we bring on that.
p3706
aVI said "as many or more", which the research and supporting documents I linked to agrees with \u2013 immigration does not have a negative impact on employment, and in some sectors there may be an increase, but more uncertain.
p3707
aVI can rephrase that to "as many" if it makes you happier.
p3708
aV&gt; Some 313,000 patients spent four hours or longer in A&amp;E between January and March, or six per cent of all people attending emergency units during that period, according to ***official figures***.
p3709
aVThat is some arse.
p3710
aV&gt; rephrase that to "as many" if it makes you happier\u000a\u000aSo you are going to drop half of your argument for the sake of accuracy?
p3711
aVGreat.
p3712
aVYeah, the point was that the waiting can't be attributed primarily to migrants in any way.
p3713
aVThat is not supported by any figures, and as is said in the article, the small factor that may be attributable to migrants is apparently because they don't have a GP \u2013 that's fixable.
p3714
aVI wasn't dropping my argument, I never meant for it to be interpreted as immigrants themselves contribute wildly to job creation, just that there might be a small positive factor.
p3715
aV(The FDI that comes with an open economy, however, [does](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/220966/foi_eumembership_fdi.pdf).
p3716
aV)
aVlearn to take a joke mate.
p3717
aVI thought UKIP were all about this stuff
p3718
aVThey only like jokes that punch down and belittle people who are different.
p3719
aVYou know, like on Top Gear!
p3720
aVJust a joke, like on Top Gear!
p3721
aV&gt; Just a joke, like on Top Gear!
p3722
aVGuys I found a Stu fan!
p3723
aVWe are many.
p3724
aVWe are Legion.
p3725
aVYou will not hear us\u000a\u000a\u000aAt first.
p3726
aVStew 
p3727
aVAnd it's the lefties with the victim complex now is it?
p3728
aVPerhaps the cover should strive to be more PC.
p3729
aVThat's not actually what they are saying, there is no reasoned debate 
p3730
aVActually there was a recent YouGov poll in which something like 60-70% of UKIP voters said they wanted to turn the clock back a couple of decades.
p3731
aVVoters from the other parties all delivered a majority in favour of preferring things as they are now. 
p3732
aVThe bright orange ad for '#epicfail a losers guide to social media' draws away the gravitas.
p3733
aVI know what you mean.
p3734
aVIf you're  going for this kind of impactful visual statement a full page is pretty much necessary. 
p3735
aV"Here is the news, not the propaganda" is not the news.
p3736
aVIn fact, it's arguably the propaganda.
p3737
aVDevoting your front page to the fact that you're not devoting your front page to a story is devoting your front page to that story.
p3738
aVThis is not rocket science.
p3739
aVThey clearly made this because of their desire to be seen as above covering the story, not because they're *actually* being above covering the story.
p3740
aVThat dove of peace really doesn't gel with the implied criticism of their competitors, nor the punchy wording and the self righteous tone.
p3741
aVPrinting a black page with a dove and talking up the event in this way presents one unfair death as a significant blow.
p3742
aVThe only way out of this is to downplay the beheading, not put your newspaper into full-on grieving mode.
p3743
aVI think this is cynical, disingenuous, harmful drivel.
p3744
aVBy the way, that isn't a dove, it's the logo of "The Independent": an eagle with a rolled-up newspaper in its talons.
p3745
aVAha!
p3746
aVMy mistake.
p3747
aVI should have looked more carefully.
p3748
aVIn that case, why are they associating their logo with this?
p3749
aVVery strange.
p3750
aV&gt; They clearly made this because of their desire to be seen as above covering the story, not because they're actually being above covering the story.
p3751
aVAbsolutely spot on.\u000a
p3752
aVAnd it would have used loads of ink...
p3753
aVBut seriously well said, reports on killings and other terrible things only makes the whole situation worse.
p3754
aVBut there is no way that it could ever stop; the public want news so the papers give them the news.
p3755
aVThe different sources of media will always try to sneak their view in, and the worse it is, the more we hear about it.
p3756
aVI like this.
p3757
aVI don't.
p3758
aVIt gives a Lord Voldemort vibe to Daash, that they're so scary we shouldn't report their names nor their crimes.
p3759
aVThis is a ideological success for a death cult against liberalism and free speech.
p3760
aVIt's also not effective counter-propaganda - they're skilled at using the internet and social media to recruit misfits and losers.\u000a\u000a
p3761
aVSo are we doing the whole "Daash" thing then?
p3762
aVI like it as it's both accurate and liberal.
p3763
aVInhabitants of the region, including many Muslims, refer to them as Daash - that they themselves hate it is an extra plus.
p3764
aVMore importantly, it denies any legitimacy to their claim to being *The* Islamic State, the Caliphate.
p3765
aVThis is far more important than not letting Daash's crimes be known - The West and its Muslim allies (as well as Assad, I suppose) are not at war in the Levant with God's State on Earth, they are containing a gang of cutthroats who are using Islamist conspiracy theories as an excuse to murder and rape their way across the Middle East.
p3766
aVDaesh (\u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634) is simply an abbreviation of 'Islamic State', it doesn't afford them any less 'Islamic' legitimacy.
p3767
aVDaash is an abbreviation of their former title, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and is the equivalent of ISIS, not IS.
p3768
aVIt does afford them less legitimacy because IS refers to their unique claim to be *the* Islamic State, rather than simply *a* Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
p3769
aVThis is why the cultists hate the term - they use the phrase in Arabic for "The State" because of the differences in theological-political legitimacy compared to Daash.
p3770
aVUse of such a term in English language publications is pointless, especially when considering that it includes a letter that native English speakers largely cannot pronounce correctly and is a term that many English speakers will not understand.
p3771
aV'Islamic State' or 'Islamic state of Iraq and Syria/Sham/Levant' are perfectly valid descriptions and titles in English language publications, abbreviated to IS or ISIS if an abbreviation is necessary. 
p3772
aVI agree, I was happy using ISIS after they had officially changed their name to IS.
p3773
aVHowever, IS as a term has become more common on the basis of accuracy, and it's a propaganda coup for them.
p3774
aV&gt;it includes a letter that native English speakers largely cannot pronounce correctly and is a term that many English speakers will not understand.
p3775
aVThis never stopped the usage of Al-Qaeda, the [Pakistanj] Taliban and other similar terms. 
p3776
aVFair point, however those were the groups' actual titles.
p3777
aVDaesh is an abbreviation of the groups' actual title/former-title.
p3778
aVAt this point they're known as the Islamic State/ISIS.
p3779
aVIt just seems pointless to start giving them this 'politically neutral' title now.
p3780
aVIf it's really so important to deny them their propaganda then we could simply go the way of the always politically correct BBC and refer to them as 'so-called Islamic State' so as not to offend anyone. 
p3781
aVIf it stops even one loser from going off to Syria, I think it's worth it. \u000a
p3782
aVBut Daash is an acronym for the Islamic State in Arabic. 
p3783
aVNo, it's an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and (Greater) Syria.
p3784
aVYes I know but that is not my point.
p3785
aVUsing Daash seems no different from using Isis. 
p3786
aVI mentioned above I was fine with ISIS until the media and people started using "Islamic State" because they think it is accurate.
p3787
aVNobody calls Taiwan the "Republic of China" even if that's their official name.
p3788
aVNot usually, but we do use the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and the United States (of America), which I believe is the same principle as using the Islamic State (of Iran and Syria).
p3789
aVThere are other Islamic States (states which are Islamic) though - Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and maybe a few others I've forgotten.
p3790
aVDaash is different in that they claim to be **The** Islamic State, as in, the only religiously legitimate state on Earth.
p3791
aV*(of Great Britain and Northern Ireland)* and *(of Iran and Syria)* are not equivalent here because Daash dropped *(of Iran and Syria)* so that they could claim to be the Global Caliphate. 
p3792
aV"Daesh" surely. 
p3793
aV&gt;Da\u02bfesh, Da-ish, D\u0101\u02bbish, Daesh, Daish, Daash, Da'ash, Daas, Da'ish, D\u0101'ash, Daiish: various latinisations of the (\u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634) acronym formed from al-Dawlah al-Isl\u0101m\u012byah f\u012b al-\u02bbIr\u0101q wa-al-Sh\u0101m\u000a\u000aFrom Wikipedia
p3794
aVIt is all very Judean People's Front.
p3795
aVI think I will refer to them as those naughty people. 
p3796
aVSplitters!
p3797
aVNo.
p3798
aVIt is lame.
p3799
aVDid we call the USSR by CCCP?\u000a\u000a
p3800
aVYes.
p3801
aVIt's this week's new name for Al Qaeda in Iraq 
p3802
aVThey think it's going to upset all the IS members on here lol
p3803
aVWhat are you talking about?
p3804
aVWhy do you think they video the murders in the first place?
p3805
aVDo you honestly think they're some sort of recruitment ploy?
p3806
aVDo you think it's just misguided PR or that they accidentally leave the camera on?
p3807
aVIdiot.
p3808
aVThey do it on purpose to provoke a response.
p3809
aVThey do it on purpose to make us look like we're anti-Islam.
p3810
aVThey want us to go to War again.
p3811
aVThey want us to kill innocent people again.
p3812
aVThey do it to make us say or do something stupid so they can turn to the Muslim world, from Algeria to Indonesia and say that we are the evil ones.
p3813
aVIt's so they can say we're the bloodthirsty, the Satanic, the warmongers.
p3814
aVThe videos have a purely propaganda purpose.
p3815
aVThe reason they dress the victims in orange is to represent the torture victims in Guantanamo Bay, enraging Muslims.
p3816
aVThe reason there's an English guy talking, is to purposely get us angry.
p3817
aVAnd every media outlet that says that we should respond, go to war and start dropping (by unanimously forgetting that we already tried that approach) is falling to this trap.
p3818
aVThey're not "skilled at using the internet and social media", we are.
p3819
aVEverytime one of these videos comes up, we're the ones who use social media to hate them, to demand our governments drop bombs and start killing.
p3820
aVThere's no great skill in provoking a response.
p3821
aVIf you show enough beheadings, you're going to get scared and you're going to get the mob angry.
p3822
aVThe trick's as old as politics itself.
p3823
aVThat's why what the Independent's doing is admirable.
p3824
aVIt's not the Daily Prophet and Voldemort, it's cutting through the bullshit.
p3825
aVThere's nothing to fear because they're just a bunch of shits living in shit scarred piece of the World who (rightly or wrongly) blame us for everything.
p3826
aVPerhaps we should stop giving them an excuse to.
p3827
aVPerhaps we should stop torturing people.
p3828
aVPerhaps we shouldn't start wars for oil.
p3829
aVPerhaps we shouldn't threaten escalate the fuck out of every region that happens to piss us off at that time.
p3830
aVI'm not an apologist.
p3831
aVI just think we should stop pretending we need to save them with bombs.
p3832
aVWe should leave them the fuck alone.
p3833
aVThis kind of radical jihadism is a conspiracy theory.
p3834
aVThere's no way the West can win.
p3835
aVWhen we were doing nothing in Bosnia, Chechnya, Syria and Aceh, Islamists screeched "Look at the evil West!
p3836
aVThey are not helping poor Muslims!
p3837
aVThey hate us and want us to die because they are unpious, hedonistic kuffar!".
p3838
aVWhen we do do something which involves killing some Muslims, the traditional script plays.
p3839
aVWhen we intervene to *help* Muslims which involves killing non-Muslims (e.g.
p3840
aVKosovo) radical Islamists are completely silent, because it doesn't fit in with their narrative.
p3841
aVThese guys have no gratitude for us.

aVFrance is as much an enemy to them as the US is, despite the Chirac government's refusal to fight in 2003 and diplomatic action in the UN.
p3843
aVNothing we do to impress them or convince them that we are actually Nice Guys will work.
p3844
aVThey will always find some way to blame the West, because their narrative demands they must.
p3845
aV&gt;Perhaps we shouldn't threaten War everytime they do something we don't approve of.
p3846
aVImagine you are a Daash commander, hanging out in Raqqa with your sex slaves and barely literate grunts.
p3847
aVWhich option would you prefer?
p3848
aVA.
p3849
aVA conventional and full war in the short term with a grand coalition of all the West and its local Muslim allies in the region, which inevitably entails the West immediately and completely kicking your ass.
p3850
aVB.
p3851
aVTime to consolidate your rule, collect taxes, establish yourself as *The* Islamic State and continuously make it more and more costly for opponents of your death cult to stop you.
p3852
aVThat you feel a need to clarify an anti-war position with the statement that you are not an apologist for Daash somehow manages to make it more obvious than it already is that B is the strategy Daash is pursuing.
p3853
aVContrary to what you say, there are risks and there are costs to not intervening.
p3854
aVThe longer we wait, the stronger they'll get - and they'll hate us just the same.
p3855
aVYour completely overstating how powerful this ragtag group is.
p3856
aVThey aren't a threat to us.
p3857
aVWe are playing into the narrative by attacking them, its ludicrous to suggest ISIL would be able to claim that the west is evil for not helping people they themselves are hurting.
p3858
aVDon't you think they know how people here would react to hearing about these videos?
p3859
aVIntervention for those in the group who actually care about this caliphate crap (which isn't all of them) is worst case scenario they die a martyr, best case they force us to bomb them for years wasting ludicrous sums of money, killing innocent people along the way, giving them the juice to keep themselves in power.
p3860
aVIt could be an indictment of how tenuous their position is that they feel the need to exacerbate a war to keep themselves together because they know the group will disintegrate as people who are using the it to achieve other aims peel off once those are achieved.
p3861
aVThey aren't stupid, they know full well that that a propaganda video that shows enough to get us to intervene to a degree, but not enough to intervene completely would make us do just that - which under some circumstances would be beneficial to their aims.
p3862
aVWe should be undercutting them diplomatically, doing the opposite of what they expect - actually empowering the people in the region.
p3863
aVYou can talk about showing the photos and videos or not, and call them what you want - but bombing them and calling them evil and overstating the threat and the power they have gives them all the credibility they need.   
p3864
aV&gt;its ludicrous to suggest ISIL would be able to claim that the west is evil for not helping people they themselves are hurting.
p3865
aVOf course it is, but they do it and the scary thing is, it works.
p3866
aVIf you can stomach it, watch [this video of theirs](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/06/17/jihad-2-0/) - note the children injured in Daash's war who are presented as objects in need of rescue.
p3867
aV&gt;They aren't a threat to us.
p3868
aVThey aren't a threat to us as they have more immediate concerns.
p3869
aVThe whole point of Daash, why they exist, is they turned Al-Qaeda's strategy on its head.
p3870
aVRather than fighting the West first then establishing the caliphate, Daash have established the caliphate so they can fight the West.
p3871
aVThis is a big part of why Al-Qaeda has disowned them.
p3872
aV&gt;Don't you think they know how people here would react to hearing about these videos?
p3873
aVDon't *you* think they know how people here would react exactly like you are doing when hearing about these videos?
p3874
aVThe entire point of these videos is to buy time through intimidating us pitiful cowardly Westerners for Daash to consolidate and make future attempts to destroy them more costly for us.
p3875
aV&gt;We should be undercutting them diplomatically, doing the opposite of what they expect - actually empowering the people in the region.
p3876
aVWe are also doing this.
p3877
aVIt's not incompatible with war with Daash - it's actually a pre-requisite - but it might not be enough.
p3878
aVThe Kurds are struggling, the Shia militias are thugs, the Free Syrian Army is a paper wildcat and Assad is as a monster.
p3879
aV&gt;but bombing them and calling them evil and overstating the threat and the power they have gives them all the credibility they need.
p3880
aVAnd understating their threat makes them somehow *less* dangerous?
p3881
aVWe didn't intervene in Syria because we were worried that bombing Assad would create a power vacuum which would allow Islamists to become powerful.
p3882
aVSo, we sat and watched a power vacuum form and an Islamist army become the most powerful force in Syria.
p3883
aVNot once have I see an anti-war argument concerning Daash contain "OK, there are risks to not going to war, but I think the trade-off is worth it".
p3884
aVIt is always assumed that doing nothing entails either minimal or no risk, in contrast to dangers intervention would produce which are apparently clearly greater than the current existence of Daash.
p3885
aVAnd this isn't to say it is obvious we should go to war, but it seems that as soon as you take the risks of inaction into account the case for non-intervention suddenly becomes a lot weaker, and I've yet to see an anti-war argument which considers those risks.
p3886
aVI think one of the issues can very clearly be seen in your post.
p3887
aVYou present the choice as "go to war or do nothing".
p3888
aVHowever that's a false dichotomy.
p3889
aVCruise missiles cost $1.4m each.
p3890
aVEvery bomb we drop costs tens of thousands of dollars.
p3891
aVWar is tremendously expensive and, whilst the human costs (death) are clear, the political results are uncertain.
p3892
aVTo me, the choice should instead be "go to war or, spend a small fraction of the amount we'd have spent on bullets and bombs, on making friends within the Islamic world, and making sure our point of view is heard".
p3893
aVThat's not doing nothing.
p3894
aVYou can't do foreign policy on the cheap.
p3895
aVIf you're going to talk about the financial costs of our security policy then you need to argue that defence is such a burden it's severely affecting our quality of life at home and that the ramifications of any cutbacks or withdrawal from the area in question are acceptable.
p3896
aVCounting cruise missiles is penny pinching.
p3897
aVWe're already doing what you've suggested we do actually, it's a key plank of Western foreign policy.
p3898
aVWe're friends with the Kurds, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Oman, the Gulf States, the Iraqi Government and Turkey.
p3899
aVWe've even reached out to Iran we're that desperate.
p3900
aVThe only people we have not tried to co-operate with are Assad and Daash themselves.
p3901
aVAnd it's shocking, but what we're doing isn't it enough.
p3902
aVIt's why Daash now control half of Syria and and Iraq each.
p3903
aVIt's why the Kurds are begging the air strikes intensify.
p3904
aVIt's why the FSA is desperate for arms and recognition.
p3905
aVAnd you are right, there are more choices than go to war or do nothing.
p3906
aVBut if we are going to do this, we can't fuck around.
p3907
aVWe are either in it to stop Daash at any cost, or we cut our losses and leave it to resolve itself.
p3908
aVSpending a little bit of money to try to stop Daash if we're lucky is not a good option.
p3909
aVWhen our friends are asking for more intervention and we refuse we isolate ourselves and make our diplomatic position harder.
p3910
aVIf more moderate strategies have failed and are continuing to fail it is madness to say that we should continue to pursue that failed strategy on the basis that the risks in escalating or withdrawal are greater than failure. 
p3911
aVYou speak of relationships with arab governments.
p3912
aVHowever that's not what I'm suggesting at all.
p3913
aVWe need to more actively compete for the opinion of the arab public, not just their governments.
p3914
aVdisagree the same way the responsible media don't publish the names of  killers who crave the attention this takes away what they want.
p3915
aVBut they don't want attention, they want deterrence.
p3916
aVThe executions are an attempt to make the price of intervention so high for the West that we stop the airstrikes or any future intervention.
p3917
aVThis isn't just taking what they are saying at face value in the videos, it's the same strategy the same group attempted unsuccessfully during the Iraq War.
p3918
aVThey don't have any other means of stopping the US from attempting airstrikes as they don't have AA weapons, and they're not bright enough to realize that despite their caricatures of us as soft and decadent stuff like this turns public opinion away from indifference and towards war.
p3919
aVdon't be silly, they are there to get ransoms from the french and other eu nations who negotiate  paid they aren't naive enough to think killing a few captives will stop nations readily willing to sacrifice thousands  of troops.
p3920
aV[I'm not being silly.
p3921
aV](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141987/robin-simcox/isis-worst-nightmare)\u000a\u000aISIS aren't interested in ransoms at this point.
p3922
aVThat's pocket change, suitable for start-up jihadist groups such as in the Maghreb and Boko Haram.
p3923
aVThey are making far more from selling oil, tax collection and financing by idiot fat cats in the Gulf.
p3924
aVOne reason might be deterrence but the slick production values and messages contained within the execution and other videos rather point to other reasons: that they are trying to demonstrate an ability to kill with impunity to a predominantly western audience and they want to inspire others to join their cause.
p3925
aVIt is also a big fuck you to the west.
p3926
aVMore than that, the executions have galvanised support for intervention as demonstrated by opinion polls pre and post execution.
p3927
aVISIS have demonstrated an understanding of media war and I find it difficult to believe these videos are meant to be a deterrent against western intervention.
p3928
aVMoreover al qaeda tried that with nick berg and that did not work.
p3929
aVLastly, if there is any deterrent effect, given that the victims have so far been almost exclusively civilians, I think the only people deterred will be journalists and aid workers.
p3930
aVI think it is quite clear these videos are not purely for deterrence.
p3931
aVThey have been chosen because they are obviously westerners and so will generate greatest publicity.
p3932
aVTo say the ransom is nothing also goes against the evidence; the french managed to secure release via payment. 
p3933
aVI agree, I think there are other reasons.
p3934
aVRansoms probably do play a secondary role, and it will have effects on recruitment and domestic morale too.
p3935
aVHowever, the options of provocation and deterrence are mutually exclusive.
p3936
aVEither Daash wants a war with the West, or it doesn't.
p3937
aV&gt;ISIS have demonstrated an understanding of media war and I find it difficult to believe these videos are meant to be a deterrent against western intervention.
p3938
aV[I mentioned elsewhere in the thread how Daash is likely to view the desirability of a full-out war with the West](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2iazyq/front_page_of_this_weeks_independent_on_sunday/cl0k9ew).
p3939
aVThe immediate problem Daash has concerning the West are the air strikes being conducted in Iraq and now Syria, and due to their lack of anti-air weaponry or planes they can't do anything militarily against these strikes.
p3940
aVTheir main concern at this point is that the USA will bleed them white with drones and planes, whilst the US' Muslim allies do the dirty work on the ground and take and hold territory.
p3941
aVDaash has to stop these strikes if they want their campaigns to succeed and the only option they to even try to make the strikes too costly for the West to continue is to hurt the hostages which they held for months before the air strikes began.
p3942
aV&gt;More than that, the executions have galvanised support for intervention as demonstrated by opinion polls pre and post execution.
p3943
aVRight, but it was also the only strategy available to them, and it probably seemed more viable to them then it does to us.
p3944
aVIf you're a radical Islamist fanatic who left the West to join Daash, you have to accept as a premise that the West is degenerate and godless, and it follows from this that in comparison to the Lions of Allah we are soft and cowardly.
p3945
aVThis kind of assumption on their part makes intimidation through the execution of hostages more appealing to them then it would do for us.
p3946
aVAnd to an extent they've been successful - the Independent front page and some of the comments in this thread are proof enough that Daash is through its own mythology getting across the narrative that it's too dangerous to provoke Daash.
p3947
aVThat public opinion as a whole is changing in favour of war is just their own assumptions about the willingness of the West to go to war in response to aggression being completely wrong.
p3948
aV\u000a&gt; They're skilled at using the internet and social media to recruit misfits and losers.
p3949
aVLet's hope they don't start up a /r/Isis then
p3950
aV&gt; against liberalism \u000a\u000aDon't see a problem with this.
p3951
aVSure, "daesh" are reactionary and an aberration but it is your "liberalism" that has created this group in the first place.
p3952
aVYou Bolshies just can't resist a dig at the West, can you?
p3953
aVlol.
p3954
aVI'm not even a Leninist, let alone "Bolshevist".
p3955
aVIf I was around in the 20s I probably would've been with the Blacks, not the Bolsheviks.
p3956
aVBut nice try.
p3957
aVOh I *see*, you're not a member of an arcane political cult, you're a member of some *other* arcane political cult!
p3958
aVCarry on then.
p3959
aVIf only there was some middle ground between righteous self censorship and pandering to terrorists...
p3960
aVJust looks like self-aggrandisement to me.
p3961
aVIf they wanted to do this properly, they should've just printed a normal story with no pictures.
p3962
aVIf I was a family member, I'd be pissed off.
p3963
aVReminds me of one newspaper's front page post 7/7. 
p3964
aVWar propaganda generally would.
p3965
aVMost papers, as far as I recall, did something similar to this after the 2004 tsunami in Asia that killed at least a quarter of a million people.
p3966
aVI'm not so sure about this one.
p3967
aVI don't like the implication of "here's the news, not the propaganda.
p3968
aV" I feel like the Independent are being snooty and trying to take the moral high ground by not having a picture of a murdered man in an orange jumpsuit on their front page. 
p3969
aVThe problem I have with this, though it sets the right tone, is that it uses this event to legitimise the message "we are real news" by comparing itself to the worst form of propaganda\u000a\u000aThis is still propaganda
p3970
aVA refreshing change.
p3971
aVTo have more bloody murder?
p3972
aVYes yes, that's exactly what I meant.
p3973
aVWow that's pretty powerful.
p3974
aVThe #EpicFail guide to social media and the promise to sort my Sunday for just £2.20 all over the top of the paper detracts from the message just a tad.
p3975
aVThe Independent giving a lecture on propaganda?
p3976
aV*Scoff*
p3977
aVI support this.
p3978
aVI don't think we should be giving airtime to bloodsoaked murderers attempting to wield hate and fear and death as weapons against the innocent.
p3979
aVI don't think we should be broadcasting their crimes on their terms, via the videos and photographs they have provided, with the speeches and announcements they have written.
p3980
aVI think our various news outlets should report on these people, by all means.
p3981
aVBut for every death, a joke at their expense.
p3982
aVFor every bomb dropped, a running tally of towns and cities under their control so that we might have a visual aid as to the progress of the battle with them.
p3983
aVFor every beheading, a thousand leaflets dropped over their desert strongholds announcing plans for bacon-tipped bullets to be provided to their enemies and the women being trained to fight them, getting killed by a woman equals no heaven for you, motherfucker.
p3984
aVThis propaganda requires an answer.
p3985
aVI think we, the people of Britain, are in a unique place given our sense of humour to provide such an answer.
p3986
aVThis is a terrible idea.
p3987
aVI'm not even sure where to begin, but I don't think a story of a man being beheaded warrants a joke at anyone's expense.
p3988
aVAnd the bacon-tipped bullets idea was just uncalled for; there are plenty of decent Muslims who don't need that sort of islamophobic content being put out there.
p3989
aVISIS aren't true Muslims, and we should treat them for their radicalism and extremism, not for the fact that they claim to be followers of Islam.
p3990
aVIt's not Islamophobic to suggest that shooting at the people who are running a perversion of Islam with bullets tipped with something that Islam states you can't get into heaven if you in any way consume or touch.
p3991
aVIf anything, is it not simply beating ISIS at their own game?
p3992
aVThey wanna attract young, angry Muslims to do their fighting for them.
p3993
aVOkay, we'll fight them with a weapon that no Muslim, no matter how young and angry, can possibly expect to be killed with and still get to heaven.
p3994
aVIt's called morale.
p3995
aVWe can spend all day and all night bombing these guys and not accomplish a fucking thing as long as they have a suitably fortified cave and enough sets of dominos.
p3996
aVLeave just one of these dudes with a bacon-tipped bullet in his chest and watch the fear grow.
p3997
aVThey want to use fear as a weapon, I suggest we give them a reason to be a little fearful of us.
p3998
aVA waste of black ink.
p3999
aVThat's still reporting it, and making a big thing out of it, which is exactly what the killers want.
p4000
aVAs long as it's getting reported, it's going to keep happening.
p4001
aVI don't like it, they are making a show out of it.
p4002
aVThis draws more and not less attention to it.
p4003
aVThey could have reported about it in a discrete way but they went for 'everyone look how we are not mentioning IS'.
p4004
aVIt creates more attention (the fact that this is on reddit kind of proofs that), it's clearly marketing for the newspaper.
p4005
aVSo they are using the death of a person for marketing... wtf, IS certainly likes it...
p4006
aVThe headline is untrue.
p4007
aVFor some reason they picked *one* name out of a very long list.
p4008
aVLook here for the reverse DNS: http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=ptr%3a195.234.240.212&amp;run=toolpage\u000a\u000aIt resolves to many different journalists at the rag, about 30-40 total addresses.
p4009
aVThis whole affair seems a trifle fishy.
p4010
aVIP is a pretty shitty way of identification.
p4011
aVI'm pretty sure it's not even admissible in court.
p4012
aVGreat point.
p4013
aVThat's why I'm baffled how they make filesharing charges stick.  
p4014
aVThey get a confession.
p4015
aVAs far as I know no one has been found liable for, or guilty of normal filesharing without some kind of confession.
p4016
aVIP addresses are used in criminal investigations, but usually (if the police are doing their job properly) as a starting point, not as definite proof.
p4017
aVRecently a judge in Florida overturned an RIAA lawsuit on the grounds that just because someone lives at the house where an IP address is, doesn't mean they are the one who downloaded the pirated material.
p4018
aVIt's shitty but this does prove (to some extent) that the post came from the Daily Mail's internal network.
p4019
aVI'd presume a big organization like that has a static, dedicated connection, so the host information is a little more reliable than if it were a person on an ADSL or cable connection (dynamic IPs vs. Static IPs).
p4020
aVEven then IP spoofing is a thing.
p4021
aVIt's easy to fake your IP to a website.
p4022
aVIt could easily have been David Williams given his recent article history for the Mail.
p4023
aVNot saying it was him of course, but given Ferrer left the Mail then unlikely to have been him.
p4024
aVhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?authornamef=David+Williams
p4025
aVIf we knew the exact time of the original post, we could work out which domain had the IP at the time from your link.
p4026
aV[deleted]
p4027
aVwhy not?
p4028
aVa dynamic IP address is assigned to various recipients and it looks like that link details the time that IP address was assigned to a particular domain.
p4029
aVThe objective being finding out who owned that IP when that message was posted.
p4030
aVIt's not a dynamic IP address.
p4031
aVIt's just that several domains have the same IP address.
p4032
aVThat makes no sense.
p4033
aVAlso since it's a big organisation they tend to buy entire IP ranges so to a company level (maybe office) they can be "static".
p4034
aVLooks dynamic to me, with all those different domains assigned to it over time.
p4035
aVNo, all those domains are assigned to that IP address *simultaneously*.
p4036
aVyeah but not all the domains are for the daily mail.
p4037
aVSure, all the DM entries are the same domain, but there are others.
p4038
aVYou can assign any domain to any IP address.
p4039
aVThey all look like parts of the DMG which was my point.
p4040
aVThey're static in the sense it will always come from within the organisation but not from the same user.
p4041
aV[Richard Ferrer](https://twitter.com/richferrer)?
p4042
aV- Editor, Jewish News.
p4043
aVColumnist, Independent, Ex Daily Mail and Daily Mirror
p4044
aVYeah so he's editor of "Jewish News" and happens to try and fake violent muslim anger for the Daily Mail in the most ridiculously stupid, obvious way ever?
p4045
aVThis can't just sound a little fishy to me. 
p4046
aV&gt;This can't just sound a little fishy to me.
p4047
aVYes.
p4048
aVYou are not alone.
p4049
aVShut it down.
p4050
aVOy vey.
p4051
aVA new low for the Daily Mail if this is true.
p4052
aVI hope it gets picked-up by the press and they get a kicking. 
p4053
aV&gt;A new low for the Daily Mail\u000a\u000aWhat about the time they published a personal attack on a transsexual woman for working in a school that triggered a media circus and led to her committing suicide?
p4054
aVI am not trans, but that is something that still make my blood boil when I hear it mentioned.
p4055
aVAnd I don't normally give a crap about that kinda stuff.
p4056
aVTo bully someone to death, which is all I can see it as because it isn't reporting, especially when they had already been mostly accepted by the local community, is just absolutely wrong and disgusting.
p4057
aVThere have been many daily mail lows before, but that to me is one of the deepest.
p4058
aVI'm trans, and it's always lovely to know that popular media outlets like to make it out like it's a choice and so chastise you like you're a freak of nature.
p4059
aVIt's a demanding life at best, and these doomsayer media outlets claim it's for attention or that being transgender has anything to do with LGB.
p4060
aVSo after being unrepresented in pretty much all walks of life, they have the audacity to claim that my life is less than a straight/cis person because I happened to be born with gender dysphoria.
p4061
aVRant aside, I feel like while LGB people are going to get their rights almost world wide within the next 10 years or so, it'll be a long time before being transgender is accepted.
p4062
aVI get that people have gender identity issues and I've seen some life-altering body modifications, however, as someone who has little experience around real-life trans people, can you please explain to me a bit about how you feel and what makes you tick?
p4063
aVeg.
p4064
aVAt what point did you say, "I'd rather be a &amp;amp;amp;lt;current gender&gt; looking &amp;amp;amp;lt;opposite gender&gt; than accept the body/role I grew up in?
p4065
aVHow successful would you describe your self-created outward appearance as, at enhancing your inner sense of self-acceptance?
p4066
aVFor me personally (Gender dysphoria is different for each person) it's the fact that everything that I do, act, associate with is naturally more feminine.
p4067
aVThe reason why many transgender persons suffer greatly is because when you are born, society goes "Okay, you have this genitalia, therefore certain social responsibilities are given to you".
p4068
aV*The clash happens when you want to act the way you are, to be yourself, but that is not what is expected from society.
p4069
aV*\u000a\u000aFor me personally, I was sent to an all male school, during this time, I felt really awkward.
p4070
aVI couldn't fit in with my classmates, at least not anything past a superficial level.
p4071
aVOn the other hand, hanging out with female friends outside of school just clicked.
p4072
aVSo in order not to be outcasted my friends, family and people in general, I had to put on this masculine act.
p4073
aVDoing so 24/7 for over a decade really, really breaks you mentally.
p4074
aVYou can't be your true self to anyone.
p4075
aVSo me, being the already mentally crippled and depressed person, realised that I'm basically lying to everyone I meet and converse with because I'm forcing myself to mentally act the way I am physically.
p4076
aVI kept this up until about 16, until I had a huge breakdown, six attempted suicides within one month, etc.
p4077
aVI told my parents at the time that it was just vanilla depression, and I'd get over it.
p4078
aVI'm 19 now, and I'm still living with my folks, but only my mother knows I'm transgender.
p4079
aVI'm currently looking to move out (if I can ever find work again) and finally start my life the way it was intended.
p4080
aVIt goes up another level too.
p4081
aVI refuse to use male public bathrooms, refuse to allow anyone to know my birth name or to be called by it (if I can help it) for example.
p4082
aVSo when society expects me, as a man, to act accordingly, the clash happens again and I'd rather prefer to either ignore it (and face transbashing, etc) or I have to abide by the expectations and the mental battle rages on.
p4083
aVI'm pretty lucky for the most part.
p4084
aVI didn't grow up in a religious place, and I live in a country where coming out as trans doesn't lead to execution.
p4085
aVBut people who end up caving in fully end up mutilating their genitalia, or committing suicide.
p4086
aVThe media doesn't help either, when they objectify transgender people and treat it as an oddity.
p4087
aVThe porn industry doesn't help either, but I won't open that can of worms.
p4088
aVTL;DR: Gender Dysphoria is a real thing, it's bloody awful and very few people take it seriously.
p4089
aVEdit: Just to add, sorry for being so dark and macabre about it, but I didn't want to make it seem farcical or less serious.
p4090
aVHey, I really appreciate the open and direct answer.
p4091
aV:)\u000a\u000aTell me, do you think it's possible for a person in your area with male genitalia to be accepted as non-masculine?
p4092
aV&gt;Tell me, do you think it's possible for a person in your area with male genitalia to be accepted as non-masculine?
p4093
aVSure, I guess.
p4094
aVI live in London so usually people don't bat an eye at much
p4095
aVOK, so do you think it's possible to define yourself as male and and not behave with typical masculine traits?
p4096
aVWell yes, but I do not define myself as male, although I could.
p4097
aVWell, you'd accept that you were born with male genitalia and can reproduce as the male partner of sexual intercourse, so you'd have to accept that your body is physically male, regardless of how you feel about that inside.
p4098
aVIn the same way that I may have blonde hair but want to eg.
p4099
aVbe a brunette.
p4100
aVNo matter how good the hair dye is, I'm still a blonde that is wearing brown hair dye..
p4101
aVIn which case, I ask, is it difficult to accept your physical body and behave however makes you happy?
p4102
aVI recommend you look at some of my previous comments to understand why a person with Gender Dysphoria finds it extremely difficult to function in their physical gender.
p4103
aVThanks, sorry for the hard questions - just trying to understand something I can't intimately relate to.
p4104
aVIt's fine, don't worry.
p4105
aVIf you want to get a wider perspective you could check out /r/transgender and associated subs :) 
p4106
aV&gt; Rant aside, I feel like while LGB people are going to get their rights almost world wide within the next 10 years or so, it'll be a long time before being transgender is accepted.
p4107
aVIf it makes you feel any better we are at least a century off in some places from the beginnings of that happening... shit innit.
p4108
aVProtip: don't use the term 'cis' if you want wider society to accept you.
p4109
aVTo many people its not unlike calling someone a kaffir or infidel.
p4110
aVBut "cis" is the exact correct term to use.
p4111
aVDo you personally get offended by it?
p4112
aVWhat's your alternative?
p4113
aVI personally dislike 'cis' too.
p4114
aVIts just less clunky than something like 'born as identified gender'
p4115
aVTry 'normal' or 'regular'.
p4116
aVI don't think there is much will in society to adopt another term like 'straight' to describe the normal state at this point, and using the term 'cis' means you'll have lost half of the audience before you've started.
p4117
aVIs this really a thing?
p4118
aVI'm as fine with cis as I am with being called straight.
p4119
aVI don't know many people who would be seen as being called cis a bad thing.
p4120
aVI hope you can see how negative it would be to call someone normal as opposed to cis.
p4121
aVhttp://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concern_troll
p4122
aVOh look you can copy paste.
p4123
aVHave fun continuing to alienate audiences and failing to get any points across.
p4124
aVDude people have been asking you why you feel this way and you haven't responded.
p4125
aVThe only person here alienating people and failing to get a point across is you.
p4126
aVNo they haven't.
p4127
aVWell, I know I for one did elsewhere in this thread.
p4128
aVNo you didn't.
p4129
aVNeither did anyone else.
p4130
aVYou do realise how insulting it is to imply that trans people are 'not normal'?
p4131
aVHe's a troll.
p4132
aVThey aren't.
p4133
aVJust like a chimeric cat isn't normal.
p4134
aVI don't think it implies anything else.
p4135
aVIt's quite amazing how a solid piece of advice is being down voted.
p4136
aVI think the thing is, is that most people don't have a problem being called cis.
p4137
aVMuch like they don't have a problem being called straight.
p4138
aVDo you view being called straight as a slur too?
p4139
aVMeh.
p4140
aVI'm not the one who has to communicate important things to another group without making them hate me by the mere terminology I unnecessarily invented to describe them.
p4141
aVDoesn't affect me :)
p4142
aVI'm *really* right wing, i believe in free markets, i think socialists are wrong about *everything* and i support the tory's \u000a\u000a*that being said*\u000a\u000ai can't imagine how hard it must be for someone to be born in the wrong body to be male but to *know* you were meant to be female an vice versa \u000a\u000ato me it's only common sense, that you're *born* trans just like you're *born* gay an i salute you're courage to become what you were meant to be.
p4143
aV(bear in mind the left will *never* know how to run an economy, even if our lot are 10 years behind the social issues :P) 
p4144
aVJust 10 years?
p4145
aVeh i'd rather be a decade behind the social issues and *actually* know how to run a country's finances then the alternative:\u000a\u000a"t-t-theres NO SUCH THING AS DEBT WE CAN SPEND OUR WAY OUT OF EVERYTHING" \u000a\u000ai made my choice \u000a\u000awe conservatives are necessary to counter the sheer pie in the sky fucking delusion of the left, even if we do get some things wrong.
p4146
aV&gt; we conservatives are necessary to counter the sheer pie in the sky fucking delusion of the left, even if we do get some things wrong.
p4147
aVToo much socialism = bust economy\u000a\u000aToo much capitalism = bust planet
p4148
aVWhat is the necessity of cutting budget deficits when GDP is significantly below trend in a country where all government borrowing is done in the currency entirely controlled by that country's central bank?
p4149
aVMeh, some lefties are stupid, some righties are stupid.
p4150
aVI'd call myself left-wing if forced into a decision, but, frankly both capitalism and socialism don't work because human nature corrupts.
p4151
aVIf anything capitalism may well be the slightly better system because at least it accepts human beings are inherently selfish bastards.
p4152
aVAlthough I may not agree with your political leanings towards the Right of the political spectrum, especially the mainstream political groups and the Tories, I do applaud your standing up in support of the rights of ignored minorities.
p4153
aVIt is sad that you are getting down-voted for what I read as a positive post.
p4154
aVit's because i said the left doesn't know how to run a successful economy \u000a\u000ait's fine though.  
p4155
aVOh don't get me wrong, there is a stereotype that lots of LGBT people are left wing (I've been to pride marches, and often you do see socialist/S.W.P support and flags), but I'm right leaning in many aspects (Libertarianism, for example plus I'm fairly right wing when it comes to fiscal issues).
p4156
aVOne thing that really grinds my gears is when people assume I'm left wing due to being trans, or that all right wingers are associated with homophobia, transphobia, etc.
p4157
aVMy political leanings tend to clash in conversation unfortunately :/
p4158
aVexactly the same here\u000a\u000ai'm as right wing as they come, but it seems to me gay people and trans people were *born* how they are, therefore we must logically conclude that they need support and help, not hatred and derision\u000a\u000abecause you literally cannot help how you are born \u000a\u000abut you are right, there is a massive stereotype of gay and trans individuals being left wing \u000a\u000ai wish it wasn't so, because even though the right are hopelessly wrong about gay and trans people we *really* do know how to run an economy and get more people with more money in their pockets.
p4159
aVcan you be socially left wing but financially right wing?
p4160
aVif you can, that's me
p4161
aV&gt;can you be socially left wing but financially right wing?
p4162
aVMe too, I'd consider myself 'Left-Libertarian' but people who are black and white minded would see that as a clash of ideologies. 
p4163
aV[I don't know if you are familiar with Bleeding Heart Libertarians](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/about-us/) but keep in mind that early libertarians split with Nixon over things like his imposition of wage-and-price controls and were generally dismissed as dope-smoking, free-love hippies because they early on favored legalizing drugs and were pro-gay rights. 
p4164
aVYou can certainly separate out the social and fiscal "leanings": see the [Political Compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org), a wordy but interesting system on a 2d instead of a 1d plane that let's you take a test and figure out roughly where you lie.
p4165
aVI'm certainly in the bottom left quadrant, which is very much the " social libertarian" style category.\u000a
p4166
aVI know the Daily Mail is awful, but this is the first time I'm hearing about this. 
p4167
aVFortunately the multifaceted nature of human existence provides enough dimensions in the hyperspace that all kinds of lows are achievable by the DM in different ways.
p4168
aVHoly crap do you have a link to that?

p4171
aVWhat a dastardly cunt that man is; and yet my mother still reads that paper.
p4172
aVThere is not new low for the daily mail to reach.
p4173
aVIt's fucking terrifying to me that they have a large and genuine audience.
p4174
aVHas anyone got the that online list of horrible Daily Mail actions over the years?
p4175
aVIt'll be a "rogue employee" again...
p4176
aVThis is a hate crime, would anyone actually accept individual responsibility for this with the likelihood of going to prison?
p4177
aVI bet they'd give up the editors quickly enough if they were charged.
p4178
aVDon't worry!
p4179
aVJournalists are above the law, particularly Daily Mail ones.
p4180
aVAlso, he's not brown.
p4181
aVTherefore, no offence.
p4182
aVJust because one person posted this does not mean the Daily Mail condones it or ordered it.
p4183
aVCompanies are made up of individuals.
p4184
aVCompanies do not (and should not) know everything there is to know about their employees.
p4185
aVSo you don't post it from work, especially given the types of stories the Daily Fail is well known for posting
p4186
aVPeople are idiots.
p4187
aVNice try Richard.. 
p4188
aVSure, but when similar behaviour is commonplace, there is a problem with the company. 
p4189
aVYou'd think but look at what idiotic UKIPers believe every time one of their members does something ghastly.
p4190
aVBasically if your organisation attracts people like that then you have to question the motives of your organisation.
p4191
aVCompanies are people
p4192
aVAye, the same bullshit excuse they made for the phone hacking.
p4193
aVThey create an environment which pressures and encourages their employees to break they law, then later act oblivious.
p4194
aVIf this is true, the Daily Mail really needs to be held to account. 
p4195
aVNo, the Daily Mail (and other news outlets) do not pressure their employees to break the law.
p4196
aVthey pressure them to succeed and get a scoop or face punishment.
p4197
aVIt is the Individual or group *inside* the company that *chooses* to break the law.
p4198
aV&gt;No, the Daily Mail (and other news outlets) do not pressure their employees to break the law.
p4199
aVthey pressure them to succeed and get a scoop or face punishment.
p4200
aVThis, as evinced by the phone hacking scandal, amounts to the same thing. 
p4201
aVNo, it doesnt.
p4202
aVThe employees choose to break the law.
p4203
aVThe company does not tell them to.

aVThat wasn't that bad to be honest, I mean it was his job to encourage a violent revolution against capitalism everywhere in the world including Britain so...
p4206
aVI think this, if its true is worse.
p4207
aVThe letter was forged. 
p4208
aVI understood that.
p4209
aVDon't you think the publication of a forged letter to sabotage an election is a little worse than posting something on an obscure forum?
p4210
aVWell, it didn't work by your own source.
p4211
aVWhat didn't work?
p4212
aVI apologise, I meant /u/madtambo's source.
p4213
aVIt didn't 'sabotage the election'.
p4214
aVThese far-right racists have been lying for generations.

p4218
aVNever judge morality by subsequent "success" or "failure" of the intended action.
p4219
aVMorality is about intent, rather than consequences.
p4220
aV&gt;Morality is about intent, rather than consequences.
p4221
aVThis doesn't work at all though.
p4222
aVIn the first instance, intent is only truly knowable to the individual performing some action.
p4223
aVIn the second, intent itself can be deeply flawed ("He meant well, but...").
p4224
aVGiven both those things, attempting to judge an outcome purely upon the motives of those responsible, without reference to what was actually *done* can lead you into some sort of moral wasteland.
p4225
aVIt's the precise reasoning which permits burning heretics at the stake because the *intent* is to save their eternal souls from mortal peril.
p4226
aVI guess I should qualify my statement, and the difference between a more absolutist intent and relativistic intent.
p4227
aVAbsolutist intent is "I intend to set this heretic on fire" - the direct thing you are trying to accomplish.
p4228
aVRelativistic intent is "I intend to nobly save this heretic by performing a service".
p4229
aVMy definition of intent in this circumstance is the absolutist one: the baseline thing you were trying to accomplish.
p4230
aVThe lines blur between the two but there's a distinction I think can be made there.
p4231
aV195.234.240.212 resolves as their web server.
p4232
aVThat seems like someone is deliberately trying to make it look like it was posted by a daily mail journalist.
p4233
aVIf it were really someone in the office it would come from whatever address staff have as their own web proxy.
p4234
aVThis would almost certainly be a different address to the one serving out web pages for their fairly large readership.
p4235
aVAgreed, faked by someone who doesn't build networks
p4236
aVYeah very unlikely the webserver and the offices have the same outbound IP. 
p4237
aVI just posted the same on Facebook, in response to a conspiracy-theorist friend.
p4238
aVThen I remembered that the Mail once stalked my website in an attempt to write about me, and the whole IP setup was *exactly* as they've described here.
p4239
aVThe full story:\u000a\u000aAt the tail end of 2011, I answered the phone at work.
p4240
aV"Hi it's Christopher Hastings from the Mail on Sunday".
p4241
aVHe'd got hold of some documents that named me and wanted to make me the subject of a story.
p4242
aVIt was all quite tedious but I had no wish to be in the papers so quietly rang round friends and got various photos of me taken down to make things more difficult for them.
p4243
aVOver the next five days, I noticed several visits to my website from the Daily Mail's nameserver, as did several friends who mention me on their websites.
p4244
aVStrangely, they also seem to use an enterprise search setup so their (many) searches on me showed up in my analytics as coming from the Mail.
p4245
aVIn this instance I am absolutely, 100% sure it was a Mail journalist behind it, and the nameserver/IP setup was *exactly* as the forum featured here have described.
p4246
aVtl;dr version: actually they do have the same outbound IP and their webserver (weird through that is), based on my own experience of being stalked by the Mail.
p4247
aVI'll concede that it's possible - seems to be an unorthodox setup but fair enough, you have the first hand experience I lack.
p4248
aVSo sorry to hear you had to deal with these dirtbags, by the way.
p4249
aVThat sounds pretty nasty; did the story ever get published?\u000a
p4250
aVNope - they spiked it in the end, but for a good few weeks my Saturday evenings were spent refreshing the Mail website to check.
p4251
aVIt wasn't a particularly interesting story, but that doesn't usually stop them.
p4252
aVThis was three years ago, though - the Mail's website traffic has gone through the roof since then, so it might have changed.\u000a
p4253
aVIf they host their own web server it's not very unlikely at all.
p4254
aVYou don't put your datcentre through the same connection as your employees.
p4255
aVThey aren't even normally the same city, let alone building.
p4256
aVAnd not only that, such a thing is a massive risk since you've put critical infrastructure on the same internal networks that hundreds of spearphishable employees are sat on.
p4257
aVThe daily mail are a huge traffic website, and their servers are most likely located at colocation sites nearer the internet backbone.
p4258
aV&gt; You don't put your datacenter through the same connection as your employees.
p4259
aVWelcome to corporate IT.
p4260
aVYou don't put it on the same network as everything else, you sit world facing stuff in a DMZ.
p4261
aVYeah well OK I should have clarified: you *can*, but making it safe requires extra effort and complexity as you describe.
p4262
aVI know that corporations would do this stuff in house and have their servers at HQ, but I highly doubt that's the case for such an online behemoth: you're talking about a web property that will be cached and CDN'd up the wazoo just to make it scalable.\u000a
p4263
aVI'm no IT guy but surely there's no way the staff's outbound web traffic comes from the same IP as their web server.
p4264
aVIf they host the website themselves on the same site as where their employees work, it's not unusual.
p4265
aVIn a pretty typical small setup like that, the world-facing IP is the public interface on a hardware firewall like a Cisco ASA.
p4266
aVWhen a request hits it the firewall rules dictate where it goes on the LAN (or if it just gets dropped) while the other stuff on the same network that needs to talk outward just goes out via the same firewall (with a proxy in the middle, or the firewall configured to check outbound requests with something more transparent like websense which instructs the firewall as to whether the request should be honoured or rejected)\u000a\u000aWebservers hosted in a configuration like that don't even know what the external IP is, the ASA just passes requests along to it based on its ruleset, and the webserver serves up the site requested based on the host header in the request.
p4267
aVIt's not the only way of doing it, but it's not at all surprising to come across companies doing it like this.
p4268
aVThe Daily Mail has 100 million visits to its site a month.
p4269
aVIt is the second largest paper in the UK.
p4270
aVI really can't imagine such a massive organisation having a setup like this.
p4271
aVMaybe I'm wrong, but I just can't see them hosting the site from the same IP as the one their employees use to check Facebook and browse Reddit.
p4272
aVI haven't checked but isn't it possible that the DNS entries for the web site point to a cdn which acts as a reverse proxy for the real site, which could indeed be hosted on the office network.
p4273
aVMaybe they want us to think they've been framed by a leftist hacker?
p4274
aV*dramatic music*
p4275
aV**MISDIRECTION ALL THE WAY DOWN**
p4276
aVWhy would a former DM employee still have subdomains in his name?
p4277
aVPeople are jumping to the conclusion that having his name in means the address was his personal computer.
p4278
aVIn fact the subdomain was for his blog.
p4279
aVThe subdomain remains active so that any old links to the blog can be redirected to the Daily Mail website rather than just becoming broken.
p4280
aVIT tech from a big company here.
p4281
aVWe name the host for each machine in a naming scheme that includes the name of that person but if a person leaves and a new person gets their PC then the host name may not get changed until the PC is replaced.
p4282
aVThat could easily have happened here if the DM have a similar system.
p4283
aVI think you're confusing internal dns (as with Active Directory) with external DNS.
p4284
aVI doubt every machine in your company has an externally resolvable address.
p4285
aVNetworking isn't my speciality (more of a hardware guy) but while I'm pretty sure that the address isn't resolvable from outside it's still visible on connections.
p4286
aVI.e.
p4287
aVWhen I vnc into my home machine it tells me that myname.mycompany.net is controlling this machine rather than just the ip.
p4288
aVEach machine does have a static ip.
p4289
aVYou're probably using a VPN though, where the internally addressable network becomes visible once the network is up
p4290
aVyes, but a publicly-resolveable name?
p4291
aVBut the IP resolves to their WEB server, as an IT tech from a big company do you think that outbound traffic from the DM offices will share the same IP as the main website?
p4292
aVYeah, totally not.
p4293
aVSomething isn't right.
p4294
aVIt's not my area so I'm not the best one to figure out what. 
p4295
aVWhy would a post allegedly made from the Daily Mail offices appear to come from their web server, as this does?
p4296
aVI assume that their site has enough traffic to justify dedicated servers, and is not being served from a box in the corner of the office which also acts as a proxy server for their staff.
p4297
aVI strongly suspect that the forum software blindly accepts the X-Forwarded-For header as containing the user's IP address, in which case you can spoof any address you like.
p4298
aVIt's probably not completely unfeasible that they have one server for web services and proxy.
p4299
aVYou should do some more digging.
p4300
aVWhat would be the point?
p4301
aVIP alone proves nothing.
p4302
aVLet's try it :)
p4303
aVI originally posted it on /r/unitedkingdom [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/29wzmo/a_post_on_ummahcom_calling_for_muslims_to_wage/), but it was removed because of the rule against screenshots.
p4304
aVYou should also post it to /r/conspiracy, those guys would be interested in something like this.
p4305
aVI'd advise against that place.
p4306
aVIt's a cesspit.
p4307
aVthat's just what the man wants you to think!
p4308
aVx post it to /r/lizardmen instead
p4309
aVDunno what you mean.
p4310
aVThose guys have 100% convinced me that the Jews are behind everything! 
p4311
aVThat's what they want you to think. 
p4312
aVI'm sure they'll find a way to make it about the jews.
p4313
aVThe guy who posted it: https://twitter.com/richferrer\u000a\u000a&gt;Editor, Jewish News.
p4314
aV/pol/ is always right.
p4315
aV*grabs popcorn*
p4316
aVHe hasn't worked there for 5 years.
p4317
aVI'm pretty sure that nothing specifically anti-jewish has ever been up voted there.
p4318
aVAnti-zionist, yeah, but there's a big difference.
p4319
aVStill, the place is a mess.
p4320
aVThere's been plenty of outright anti-Semitic stuff posted there, unfortunately.
p4321
aVCheck /r/conspiratard for the list. 
p4322
aVPeople post stupid shit everywhere, doesn't get up voted though.
p4323
aVThey're not racist, just some are nutjobs and tend to convince the majority about stupid theories.
p4324
aVIn my couple years of being subscribed half for the lols, I haven't seen anything anti-semetic.
p4325
aVThe funny thing is that Semite actually means Arab by definition haha.
p4326
aVI've had the same experience as you.
p4327
aVMostly people believing outlandish plots from the same governments that they think are incompetent.
p4328
aVOh, [come on](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/search?q=anti-semitic&amp;restrict_sr=on).
p4329
aVIt's hardly uncommon. 
p4330
aVLike when bipolarbear put fake anti-semitic posts on conspiracy under an alt and then tried to get people to upvote it on IRC so he could call conspiracy anti-semitic?
p4331
aVYeah, real classy.
p4332
aVThere's lots of nonsense on conspiracy, but most of the most egregious stuff is trolls.
p4333
aVSadly, there are usually some "jewish banker" posts lurking around.
p4334
aVYou can make it a self post and link to the images in the comments. 
p4335
aVCan we not get this investigated?
p4336
aVForwarded to the media? 
p4337
aV'We'?
p4338
aVEvery journalist I know uses Reddit.
p4339
aVI don't doubt that DM would stoop to false flags but I do struggle to believe that they would make it so obvious.
p4340
aVThis screenshot obviously doesn't provide any evidence and indeed only proper access to their servers would.
p4341
aVEven then it might simply be that they are not configured properly and someone figured that out.
p4342
aVsomeone pretending to be someone they're not to stir up animosity, say it ain't so /r/ukpolitics 
p4343
aVNothing new.
p4344
aVMI5 and various special police units have been pulling this honeypot crap for years and I am sure the newspapers have too.
p4345
aVPass it to the police
p4346
aVI'd suggest part of the problem is that it's just so easily believable that someone at the Mail would do this, just to stir up some more trouble.
p4347
aVI dont know enough about the web to know if this is true but i do know enough about the daily mail to suspect that it could be.
p4348
aVId like to see some concrete evidence or an explanation from someone in the know before i go on a witch hunt however im close to making an exception for a newspaper as disgusting and hateful as this. 
p4349
aVI like how many are going out of their way to explain away that DM is trying to start up trouble.
p4350
aVArguing about IP's and domains etc.
p4351
aVThe fact of the matter is that DM, someone who has access to their system, made a honeypot post.
p4352
aVThe entire debate around this event is totally trivial- there is so much damage control being attempted here it's not even funny.
p4353
aVBloody converts. 
p4354
aVWhat the actual fuck?
p4355
aVSo he hasn't worked there for 6 years and the daily mail has confirmed that it wasn't him who posted it, but don't lets let facts stand in the way of the witch hunt.
p4356
aVFucking disgusting, inciting racist hatred so they can sell newspapers.
p4357
aVA scumbag newspaper.
p4358
aVMuslims aren't a race.
p4359
aVIt's religious discrimination as a token for ethnic discrimination.
p4360
aVThere's plenty of white Muslims in the UK (e.g.
p4361
aVmy sister-in-law and her husband), but I'd be surprised if that was the picture in your head when someone says "Muslim".
p4362
aVRacism can be defined as discrimination based on cultural practices rather than an ethnic or racial grouping.
p4363
aVAnything can be defined as anything, it doesn't make it correct.
p4364
aVThis leftist attempt to redefine racism to include whatever they want is ill advised at best.
p4365
aVRacism, as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary\u000a\u000ahttp://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/racism\u000a\u000a1.
p4366
aVThe belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races\u000a\u000a2.
p4367
aVPrejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one\u2019s own race is superior\u000a\u000a
p4368
aVThere is the argument that language is fluid and definitions and meanings change over time and the meaning of the term 'racism' depends upon the context in which it is used.
p4369
aVA fuzzy definition doesn't make it incorrect either.\u000a\u000a 
p4370
aVSaying that "Racism" can mean discrimination based on anything other than race is quite frankly stupid.
p4371
aVIt has the word "race" in it, it can't get much more obvious than that.
p4372
aVThis is why context is important.
p4373
aVRace as a social construction expands the definition beyond biological racial differences to include social, political and cultural differences that overlap and intersect.
p4374
aVUse defines meaning.
p4375
aVI'll take the legal definition over the OED.
p4376
aVSo since the legal definition of rape means women cannot rape men, you accept that's the "real" definition?
p4377
aVYou have confused the signifier for the signified.
p4378
aVI'm not taking the legal definition _just because_ it's the legal definition, but because the legal definition happens to line up with what people commonly mean when they talk about racist acts, racist speech and racially aggravated crimes.
p4379
aVThe amount of things that are called "racist" these days doesn't help your idea that just because something is what people "commonly mean" that makes it the right definition.
p4380
aVThis is just SO FALSE.
p4381
aVThere is no legal definition of rape that actually excludes females from being convicted of rape.
p4382
aVI'm guessing you've never heard of statutory rape?
p4383
aVOr maybe you never even bothered to think of female child predators.
p4384
aVI suggest you do a simple google search for the demographics of rape convicts in America and realize that women do receive rape convictions.
p4385
aVhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1\u000a\u000a&gt;(1)A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014\u000a\u000a&gt;(a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,\u000a\u000a&gt;(b)B does not consent to the penetration, and\u000a\u000a&gt;(c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.
p4386
aVAccording to UK law, only a man can rape, and it's only rape if done with a penis.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p4387
aV&gt; This leftist attempt to redefine racism to include whatever they want is ill advised at best.
p4388
aVAnd the rightists attempt to distract from the actual point by pointing out someone incorrectly using of the word *'racism'* instead of *'bigotry'* is even more pathetic and serves only to make a further mockery of yourselves.\u000a\u000a
p4389
aVIt's hardly "distracting" from the point, it's clearing up what the point is.
p4390
aVAnd what it most definitely isn't.\u000a
p4391
aVIn the same way that if two policemen hunting for a missing child find a mysterious pool of blood, and one asks the other, "Is that pool of blood from the missing child?
p4392
aV" and the other replies "no, thank God.
p4393
aVIt's from some other child.
p4394
aVShall we call it a day?
p4395
aV"\u000a\u000a
p4396
aVThe difference is that by calling things racist that clearly aren't racist, you're watering down the term and making it meaningless, thus damaging the integrity of the word.
p4397
aVAll this means that the next time something genuinely racist is called it, nobody will believe it or care about it.
p4398
aVHardly the same as your analogy.
p4399
aVAre you saying that crimes committed against people because of the colour of their skin are worse than those committed against people of a particular religious, social or cultural group?
p4400
aVNo, I'm saying they're notably different.
p4401
aVHilarious.
p4402
aVDM literally creating stories.

p4404
aVIf there were any regulars posting things like that, the daily mail wouldn't need to make an account to invent it.
p4405
aVObviously they couldn't find any existing posts to screenshot 
p4406
aVThing is, it probably wouldn't be hard for the Daily Mail or anyone to find some questionable comments on there.
p4407
aVIt is a fairly right-wing forum.
p4408
aVSource: I'm banned from there.
p4409
aVWas there several years ago.
p4410
aVI don't know whether or not it has changed but there really are (were?

p4418
aVWhat I don't understand is how these people really believe these ideas.

aVI think you need to take another look mate.
p4420
aVAt the post, not the west.
p4421
aVThere you go OP's Image fixed http://imgur.com/lmqWohi
p4422
aVThat's just depressing.
p4423
aVHow can we call this a democracy when these are our options?
p4424
aVI know there's other parties like greens and pirates but they get a fraction of the campaign funding these guys do, and campaign funding = votes unfortunately.
p4425
aVStand for election.
p4426
aVYou'll soon find out it's a lot harder having to come up with answers than sitting on the sidelines and calling someone out for not having an answer.
p4427
aVThe European elections re held under PR so smaller parties have a much better chance than in Westminster elections.
p4428
aVPeople who don't like what the big parties have on offer should vote for the small party that's closest to their own views.
p4429
aVLeftUnity!
p4430
aVIndependence.

p4435
aVYep a crucifiction gets its followers!
p4436
aVIt's really true - the choice of leaders pushes you towards apathy.
p4437
aVI suppose you have to look at the policies and not the leaders, yet the inspiration still needs to be there and is sorely lacking.
p4438
aVIn terms of lying motherfuckers, sadly I'd trust Farage the most to tell the truth (not that this is saying much), and he's an extremely charismatic leader, just of the wrong party for me.
p4439
aV+1 Fantastic
p4440
aVPoliticians.
p4441
aVBleedin' obvious.....
p4442
aV2edgy4me
p4443
aVUKIP are in such a clever position.
p4444
aVAlmost any opposition to them and they can spin in as the 'establishment' running scared.
p4445
aVIt works well now but it's clearly unsustainable, I think they actually need to distance themselves from the Europe issue soon and make something else their focal point, otherwise what will they do after 2015 if we get a referendum?
p4446
aVJust slowly die out like every other reactionary, one issue, party. 
p4447
aVThe problem is that the other parties have been criminally negligent in their framing of the current MEP election debate.
p4448
aVUKIP have tried to make it about whether we or not we are in Europe and stupidly every other party has fallen in to their frame by trying to defend Europe.
p4449
aVNow it's UKIP (with a unique selling point) vs every other party.
p4450
aVOne party on one side of the argument vs many parties splitting their votes on the other.
p4451
aVThe argument should never have been about whether we are in Europe!
p4452
aVIt's about what our MEP's do in Europe for the next 3-5 years!
p4453
aVCommon energy policy, reform, financial development etc.
p4454
aVThat's what the other parties should have talked about, UKIP should have been laughed out the door and not even engaged with over these elections.
p4455
aVHasn't Farage already said he is quitting one way or another after 2017 (referendum win, loss or none at all)?
p4456
aVThat is pretty much the end of the party.
p4457
aVDemographics are against a long term UKIP.
p4458
aVThis is their day in the sun and either their victory or their eternal defeat.
p4459
aVThey won't get another chance at a vote for another decade at which point there'll be no real chance of a win.
p4460
aVI think Nigel Farage has even admitted that the most popular attraction to UKIP is not its political stance on Europe, but rather its policies towards immigration.
p4461
aVThat's what draws in the punters.
p4462
aVAll I desire is a referendum on the EU.
p4463
aVI abhor political parties and I won't be voting for UKIP, simply because many points on their manifesto are so disagreeable to me and a large proportion of the British public.
p4464
aV&gt; simply because many points on their manifesto are so disagreeable to me and a large proportion of the British public\u000a\u000aLike what?
p4465
aVOne of the main sticking points for me, concerning their policies, is that UKIP have an unabashed agenda to heavily invest support and money into fracking and nuclear power projects.
p4466
aVIn comparison to other political groups, they are diametrically opposed bringing future benefits to this country in terms of renewable energy.
p4467
aVSecondly, their suggestion for a flat tax rate, wealthy or poor, might be fair, but I don't think it's popular or applicable.
p4468
aVUKIP make claims, like the Tories, that Britain is still a Christian nation, and they allude and insinuate that legislation should not always be secular in its implementation.
p4469
aVThe homosexual marriage debate recently brought this matter to focus.
p4470
aVThere are many other points, and whilst I'm not sure whether UKIP has a formal, defined manifesto yet, this is what Nigel Farage and other UKIP members state to be largely representative of the party line.
p4471
aVI agree, I'm 100% pro-Europe, practically a European Federalist but we need a referendum and let Britain decide.
p4472
aVInterestingly, whilst I'm no UKIP supporter, I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum and will certainly vote in favour of secession.
p4473
aVCentralisation and the gradual destruction of national sovereignty is a factor that I cannot lend my hand to aid.
p4474
aVI agree with you that Britain should be given the chance to decide.
p4475
aVI was not born when such decisions were made, yet it was a measure that is still affecting our lives in numerous ways.
p4476
aVIt's been around 40 years since the last popular decision on the matter.
p4477
aVEven those who voted then were deceitfully entangled in a political union when they only wanted a limited, economic one.
p4478
aVDon't get me wrong the current EU is not what I want the European Union to be but hopefully this may change for the better.
p4479
aVI wasn't born to, we're allowed to vote for our politicians so why can't we vote to leave a Union we had no say in.
p4480
aVIf we ever get a referendum on the issue I'll vote yes, and in the event we as a country decide to leave I'll accept that 
p4481
aVSounds similar to what Fox News do.
p4482
aVAnti establishment my arse... rich folks on tv all the time, how is that anti establishment?
p4483
aVThey are all over our screens... pretending they stand for the common man but want to raise our taxes and lower the rich's... pro-fracking and anti global warming racist homophobic cunts.
p4484
aVThey are the establishment, followed by blind voters who know nothing of their other policies.
p4485
aVHow can the working class vote for UKIP is beyond me.
p4486
aVFuck UKIP to hell.
p4487
aVWhere?
p4488
aVI was on the way to Islington Mill.
p4489
aVIt might even be considered Salford.
p4490
aVI don't know the area to well
p4491
aVI wonder who's looked at this NOT thought 'why is he singled out?
p4492
aV' I'm no fan, but I don't rate the other three much better, tho they could all use a gag at times.
p4493
aVYou get this sort of abuse towards Farage because some people just do not want to take the time to evaluate the political situation.
p4494
aVIt's fun to call someone racist or whatever because it means you get to write funny messages or send shit in a box to someone free of charge.
p4495
aVIf someone disagrees with UKIP's policies, there is nothing wrong with that at all and it is understandable, but slander and abuse is just ridiculous.
p4496
aVYou get this sort of abuse towards Nigel Farage - and more importantly, UKIP - because the vast majority of this country will stand up to fascism.
p4497
aVIt isn't just a case of calling the racism card for fun, because there have been too many cases from the UKIP party those standing for election have broadcast views with clearly racist, or homophobic, overtones.
p4498
aVSerious question: how long do we continue to ignore \u000a\u000aAnd "evaluate the political decision"?
p4499
aVI think you'll find that anyone who has bothered to "evaluate the political decision" can quite clearly see that Europe really is not the issue. 
p4500
aVIf the country is willing to "stand up to fascism"  then shouldn't that give UKIP a better chance?
p4501
aVSeriously ridiculous how so many people on a politics based Reddit have such a poor knowledge or delusion with politics itself.
p4502
aVTo me, I'd suggest it's a combination of him being 'the new boy', him rising too fast, 'tall dandelion syndrome' I think it's called, that if anyone is too successful too quickly, people want to knock them down, and just the fact that people high up in politics get called called names daily, it's part of the job.
p4503
aVThat and 'Europe and immigrants are bad' seems to be his entire platform.
p4504
aVThey're all lying motherfuckers
p4505
aVSurprised Clegg didn't get one of his own. 
p4506
aVIntolerance. 
p4507
aVYou saw it in Salford, actually.
p4508
aVEdit: Possibly.
p4509
aVI'm sure they've done a good job plastering this over most of the bill boards in Manchester.
p4510
aVEdit II: were you at Sounds from the Other City, perchance?
p4511
aVThese kinds of childish stunts, like sending poo in the post, don't really do the liberal leftists any favours though... just makes people want to distance themselves from them
p4512
aVThe poo in the post was stupid, and I kind of hope they find who sent it and arrest them.
p4513
aVBut this?
p4514
aVGraffiti on a campaign poster.
p4515
aVThis is par for the course.
p4516
aVDo you remember the David Cameron shiny forehead poster?
p4517
aVWhy should UKIP be special and **not** get treated like this?
p4518
aVIf you can't stand the heat etc etc
p4519
aVDo you reckon they leaned over the envelope or put the poo in with their hands?
p4520
aVWas it a human poo?
p4521
aVI would have asked a friend with a cat.
p4522
aVWho says it was a leftist?
p4523
aVUKIP are probably taking more share of the Tory vote than anyone else's
p4524
aVIt's not very Conservative to send shit in the post. 
p4525
aVSays who?
p4526
aVI didn't realise your political views decide whether or not you like to send shit in the post.
p4527
aVI mean, it's not conservative.
p4528
aVa throwaway little pun.
p4529
aVBut seriously, who's more likely to send shit in the post to a right wing political party, the right or the left? 
p4530
aVHonestly, petty minded cruelty/petty evil is pretty common at both sides of the spectrum.
p4531
aVYeah, but if it was the British communist party which was sent shit in the post, no one on this sub would be saying it was a labour supporter who sent it. 
p4532
aVSure, but that's primarily because the split between the socialists and Labour is done and gone.
p4533
aVThere is no controversy, socialists/communists simply are not represented in any UK party at this time.
p4534
aV(Trade unionists still are, of course, sorta)\u000a\u000aUKIP are new and are still tightly associated with the BNP and other racist groups and people.
p4535
aVIf they keep up their attempts to distance themselves from the racists (and do a better job of screening them out) that should end eventually.
p4536
aVFor now the zeitgeist is that UKIP are racists trying to wear a veneer of respectability.
p4537
aVPutting shit in the post is less about political leaning and more about mental health.
p4538
aVIf I was to define it as anything, I'd argue it is Anarchism.
p4539
aVDo you regard anarchism as left wing or right? 
p4540
aVFar left.
p4541
aVAre you claiming anarchists are all mentally ill?
p4542
aVPeople with mental health issues come in all political colours, but, although there might be more amongst our ranks than in the general population (I've no idea, I've met a number of people with problems, but the vast majority exhibit nothing out of the ordinary range), that probably says much more about ableism and the impact of poverty and work stress on mental health than it does about my particular political philosophy.
p4543
aVTheoretically, not on the spectrum.
p4544
aVIn practice, they are the far left. 
p4545
aVI think with the resurgence of free market rhetoric in modern anarchism (such as Anarcho-Capitalism) things are changing, although I get the point you're trying to make.
p4546
aVCertainly things like black bloc are far left.
p4547
aV'Anarcho'-capitalism isn't anarchist, and I've never met one in real life in decades of activism.
p4548
aVWell, obviously not.
p4549
aVThey don't have any friends.
p4550
aVNow that's just mean!
p4551
aVliberal leftist is a bit of an oxymoron really
p4552
aVi'm being downvoted for this but i think it's worth pointing out the difference, because it's quite crucial: the people that inhabit the centre ground and parade as 'left' are anything but, of course those actually on the left uphold identity rights but actually also understand big picture thinking, are in support of nationalisations, public works programmes, basic income, a living wage, and broader public ownership not just in sectors like transport but wider economics, culture, etc.
p4553
aVthe idea that it is your fellow worker but with a different shade of skin that's at fault is contemptible and rejected.
p4554
aVfarage and ukip are demagogues who try to cloak themselves in some anachronistic image of being for the common man but are actually very much on the other side of the line, and fighting against the majority interest.
p4555
aVthey like to portray "the left" - as in some of the commentariat writing in the papers in a milquetoast manner, or this or that dr weakling of the labour party - as the same as economically and politically left principles but they really are not the same at all
p4556
aVYeah, I don't sense that Farage has any real urge to help 'the working man' as such, they seem to be very much a one policy party, and I'd be concerned to be voting that in.
p4557
aVThey could have a policy that states anyone over 60 will be recycled and broken down for parts for the NHS, and no-one would know because it seems no-one's looking for a manifesto, they just like the 'get out of Europe and chuck out the immigrants' rhetoric.
p4558
aVExactly, the more detailed they are on wider policy the more they can only lose votes.
p4559
aVEg.
p4560
aVsame-sex marriage, lots of current UKIP supporters who probably don't care but also lots who hate the idea.
p4561
aVOf course, all of that applies to every political party, which is why we're getting very few actual policies out of the Libs/Labour at moment.
p4562
aVI support your distinction between liberals and leftists - they tend to get conflated in the US as the US has had much less of a left since McCarthyism and after, so the right needed a new group to disparage.
p4563
aVHowever, to say leftists 'are in support of nationalisations', for example, is to ignore a whole tradition on the left, albeit the historically-smeared one since Baukunin had his spat with Marx and formed his own International, leaving the rest to screw up in the Soviet Union just as predicted... ;-)
p4564
aVwho's the guy on the end?
p4565
aV[deleted]
p4566
aVHow is there no topic?
p4567
aVSomeone has gone through the trouble to print the sticker and place the graffiti.
p4568
aVThe person doing it is obviously voicing their opinion.
p4569
aVMany people feel the same.
p4570
aVCrap comments will appear in any post.
p4571
aVWould you value the post more if it was a propaganda photo?
p4572
aVOr a link to an article in the guardian?  \u000a\u000a
p4573
aVIt seems very organised, so definitely politics....
p4574
aVIt has very little to do with real UK politics though and image posts are generally discouraged in this sub.
p4575
aVIf I were you I'd post it to /r/unitedkingdom - anyone who posts anything even vaguely anti-UKIP over there is getting gifted with Reddit Gold at the moment.
p4576
aV"real politics" - appears to just be what you agree with kipper. 
p4577
aVNot really, twat.\u000a\u000a
p4578
aVYour only backup to the idea it wasn't real politics is that some people don't like UKIP and a little moan about how UKIP only control one subreddit.
p4579
aVYou sure convinced me with your hot opinions. 
p4580
aVExcept I've said neither of those things, you cock.
p4581
aVYou've either confused me for someone else or you've constructed an elaborate straw man. 
p4582
aVRead your own comment hotshot.
p4583
aV&gt;not real politics\u000a\u000a&gt;post it in /r/uk\u000a\u000a&gt;they're anti ukip waaahhh
p4584
aVA picture of a defaced poster is not in any way real politics.
p4585
aVAnd picture posts are also discouraged here.
p4586
aVBitch all you like, I am correct on both points.
p4587
aVAnd he took my advice, by the way, since it has been widely observed that someone is rewarding anti-UKIP posts with gold.
p4588
aVMaybe if you weren't so busy trying to suck your own cock, you'd have noticed too.
p4589
aVIf it was worthless it wouldn't have got upvoted.
p4590
aVThe beauty of reddit :)
p4591
aVYou must be joking
p4592
aVJust because it is worthless to you doesn't make it worthless to other people. 
p4593
aVAgreed, no one wants stupid meme shit or 'oh look how political this dumb graffiti is im so progressive in society'
p4594
aVYou know it's not illegal to freepost UKIP a brick or three. 
p4595
aVThey (Royal Mail specifically) cancelled their free post and even before sending bricks didn't cost them money, freepost doesn't apply to anything bigger than an envelope so they were just undelivered.
p4596
aVCongratulations on trying though, really mature.
p4597
aVThanks for letting me know before I headed down to my local Post Office with a wheelbarrow full of bricks.
p4598
aVMy, there would have been egg on my face then, wouldn't there?
p4599
aVI couldn't possibly have been making a throwaway comment based on the online 'what did you send to UKIP?
p4600
aV' trending I've been seeing on social media.
p4601
aVI'm glad you didn't just think that and leave me to waste my time.
p4602
aVGood save!
p4603
aVThat's not only vandalism, but also potentially exposing small children to inappropriate language.
p4604
aVJust because he doesn't agree with UKIP doesn't mean he's allowed to act in such a despicable manner.
p4605
aVNow I'm going to get downvoted by the anti-UKIP brigade.
p4606
aVI'm not even showing support for UKIP.
p4607
aVIf this was done to any party's poster I would take offence.
p4608
aVEDIT: For fuck's sake, downvote means *irrelevant to the topic*, not *I disagree*.
p4609
aVDo you remember when you were 7?
p4610
aVI do.
p4611
aVWe were the most foulmouthed motherfuckers on the planet when adults weren't around. 
p4612
aV[deleted]
p4613
aVYou lived a very sheltered life.
p4614
aVI don't live a sheltered life at all.
p4615
aVHowever, I feel it isn't appropriate to use profanity in public, as to some, it is offensive, and I respect their opinions.
p4616
aVKids don't know what to look out for.
p4617
aVIn the event that they can work out how to pronounce this they aren't going to notice/remember it any more than they are the name "Clear Channel".
p4618
aVThey don't know it's rude until you tell them.
p4619
aVI discovered earlier the village where I work has a UKIP billboard up.
p4620
aVIt's the one about border controls with a picture of an escalator.
p4621
aVAny thoughts on how I can deface it?
p4622
aVIf in doubt, Hitler moustache on Farage.
p4623
aVOr modifying the UKIP logo to look like Hitler (fringe, moustache, black spraypaint).
p4624
aVIt's probably the easiest way of doing it.
p4625
aV...Or, y'know- you could go and campaign for a party other than those tits.
p4626
aVThey're all *begging* for people to go and volunteer at the moment- go ahead and try it!
p4627
aVIt's a nice experience, if nothing else.
p4628
aVPaint your name in bright letters across Farage.
p4629
aVThat'll teach those working class UKIP swine for wanting to control immigration or return democracy to us.
p4630
aVFascist scum!
p4631
aVSlow down a second.
p4632
aVAlthough I feel like we're on the same boat politically, this kind of response only really hinders the lefty cause.
p4633
aVDefacing political billboards, no matter how wretched they are, is a step back from democracy, and your comment generalising the supporters as "working class swines" is pretty extraneous, and really shouldn't be the view to adopt as a libertarian.
p4634
aVBranding them as "fascist scum" , isn't a good way to go about it either, as although many of the policies on the UKIP agenda are unquestionably radical and backwards, throwing the "f" bomb around  only incites unrest among the bastards.
p4635
aVThe kippers love to play the "I'm a lefty, and therefore I am morally superior" jape, and your frankly irrational response only contributes to that stereotype.
p4636
aVLets fight off the kippers together as liberals, and not become them along the way.
p4637
aV&gt; or return democracy to us.
p4638
aV*eye roll*
p4639
aVAs a word of notice, after looking through this prick's recent comments you can see that he himself is in fact a kipper.
p4640
aVI pointed out that he was hindering the lefty cause, but I think I failed to realise that he's doing it on purpose.
p4641
aVThis is guy is the worst manipulative scumbag I've ever fucking seen.
p4642
aVShame on you, you complete and utter cunt.
p4643
aVSome of you commenters really enjoy being swayed by baseless vandalism like this.
p4644
aVBeing against UKIP seems to be the trendy, progressive thing right now.
p4645
aVNo one my age seems to know or care what they stand for, It's sickening.
p4646
aVOf course being against UKIP is the progressive thing because UKIP are an antiquated, out of date party who belong in the isolationist and imperialist pre-war era.
p4647
aVNationalism is never a good thing.
p4648
aVEver. 
p4649
aVWanting to trade with the whole world is not isolationist.
p4650
aVThe EU is the imperial power expanding into places like Ukraine here, not UKIP.
p4651
aVSome old concepts, such as sovereignty and self determination are good and worthwhile.
p4652
aV&gt; No one my age seems to know or care what they stand for, It's sickening.
p4653
aVI'm 22, poor, unemployed.
p4654
aVI'd rather vote Conservative than UKIP, and I loath the Tories.
p4655
aVI'm gay as well - no fucking chance UKIP are getting my vote.
p4656
aVThey are even more homophobic than the Tories which is quite the achievement.
p4657
aVUKIP are simply a primitive and predictable reaction to economic and social unrest.
p4658
aVThat's all they stand for.
p4659
aVThey're nothing new, they're a tale as old as time.
p4660
aVEvery time the economy collapses no matter when or where, some right wing nationalist party swoops in saying they're going to save the day by appealing to emotional issues, established prejudices and easy scape goats that people can latch onto without providing any actual policies or economic plans, just trumpet some empty patriotic rhetoric about "returning the country to its former glory" and all sorts of devious crap.
p4661
aV"Can't find work?
p4662
aVBlame the immigrants!
p4663
aV"\u000a\u000a"Business on the verge of banktrupcy?
p4664
aVBlame the EU!
p4665
aV" \u000a\u000a"Getting old and disillusioned?
p4666
aVBlame the Muslims!
p4667
aV" \u000a\u000aEasy scape goats you can point your finger at to blame for your crappy life, despite being a total distraction.
p4668
aVIt's just the UK's version of Golden Dawn, a party full of right wing psychopaths tricking the people into thinking they're "of the people, for the people" when in fact all they care about is satisfying their meglomaniacal desires and cleansing their society of [insert hated group here].
p4669
aVDon't be fooled - they don't give a single shit about you.
p4670
aVYou only need to look at the glassy eyed Farage and his insidious smile to see that this man is a snake who you simply cannot trust, he is your classic "charming psychopath"; a grinning cheshire cat that says what you want to hear until he's earned your trust and then cuts your throat from behind.
p4671
aVDo you honestly think UKIP will do *any* good?
p4672
aVYou really think putting a cap on immigration will make ANY difference to your life at all?
p4673
aVYou honestly think leaving the EU will make ANY difference to your life at all?
p4674
aVNo.
p4675
aVNothing will change except we'll have no more human rights inspectors and that insideous snake Farage will be left in charge to wreak 4 years of absolute incompetent havoc which is the LAST thing the country needs during a recession.
p4676
aVHe'll be our very own Tony Abbot.
p4677
aVSeriously if you want the country to go *completely* down the shitter - vote UKIP.
p4678
aVIn fact I kind of hope UKIP get in power, because I know for a fact after 6 months have passed and none of their promises have been delivered and people realize that immigrants and the EU actually have fuck all to do with their problems they will very quickly sober up and realize what a horrific mistake they made in their hysterical episode of temporary psychosis.
p4679
aVUKIP will bring nothing but disaster, incompetence, embarassment and further social unrest.
p4680
aVFarage will sell this country down the river in every way possible and once he's lined his pockets he'll piss off and you will never hear from him again. \u000a
p4681
aVYou seem to enjoy talking a lot, but in actual fact you are saying nothing.
p4682
aVThe sad thing is that you've probably acquired a lot of upvotes just for using dramatic buzzwords and throwing in a load of rhetorical yet loaded questions.
p4683
aVYou're just presenting ideas which you obviously care about, but ultimately letting them fall short:\u000a\u000a&gt;"Getting old and disillusioned?
p4684
aVBlame the Muslims!
p4685
aV"\u000a\u000aPlease direct me as to where in the UKIP manifesto Muslims, and specifically Muslims, are singled out - Oh no wait, you can't.
p4686
aVFind the UKIP manifesto, ctrl+f 'racism'.
p4687
aVYou won't find it.
p4688
aVIn fact I don't believe there is anything alluding to it (only say that because I think the manifesto is getting an overhaul BECAUSE of the 'devilish snakes' or whatever you were spouting).
p4689
aVPlease refer to the fact that UKIP and BNP are different parties.
p4690
aV&gt;bring nothing but disaster, incompetence, embarassment\u000a\u000a&gt;Farage will sell this country down the river\u000a\u000a&gt;and all sorts of devious crap\u000a\u000a&gt;[Using obviously fake quotes]\u000a\u000a&gt;Fascism\u000a\u000aAll lovely melodrama, but no substance.
p4691
aVIf you really wanted to make a real point you could've said, for example: "Throughout modern history, from The National Front to BNP and their continued failure, racism has never been popular in this country and will always be frowned upon.
p4692
aVTherefore UKIP's focus on immigration upsets a lot of people and their tightening on the border leads me to believe that they are against foreign people".
p4693
aVThis is a fair statement when observing a party, however can you deny that mass immigration has been a highly talked about issue?
p4694
aVIn a democratic country, can you deny the voice of a lot of people who at least want some kind of closure on the subject?
p4695
aVNo matter what someone is saying they deserve fair debate and understanding to what they want to say.
p4696
aVWhether you agree or disagree, using buzzwords, vandalism, blood and feces fundamentally goes against what this country stands for.
p4697
aVFreedom of speech goes both ways.
p4698
aVPeople are worried about the country, they have a *right* to vote for who they want.
p4699
aVYou can calmly and maturely present facts as to how they may be wrong, or you can draw up a caricature about how Farage is the devil and how he is obviously burning immigrants at the stake.
p4700
aVThat is your choice, but I think we all know which is fair.
p4701
aVBy the way, I respect your political views completely.
p4702
aVHowever I don't like ignorance.
p4703
aV"I do not agree" is all that needs to be said sometimes.
p4704
aVLooks like a spur of the moment bit of graffiti.
p4705
aV/s
p4706
aVA speech bubble with a choice quote would've been better.
p4707
aVAs it stands, it's more than a little trite.
p4708
aVIs that Farage on the right?
p4709
aV[Higher resolution image](http://blog.solopress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ukip-election-poster-your-daily-grind.jpg) (It isn't Farage)\u000a\u000a\u000aMay I ask someone who is more knowledgeable on the subject, isn't Farage a MEP too?
p4710
aVI'm not implying that he shouldn't be one if he wants to leave the EU, as it can help him achieve his goal I suppose, but doesn't he also get a portion of that 55 million a day'?
p4711
aVYes, he's been an MEP since 1999.
p4712
aVHis expenses are the subject of an ongoing scandal.
p4713
aVHis response is basically that he doesn't give a shit, and he'll milk the EU for all it's worth and remain as unaccountable as legally possible.
p4714
aVSo... by the standards of his own campaign ad, he is a 'eurocrat'.
p4715
aVYes, and he has no qualms that he wants himself fired, he just wants the rest of the MEPs to be fired along with him.
p4716
aVFarage behaves exactly as every other MEP behaves, except he and a few others (not all UKIP) are honest about it and call the others out on it.
p4717
aVThat sounds very hypocritical; Farage behaves like those he is against, but he's just honest about it.
p4718
aVThis doesn't really make him a better person does it?
p4719
aVIt's not hypocritical.
p4720
aVHe actively says that his actions are bad, but he's allowed to do them because the rules are bad - rules which he spends every waking hour trying to abolish.
p4721
aVFarage is a man who wants his own job cut, but in the mean time he's willing to milk it for all he can whilst showing everyone what he - and by extension everyone else - is able to do within such a corrupt organisation.
p4722
aVThat's not a very moral way of doing it.
p4723
aVThat would be the same as an MP avoiding taxes using offshore bank accounts, to raise awareness of how bad the law is and that the loop holes exist.
p4724
aVHe would be allowed to do it, it's legal, it just isn't right of him to do so, especially in his position.
p4725
aVTbf, he tried raising awareness of it from outside the system and nobody listened.
p4726
aVNow he's doing it from within the system and all you can say is "well how immoral of him".
p4727
aVThe fact you now care it's happening at all is probably a success as far as he's concerned.
p4728
aVIf you don't like the way the EU parliament works, start voting UKIP cos they're the only ones campaigning to do anything about it.
p4729
aV&gt;and all you can say is "well how immoral of him"\u000a\u000aWell, speaking solely on my behalf, I am young and haven't been following politics for very long yet.
p4730
aVFarage has been leader of UKIP since 2006, that's 8 years.
p4731
aVMost people under 25 would not have really followed politics 8 years ago, so it's unfair to say that I only care about what he is doing now.
p4732
aVHowever it is true that he is raising awareness, obviously.
p4733
aVYet I still don't think it is the right way to go about it.
p4734
aVIt may be an easier way to get heard, but not necessarily the better way. \u000a
p4735
aVWell, at the end of the day there's nothing anyone can really do to stop him lol.
p4736
aVIf he's within the rules, he's within the rules.
p4737
aVAny attempt to change the rules would be a huge breakthrough for him, so really he can't lose.
p4738
aVSo you're fine with corporations like Starbucks avoiding tax, because they're technically within the rules?
p4739
aVThis would only make sense as an argument against Farage if Starbucks where trying to raise awareness of tax avoidence in large corporations and would like to change laws to have it stopped.
p4740
aVGood point.
p4741
aVYet I still find it hard to believe that Farage is doing the right thing by exploiting a system which he is meant to be working for.
p4742
aVWhat's hypocritical?
p4743
aVAre you asking for the definition of the word...?
p4744
aVIf not then I don't understand your question.
p4745
aVHe is criticizing other MEPs for the same thing he does, as far as I am aware.
p4746
aVThat's hypocritical.
p4747
aVIt would be hypocritical if he said "it's fine when I do it, just not anybody else".
p4748
aVIn reality he's saying "look how much I'm able to screw this corrupt system and stay within the rules, isn't it awful?".
p4749
aVHe spends most of the money he gets from it on campaigning to make it so you can't do it anymore. 
p4750
aVI find it hard to believe that he enjoys the luxuries of 66 thousand euros or however much it is per year that MEPs receive whilst thinking to himself, 'gosh, isn't it awful how I can receive all this money?
p4751
aVI sure am showing Westminster how bad the EU is'.
p4752
aVI'm sure he rationalises it by thinking that if it wasn't him, it would be somebody else.
p4753
aVPaying his German wife to work for him and then complaining that Europeans are stealing British jobs.
p4754
aVHe never really claims to be a good person
p4755
aVThis doesn't mean he suddenly has a free pass to do bad things.
p4756
aVYou shouldn't have to claim to be a good person, you should just do good things, it is expected.
p4757
aVEspecially if you intend to lead a country.
p4758
aVI think in terms of being prime minister I would prefer somebody who was right, instead of somebody who was good.
p4759
aVAdmitting to doing the same thing as others who don't admit it doesn't mean he is doing anything right though. \u000a\u000a
p4760
aVDownvotes for speaking the truth.
p4761
aVI suspect Nigel can not wait for the elections.
p4762
aVThe parliament is going to be full with anti EU MEP's from a host of nations soon.
p4763
aVThere is no scandal.
p4764
aVHe does not get paid anymore than anyone else or receive an allowance greater than anyone else.
p4765
aVIt is comical that people criticize him for taking the EU's money.
p4766
aVThe EU's money?
p4767
aVThe money comes from the UK government and from their people. 
p4768
aVYeah, I got downvoted so hard in this thread that I'm stuck on a 10 minute cooldown between comments now...\u000a\u000a*sigh*
p4769
aVPeople don't seem to understand.
p4770
aVUKIP are currently polling at 30 percent.
p4771
aVThat means at least 30 percent of people don't want to be in the EU.
p4772
aVBut the UK does not get a 30 percent discount towards their EU bill.
p4773
aVThey still have to pay the same amount.
p4774
aVWhere is the representation of that 30 percent?
p4775
aVThey have to pay to be a member of a club they don't want to be a part of.
p4776
aVQuite rightly Nigel and UKIP spend the money that also comes from this 30 percent on giving them representation. 
p4777
aVTerrible argument.
p4778
aVThere are groups of people who don't want welfare, taxes, a military, nationalised services, etc.
p4779
aVand they don't have a choice either.
p4780
aVIt's not possible for everyone to have exactly what they want unless we split the UK in 70 million different countries.
p4781
aVNo it isn't.
p4782
aVWelfare, taxes, military and nationalized services are necessary.
p4783
aVThe EU is not.
p4784
aVYou are confusing yourself.
p4785
aVThe portion of money used by anti EU MEP's is tiny.
p4786
aVTiny in comparison to total spend and the percentage of people they represent. 
p4787
aVThat doesn't make any sense.
p4788
aVI could just as easily say that the EU is necessary, or that welfare or taxes or the military or anything else are not necessary. 
p4789
aV&gt; Welfare, taxes, military and nationalized services are necessary.
p4790
aVThe EU is not.
p4791
aVThat's ... an opinion.
p4792
aVYou can state it as if it were fact, of course, but it isn't.
p4793
aVWhether the EU is necessary is in the eye of the beholder - much like whether nationalized services are necessary is in the eye of the beholder (ask any libertarian).\u000a\u000a
p4794
aVIn the current economic, societal and global climate they are necessary for the UK.
p4795
aVThe EU is not.
p4796
aVIt isn't a matter of opinion. 
p4797
aVHis response is that the money he's being given is an allowance - it's essentially his pay for being an MEP, and that he's entitled to do as he wishes with it, which he's already stated is funding of political activity.
p4798
aVI'm sure there's plenty of other MEP's that use their allowance for giant TV's and all that crap.
p4799
aVIt's ridiculous that this is even a 'scandal'.  
p4800
aVWhich seems acceptable enough to me The part that doesn't really make sense is how he criticizes the other MEPs for the same thing.
p4801
aVMate I think you've stumbled onto the wrong board, only UKIP bashing is allowed here.
p4802
aVTIL entire threads of 'can't barrage the Farage' is 'UKIP bashing'.
p4803
aVThat was a /pol/ raid.
p4804
aVA few of them have stuck around, but overall anything positive to say about UKIP is met with negativity on this board.
p4805
aVAlso look at all the top threads right now, all of them are negative spin/opinion articles from the Guardian...
p4806
aVI would say UKIP supporters are a loud minority on here.
p4807
aV&gt;anything positive to say about UKIP is met with negativity on this board\u000a\u000aThat is because people have differing opinions!
p4808
aVI can't stress this enough.
p4809
aVYou cannot moan about someone having a different opinion than you.
p4810
aVThere is also negativity against labour and conservative supporters.
p4811
aVThis board is made up of a LOT of people, isn't it obvious that they have opposing views from eachother?
p4812
aVI wouldn't even call UKIP a minority on this board.
p4813
aVEvery thread has vocal posters, who all support different parties.
p4814
aVThere is nothing wrong with someone supporting UKIP or Labour, or whoever else they want to.
p4815
aVThere is also nothing wrong with people debating a point and disagreeing.
p4816
aVStop acting like your an oppressed minority, you're not.
p4817
aV&gt; I would say UKIP supporters are a loud minority on here.
p4818
aVThen again, they're a loud minority in the country overall as well.\u000a\u000a
p4819
aVStop acting like a victim.
p4820
aVAlmost every thread on this sub has UKIP supporters bashing others, and others bashing UKIP.
p4821
aVSome people on this subreddit hate UKIP - this doesn't suddenly make it a circlejerk.
p4822
aVSome hate Labour, some hate Conservatives.
p4823
aVThe same thing happens everywhere in the real world.
p4824
aVHis post is upvoted to the top which kinda disproves your point...
p4825
aVHow does this disprove any part of my point about you, specifically you as an individual, not a ukip supporter, moaning about something that isn't true.
p4826
aVThe fact that someone has a different view from someone, even if that view is more popular than the others, does not mean they are bashing eachother.
p4827
aVIt is how any argument or debate works.
p4828
aVWell I guess he's counting downvotes among the bashing.
p4829
aVAnd I kind of agree: if all opinions of one side are downvoted into invisibility, that's a form of bashing.
p4830
aVPoint is, it's not always that way.
p4831
aVPlenty of UKIP supporters here, who upvote each other, and in many other discussions their comments remain well visible.
p4832
aVIt's just that this argument about Farage comfortably cashing in on the same expenses his party is decrying on campaign posters and claiming that he's doing so just to show how the EU lets you get away with really bad stuff, is particularly laughable, and that's why they're getting downvoted much more here than normally.
p4833
aVIdiot racists have feelings too you know.
p4834
aVBoo hoo!
p4835
aVI didn't realise there were still people that thought UKIP were racist.
p4836
aVOh well.
p4837
aVHow's 2010?
p4838
aVYeah.
p4839
aVNow we *know* they're racist.
p4840
aVAll voters for UKIP are racist?
p4841
aVAgainst what race?
p4842
aVgood question, I'd like to see it answered.
p4843
aVwhich race do I hate again?
p4844
aVmight have to call up UKIP to ask.
p4845
aV&gt; His expenses are the subject of an ongoing scandal.
p4846
aVThey really aren't if we are being honest.
p4847
aV&gt; His expenses are the subject of an ongoing scandal.
p4848
aVNot really m8\u000a\u000aThey don't even have a system of 'expenses' with MEPs.
p4849
aVWell, the £60,000 he claimed for his (rent-free!
p4850
aV) office seems to tell a different story.
p4851
aVNo it doesn't!
p4852
aVIt's an allowence, not an expense.
p4853
aVHe gets no more or less than any other MEP.
p4854
aVThe whole system is a fucking disgrace and Farage is one of only a handful of MEP's who are open about how much of a financial piss take the EU is.
p4855
aVYou don't 'claim' money in as an MEP.
p4856
aVYou get an allowance, the same as every other MEP, and you get a daily bonus when you clock in to the parliament.
p4857
aVHe is indeed an MEP and so does indeed receive a portion of the £55m.
p4858
aVWhich was kind of the whole point of the joke...*whoosh*
p4859
aVMost people only consider the eurocrats to be bureaucrats within the administration of the European Union and not the MEPs themselves.\u000a
p4860
aVThe ones that sign in every day are the ones that maximise their pay.
p4861
aVUKIP MEPs use the money for the campaign to get out of EU.
p4862
aVexactly, and he's saying that it's wrong
p4863
aVBy enjoying the luxuries of 84,000 euros.
p4864
aV"I'm the turkey voting for Christmas"\u000a\u000aAnd enjoying it by spending it campaigning to leave the EU.
p4865
aVWhich his voters want him to do, and it is public money.
p4866
aVIsn't that the point of democracy.
p4867
aVi really don't see the problem 
p4868
aVThe far right?
p4869
aVTitle would be accurate attached to a picture of any ukip advert. 
p4870
aVAha
p4871
aVLooks forunate.
p4872
aV2 for the price of 1. 
p4873
aV...plus added free publicity.
p4874
aVwhat one is the UKIP ad?
p4875
aV*Which one is the UKIP ad?
p4876
aVHowever these tents are fantastic, really sturdy and seem really durable considering there blow up.
p4877
aVHaha this hilarious.
p4878
aVHa ha that's brilliant.
p4879
aVIt's the wrong ad.
p4880
aVIt'd work if it was the one warning about immigration.
p4881
aVAn associative joke, between "Poles" (short for Polish) and UKIP, right?
p4882
aVThe association of what?
p4883
aVThat UKIP are against Polish people?
p4884
aVWhich would be absurd and I would like it pointed out where exactly it's stated.
p4885
aVOh, wait...
p4886
aVIt isn't.
p4887
aVBut y'know, "I get the joke, it's so funny.
p4888
aVUKIP are w-w-wacist.
p4889
aV" And yes, oh look it's on the right, I best make jokes to a political spectrum which states that all UKIP voters are on the right.
p4890
aVWell, har-dee-dar.
p4891
aVI think whoever did laugh at it just asserted their bias and ignorance, that is that UKIP are "racist and right wing".
p4892
aVIsn't one of the primary reasons UKIP are anti EU the massive influx of economic migrants from countries such as Poland?
p4893
aVSo in other words "no need for poles (taking our jobs!)?
p4894
aVIt's hardly an absurd joke when it's associated with one of their main arguments.
p4895
aVPrimary, yes probably the anti-EU sentiment.
p4896
aVMass immigration coupled with limitless borders (with little influence or control by your own government), yes probably.
p4897
aVI said the association that, some people could take from it, that UKIP are against Polish people, is absurd.
p4898
aVNo need for Poles, taking our jobs?
p4899
aVThat does not sound like UKIP.
p4900
aVSo, in others words - no.
p4901
aV&gt; No need for Poles, taking our jobs?
p4902
aVThat does not sound like UKIP.
p4903
aVThat sounds *exactly* like UKIP.
p4904
aVThen prove it if you see the association so clearly.
p4905
aVI'm not arguing against differing opinion.
p4906
aVThe same old rhetoric does not get anywhere.
p4907
aVAt least the other poster, almodozo, was so thoughtful as to quote specifically where they found this association.
p4908
aVI have better things to spend my Sunday on and I'm only on my phone, but [here]( http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26376026) are quite a few statements that could easily be summed up with the above. 
p4909
aVThanks.
p4910
aVAn article primarily discussing mass immigration.
p4911
aVSo, 'Poles taking our jobs'...\u000a\u000a"While UKIP supported migrants coming to the UK to fill specific jobs - where there were skills shortages..."\u000a\u000a"...he said economic problems in the eurozone meant the influx of low-skilled labour to the UK was likely to accelerate and questioned the social and cultural impact it had had..."\u000a\u000a"...He also said UKIP would not work with the Front National, the French far-right party, saying its politics was based on "race and religion" and that it was "unreformable".
p4912
aV"\u000a\u000aThis is not against Polish people, it advocates away from race in relation to immigration policy change (because it has nothing to do with race) and it discusses supporting immigration towards specific industries with skill shortages (this does not discriminate to races or nationalities).
p4913
aV'Poles taking out jobs' does not sound like UKIP in the presented article, in my opinion.
p4914
aVGosh a Ukip supporter acting all offended by that harmless joke!
p4915
aVIt's political correctness gone mad!
p4916
aVI'm not offended by the joke, I'm offended by the associations.
p4917
aVI didn't say you didn't have a right to the joke, nothing PC about it.
p4918
aVOh, people can have opposing opinions to jokes?
p4919
aVYes.
p4920
aVOffended or harmless?
p4921
aVBoth perceptual, like many political jokes.
p4922
aVI laugh at some of the Farage photos taking the piss out of him, I actually find that funny.
p4923
aVYour writing style intrigues me.
p4924
aVIt forces me to read what you write in a really weird way such that I can barely understand what you are saying.
p4925
aVIt's almost like how a politician speaks.
p4926
aVIt's all the double negatives: "I **didn't** say you **didn't** have a right to the joke, **nothing** PC about it.
p4927
aV"
aVhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuStsFW4EmQ
p4928
aVI did not say... [that you] did not have a right to [laugh at, support] the joke.
p4929
aVIn relation to: "acting all offended, political correctness gone mad".
p4930
aV[There is nothing] PC (Politically Correct) about [my statement].
p4931
aVThe poster implied that I was pushing political correctness and I stated I was not.
p4932
aVIt might be the way I communicate, I tend to skip "the" a lot too.
p4933
aVIf it's illegible, let me know.
p4934
aVWell, I'm not a politician.
p4935
aVI'm a Paramedic.
p4936
aVLookout everyone we've got a badass over here.
p4937
aVHey don't knock paramedics, paramedics are fantastic.
p4938
aV&gt; offended by the associations\u000a\u000aIf you don't want to be offended by UKIP being associated with racism, best not associate yourself with a racist party.
p4939
aVCircular logic, it requires the perception that UKIP is racist in the first place.
p4940
aVI do not know of any UKIP member or policy that is against Polish people.
p4941
aVMaybe you would like to propose a new party?
p4942
aVOr convince me?
p4943
aVOr, as I guess, you've just came along to nitpick.
p4944
aVEnjoy your upvotes.
p4945
aV&gt;The association of what?
p4946
aVThat UKIP are against Polish people?
p4947
aVWell, not against Polish people per se - I'm sure the UKIP is fine with Polish people as long as they live in Poland.
p4948
aVIt's rather the association between the tent ad's "No Poles Required" and the UKIP's stance [against mass immigration from Poland](https://www.facebook.com/TheUKIP/posts/331833046912623) and its criticism of Polish immigrants, which it [accuses of refusing to integrate](http://www.cambstimes.co.uk/news/ukip_leader_nigel_farage_speaks_out_about_immigration_in_peterborough_1_1995599).
p4949
aVSo not all that far-fetched really.
p4950
aVThanks for answering a couple of my questions.
p4951
aVI see the association there, from that standpoint.
p4952
aVI still disagree, though, on some key points.
p4953
aVUKIP have a general stance against mass immigration, and as expected that applies across the spectrum.
p4954
aVIt is not particular to a set group of people who belong to a certain nationality.
p4955
aVI think the second link associates Governmental problems with immigration the way it is currently designed and implemented.
p4956
aVFor instance, it is arguable that the points made were directed towards: isolation and solitude-like societies, rapid alteration in communities not accustomed to the change (which could bring divides within communities) and discrimination for not speaking Polish, in a British town for a British factory job (which some would say was not acceptable).
p4957
aVI do not fully agree with the last point, if that is the interpretation that the writer or Farage was trying to make.
p4958
aVThat said, it is a workplace, you would think there would be a general lean towards speaking English.
p4959
aVAnyhow, the association that UKIP are against Polish people, on that premise, therefore I still believe is far-fetched (as also, this applies to being racist and right wing).
p4960
aVFor example you could pick out a number of EU countries with limitless immigration to Britain and probably get similar answers, that does not show racism, it shows an argument against mass immigration.
p4961
aV&gt; For example you could pick out a number of EU countries with limitless immigration to Britain and probably get similar answers, that does not show racism, it shows an argument against mass immigration.
p4962
aVSure, it's just that Farage has singled out Polish immigration/immigrants for criticism - for obvious reasons, because Poles are one of the main new group of immigrants, and I assume the single largest one.
p4963
aVSo while the juxtaposition would have been funny if it had said "No Romanians required" too, it wouldn't work with "No Spanish required", even though quite a few Spanish people have gone to try their luck in Britain too in the face of the crisis there.
p4964
aVUnfortunately, tents don't have romanians to hold them up, just p/Poles.
p4965
aVI dare say you might be slightly overthinking the joke... All it really needs to work is that Farage has singled out Polish immigrants/immigration for criticism (regardless of whether that was for logical reasons or not), and that's obviously been true.
p4966
aVFair call.
p4967
aVWhen I worked for the BBC and we were first rolling out iPlayer, Anthony Rose (the was showing us various things about it, when a 500 error occurred.
p4968
aVThere, on the big screen, was a huge picture of the Queen with words to the effect "something has gone horribly wrong.
p4969
aV"\u000a\u000aAnthony was *not happy* and demanded that be removed immediately.
p4970
aVI don't know if it was an internal joke and was never supposed to be seen by the public (I don't think it was), but I thought it was pretty damned funny.
p4971
aVBeats their 'unofficial' election video, that's for sure. 
p4972
aVThey seem to have spelled 'second' incorrectly. 
p4973
aV2witty4me
p4974
aVWhat are they actually saying?
p4975
aVYou'd think they'd say second if they're asking you the voter to help them defeat Cameron.
p4976
aVBut they're not.
p4977
aVThey want a second term with him, or maybe Miliband, that's up to people who don't vote for them.
p4978
aVSo what is it saying then?
p4979
aVIt's a joke about Cameron ruling out a third term.
p4980
aVYou probably don't need to read too much into it.
p4981
aVCameron made the comment a while back that he would not run for a third term.
p4982
aVThis is just a joke in relation to that comment. 
p4983
aVCameron said the other week that he won't run a third time for the PM office. 
p4984
aVWhat an odd thing to pick them up on
p4985
aVHardly.
p4986
aVWell, they shouldn't be assuming he'll get a second term.
p4987
aVIt's their job to make sure he doesn't.
p4988
aVAlso, are they *against* him not wanting a third term?
p4989
aVI don't really get it.
p4990
aVThe message is regarding the fact Cameron recently revealed he would not serve a third term even if Conservatives were voted for office a third time in a row.
p4991
aVHe'd almost certainly leave just before the renewal date.
p4992
aVDoes anyone have a link for this?

aVTheir Labour economic policy one was better.
p5004
aVSome quality banter from the Liberal Democrats.
p5005
aVNow if only their policies were so good!
p5006
aVTheir policies are.
p5007
aVTheir PR, however, is non existent.
p5008
aVI'd say the policies are good, but actually following them is their weakpoint.
p5009
aVThen you need to learn more about politics, especially coalition politics.
p5010
aVI'm not talking about specifically the tuition fees.
p5011
aVTheir leaflets are full of promises that are clearly going to be empty.
p5012
aVI feel like since New Labour the whole idea of having a party with views somewhere between those of the Conservatives and of Labour is unnecessary.
p5013
aVI feel like all the Lib Dems serve to do now is make it harder for either of those parties to get a majority.  
p5014
aVGood.
p5015
aVThe last thing I want is either of them to have a free reign.  
p5016
aVTotally agree with you on the empty promises, that really turned me off them when they started talking about devolving Cornwall and Wales to the same degree as Scotland, and decriminalising most drugs.
p5017
aVIt's making promises about things that nobody really cares about changing.
p5018
aVYou mean things *you* don't care about?
p5019
aVI'm sure there are a lot of people who think *certain* drugs should be decriminalised.
p5020
aVVictimless crimes and all that.
p5021
aVGiven his flair, there doesn't seem to be much he *does* care about.
p5022
aVApathetic about politics, seeing as we're in a political subreddit, I thought it appropriate because I don't believe it really matters who's in power anymore.
p5023
aVI know it's a big reddit thing to believe that decriminilising drugs is the be all, end all, and including myself, I do believe that Cannabis and LSD should be decriminalised, however, ask the majority of the British population and they don't care for it, it's on the very bottom of their to do list about changing the countries laws.
p5024
aVWhere are you getting this from?
p5025
aVBecause these websites report differently.
p5026
aVhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/05/war-on-drugs-failed-decriminalise-illegal-use\u000a\u000ahttps://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3134/Public-attitudes-to-drugs-policy.aspx\u000a\u000ahttps://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/06/16/drugs-policies-dont-work/\u000a\u000aThey say more than half of the British pop are in favour of a drugs review.
p5027
aVThere are more sources but I think this makes my point.
p5028
aVAgain, who really cares that much that they really want government policy to change?
p5029
aVI'm sure people have for a good long time thought that drug policy is daft, there are only two people that I really know who are anti-drugs, I don't think I know of anyone who hasn't smoked Cannabis, but yet you don't see anyone saying it's important enough to change, **that's the point of what I'm saying**, **it's not important enough to change.
p5030
aV**
p5031
aVThe point I'm making is, that's your opinion and doesn't represent the views of everyone in the UK.
p5032
aVI'm not saying it is my opinion, please do give me the reason why you think it isn't decriminalised yet?
p5033
aVI really have no idea, I imagine it has a lot to do with the majority of voters being the elderly and the majority of drug reform supporters are younger who don't vote as much.
p5034
aVThey pander to the voters.
p5035
aVThere you go, that's exactly my point.
p5036
aVNobody cares that much to go out and vote for anyone who deals in drug decriminalisation, ergo, it's not that important.
p5037
aVBut that doesn't mean it's not an important issue with a lot of people.
p5038
aVThere are a lot of reasons young people don't vote and I don't think the reason is because they don't think there are stupid laws that need changing.
p5039
aVI think it's becuase they think even if they do vote, it won't change anything.
p5040
aVBut there are parties who do want decriminalise drugs, and one of them is the junior partner in coalition at the moment, surely if you care that much about drug decriminalisation, surely you would vote for a party that thinks the same, like the Lib Dems or Greens.
p5041
aVIf it's that much of an issue and you don't vote for those parties, then you clearly don't care that much about decriminalising drugs.
p5042
aVWell, seeing as a party who apparently wants to decriminalise drugs is already a part of the current government and drugs have yet to be decriminalised, it kind of proves my point.
p5043
aVVoting doesn't change anything or that's how it seems at least.
p5044
aVBut only the minor member.
p5045
aVAnd it so happens that it would the senior member's worst decision, *their* voters would never stand for it.
p5046
aVThey are not liberal enough.
p5047
aVJust a massive difference in status. 
p5048
aVThen you need to learn more about politics, especially not pissing off one's core demographic immediately after coming near power.
p5049
aVCompromise is compromise, but LD showed their hand that day.\u000a\u000a
p5050
aVYeah, they were always a "I like them because they talk sense" party in opposition and haven't quite lived up to it as a member of a ruling coalition.
p5051
aVIn all fairness, they are a junior partner.
p5052
aVTheir interventions with the worst of conservative policies (NHS reform, Snoopers Charter) has been very good, with only a couple of things which make it impossible for me to vote for them (secret trials, tuition fees)
p5053
aVWell, I think either position is a bad argument for voting for them.
p5054
aVThey've not done what they said they would because you can't trust them or they've not done what they said they would because they're a minor party.
p5055
aVWhat about the Conservatives?
p5056
aVThey've also broken their election promises - they haven't cut immigration, and they've also broken their no top down reorganisation of the NHS promise.
p5057
aVJunior coalition partners having less input is literally how coalitions are supposed to work - tactical voting is why we have such a screwed up political system in the first place
p5058
aVWell, yeah but you wouldn't be voting for them based on this parliament either.
p5059
aVI do think it's clearly unfair to blame the Lib Dems for being a bad coalition partner and vote Conservative.
p5060
aVThing is, I honestly feel that the lib dems actually punched above their weight this parliament.
p5061
aVThe only reason I'm not voting lib dem is a few things which they followed the Conservatives on which I feel violated their ideals as a party (secret trials, in particular)
p5062
aVI get where you are coming from, but don't forget how much negotiation had to be done, and the LD's still kept them in check - they prevented the Snooper's Charter and stopped them from pulling out of the ECHR.
p5063
aVThis is massive.
p5064
aVThese are my main causes for concern if we get a Tory majority.
p5065
aVhttp://www.libdems.org.uk/404 gives me a different error message, which is interesting.
p5066
aV(When I say interesting, I mean at best /r/mildlyinteresting , because it looks pretty bad)
p5067
aVThe Labour Party website takes a jab at the Tories too!
p5068
aVhttp://action.labour.org.uk/content/404
p5069
aVJust like Nick Cleggs integrity.
p5070
aVAh, the 'Nick Clegg's a liar!
p5071
aV' argument.
p5072
aVHow refreshing.
p5073
aVthing about being a liar is you only have to be a liar once and you're a liar forever, a mans word is his bond.
p5074
aVI'm not at all a fan of Nick Clegg, but why is he considered a liar?
p5075
aVHe got into bed with the Conservatives, surely people can't expect him to keep all of his pre-election promises if he's not actually the boss. 
p5076
aVI feel that most of the new Lib Dem voters of 2010 were really turned off about them enabling a Tory government (who, if you were voting Lib Dem, are probably the last party they thought theirs were going to sign a deal with) and not truly fighting for things like the AV referendum or Lords reform, it's only students who are very bitter about the tuition fees and who can blame them.
p5077
aVIt's not only students unfortunately.
p5078
aVAnecdotal I know, but my boyfriend and I were students at the time and it didn't bother us that much (especially as imo the new system is better), but my parents on the other hand...
p5079
aVThey've very much adopted the "What a betrayal, I'll never vote for them again"  line and now they're pushing for the Greens. 
p5080
aVIt's a shame really, if only he kept that one pledge, I reckon they would be on course to doing better this election that ever before.
p5081
aVIt's a shame, I agree.
p5082
aVI don't know why they decided to go back on their pre election pledge.
p5083
aVI'd like to believe it was for honourable reasons and that by giving that one to the Conservatives, they gained leverage to enact many more of their policies that have been overshadowed.
p5084
aVBut who knows.
p5085
aVCoalitions by their nature involve sacrifices and compromise on both sides.
p5086
aVI am disheartened to see so much support disappear from the Lib Dems because in my mind, I still trust they would be a strong liberal force in government.
p5087
aVBut we'll see what happens, I suppose. 
p5088
aVI'm a student myself and I'm not bitter about tuition fees.
p5089
aVI think it's selfish to be, why should my higher education be paid for through tax?
p5090
aVAll the students knew they would have to pay it back when they signed up for it, it's not like he said "Yeah take the loans, we'll write them off when we come into power". 
p5091
aV&gt; why should my higher education be paid for through tax?
p5092
aVBecause it benefits the country.
p5093
aVA more educated population is better for everyone.
p5094
aVIt's a hell of a lot better for the person with that education, though.
p5095
aVI don't see why a bin man should have to pay for a degree which gets someone else a well paid job in the city of London. 
p5096
aVOr gets his children a well paid job? 
p5097
aV&gt; It's a hell of a lot better for the person with that education, though.
p5098
aVSure.
p5099
aV&gt; I don't see why a bin man should have to pay for a degree which gets someone else a well paid job in the city of London.
p5100
aVI don't think they just fund degrees for well paid jobs in the city. 
p5101
aVAs does not having to pay as much tax.
p5102
aVIt's my choice to go to uni, and I shall reap the benefits of it.
p5103
aVI hardly think it's fair to ask my peers who didn't go to university and went straight to work to foot my uni bill, and then I'll leave uni and end up earning more than them too?
p5104
aVDoesn't sound better for everyone to me.
p5105
aVThere is a question mark in there but I'm not sure what question you're asking.
p5106
aVCan you try again?
p5107
aVIt is better for everyone because it is an investment.
p5108
aVWith that degree you will hopefully earn more and therefor pay more tax.
p5109
aVI'd earn more and pay more tax regardless of who funded my studies.
p5110
aVThe average person paying tax will not benefit from my degree, I will.
p5111
aVTherefore I should bare the brunt of the fees. 
p5112
aVAgain, the nation as a whole benefits from a better educated population.
p5113
aVhe drew a red line with tuition fee rises, the point is yes, politician should be held to any pledge they make, otherwise what is the point of making pledges?
p5114
aVIf he had said 'i would fight against any rise unless' or 'i wouldn't vote for it unless' then he wouldn't have broken a promise, he in fact released this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLR8R9JXz4 putting this promise front and centre of his campaign.
p5115
aVPart of the Coalition agreement liberal democrats could at least abstain from it (and remember every MP has the right to vote as they choose) he voted for it, despite promising not too, this make him in simple terms, a liar.
p5116
aV21 liberal democrat members of parliament aren't liars, 27 are.
p5117
aV8 are cowards.

aVThere isn't any connection between the two parties now, there barely has been for a year now, leading up to the vote.
p5124
aVParliament has pretty much closed, they are no longer a tag team.

aVBack to the individual scrap, and that's fine.
p5126
aVIn fact it shows how professional they have been over the past 5 years.
p5127
aVAlmost 0 spats, despite all the doom-mongers that were out at the beginning of the coalition.
p5128
aVIn fact, I will be really disappointed if we don't get another coalition, especially one involving the LD's. 
p5129
aVyou realize coalition is a temporary agreement between two DIFFERENT parties who form a government in the national interest right?
p5130
aVGranted its easier to sit in the background and snipe, but someone has to bring stability to government.

aVAccording to yougov sturgeon is the best egg
p5177
aVIf you can get hold of it, just read the little purple book \u2018WHY VOTE UKIP 2015\u2019, published by Biteback, one of a series on the main parties in the run-up to the GE.
p5178
aVHere\u2019s a sample,\u000a\u2018The EU is a staggeringly expensive club.
p5179
aVIt costs us £55m every day to stay in, yet it wastes billions on staffing costs, huge glitzy buildings, vanity projects, foreign junkets for MEPs, advertising, and moving the whole of the parliament to Strasbourg once a month, among other profligacies such as the 140 \u2018embassies\u2019 it has set up in non-EU countries (44 diplomats in Barbados alone).\u2019\u000a\u2018The EU controls immigration, business and employment, financial services, fishing, farming, law and order, energy and trade.
p5180
aVSo, whatever the precise figure is regarding how much British legislature is controlled by the EU, you can be sure it is too much.
p5181
aVOur voting power within the EU is also getting weaker and weaker.
p5182
aVThose who say if we left the EU we would be isolated and lose our influence are being ridiculous; we have very little influence anyway.
p5183
aVSince 1996, the UK has voted \u2018no\u2019 to a proposal 55 times at the Council of Ministers-where national ministers from each EU country meet to actually decide the EU\u2019s line on major issues- yet every single time the measure has gone on to become British law anyway.\u2019\u000aThis book details in painful, sleep ruining detail how the EU has damaged our fishing industry, our agriculture, our rights under our legal system, our small and medium sized businesses, our energy policy and costs, our clinical trials, our foreign trade, our patient care within the NHS, and so much else.
p5184
aVAs the EU expands further, our position within it is going to get weaker and much, much more vulnerable.
p5185
aVWe must leave while we still have the right to do so.\u000a
p5186
aVHere's a [chart](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/danmunro/files/2014/06/TCFchart.png) of how the NHS compares to other rich countries' health systems.
p5187
aVWhy anyone would want to drastically change this is beyond me... actually it's not, they're just under the impression that private businesses always manage things better, as demonstrated by rail and power companies.
p5188
aVOh, and they don't like paying for something that doesn't directly benefit them.
p5189
aVThe only issue I can see with the NHS is NHS directors carving services out to private companies and there just being too many people for the hospitals to cope\u000a\u000aI work in a hospital, in a department that used to be NHS, we were moved over to the private company, it's one of the leading hospitals in the country so, perhaps I have a biased view of how the NHS works....incredibly well as far as I can see
p5190
aVIt works incredibly well but the question is can we afford to pay for it without doing something incredibly drastic as our population ages.
p5191
aVCare has to be paid for somehow.
p5192
aVEither we all pay for our own care as private individuals, which is what happens in many countries, or we pay all our money into a big government pot to create and run a massive state owned system.
p5193
aVThe evidence from Forbes suggests the latter is cheapest, so even if costs go up, it'll still be cheaper than other options.
p5194
aVGood point, the question should be can we afford to go insurance based?
p5195
aVSome people could afford it but a hell of a lot couldn't, they would either just die or be bailed out by the state except now it costs the state a shed tonne more because the insurance industry needs to make a profit, the hospitals need to make a profit.
p5196
aVA bit like selling off all the council houses, not building any more and then renting them back again at extortionate market rates.
p5197
aVThe only reason this stuff ever seems cheaper is because they can afford to run at a loss for a few years, then when the NHS is no longer equipped to carry out the now privitised procedures in that area they raise the price.
p5198
aVIt would also further divide society and push an ever increasing number to the margins.
p5199
aVThings like that have a negative effect on everyone, more work days lost, more crime, more disease. 
p5200
aVAnd I would agree it is an issue - but it's a discussion that's hard to take seriously when you look at our expenditure on say, military.
p5201
aVFor a country that vowed to care for it's people from cradle to grave, it's priorities don't seem to allign.
p5202
aVThe argument might be that an exceptional healthcare service won't be necessary if we were destroyed by our enemies... but then some might argue that if that's the case, maybe we should stop funding and supporting the creation of new enemies so we can stop focusing on military spending.
p5203
aVThe real issue is priority.
p5204
aVThis discussion often gets misconstrued with capitalism vs socialism... but in reality it's more corruption vs the people.
p5205
aVBecause there's a massive, looming black hole in NHS spending and if we don't talk about ways to fix it, not meaning privatisation, then we will end up having to privatise!
p5206
aV&gt;Oh, and they don't like paying for something that doesn't directly benefit them.
p5207
aVIt benefits everybody.
p5208
aVThat's why they want to keep it free at the point of use, replace Monitor with public elected bodies to keep standards answerable to the public, and return to a clinician led management - because NHS clinicians generally would rather march on hell than oversee the privatisation of the NHS.
p5209
aVWe have a problem.
p5210
aVIf we don't discuss it and find a pragmatic  workaround your worst fears for the NHS will have to come true and not out of choice.
p5211
aVThe NHS is cheap compared to the international competition.
p5212
aVIf there is a funding gap, it is on the "money raised" side of the equation, not the "money spent" side.
p5213
aVI'm not saying that the NHS is perfect or that it cannot be improved.
p5214
aVI am saying that taking about any large scale change to the way the system works is completely uncalled for.
p5215
aVThe world offers us a smorgasbord of 100s of other systems to compare with, and none of them offer noteworthy improvements over what we already have.
p5216
aVTotally agree.
p5217
aVIt is being deliberately run into the ground, we always seem to have plenty of money for wars, nuclear weapons, Christ we even printed an absolute fortune and handed it to the banks to share among themselves.
p5218
aVMy wife works in a department in the NHS where this week they were told they were pretty much replacing 15 already overrun people with 3.
p5219
aVIf I give £5 and say you have to live off it for 2 weeks, are you the one who overspent when you ended up starving by the end of it or did I just pull a number out of my arse and call you a failure for not managing?
p5220
aVUntil you ask yourself the question, "how does Germany afford to spend over 1k more per person per year?
p5221
aV" The taxpayer is never gonna stump up a percentage increase in spending to cover that gap, so who is?
p5222
aV&gt;The NHS is cheap compared to the international competition.
p5223
aVIt is, but greater efficiency doesn't mean there isn't a looming funding gap.
p5224
aV&gt; If there is a funding gap, it is on the "money raised" side of the equation, not the "money spent" side.
p5225
aVIt's on both sides.
p5226
aVIt's a looming funding gap i.e.
p5227
aVwe're not spending nearly enough for the projected costs of increased medical technology and treatment, more of us, living to an older age.
p5228
aV&gt; I am saying that taking about any large scale change to the way the system works is completely uncalled for.
p5229
aVIF you ignore the oncoming storm that we're going to have to spend increasingly more to just tread water, and that we're going to have to be treating more people.
p5230
aV&gt; The world offers us a smorgasbord of 100s of other systems to compare with, and none of them offer noteworthy improvements over what we already have.
p5231
aVThen in part of this debate, which proves that Nigel is shown to be right that we need the debate, we need to find another new way if none of the other systems do fit once the debate is fleshed out.
p5232

p5233
aVFrench non-profits, and attracting more private insurance money into a public service is certainly a fresh revenue stream to consider.
p5234
aVThe solution to an NHS funding gap is not to change the NHS.
p5235
aVIt's to change something else in society to provide the funding shortfall.
p5236
aVTax loopholes, ridiculous banking subsidies etc.
p5237
aVThere are a million things we can tweak before we even consider touching the NHS with regards to privatization.
p5238
aVThere is no debate.
p5239
aVFarage is wrong.
p5240
aVHands off the NHS, fuckos.
p5241
aVGet the money elsewhere.\u000a
p5242
aVYou're still not listening.
p5243
aVI agree with you.
p5244
aVGet the money from elsewhere!
p5245
aVThe funding shortfall is perpetual.
p5246
aVYou will always have growing costs whilst we have developing technology and people living longer - right up to the point where you develop a generic cancer cure at a fraction of more and more expensive modern treatments.
p5247
aV**I agree.
p5248
aVClose the tax loopholes and ridiculous banking subsidies.
p5249
aV**\u000a\u000aThat doesn't fix the issue though.
p5250
aVIt buys it more time, even if you put everything extra you get from it into the NHS.
p5251
aV&gt;There is no debate.
p5252
aVFarage is wrong.
p5253
aVHands off the NHS, fuckos.
p5254
aVGet the money elsewhere.
p5255
aVThe course you are prescribing is going to make privatisation of the NHS inevitable.
p5256
aVNo debate and the problem doesn't go away.
p5257
aVYou're actually arguing for something that will temporarily put off the permanent: the privatisation of the NHS.
p5258
aVYou're buying some time, but the longer you ignore the issue the more likely the unpalatable becomes.
p5259
aVYou're putting off privatisation, like Labour did by punting it with PFI two decades away but making it more inevitable.
p5260
aVWe need to *prevent* it.      
p5261
aV[deleted]
p5262
aVGlad you're entering another part of the debate.
p5263
aVSo now part of the NHS debate is elephant#2 in the room that the national age of retirement *might* have to be pushed back....
p5264
aVBut that too is a short and easily extinguishable fuse that still doesn't tackle the real behemoth in the room in addressing the health issue.
p5265
aVWouldn't it be nice if somehow, without being bombed or starved by the US we could make our own drugs, conduct our own research and disregard foreign pharmaceutical patents.
p5266
aVI can't help feel that we're a bit of a scumbag species when we trust medicine, one of the most important things in a caring society to greedy companies who spend more on marketing, misinformation and bribing NHS doctors than they do on R&amp;D. If we did this, stopped playing world police and had a real tax evasion policy the NHS would be absolutely fine.

aVThe notion of endlessly growing costs is a fallacy not backed up by science.
p5270
aVTechnological improvements act to reduce costs of universal healthcare, by adopting more preventative measures and automating a lot of costly procedures.
p5271
aVWe are seeing a growth in costs right now because of an aging population and a growing population.
p5272
aVTwo things that are slowing down and will reach an equilibrium in the future.
p5273
aVSo yes, we are fine to delay changes to the NHS.
p5274
aVBecause by the time they are supposedly required, the system will have adapted to our changing society and corrected itself.
p5275
aVWhich is ignoring the core issue here, which is one of principle.
p5276
aVEven if the NHS was on the edges of a black hole, from which it would never escape.
p5277
aVI'd rather change almost everything else about our society first in an attempt to save it, rather than start day one with widespread changes to the NHS.
p5278
aVSo Farage is still talking out of his arse, just like most of the right wing who are desperate to turn the NHS into a cash grab.
p5279
aVI'd tolerate pretty much any change to society before I'd tolerate a change to the NHS on a fundamental level.
p5280
aVAnd yes, the slow erosion of services by the private section is a fundamental change.
p5281
aVAnd one I abhor.
p5282
aV&gt;The notion of endlessly growing costs is a fallacy not backed up by science.
p5283
aVTechnological improvements act to reduce costs of universal healthcare, by adopting more preventative measures and automating a lot of costly procedures.
p5284
aVNot if you want the latest up to date medical treatment.
p5285
aVWhich do you think costs more, an MRI at today's prices or 1980s X-ray at 1980s prices?
p5286
aVYou get better for less than what you could ever expect at 1980 levels in the modern age.
p5287
aVIn medicine you don't expect yesteryear treatment when there is better on the market today.
p5288
aVIf you're saying people on the NHS in 2030 should expect 2020 level of treatment on the NHS, which will still be better than what we have today, but shouldn't expect cutting edge medicine, then you're now entering a reasoned debate and one we should have.
p5289
aVThat would be one way of ensuring an NHS as we know it - but people should know what it means.
p5290
aV&gt;We are seeing a growth in costs right now because of an aging population and a growing population.
p5291
aVTwo things that are slowing down and will reach an equilibrium in the future.
p5292
aVTHIS.
p5293
aVTHIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED THE DEBATE BECAUSE IT IS DEMONSTRABLY UNTRUE.
p5294
aVThe UK population is exploding and is set to hit 70 million by 2027.
p5295
aVWe are seeing unprecedented growth, which is why UKIP are calling for controlled immigration to manageable levels.
p5296
aVhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15461579\u000a\u000a&gt;So yes, we are fine to delay changes to the NHS.
p5297
aVBecause by the time they are supposedly required, the system will have adapted to our changing society and corrected itself.
p5298
aVCorrected itself by a debate you don't want to have?
p5299
aVYou want to keep it the same.
p5300
aV&gt;Which is ignoring the core issue here, which is one of principle.
p5301
aVEven if the NHS was on the edges of a black hole, from which it would never escape.
p5302
aVI'd rather change almost everything else about our society first in an attempt to save it, rather than start day one with widespread changes to the NHS.
p5303
aVNow we really are talking....
p5304
aVSo even if the NHS engulfs the rest of the government spend you'd be okay with it.
p5305
aVReally?
p5306
aVThe other government spend includes welfare, job seeker allowance, policing, roads, industry, pensions, local government services, prisons, education,....\u000a\u000aAn ever increasing spend in one will have to eat into the rest to remain sustainable in the short term.
p5307
aVI don't think you've thought this one through.
p5308
aVTo put off the privatisation of one temporarily, in the interim you have advocated effectively the privatisation of all else!
p5309
aV&gt;So Farage is still talking out of his arse, just like most of the right wing who are desperate to turn the NHS into a cash grab.
p5310
aVHe doesn't want to privatise it.
p5311
aVAn insurance model doesn't mean privatisation, and it is actual UKIP policy to keep it free at the point of use and to return it to clinician led management - and I personally trust those clinicians in the NHS to want to keep it free and public.
p5312
aV&gt;I'd tolerate pretty much any change to society before I'd tolerate a change to the NHS on a fundamental level.
p5313
aVIgnoring that until we have this debate on how to keep the NHS true to NHS principles (UKIP's health policy was actually chaired and written by a doctor who had worked in the NHS for over 20 years) that the status quo is actually a slow track to privatisation with TTIP (which UKIP opposes applying to the NHS) wishes to put on a fast track.
p5314
aVWe are not seeing unprecedented growth.
p5315
aVGrowth was higher in the 60s and 70s, and considerably higher in the post war period.
p5316
aVIn fact, UK population growth has been slowing down since 2006.
p5317

p5342
aVTo fill this black hole in NHS spending, the money will be coming from the public either way.
p5343
aVIf it goes through the government (via taxes), the people who can afford most, pay most.
p5344
aVIf it goes through private companies (via insurance), the people who are most ill pay most and then a bit extra to cover company profits and marketing. 
p5345
aV&gt;To fill this black hole in NHS spending, the money will be coming from the public either way.
p5346
aVWhy do you say that?
p5347
aVThere's already models in place to accentuate NHS income from private streams without privatisation (by raising how much the NHS can charge private insurer patients whilst stipulating a minimum percentage of patients that must be on the NHS to stem shortage of service), but much more can be done - and is done in parts of the continent.
p5348
aV&gt; If it goes through private companies (via insurance), the people who are most ill pay most and then a bit extra to cover company profits and marketing.
p5349
aVYou seem to be only working on one insurance model when you can have a public insurance model, like in France, Germany, Spain,...\u000a\u000aYou also seem to be ignoring the potential for non-profits outside the government run hospitals.
p5350
aVThese exist on the continent too (around 15% of French hospitals, and more still I believe in Germany).
p5351
aVWhat you've just said illustrates perfectly why a mature national debate is needed, precisely what Labour and the Mirror, in this case, are trying to stem.

aVInterestingly an insurance model would be a means to keep the NHS public and to attract more private money without buying services.
p5372
aV*Which is precisely why Germany and France can spend more than the UK as a percentage on an insurance model without having to necessarily adopt the US model.
p5373
aV*\u000a\u000a.

aV**Kinda like what FARAGE was arguing in 2012....**              \u000a\u000a                                            [still not UKIP policy]
p5375
aVThe citizens of various countries  pay a varying proportion of GDP towards healthcare.
p5376
aVWhether this is via insurance, taxation, or some sort of single payer scheme, either it's affordable and sustainable or it's not.
p5377
aVThe huge advantage of paying for your healthcare out of taxation is that that more of the money can be extracted from people with higher incomes.
p5378
aVThe disadvantage is lack of choice: unless you go private and pay cash, there's no real market in healthcare.
p5379
aVBut that's the case in almost every healthcare system on the planet: the only partial exception is the Netherlands which has individual healthcare accounts.\u000a
p5380
aVLet's talk about ways to fix it then.
p5381
aVBailed out banker's bonuses, corporate tax dodges, offshore havens\u000a\u000aThere we go
p5382
aVI have to assume you're being sarcastic.
p5383
aVNone of those are long term large tax incomes.
p5384
aVWhy not?
p5385
aVThey're certainly long term earners
p5386
aVBecause rich people and companies will just move to other countries if you confiscate all their money.
p5387
aV"Taxing the rich more" seems to be the only answer lefties have.
p5388
aVAt some point pretty soon, rich people run out of money, or move away.
p5389
aVIt's not a sustainable option.
p5390
aVNever mind being a morally wrong policy to just raid rich people to pay for things.
p5391
aV"Bankers bonuses" is the worst though.
p5392
aVDo you really want to remove bankers bonuses so that the talented bankers who make money move to other countries, leaving behind all the rubbish bankers who lose money?
p5393
aV'Banker's bonuses' is an easy target.
p5394
aVWhat they should concentrate on is bankers being incentivised to take hideous risks with an easy get out when it fails (being bailed out).  
p5395
aVYeah this line of thinking always comes out.
p5396
aVTwo points defeat it easily.
p5397
aV1: the rich have nearly all of the pie already.
p5398
aVThey only want more and more and threaten to leave if they aren't allowed nearly all of it.
p5399
aVThis isn't reasonable, it isn't logical, it isn't fair, and there is no end to it.
p5400
aVEventually they will ask for 100% of all money, ans anyone who dares say no will get the same bs argument back, "give us it or we will leave".
p5401
aVFuck off then, scum\u000a\u000a2: holding ourselves ransom to morally bankrupt greed is no argument whatsoever.
p5402
aVThose with more money than they can spend don't want to pitch in, then let them go.
p5403
aVWe will build a poorer but better country without them and their malicious logic\u000a\u000a\u000aYou say morally wrong.
p5404
aVDo u know what moral means?
p5405
aVIt doesn't mean super corporations like google avoiding tax while posting record profits.
p5406
aVThat's not what it means AT ALL\u000a\u000aoh and don't forget, although the rich tell themselves they created their own wealth and deserve to horde it, the reality is the rich owe the state a massive debt for educating their employees, for upholding the society that their business operate in, and much more. 
p5407
aVWealth isn't a zero sum game.
p5408
aVI think you're missing that point.
p5409
aVWhat "the wealthy" have bears no relation to what you can have.
p5410
aVStop being jealous and create your own.
p5411
aVGoogle has a responsibility to its shareholders to maximise profits.
p5412
aVIf it doesn't do that, it would be doing them a disservice.
p5413
aVSo obviously it is going to minimise tax bills.
p5414
aVAnd if that requires them to route all online activity through some irish "office", that makes sense.
p5415
aVIf you think that should be made illegal, lobby your MP to make it illegal (They're actually closing a few of those schemes now).
p5416
aVBut don't suggest that Google is at fault here - it's not.
p5417
aVIt's being sane, and doing what you and I would do.\u000a
p5418
aV&gt; the rich have nearly all of the pie already.
p5419
aVThey only want more and more and threaten to leave if they aren't allowed nearly all of it.
p5420
aVThis isn't reasonable, it isn't logical, it isn't fair, and there is no end to it.
p5421
aVEventually they will ask for 100% of all money, ans anyone who dares say no will get the same bs argument back, "give us it or we will leave".
p5422
aVFuck off then, scum\u000a\u000aEconomics isn't a zero sum game... What you were saying may have been true (or rather, was seen to be true) in the 1600's when mercatilism was the dominant economic theory but times have changed.
p5423
aVThe average person is far better off than the average person was 30 years ago, who was far better off than their own parents, who were far better off than their own but it wasn't always that way.
p5424
aVBefore the industrial revolution most humans lived pretty much the same lives as their ancestors 10,000 years ago did when agriculture was first developed.
p5425
aVThe revolution (along with the enlightenment and the development of Capitalism, which all occurred within the same short timeframe) sparked a massive increase in living standards, economic productivity, scientific and cultural development which shows no signs of stopping (in the mid-long term at least).
p5426
aVEven if in a century the rich end up controlling 99.9999% of the worlds wealth i would bet the remaining 0.0001 will live like kings compared to you and me today.
p5427
aVUs Westerners like to pretend that we're hard done by but in reality the world's the best it's ever been and tomorrow will be even better.
p5428
aVI don't want to undermine the billions of people that still suffer or the cause of progress, i just hate it when people try to paint a picture of Earth as some sort of science-fiction dystopia.
p5429
aVGiven the progress we're making we have to be doing something right.
p5430
aVYou're right, but we'd be doing a hell of a lot better if we didn't have gaping holes in our laws on taxation.
p5431
aVWe could cut taxes that affect the poor and *still* have more tax income than we do now.
p5432
aV&gt; Given the progress we're making we have to be doing something right.
p5433
aVWe could do something even right-er (than what we're doing now) and make more progress more quickly.
p5434
aVOh yeah the £500 BILLION that Gordon Brown bailed them all out with doesn't count in this scenario then...
p5435
aVA single one off payment to buy shares in banks, which will be paid back to the public with profit shortly.
p5436
aVThe public actually did pretty well out of the banks bailout.
p5437
aVSo no - it doesn't count.
p5438
aVGreat!
p5439
aVThat's what Nigel said we'd have to do.
p5440
aVI certainly want to keep it free at the point of use, so let's do it.
p5441
aV&gt;Bailed out banker's bonuses\u000a\u000aThe bailouts shouldn't have happened, and Farage has talked favouably about a Glass-Seagall system so we don't have to do any more bailouts.
p5442
aVLet the bankers get whatever bonuses they want, but sell off the ownership of the banks we have when we can, and prevent any future bailouts.
p5443
aVNo more 'to big to fail'.
p5444
aVUKIP support a citizens initiative of Direct Democracy, but I'm sure there'll be quite a bit of cross party support to stop High Street banks speculating irresponsibly with not investor cash but with the public's savings.
p5445
aV&gt;corporate tax dodges, offshore havens\u000a\u000aThese are pretty much two sides of the same coin so I've taken them together.
p5446
aVOne proposal by UKIP is that corporates should be taxed on turnover not profit which would prevent them from externalising profits derived in the UK to more favourable tax havens.
p5447
aV----------------------\u000a\u000aThis hasn't as such solved the NHS issue so much as buys it more time.
p5448
aVThe issue still remains that whilst new medical technology and treatment will always cost increasingly more, and whilst we're having to treat more people as there are more of us and we live longer, then we can't indefinitely keep increasing the percentage NHS spend as a share of total government spend.
p5449
aVSomething eventually would have to give - even if we've now bought some more time.
p5450
aVWe still need a more sustainable model, which means testing those with more to give under an insurance model into contributing more into a public model may do - which is what some of the European models do.
p5451
aVIt doesn't mean privatisation, but it means providing more capacity whilst still improving the bar of those under a state provider.
p5452
aVWe should also look, I feel, at non-profit provision under a state insurance model.
p5453
aVA Glass-Steagall system wouldn't really prevent bailouts.
p5454
aVLehman Brothers was just an investment bank, but when it collapsed it nearly brought down the whole financial system.
p5455
aVJust separating retail and investment banks isn't enough.
p5456
aVTrue, but the Bank of England doesn't work along the same fractional reserve systems of the US.
p5457
aVThere is no fractional reserve of sorts for UK banks at the BoE, it's a matter of opening books once a year where the BoE establishes am individual lending rate...which leaves open the LIBOR controversy, which is another matter.
p5458
aVAnd of sorts that BoE rate too has been addressed by the UK introducing a bank levy on borrowing.
p5459
aVThe rush on banks in the UK was very much a rush on highstreet banks because highstreet banks had been behaving like investment banks.
p5460
aVIn the UK instance, had there been a Glass-Steagall system, then we wouldn't have had to bail out RBS.
p5461
aVTo take it to another level Canadian regulation meant Canadian banks were largely insulated when the global crisis hit in 2008.   \u000a
p5462
aVAnd then what happens when you run out of successful people to penalise?\u000a\u000a
p5463
aVWow, I am very surprised at Norway's ranking in that chart. 
p5464
aVThat is a chart released by a left-wing lobby group in the US that campaigns in favour of a public owned healthcare system.
p5465
aVSurprise, surprise, when they do an analysis of healthcare systems, they rate publicly owned ones best.
p5466
aVCuriously, the only metric that actually really matters, that of healthcare outcomes, the UK comes last. 
p5467
aV&gt; Curiously, the only metric that actually really matters, that of healthcare outcomes, the UK comes last.
p5468
aVCare to elaborate? 
p5469
aVGo to the Commonwealth Fund's website and look through the metrics involved in their rankings.
p5470
aVAll of them involve inputs (like spend on healthcare, number of follow up letters sent) etc, whereas only one ("healthy lives") includes actual health metrics.
p5471
aVThat's the one the UK comes second last on.
p5472
aV(I likely won't be able to have a back and forth about this as left-wingers tendency to downvote views they disagree with has limited my posting in this sub.
p5473
aV)
aVSeemed pretty self-explanatory to me.
p5474
aVAlmost all the other metrics are opinion based rather than fact based.
p5475
aVThat study was a joke so it's evidence of very little, the methodology was heavily based on patient opinions, which entirely fails to take into account cultural differences.
p5476
aVAs is well known Americans tend to demand much better service than British people do, especially when they have to pay, whereas British people are taught to be oh so grateful that they're getting anything for "free" at all, this obviously biases the results.
p5477
aVIt's similar to UK student satisfaction ratings for universities wherein universities with higher % of private school pupils tend to have lower satisfaction scores, not because they're worse but because from private school pupils tend to be much more demanding.
p5478
aVSo why do the OECD and WHO rank US healthcare so poorly against other developed nations whilst topping it for expenditure?
p5479
aVIt didn't say otherwise, I was just pointing out in particular that the methodology would be likely to give an unrealistic advantage to the UK.
p5480
aVAnyway why bother debating, "don't downvote simply because you don't agree" is a complete joke on this subreddit, especially when you commit the heresy of not treating the NHS as a sacred cow.
p5481
aVI don't like the downvoting either, people treat it like the daily mail thumbs up or down.
p5482
aVDid you miss the bit where we come second last in the section which ranks the NHS's ability to keep people alive, or where you willfully ignoring the bit that didn't fit your bias filled rubbish?
p5483
aVAlso, Nigel has one opinion.
p5484
aVHis party has another one.
p5485
aVHis party outvoted him.
p5486
aVUKIP does not want to get rid of the NHS.
p5487
aVJust did a quick search.
p5488
aV[This could be the clip that the article is referring to](https://www.youtube.com/v/dXBU68nTQj0?version=3&amp;start=2888&amp;end=2933).

aVThe 5 stages of UKIP a supporters reaction to a Nigel Farage soundbite:\u000a\u000a1.
p5492
aVHow do the hook, line and sinker taste?

aV1.
p5494
aVIt must get awful tiring, jumping to so many conclusions.
p5495
aV* What damage?
p5496
aVSome hyped up headlining from a rag that no one in their right mind takes seriously?
p5497
aV* You seem rather determined to take a quick glance at a Mirror headline and reach a decision.
p5498
aV* Noooooo, not a debate on the sacred cow that is the NHS!
p5499
aVAnything but an open conversation, please!
p5500
aVHe didnt mention scrapping the NHS or private insurance.
p5501
aVJust that we need to consider the ageing population. 
p5502
aVHe also specifically says he wants to avoid a US-style system.
p5503
aVSo the title of the article is factually incorrect.
p5504
aVHe only points to Danish and Dutch systems which outscore the UK NHS on every meaningful measure.
p5505
aV&gt;which outscore the UK NHS on every meaningful measure.
p5506
aVExcept for those two trifling measures on which we beat them- cost efficiency and adult deaths per million?
p5507
aVhttp://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/aug/07/nhs-among-most-efficient-health-services\u000a\u000aIt's insane to want to change the NHS on cost grounds.
p5508
aVWe already have by far and away one of the most cost efficient health services in the world.
p5509
aVEfficiency is what the NHS always clings to- a result of being based on the US target based system.
p5510
aVImpossible to compare that with the Australian based payment system like the German which pays hospitals for the duration that the patient stays rather than the speed at which they are processed.
p5511
aVThat is why I said meaningful.
p5512
aVOK then, which measures do they beat us on?
p5513
aVLet's see some of those sources.
p5514
aVAs per the comment by /u/mrtube, we beat the competition (Denmark not shown, unfortunately) on all measures of Quality of Care, on Access to Care, on Efficiency, second place on Equality, third place on Timeliness, and second cheapest on overall Cost Per Capita.
p5515
aVAnd as my link says, we're also way ahead on overall adult mortality.
p5516
aVThe only thing we're really bad at is Healthy Lifestyle- which is not really in the NHS's remit at the moment, rather the Department of Health.
p5517

p5518
aVCelebrating not spending as much on each person and how fast we process people is something only someone form the UK is capable of doing with a straight face I am afraid.
p5519
aVTry and get specialised care or be unlucky enough to be on a waiting list for cancer care- then you'll see what the health system is really like.
p5520
aVCheck the conditions next time you go to A and E, look around you at what is happening.
p5521
aVYou are treated as a burden in the NHS, in Germany I am treated with the dignity of a paying customer and enjoy conditions I have never observed in any UK hospital I have had the misfortune to end up in.
p5522
aVGerman remuneration is based on the length of stay- can you imagine how much the death rates in UK hospitals would increase if we had to do so, imagine how utterly inefficient the NHS would be then?
p5523
aVYou cannot compare systems based on the Australian and US remuneration programs- it makes no sense.
p5524
aVYou have one hell bent on keeping people in and one hell bent on kicking people out. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p5525
aVI don't think many people are celebrating the fact that we spend so little but rather using it to explain that if you're looking for further efficiencies and cuts then you're looking in the wrong place.
p5526
aVIt seems fairly obvious that if we're falling short on any measures then the likely reason is that we're simply not spending enough.
p5527
aVWe do amazingly with the pittance we do spend so stop trying to choke the service even further, rather spend a little more and watch it flourish.
p5528
aVI've not used the German system though I've no doubt it's great but I've never been treated with anything but great care and dignity on the NHS - no I'm not saying that this goes for everyone but I'm certainly not alone in this experience.
p5529
aVThe idea that medical staff would suddenly turn around and treat you differently because you're a paying customer is condescending and facile to the caring professionals involved.
p5530
aV&gt;n Germany I am treated with the dignity of a paying customer and enjoy conditions I have never observed in any UK hospital I have had the misfortune to end up in.
p5531
aVIn Germany, you are milked.
p5532
aVPrivate patient, well this way sir.
p5533
aVWon't you have another test, ka-ching, can't be too careful sir....\u000a\u000aPublic insurance patient - kick you out next day, private patient, stay another week.
p5534
aVIf switching over to a system that is insurance based, and still free at the point of use, means that we put more much needed money into the NHS then i'm all for it.
p5535
aVI think people really are blind to how dire the NHS can be for a lot of patients.
p5536
aVAlmost every interaction my family and I have had with it has been dire, and they've fucked up in numerous ways.
p5537
aVSimply getting to see consultants is an uphill battle and you have to fight and fight to get seen within months. 
p5538
aVAdd Insurance and you are adding  a ~10% overhead, add billing and that's another ~10%.
p5539
aVIf you want a better service that's not the way to get it. 
p5540
aVAnother real big problem for the NHS are their completely outdated, backwards, paper based admin systems.
p5541
aVWhen they do try to get a new system in it always seems to go completely wrong, cost 10 times more and ultimately fail.
p5542
aVConsidering pretty much every single outsourced government IT system goes to complete shit I really wish they'd just hire their own developers and write this software themselves in partnership with the people who actually use it instead of leaving it to some procurement types who don't have a clue.
p5543
aVWhat sometimes seems like the more expensive option really isn't in the long run when you count the ballooning costs and ultimate failures of outsourced government projects.
p5544
aV[Citation needed]
p5545
aVHis words in 2012 were, "I think we're going to have to move to an insurance based system of health care"
p5546
aVYou can have an insurance based system that is still free at the point of use.
p5547
aVIf it encourages more private money into the system it would be a good thing.
p5548
aVThen we could bridge the spending gap that exists with other countries.
p5549
aVIt is the private money that allows those countries to spend so much more.
p5550
aVA win win situation for the taxpayer.
p5551
aVno, this is a lie.
p5552
aVPrivate money wants profits.
p5553
aVThey will only invest if they expect to get more out of it then what they put in.
p5554
aVIn the end it would cost us much much more then if we just did it ourselves.
p5555
aVSo the only people who want it privatised either think they can profit from it or are ignorant of what it would really mean and have fallen for the spin.
p5556
aVYou can easily have a private system co existing with a public one- Look at Germany.
p5557
aVThe question I have is why should the poor of a nation pay the healthcare of the richest few in society?
p5558
aVIt makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
p5559
aVYou can have it free at the point of use, public for the least well off and private for the richest.
p5560
aVNot in tribal UK though, it's my way or no way.
p5561
aVyou seem to misunderstand how taxes work, the rich,[ i know its the daily mail, but you can interpret the graphs your self](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/13/article-0-1C40419800000578-16_634x383.jpg) and my interpretation is that the richer 50% pays ~88% of the tax burden, and the richer 75% pays ~100% of the tax burden.
p5562
aVSo its a bit of stretch to say the poor subsides the rich when its the exact opposite.
p5563
aVI know what you are saying, but my point stands- the poorest contribute to healthcare for the richest defacto
p5564
aVThat is not a reasonable view point, they may contribute, but their net contribution is extremely negative.
p5565
aVThey take far more in taxes than they contribute.
p5566
aVI dont blame them, thats why taxes are setup the way they are at the end of the day.
p5567
aVWe already have this - seen BUPA recently.
p5568
aVMere crumbs- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Europe\u000a\u000a96.9 % pubically funded- still massively underfunded- no hope to ask the taxpayer to pay much more- so who pays more to make up the difference?
p5569
aVRich people and employers?
p5570
aVSound fair?
p5571
aVYour original question doesn't make much sense actually:\u000a\u000a&gt; The question I have is why should the poor of a nation pay the healthcare of the richest few in society\u000a\u000aIsn't that the point of proportional taxation\u000a\u000a&gt; still massively underfunded- no hope to ask the taxpayer to pay much more- so who pays more to make up the difference?
p5572
aVRich people and employers?
p5573
aVSound fair?
p5574
aVIsn't this what income tax and corporate tax does?
p5575
aVThe systems in Germany are pretty broken.
p5576
aVEveryone is their own billing entity.
p5577
aVAll that administration has to be paid for.
p5578
aVEven if the person is in one of the public insurance systems, the big billing monstrosity has to exist behind it.
p5579
aVvery well refined argument
p5580
aVI'm glad you enjoy the German system.
p5581
aVThe insurance companies certainly do as do those who over treat you.
p5582
aVAh I see- it's just too good for the Uk is it?
p5583
aVToo much treatment?
p5584
aVLOL
p5585
aVIn the UK, the NHS exists to maximise the outcomes for the greatest number of people for the available budget.
p5586
aVThese are clearly defined goals which are not shared by the German system, which exists often just for profit maximisation.
p5587
aVGiven the differing goals, it is always a question of what is being prescribed and why.
p5588
aVThe public system is better controlled than the private system but even there it can be abused.
p5589
aVThe problem is that the end user ultimately pays the price tag.
p5590
aVPublic insurance contributions are related to income but private to risk class.
p5591
aVAs you get older, the price goes up.
p5592
aVDramatically.
p5593
aV&gt; which exists often just for profit maximisation.
p5594
aVPublic insurers are non profit organisations.
p5595
aVOf course in private healthcare the price goes up as you are likely to need more care...you talk aout these things with such ideological ignorance, it's enough to make you sick.
p5596
aV&gt;Given the differing goals, it is always a question of what is being prescribed and why.
p5597
aVWhat does this even mean?
p5598
aV&gt;The problem is that the end user ultimately pays the price tag.
p5599
aVThe tax payer pays less as a percentage of GDP and less as a percentage of all investment in healthcare yet on average the outlay is 1k more per person than the UK.
p5600
aVAll free at the point of use too, the end.
p5601
aV&gt; Public insurers are non profit organisations.
p5602
aVThis is not the case for everyone else in the value chain.
p5603
aVPharmacists are almost unique in being guaranteed by law a 20% profit margin on the retail of any drugs they sell on prescription.
p5604
aVThis is why you find a lot in Germany.
p5605
aV&gt;Of course in private healthcare the price goes up as you are likely to need more care\u000a\u000aIn the UK they spread the costs amongst everyone (one risk group).
p5606
aVIn Germany they cut the cost on first entry to make the system seem attractive.
p5607
aVThey used to differentiate as well based on sex, but that is no longer the case.
p5608
aV&gt;it's enough to make you sick.
p5609
aVCan't afford to be..... Until a little while ago, public patients had to pay quarterly if they wanted to see the doctore.
p5610
aV&gt;The tax payer pays less as a percentage of GDP and less as a percentage of all investment in healthcare yet on average the outlay is 1k more per person than the UK.
p5611
aVNope.
p5612
aVThis has just moved a lot of the costs from the state to the insurance companies, whether public or private.
p5613
aVIn the end it is still a cost to the employer and the employee.
p5614
aV&gt;All free at the point of use too, the end.
p5615
aVAgain, only true for some.
p5616
aV&gt; This is not the case for everyone else in the value chain.
p5617
aVPharmacists are almost unique in being guaranteed by law a 20% profit margin on the retail of any drugs they sell on prescription.
p5618
aVThis is why you find a lot in Germany.
p5619
aVYou mean retailers want to make profits!!!!!!!
p5620
aVMy god quick arrest them!
p5621
aV&gt;In the UK they spread the costs amongst everyone (one risk group).
p5622
aVIn Germany they cut the cost on first entry to make the system seem attractive.
p5623
aVThey used to differentiate as well based on sex, but that is no longer the case.
p5624
aVYes this is exactly what is wrong with the UK system.
p5625
aVIt means overall spending falls down as such a high portion comes directly from taxation (National insurance), poor people funding healthcare for rich people- in other words.
p5626
aVCan you explain why it should not be the case that rich people are obliged to pay for their own healthcare?
p5627
aVCan you tell me how it is less fair?
p5628
aVRich people paying for their own care leaves more national money to spread over fewer individuals and thus overall spending goes up per head and down as a percentage of tax outlay, up as a percentage of GDP- more nurses and doctors (obviously) as a result and all the trickle down outcomes of having more money in the system.
p5629
aVHow else do you think Germany can spend so much more per person than the UK?
p5630
aVFor the UK to increase spending the only option is political suicide ie ask the taxpayer to spend more.
p5631
aVShift the burden is better IMO- shift it onto the rich and their employers through private insurance.
p5632
aVI remember those quarterly payments - I think it was 10 euro every 3 months?\u000a\u000a
p5633
aV&gt; You mean retailers want to make profits!!!!!!!
p5634
aVMy god quick arrest them!
p5635
aVThis is protected by law.
p5636
aVHow many industries in the UK have a state guaranteed profit?
p5637
aV&gt;It means overall spending falls down as such a high portion comes directly from taxation (National insurance), poor people funding healthcare for rich people- in other words.
p5638
aVNope.
p5639
aVBoth private and public are supported through their own (mandatory) insurance contributions.
p5640
aVDifferent Krankenkasse have their own features.
p5641
aVThere is no fair or unfair tax, both are the same.
p5642
aVIndeed those with higher incomes pay rather less as a percentage of their income into a Privatkasse than those with lower incomes (which is why they are so popular).
p5643
aV&gt;Rich people paying for their own care leaves more national money to spread over fewer individuals and thus overall spending goes up per head and down as a percentage of tax outlay, up as a percentage of GDP\u000a\u000aNot really as neither is supporting the other.
p5644
aVThe insurance system takes the risk either way, it is just in Germany there are many more entities and bureaucrats that have to be paid for.
p5645
aVThere is also nobody with an overview of what is effective and what isn't so we get to pay for such things as homeopathy.
p5646
aVYou talk about doctors and nurses.
p5647
aVHowever, Germany does have issues, it has a surfeit of junior doctors but far fewer skilled technicians and an issue with enough nurses.
p5648
aVWhat is paid for are the multiple layers of bureaucrats who administer the system.
p5649
aVThe NHS and the DSS behind it have a lot of bureacrats too but nothing like the numbers in Germany where we have "per aspirin" accounting.
p5650
aVYes, in the UK, increasing spending means asking the taxpayer to pay more.
p5651
aVSame in Germany as the public insurance schemes are not permitted to compete on cost so if they run short, all must increase their cut.
p5652
aVSo both rich and poor pay for the system but the private system allows for gold plating.
p5653
aV&gt;I remember those quarterly payments - I think it was 10 euro every 3 months?
p5654
aVYes.
p5655
aVBut it was no longer free at the point of use.
p5656
aVNow there are many things that are not covered or have to be argued with an insurance company, particularly with the public system.
p5657
aVThe final problem is what the insurance companies do with that cash they take.
p5658
aVIn earlier times, they would make long term investments in the markets.
p5659
aVUnfortunately these opportunities have gone and some insurance companies even lost money there.
p5660
aVHow could it cost much more than 97% of the funding coming from taxes?
p5661
aVYou could drop that to 87% tax funded and 10% private funding, half of which is paid by the employer.....\u000a\u000aCan you tell em what is less desirable about that?
p5662
aVOne tax big business COULD NOT avoid.
p5663
aVHo ho ho, I admire your dedication.
p5664
aVHere are the three stages of most others ITT:\u000a\u000a1.

p5678
aVNoooooo, not a debate on the sacred cow that is the NHS!
p5679
aVAnything but an open conversation, please! 
p5680
aVWe can have one now; It's a stupid, stupid idea.
p5681
aVThere is nothing about the US's heathcare system that is remotely desirable.
p5682
aVUnless you are wealthy and a shareholder.
p5683
aVThen its clearly superior.
p5684
aVEveryone can be a shareholder!
p5685
aVJust so long as we can find someone to buy MRI machines for £500k in India, and sell them here for £250k at a profit.
p5686
aVPlease point me in the direction of an actual quote from Farage's actual mouth about how he wants a system just like the United States.
p5687
aVI'll wait for that one.
p5688
aVWhich Farage was not referring too.
p5689
aV&gt;remember the commonwealth\u000a\u000aOh boy
p5690
aVDo you have an issue with regaining strengthened ties with the Commonwealth?
p5691
aVI have an issue with regaining ties with nations simply based on the fact we used to rule over them, yes. 
p5692
aVIt is open.

aVYou're just going to lose.

aVSweet Jesus, how many worshippers  at the  altar  can there be in one thread?

aVUh oh, that's torn it.
p5697
aVThey're all out now. 
p5698
aVYeah mate, you're outnumbered.
p5699
aVDeal with it instead of going "hurr durr altar" \u000a\u000aStart the debate. 
p5700
aVI'm having a laugh about the "Ageing population" one from the Telegraph.
p5701
aVThe NHS does very nicely out of non-earning OAPs retiring to Spain with younger workers coming to the country, paying in and then going back home before they claim much in the way of benefits.
p5702
aVAh, yes, the EU.
p5703
aVUKIP will do something about the British benefits tourists.
p5704
aVHow dare the evil lefty smearers criticise someone who actually thinks we should sell off the NHS and replace it with American Insurance system.
p5705
aVBut no, just another case of the left smearing you as usual, it's okay we won't have to wait another week until someone in UKIP says something racist.
p5706
aVBut no that's fine as well, because we should all stop trying to be politically correct.
p5707
aVBritain is doomed.

aVIt's ok, he will change his mind next week again.

aVHonest.
p5710
aV[deleted]
p5711
aVHow come?
p5712
aVPerhaps you should wait to see the video before jumping to conclusions?
p5713
aVI'd hate to see another scenario like the one in which several anti UKIP posters fell for the troll Twitter account impersonating a UKIP MEP, only to have egg on their face when the deception was revealed.
p5714
aVYou have to admit there's a problem when troll accounts are so easily mistaken for genuine UKIP MPs however.
p5715
aVTho to a lesser extent, there's little shock at the stupidity falling from MP's mouths on all sides.
p5716
aVI swear some of them still don't understand that they're likely being recorded whenever they speak and that the internet is a thing.
p5717
aVI seem to remember some UKIP posters fell for it too...\u000a\u000aMuh us and them!
p5718
aVIn fact, I was the one who posted it here - I got it from the UKIP subreddit!
p5719
aVIt wasn't a UKIP supporter who posted it there.
p5720
aVI didn't check who posted it at the time, but it was upvoted and all the Kippers posting at the time believed it as well.
p5721
aVWith several of them even defending the fake post, both there and here.
p5722
aVSo...
p5723
aV&gt;Perhaps you should wait to see the video before jumping to conclusions?
p5724
aVWhich conclusions?
p5725
aVIt's unlikely he'll be in charge of the party this time next week.
p5726
aVIt must get awful tiring, jumping to so many conclusions.
p5727
aVIt must be very tiring being in constant damage control
p5728
aVWhat damage?
p5729
aVThis is good for UKIP.
p5730
aVWhat damage?
p5731
aVSome hyped up headlining from a rag that no one in their right mind takes seriously?
p5732
aVWhich, by the way, speaks volumes about the kind of character you are. 
p5733
aVDo you take any of these articles or headlines seriously?
p5734
aV[Nigel Farage: NHS might have to be replaced by private health insurance](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-nhs-might-have-to-be-replaced-by-private-health-insurance-9988904.html)\u000a\u000a[Nigel Farage: NHS debate 'will be needed' on insurance system](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30877758)\u000a\u000a[Nigel Farage says 'ageing population' requires new debate on NHS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11356057/Nigel-Farage-says-ageing-population-requires-new-debate-on-NHS.html)
p5735
aVWanting a decent debate is one hell of a leap from the Mirror headline, is it not? 
p5736
aVYou're the only one here who's intent on discussing just the mirror's headline but you seem convinced that's what everyone's focusing on.
p5737
aVGoolags for you sir!
p5738
aV&gt;It must get awful tiring, jumping to so many conclusions.
p5739
aVdude, the guys got a fucking jet pack.
p5740
aVThis will be used against him in the Tv debates if they go ahead and will probably be very damaging.
p5741
aVUKIP was rapidly expanding from its libertarian capitalist roots but any mention of the NHS and privatisation will deter a lot of voters from voting UKIP.
p5742
aVIf these debates go ahead I hope the public, many of whom have one policy tunnel vision when it comes to UKIP get to see them for the hard right, ex-tories that they are.
p5743
aVThey'll do nothing but attack working and poor people and divide society if they ever get any real power.
p5744
aVI agree.
p5745
aVThough at the moment, UKIP may well cost the Tories the next general election, so they're not all bad.
p5746
aV:)
p5747
aVIt could go the other way with a tory / ukip coalition, I'm not sure I could actually handle that, makes me think of that Children of Men film.
p5748
aVSorry to be pessimistic!
p5749
aVThe Tories are bound to lose seats.
p5750
aVThey got 36% of the vote last time, they won't reach that in May.
p5751
aVUKIP won't get more than 10 seats at the very most.
p5752
aVIt won't happen.
p5753
aVStop panicking me!
p5754
aVWell if that doesn't lose him a metric fuckton of votes, nothing will.
p5755
aVAs long as he keeps the focus on immigration and a vague notion that the government aren't listening to "the people" then he'll be completely fine.
p5756
aVIt seems UKIPvoters are pretty determined to fuck up the good stuff we still have left.
p5757
aVLike an experiment, let's see what happens if we put a comedian in charge, with a party we've only first heard about a year ago. 
p5758
aVYou seem rather determined to take a quick glance at a Mirror headline and reach a decision.
p5759
aVI hope you don't work as a detective, or in any capacity which requires a modicum of critical thinking. 
p5760
aVIn fairness it's a leading story in many of the UK newspapers, left and right.
p5761
aVIn fairness, some of them have objectively dishonest headlines;\u000a\u000aIndependent; "Nigel Farage: NHS might have to be replaced by private health insurance"\u000a\u000aWhat he actually said;\u000a\u000a"As time goes on, this is a debate that we\u2019re all going to have to return to.\u201d\u000a\u000aHe's saying there will have to be a national debate (frankly he's right, LibLabCon aren't doing voters any favours by pretending there won't have to be some very hard decisions made.
p5762
aV&gt; LibLabCon aren't doing voters any favours by pretending there won't have to be some very hard decisions made.
p5763
aVWhy do you say that?
p5764
aVPretty simple really, it's the same old pre-election dishonesty.
p5765
aVThe parties all promise they won't do something before the election, then once they've won they turn around and say they will actually have to do it (and because they've put off the decision it's now worse).
p5766
aVWhichever party is in power there will have to be some painful decisions; either a massive shift in the structure of the NHS, or a very steep increase in the taxes required to pay for it.
p5767
aVCompare it to energy policy, Labour spent thirteen years being too cowardly to make a hard decision, and now the UK is likely to be on the verge of rolling blackouts in a couple of years.
p5768
aVIf Labour had been willing to make a hard decision (nuclear, renewables, coal, whatever), things wouldn't be so tight now, instead they just tried to avoid the flak they'd have taken whatever decision they made and left the country in a dire position. 
p5769
aVIt would be hard to fuck things up more than the last Labour government, and the Labour voters that put them there.
p5770
aVHow about making it compulsory to smoke in pubs?
p5771
aVEdit: I dont think people are getting my refrence
p5772
aVVotes don't matter, it was decided in 1995 when the UK joined the WTO, remember?
p5773
aVOne way street to privatization!
p5774
aVHow do the hook, line and sinker taste?
p5775
aVI'm not sure they have any voters who aren't blind fanatics.
p5776
aVI guess you'll be voting for them then.
p5777
aVI'm not sure im reading the same story as everyone else.
p5778
aVI read "we will need to discuss how we run the NHS at some point in the future because we have an aging population and its only going to get more expensive" which seems pretty sensible?
p5779
aVAt some point we need to stop ignoring all of our problems and hope they go away.
p5780
aVTo get onto the road to recovery you first need to admit there is a problem, at least then we can have a healthy debate on solutions. 
p5781
aVYou can't have rational debates on the NHS, people are too emotionally attached to it.
p5782
aVWhen you talk about the possibility of paying for the NHS, people instantly assume American system and privatization, even though paying for something doesn't make it any of those things.
p5783
aVWhich is why Labour can weaponize it so effectively.
p5784
aVAnd FYI: I don't support Farage's opinion on this.
p5785
aVI think he NHS needs to remain free forever, no matter what is thrown at it.
p5786
aVJust in case anybody begins to say I'm coming to his defense, I aint, he's solemnly wrong on this issue and he should stay away from it.
p5787
aVYou're totally correct.
p5788
aVHowever, reading the political subtext, realistically this is an admission that Farage is ultimately in favour of privatising the NHS.
p5789
aVNot now, but maybe in the future.
p5790
aVThe question that will face the voters is how much of a premium do you put on a politician who is honest enough to admit what he stands for, even if it costs him votes?
p5791
aVHe at least gets respect from me for being straight about it, where as Milliband or Cameron would just avoid answering any questions that could vaguely cost them seats. 
p5792
aVUKIP Policy would also be to hold a referendum on any big government decisions - So something on this scale would go to the polls and likely be a big no
p5793
aVInsurance based does not mean privatisation.
p5794
aVThere is no 'realistic admission' in hidden subtext, other than the population is getting older and new medicines cost more so this debate isn't going away.
p5795
aVIronically one of the solutions Labour imposed through hospitals with PFI contracts is a direct way to privatisation; and the easiest way to prolong the NHS as it is is to redirect funds into front line services, return to clinician lead services, and put real limits on immigration so you can plan future services efficiently around accurate population predictions - which is all UKIP policy.
p5796
aV&gt; Insurance based does not mean privatisation.
p5797
aVThere is no 'realistic admission' in hidden subtext, other than the population is getting older and new medicines cost more so this debate isn't going away.
p5798
aVWhat else could insurance based mean?
p5799
aVBe realistic - In the current political climate anything short of absolute refusal to ever privatise the NHS is a statement of intent to the contrary. 
p5800
aVLook at some of the European insurance based models.
p5801
aVYou wouldn't say they were privatised.
p5802
aVThey tend to have non-profit operators, charity operators, private operators, as well as state providers, and a communal or public law enforced insurance (like National Insurance used to mean, but dedicated towards health) running in parallel to other systems.
p5803
aVI am being realistic.
p5804
aVI'm asking you to look at the alternatives.
p5805
aVThe point about saying we are going to have this debate in the future is the only way to stop privatisation of the NHS in this climate.
p5806
aVIt's Labour that rolled out PFI to hospitals.
p5807
aVUKIP says have the debate, talk about other revenue streams like they have in Europe, and put the NHS  clinicians back in charge rather than primarily bringing private managers in!
p5808
aVBut if you want to *CHANGE* the political climate you are worried about you have to have the debate at some point, because it is a fact that new medicine and technology is more and more expensive, old technology needs replacing, there are more of us and we are living longer, so at some point in the future we will have to have the debate of alternative systems because the current system is ultimately unsustainable unless we make some changes - but that needn't mean privatisation.
p5809
aVIt will mean privatisation if you don't have the debate and come up with a solution because it'll bankrupt us.
p5810
aVA lot of the European insurance base models really work as a sickness fund kind of thing where contributions from employers/employees go into those instead.
p5811
aVThis is really just another way of allocating the money, it boils down to an extra tax very similar to National Insuarance - people and employers are still paying for it and it costs more per capita.
p5812
aVThe rate of growth of costs per capita for the health service will be on trend with other countries so this isn't really forcing us to move to a different insurance based system at all.
p5813
aVIt's just the fact that there is an aging population and insurance based health care would need to cost more as well, not saving us any money or increasing investment beyond what is being put in.
p5814
aVIf you accept the fact that costs will increase regardless of what system you use, raising tax/national insurance by a few % points to cover it is effectively the same as paying privately into an insurance pot.
p5815
aVGiven that our system is already one of the most cost effective it's hard to imagine a reason to change.
p5816
aVObviously it is still worth analyzing options, but in this situation there is a lot of evidence already available and all of it points to the quality of the NHS versus other systems.

aVMy fiancée is American, I've heard first-hand how terrible the American system is for everyone not running the hospitals.

p5821
aV&gt;Would you be fine with the German system though?
p5822
aVThe NHS gives better outcomes for lower percent-GDP cost.
p5823
aVWhat the NHS needs is for politicians to stop sabotaging it, not a root-and-branch change to a completely different health-care delivery system like the German model.
p5824
aVThe overall structure of the NHS is not the underlying problem; resourcing and priorities are the problems.
p5825
aVThe main problem is that the Tories are hell-bent on depriving it of resources and mismanaging it so that they can have an excuse for more privatisation at 10p to the pound to their cronies.
p5826
aVAnd they have form: look at the Royal Mail for an illustrative example. \u000a\u000a

p5830
aVI'm going to play devil's advocate and ask for more about this, too.
p5831
aVWe all hear the horror stories about the US, but I don't know much about other countries private systems.
p5832
aVI'm currently in Finland and tbh really hope we don't get a similar system.
p5833
aVI have health insurance with my employer but it covers SO little, and private treatment is incredibly expensive, and private health is dominated by one very large provider - and mine and other expats experience with them has definitely been worse than the NHS.
p5834
aVPublic health treatment appears to have very limited availability indeed. 
p5835
aVI'm in the Netherlands and I see a lot of parallels with your experience.
p5836
aVIts certainly not a lot better than the UK and there is a lot more bureaucracy on the patient/customer side of things.
p5837
aVIf I want a certain treatment or have a particular condition then you always have to check what is covered and what is not.
p5838
aVYou also have to check regularly whether you are getting a good deal and then for each treatment there is generally a bit of paperwork (depending on what you are having done).
p5839
aVThere are small things that are better here but on the whole the simplicity of the NHS model is a big plus for me.
p5840
aVCHOICE!
p5841
aVThats big in the US too, **its important that the natural segentation of the market not be distorted by subsidies of any kind.

aV**\u000a\u000a***Otherwise people wont have skin in the game***.
p5843
aVWhy would somebody pay $75,000 a year for good health insurance if they could get perfectly adequate health insurance for $20,000?

p5851
aVThink small, very small. 
p5852
aVPeople would still buy private insurance although fewer would.

aVWell its all a moot point, its forbidden for the governments to have monopolies that compete unfairly with investors.
p5856
aVIts a question of priorities.
p5857
aVInternational capital is very fickle.
p5858
aVMany governments are basically Ponzi schemes.
p5859
aVIf they were to trample on investors rights as they did back in the 80s and earlier, stocks might fall. 
p5860
aV&gt;  its forbidden for the governments to have monopolies that compete unfairly with investors.
p5861
aVMaybe we should change that law, then?
p5862
aVIn this specific instance a nationalised healthcare system with the option of going private is preferable.
p5863
aV"Freedom Isn't Free"\u000a\u000aYou would have to BUY that freedom back, and wait many years, paying them back for their projected future profits and their market value.
p5864
aVAs you know, health care is worth a lot of money.
p5865
aVSo, get ready to pay trillions, (or maybe just hundreds of billions since you are a small country.
p5866
aVProperty rights are a matter of principle.
p5867
aVYou should read up on the Achmea v. Slovak Republic case .. \u000a\u000ahttp://italaw.com/cases/417\u000a\u000ahttp://italaw.com/cases/2564\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso, Antigua v. US WTO online gambling case
p5868
aV&gt; Property rights are a matter of principle.
p5869
aVIf that principle harms society then I'd rather it was disregarded in this case.
p5870
aVThe better society is preferable to the most highly principled society.
p5871
aVNobody asked you.
p5872
aVYou dont even exist.
p5873
aVThe agreements don't say anything about that.
p5874
aV[POLITCIANS] should have thought about that before they signed the British equivalent of the Uruguay Round Authorization Act - perhaps the most important document in history up to that point, the US signed it in 1995.
p5875
aVAnd the UK did too.
p5876
aV[Read this for some deeper understanding](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf) of this issue.

aV-----\u000a\u000aUnfortunately [its brilliant young author, who you can see in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWBZz070m-k), unexpectedly died a few weeks later.
p5878
aV&gt; Nobody asked you.
p5879
aVYou dont even exist.
p5880
aVRight.
p5881
aVWell that's your opinion and not one I agree with.
p5882
aVIf this GATS thing is really so terrible we should just leave it.\u000a
p5883
aVSee the GATS Article 21 procedure.
p5884
aVIt'll cost you.
p5885
aVSome huge sum of money.
p5886
aVThey are designed to be impossible to leave.
p5887
aVDo you understand what I am saying?
p5888
aVThe UK isnt about to leave the WTO.
p5889
aVNor is the US.
p5890
aVIts not some little thing, its a global coup they are successfully enacting without anybody's knowledge, in back rooms.
p5891
aVWell then obviously we need to do something about it.
p5892
aVEveryone is doing their part to ***prevent deflation*** in this important period.
p5893
aVI am just joking.
p5894
aVYou do exist to me.
p5895
aVBut I dont matter either.
p5896
aVAs I am not either multinational or incorporated.
p5897
aVNor do i have 6000 lobbyists.
p5898
aV&gt; I wouldn't like to live in a country without socialised healthcare, nor would I like to live in pods rented by the hour.
p5899
aVWell, public services are going away everywhere.
p5900
aVNo profit, its a theft.
p5901
aVAs is public education.
p5902
aVThe future is established education brands.
p5903
aVValue added.
p5904
aV"Why give people unrealistic expectations" I heard someone say recently.
p5905
aVThere is not the need there used to be for them because fewer and fewer people are working and they are less and less important all the time.
p5906
aVYes, crowd out is a problem, and will become much more serious, but basically what that means is that capital will cluster in the firms and countries that have established their rights most effectively.
p5907
aVInvestors will move with their feet.
p5908
aV&gt; Well, public services are going away everywhere.
p5909
aVNo profit, its a theft.
p5910
aVI prefer this "theft" to a ruthless pursuit of profit.
p5911
aVProfiteering damages public services.\u000a
p5912
aVNo nonconforming monopolies damage profiteering.
p5913
aVAlso, politicians have to be given something to do.
p5914
aVISDS takes away their ability to do racticall anything except churn.
p5915
aVOtherwise they adversely effect profits and that creates a uge potential liability.
p5916
aVSo they can churn\u000a\u000a\u000aUnless you are you an international corporation or a nation-state you have no standing, BTW.
p5917
aVAs Frank Zapa once said.
p5918
aV**The rights to you have already been sold.
p5919
aV**
p5920
aVWell, I'm still going to do my best to campaign to protect the NHS.
p5921
aVI think the NHS is an incredibly important public service and the alternative will prevent poor people getting access to the medical care they need.
p5922
aVAllyson Pollock has a lot to say about this.
p5923
aVWatch out for TISA, \u000a\u000aHint:That'- not TTIP so much, is the services one..\u000a\u000aServices as in *health insurance*.. \u000a\u000aBritain cannot stand in the way if you sign.

aVPoliticians have absolutely NO say so whatever they say is useless chatter to shut people up for now.
p5925
aVMillion euro jobs waiting for them soon.

aVThat's the drill.
p5927
aVThat's what they do in your neighbor to the west.
p5928
aVPretend to disagree to conceal their capitulations.
p5929
aVAnd often they outright lie too.
p5930
aVThey have to, otherwise people would catch on.
p5931
aV&gt;Profiteering damages *"public services"*.
p5932
aVStrike that word from your vocabulary.
p5933
aVThe new word is MONOPOLY.
p5934
aVAnd its a theft from the owners, the mega-corporations that develop it.
p5935
aVpublic healthcare is a [moral hazard](http://kaiserpapers.org) the way things are going.
p5936
aVAlso, people have to have skin in the game so they know the value of money.
p5937
aVWe will have suspended animation soon, people could be put into it until their families can come up with the money.
p5938
aV(assuming its before their use by date)\u000a\u000aHows that for market in-elasticity?
p5939
aV;)  The name of the big profit game is market inelasticity.
p5940
aVBuy or die.
p5941
aVAlso, another aspect of trade in SERVICES - is the trade in services..labor mobility- "mode four" "the fourth mode of supply" \u000a\u000athink about this, how would UK corporate players get access to emergent markets if their golfing buddies on the government side of the revolving door could not trade those millions of teaching and nursing and the biggest prize of all, rapidly growing prison industries, contracts in those newly privatized entities for them?
p5942
aVHow else to attract countries like Burma and North Korea into the FTA system than to let them *do what they do best?
p5943
aV* Kind of like baby farming!
p5944
aV*I know NOTHING* nudge nudge wink wink.
p5945
aVTrade newly privatized contracts for access to them.
p5946
aVWith at least a decade or two of growth ahead of them.

aVthose new bargaining chips you're not in the game!
p5949
aVEmergent markets will *still be growing* for at least another ten years, maybe fifteen.
p5950
aV&gt; Strike that word from your vocabulary.
p5951
aVThe new word is MONOPOLY.
p5952
aVUhhh... no.
p5953
aVI'm not going to support a society that deconstructs public services in favour of ruthless capitalism.
p5954
aV"Buy or die" is a morally reprehensible idea and so clearly laws need to be brought in to oppose developments that could lead to that situation.
p5955
aVI couldn't give a fig about "getting in the game" if the price is poor people being unable to get healthcare.
p5956
aVThat's not a bug it's a feature.
p5957
aV&gt;Uhhh... no.
p5958
aVI'm not going to support a society that deconstructs public services in favour of ruthless capitalism.
p5959
aVThe whole idea of the FTAs is to ensure stability, so they planned ahead, they dont need votes.
p5960
aVIt takes these important things out of the hands of fickle politicians.
p5961
aVGo ahead, vote all you want.
p5962
aV***Even South Africa with a revolution was still bound by the pre revolution FTA.
p5963
aV***\u000a\u000a&gt;"Buy or die" is a morally reprehensible idea\u000a\u000awhat do you mean by "morally reprehensible"?
p5964
aVI don't see a word about that in my dictionary.
p5965
aV&gt;and so clearly laws need to be brought in to oppose developments \u000a\u000aSee above, "laws" make no difference.
p5966
aVIf these "laws" are enacted, a country can not be sued until they actually IMPLEMENT it.
p5967
aVSo you still have freedom to ENACT laws, just not to IMPLEMENT them.
p5968
aVThats important because it lets politicians promise things so they can get elected.. ;) wink  \u000a\u000aAnd look like they are doing someting, arguing!
p5969
aVFor some reason they never agree!
p5970
aV*Shhhhh!
p5971
aV*\u000a\u000a&gt;that could lead to that situation.
p5972
aVI couldn't give a fig about "getting in the game" if the price is poor people being unable to get healthcare.
p5973
aVAs I said earlier, thats not a bug, its a feature.
p5974
aVOtherwise, there would be social unrest of the politicians couldn't blame one another.
p5975
aVYou have to understand the industrial era is ending.
p5976
aVWorkers are no longer needed to man the machines of industry.
p5977
aVJust to consume the products of it.
p5978
aV&gt;what do you mean by "morally reprehensible"?
p5979
aVI don't see a word about that in my dictionary.
p5980
aV"If you can't afford to pay this large sum of money, then we're not going to treat you for cancer and you'll die.

aV"\u000a\u000aDo you not see any issue with this?
p5982
aVIf it wasn't for the NHS, both my parents would be dead.
p5983
aVIt all has to do with value.
p5984
aVThe market determines the value.
p5985
aVHow could the rights to a market that didn't have any concept of value be sold profitably?
p5986
aVCountries who gang up on the poor corporations to extort a service for less than its cost are stealing.

aVThe 20 century was about human rights.

aV***But corporations are people*** too, so the 21st century is about corporate rights.
p6002
aVWell, they will have to, you cannot have both public and private.
p6003
aVRead the fine print.
p6004
aVWell if we can't have public AND private, we should do away with private healthcare.

aV**GATS Article 21 procedure?

aVFreedom isn't free.
p6008
aV&gt;GATS Article 21 procedure?
p6009
aVI don't know what that is, but if it means we can't have public healthcare then it should be disregarded.
p6010
aVHow?
p6011
aVDon't you know what ***"indirect expropriation"*** is?
p6012
aV&gt;I don't know what that is, \u000a\u000aLearn!
p6013
aV&gt;but if it means we can't have public healthcare \u000a\u000aYou mean MONOPOLIES.
p6014
aVYou should have thought about that before you signed it in 1995.
p6015
aVRead this for some background about [GATS and health care](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf).
p6016
aV&gt;then it should be disregarded.
p6017
aVImpossible, [the UK will get hauled into court](http://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National_Office_Pubs/putting_health_first.pdf) and the UK will lose.
p6018
aVHold on for a second, Finland?
p6019
aVThat sounds more like US Mengeled care.
p6020
aVLess is more.
p6021
aVOpen up wide for the Doctor. 
p6022
aV&gt; I don't know why people have this mentality of "it's either the NHS or america"\u000a\u000aPerhaps because the private healthcare providers lobby so hard in this country?
p6023
aVFor example, consider [this article](http://socialinvestigations.blogspot.nl/2014/03/compilation-of-parliamentary-financial.html).
p6024
aVMake sure to scroll down, past the names of the members of the House of Lords, until you can see the huge number of MPs with health care links.
p6025
aVI counted 81.
p6026
aVIf we abandoned the single payer system, then I, and I'm sure some others on this sub-reddit, have very little confidence that the government of the day wouldn't follow the bribes.
p6027
aVUnless we first get proper reform of lobbying, I am very worried that we'd up with Obamacare Mark 2.
p6028
aVI'd rather stick with the NHS we currently have than take that sort of risk.
p6029
aVBecause the NHS is perfect and look how bad the only other system in the world is - bad 'Mericans.
p6030
aVSo, guys, it's NHS or Yankee style failure.
p6031
aVtake your pick!
p6032
aVLiterally nobody would say the NHS is perfect.
p6033
aVI'd defend it to my last breath but I'd never ever say it's perfect.
p6034
aVIts ranked as the best in the world, but its still far from perfect.
p6035
aVneeds more money and less privatisation of services.
p6036
aVWell, we will watch the video of what he actually said and find out.
p6037
aVWell, Insurance systems does not equal American system.
p6038
aVEeeeasy, it's another misleading pile of tosh.
p6039
aV&gt;"But in a new BBC interview to be aired this morning, Mr Farage says ditching the NHS is \u201ca debate we\u2019re going to have to return to"  \u000a\u000aThe rest of it is from 2012.
p6040
aVDirect democracy, debating is a key ukip policy.
p6041
aVCare to explain why an article that starts by emotively guiding with "Slippery nigel" should be taken seriously by anyone old enough to write?
p6042
aV"Thatcher - loving Nigel" was also pretty laughable.
p6043
aV[deleted]
p6044
aVProbably.
p6045
aVBut the average mirror reader doesn't.
p6046
aVIt's pretty blatantly manipulative, and I'm saying that as someone who doesn't like Farage. 
p6047
aV\u000a&gt;Care to explain why an article that starts by emotively guiding with "Slippery nigel" should be taken seriously by anyone old enough to write?
p6048
aVThe Mirror is left wing so it's OK 
p6049
aVHaving not seen the video I can't comment on it, but to play Devils advocate, why do you assume an insurance based healthcare system must be USA style?
p6050
aVFrance has insurance based healthcare too after all.
p6051
aVFrance's national healthcare system is incomparable to the US.
p6052
aVIt's universal for starters and "insurance" is taken at source - it's a tax in all but name.
p6053
aVThey also pay *much* less per head out of GDP than the US, yet more than the UK, funnily enough.
p6054
aVBut I suspect you already knew that.
p6055
aVGood thing Farage didn't actually say he wanted a US style system then, he's said a dutch and French style one.
p6056
aVMost of France's healthcare is covered by government funding, similar to the NHS. 
p6057
aVYes, and Farage supports a publicly-funded insurance model.
p6058
aVThe criticism Farage makes is about public operation, not its financing. 
p6059
aVYou can have insurance based healthcare that is predominantly government funded, like Germany now has.
p6060
aVYou have a public insurance model, or a communal insurance pot.
p6061
aVPlease excuse my ad hominem, but my presumption is that Farage doesn't want to copy anything from Europe.
p6062
aVThat's not true.
p6063
aVThey talk about Swiss style Direct Democracy, German style education (especially around trades and apprenticeships which they wish to emulate).
p6064
aVThey even advocate an EU style immigration policy as endorsed by Juncker for those outside the EU coming in, but only applied  to those outside the UK coming in.
p6065
aVWhy would you say something like that?
p6066
aVYou don't believe they're anti-European, surely?
p6067
aVThey're opposed to being part of an EU political union.
p6068
aVThat's a presumption that you would only get if you only get your news from biased left-wing sources.
p6069
aVFarage is a fan of many things about Europe, including its women, if you consider who he married.
p6070
aVHe just dislikes the EU, as every rational person should.
p6071
aVThat's just silly.
p6072
aVThat's childish in the extreme (and hopefully just a rather weak joke), lots of anti-EU politicians are very pro-European, it's just the childish "leave EU = xenophobe" argument we see over and over.
p6073
aVYou can see something positively without wishing to be subsumed into it.
p6074
aVHe's married to a German for God's sake!
p6075
aVAny western European style of funding healthcare is fine; most are at least partly insurance based.
p6076
aVA U.S. style is not.
p6077
aVVery high costs per person despite a low standard of care and illness is the cause of 80% of bankruptcies and of those 80% half did have insurance.
p6078
aVI think wanting to create a system that resembles it in any way is madness.
p6079
aVIf I recall correctly, Farage is also a big fan of the U.S. justice system which is without a doubt the worst in any developed country.  
p6080
aVYou realise that when talking about it Farage has always talked in future terms of the Dutch or French systems, and it's the papers that are hearing 'insurance' and making it synonymous with the US, do you?
p6081
aVA French or Dutch based system?
p6082
aVBoth those countries have a higher public expenditure on healthcare than the U.K.
p6083
aVIsn't that the opposite of what Farage wants?
p6084
aVWestern European system ***are not*** insurance based.
p6085
aVThe vast majority is paid for by the government with a token amount paid by citizens.
p6086
aVInsurance based system are basically confined to the U.S. and the third world.
p6087
aVFarage is going to have to make himself very, very clear here.
p6088
aVAnd if they had NICE they'd have cheaper systems too.
p6089
aVOf course doing away with NICE isn't a prerequisite of either the French or Dutch systems - but you only have to step outside your own bubble to see why any French system will always cost more than the UKs - for the same reason France has no real bus services outside the cities and why you see big, expensive paramedic saloons driving everywhere outside the cities and not ambulances.
p6090
aVThere's a geographic aspect.
p6091
aVHaving said that the French standard of care, speaking from experience, is excellent, and I say that as a big supporter of the average NHS level of care.
p6092
aVThey spend more, providing a service over less dense population, but boy what a service!
p6093
aV&gt;Isn't that the opposite of what Farage wants?
p6094
aVWestern European system are not insurance based.
p6095
aVFrance, Germany, Holland, Spain?
p6096
aVSpain has a regional Convenio Especial, France has its Carte Vitale where the state insurance  reimburses 70% of a GP visit costs if they aren't waived, and Germany has Gesetzliche and Private Krankenversicherung or mandatory public insurance with voluntary private insurance.
p6097
aV&gt;Insurance based system are basically confined to the U.S. and the third world.
p6098
aVThat's nonsense.
p6099
aVIf you don't know what you're talking about don't make assertions.
p6100
aVIt sounds like you're getting insurance confused with privatisation and again with necessarily non-universal coverage.
p6101
aVEdit:\u000a\u000aYou even contradicted your previous comment,     \u000a\u000a       "Any western European style of funding healthcare is fine; \u000a        most are at least partly insurance based.
p6102
aV"\u000a\u000aHow you can go from saying *"most are at least partly insurance based"* to *"insurance based system are basically confined to the U.S. and the third world"* to suit your argument boggles the mind.
p6103
aVI had to check that you were the same commenter!
p6104
aVPlease don't say mistruths to avoid the inconvenient, it's not conducive.
p6105
aVHigher expenditure =/= worse system.
p6106
aVIf we spent more on the NHS it wouldn't be worse after all.
p6107
aVMost of Europe does in fact use an insurance based system of sorts; insurance-based =/= privatised, it just happens that the US system is both. 
p6108
aVWhen did Nigel Farage ever say "American style"?
p6109
aVThe insurance scheme Farage supports is along the French, Canadian or German models.
p6110
aVThe "American style" description is made up crap from the Daily Mirror to scare people.
p6111
aVWe generally don't accept the Mail as a valid source on here, so why are we accepting the Mirror's bullshit?
p6112
aVGermany has a pretty similar system to America.
p6113
aVWhat are the issues with that?
p6114
aVExcept this is never UKIP policy, and never was.
p6115
aVIt was Farage's ideas about how things could be done at a party.
p6116
aVFarage isn't saying it will be UKIP policy.
p6117
aVHe is saying that UKIP needs a policy to deal with changes in the UK population.
p6118
aVPersonally, I think the NHS as it is will be fine, but I get a little tired of these articles trashing and misrepresenting UKIP.
p6119
aVHow about attacking their actual policies.
p6120
aVThey're available from UKIP's home page.
p6121
aVYou don't *need* to invent new ones to attack. 
p6122
aV&gt; Germany has a pretty similar system to America.
p6123
aVWhat are the issues with that?
p6124
aVYou have *got* to be kidding.
p6125
aVAbout what?
p6126
aVAbout the fact that a Germany's multi-payer, insurance based system is fairly similar to that of the US, or that Germany doesn't have any fundamental issues with its health care system?\u000a\u000a
p6127
aVThe German system is not comparable.
p6128
aVThe US system has a number of differences (although slightly less than with the US).
p6129
aVThis ranges from things like the 'basic package' of care through to regulations regarding pre-existing conditions etc.
p6130
aVWhen it comes to insurance markets, there are millions of potential differences in the legislative framework that can be implemented which fundamentally change the nature, quantity and quality of care. 
p6131
aVGermany has a universal healthcare system.
p6132
aVThat, from the very outset, is a *fundamental* difference.
p6133
aVThey have a slightly convoluted scheme for paying for the healthcare - some of from taxes, some of it from **non-profit** insurance "funds".
p6134
aVInsurance costs for the employed are shared 50/50 with the employer.
p6135
aVIt may as well be a tax.
p6136
aVOur "National Insurance" isn't insurance, after all.
p6137
aVAlso, Germany spends almost 50% per capita *less* than the US on healthcare, but 30% more than the UK.
p6138
aVI don't know where you got this idea from, but you've been sold a pup.
p6139
aV&gt; some of from taxes, some of it from non-profit insurance "funds".
p6140
aVVery little from taxes.
p6141
aVThe split is usually 50/50 employer/employee.
p6142
aVAnd the funding from the insurance goes directly to the insurance scheme, and then to hospitals.
p6143
aVNone of it goes into the general taxation pool.
p6144
aVThe British government could raise NI and reduce NHS funding or vice versa as they choose because the two are not linked.
p6145
aVGermany could not do that.
p6146
aV&gt; It may as well be a tax.
p6147
aVCan say the same for the US, post Obamacare.
p6148
aV&gt; Also, Germany spends almost 50% per capita less than the US on healthcare, but 30% more than the UK.
p6149
aVYes.
p6150
aVSo they have a better funding model.
p6151
aVIt's still an insurance based private healthcare scheme rather than a government based public scheme.
p6152
aVThe point here is that Germany can run the type of system that Farage was talking about and make it a success.
p6153
aVNeither.
p6154
aVThe German system very tightly regulates insurance companies, and if they tried some of the sinister practises that are so common among US insurance companies, the regulators would shut them down.
p6155
aVThe US system is dominated by a health-insurance oligopoly and there is little to no accountability.
p6156
aVThis isn't just a theoretical concern: denial of care by insurers kills Americans.
p6157
aVAlso, the US does not have universal coverage, though Obamacare was a timid and poorly-implemented move in that direction.
p6158
aVIt would make a certain amount of sense for the US to move to a system more like that in Germany.
p6159
aVBut there is absolutely no reason to abandon the NHS for a private-insurance system.
p6160
aVIt would raise costs and is unlikely to impove outcomes.
p6161
aVAlso, the funding model is entirely different than the UK now has, and the roll-out would be hugely disruptive.
p6162
aVSo what reason would you have to do that to yourself?
p6163
aVAn ideological conviction that private provision is better than public provision, despite well-documented evidence of it being more costly and less effective?
p6164
aVThe fact that he doesn't want an American Style health care service is one.
p6165
aVWhen he has suggested it he has suggested versions like that in France and Holland.
p6166
aVIts just the Mirror being the Mirror.
p6167
aVHe explicitly says he doesn't want an American-style system.
p6168
aVWill that do?
p6169
aVI'm not a ukip supporter, but my objections to the nhs is the same objection I have for every government programme; if I can't opt out of it, it's essentially extortion.
p6170
aVExtortion with the best of intent, but extortion all the same.
p6171
aVAt least the American system (in theory, anyway) gives you a choice.
p6172
aVThat said I don't think ukip have any idea what they are doing and will almost certainly cause far more problems trying to remove the nhs than if it were just left alone.
p6173
aVI may be an idealist in the abstract, but I'm not completely separated from reality.
p6174
aVThe US system doesn't give you a choice in most cases.
p6175
aVYou have to have health insurance.
p6176
aVThe reason being that given free choices, the system effectively collapses.
p6177
aVThis is what Obama care has been about.
p6178
aVI agree that 'liberty' and free choice is important but in some instances it shits on everything else.
p6179
aVYou can try a nice middle ground where you have to have insurance but you get to choose which policy but grandstanding on principles of freedom just drags the debate away from the reality of creating a sustainable market/system for health care.
p6180
aVHence why I noted "in theory".
p6181
aVThere are problems with the US system, yes, but it's a failure of implementation and external economic issues, primarily due to corporatisation thats verging on oligarchy.
p6182
aVRegardless I'm not arguing for the removal of the nhs or any programme.
p6183
aVI'd ideally like it to be voluntary with alternatives, but there would need to be extensive reforms and safety nets put in place before such a transition even got passed the planning stages.
p6184
aVThe problem with healthcare though, is that when you need it most, very few of us would be in the position to be able to pay for it on our own.
p6185
aVThe idea with a national Health service like the NHS is that we all put in and then when one of us needs it, its there.
p6186
aVand you can opt out.
p6187
aVYou can leave the country, but while you live here, you are benefiting from our society, you are eligible to benefit from the infrastructure our society supplies and so its only fair that you also contribute in a fair way towards it upkeep.
p6188
aVSo then how do you feel about being forced to pay for roads, water utilities, and schools?
p6189
aVI'm not being flippant, I'm genuinely curious - would you opt out of paying for these sort of things?
p6190
aVIt's just that roads allow other business and people to travel, water allows people to live, and schools can provide an educated workforce.
p6191
aVIf you had the chance to opt out, would you no longer be able to benefit from these?
p6192
aVWell if given the opportunity to opt out, others would presumably offer competing services you could choose to use instead.
p6193
aVMost water services are actually handled by private companies already, and there are private schools.
p6194
aVWhether I'd opt out or not would depend on the alternative.
p6195
aVThe ability to choose is the important point.
p6196
aVIf I choose not to pay now, I get arrested, fined, have all my property repossessed and imprisoned if I resist.
p6197
aVI wonder why the clip wasn't posted in the article.
p6198
aVModerately pro-EU centre-leftist here.
p6199
aVIt is astonishing how different accounts of what he says in newspapers are to videos of him saying it.
p6200
aVPolitical PR these days is that you release details of speeches and interviews before they've aired, so that they are in the morning news, not yesterday's news.
p6201
aVHave you not noticed the plethora of articles where it says "to be aired later today..." Or "in a speech X will give this afternoon..."  Or the most common one: "In next week's budget..."
p6202
aVWhat's shady about this practice is that what is actually spoken doesn't always match the text that was pre-released
p6203
aVJournalists can't very well let reality ruin their professional spin now can they?
p6204
aVWhen has Farage called for US style healthcare?
p6205
aVHe's explained his previous comments were about more of a European set up which people may or not agree with but they work far better than the US system.
p6206
aVIs this just mirror propaganda? 
p6207
aVWhat's the difference between US and European style insurance, if you don't mind my asking?
p6208
aVI genuinely don't know.
p6209
aVI've never seen it satisfactorily explained in the press.
p6210
aVI have European style health coverage.
p6211
aVI have what is called a Carte Vitale (everyone in the French system does).
p6212
aVTo see a GP I have to pay \u20ac24 per visit but individual doctors may charge more, of which 70% of the \u20ac24 is refundable via your carte vitale.
p6213
aVYou will then be expected to pay more for prescribed medicines.
p6214
aVThe cost is offset if you're a student or on low income, and you're not eligible for costs if it is a long term condition or the more serious it is.
p6215
aVThe offset of this is that waiting times to get an appointment for a GP are non-existent.
p6216
aVIt's all same morning or same afternoon.
p6217
aVIt also means a higher percentage of the public spend goes on serious conditions, the elderly, or the poor.
p6218
aVOnly two thirds of French hospitals are publicly owned.
p6219
aVMany people then elect to have top up insurance to cover any surprise prescription costs or dental costs.
p6220
aVWhat the state does seem able to do is deliver a more thorough system by priortising free at the point of use for emergencies and long term conditions, or only for those on low incomes.
p6221
aVI don't spend much time at the doctors but I had people from the UK visiting in the summer when there was a wine &amp; barbecue related injury, and for an anecdote they'd already said how frustrating they found it to get an appointment in the UK so it was with some deep seated suspicion they got in the car to see our French doctor - largely expecting a bit of a run around.
p6222
aVEven though they didn't have the French paperwork or carte vitale he offered to print off the relevant docs so he could claim \u20ac17 back from the NHS, but at \u20ac24 he was throwing his money at him and saying don't bother - all because he'd been able to walk into the doctors around 4:30 and be out for around 5:30 on the same day.
p6223
aVThey were blown away at how much sense and efficiency it made, that it was more means tested, especially when comparing the paperwork they'd filled out for him and how it would have all gone through a carte vitale if set up.
p6224
aVFarage has specified he was talking particularly about the dutch and french systems.
p6225
aVAs far as I know the dutch arrangement has a state operated insurance system which covers the most serious stuff.
p6226
aVIn the US they don't have this public option which many wanted in the recent reforms so you're forced to used private insurance companies which often don't pay up and leave people indebted for life.
p6227
aVJust read the reams of horror stories about the US system on reddit alone, people getting billed insane amounts for the most trivial problems.
p6228
aVI've not heard these kind of complaints about European health care. 
p6229
aVYou don't go bankrupt because you can't pay for treatment in the European model but you still get less access to care if you are poor.
p6230
aVMental health is a good example - I know a couple of people in the Netherlands who haven't gone for mental health treatment because it isn't covered by their insurance and they can't afford to pay.
p6231
aVIt's a vast amount better than the US system, and hasn't created the sort of glimpse into a libertarian dystopia that the US has, but it does have flaws.
p6232
aVAs does the NHS model, I might add.
p6233
aVEdit: Oh, I should also note that it works far better in a more egalitarian society.
p6234
aVThe European model only works because they have strong unemployment support, and everyone has access to a decent standard of living.
p6235
aVInsurance costs about 120 euros per month even at the cheapest end, and you are legally required to have it if you work.
p6236
aVSo people working minimum wage jobs part time really struggle, and a lot of people in the UK would too.
p6237
aVOur system ensures that the richest pay a LOT more, which is much fairer in such an unequal economy. 
p6238
aVThe Europeans regulate their private markets.
p6239
aVThe US barely does.
p6240
aVMight be better to find out what the quote is before commenting, after all\u000a\u000aBut in a new BBC interview to be aired this morning, Mr Farage says ditching the NHS is \u201ca debate we\u2019re going to have to return to\u201d.
p6241
aV!=\u000aBut in a new BBC interview to be aired this morning, Mr Farage says "ditching the NHS is a debate we\u2019re going to have to return to\u201d.\u000a
p6242
aVNot surprised really.
p6243
aVRoger Helmer also wants a US Healthcare system instilled in the UK, in fact he stated that 80% of Americans receive better care than the NHS provides us.
p6244
aVUKIP are modern Thatcherites, dropping the NHS into the hands of the private market would be a dream come true for them.
p6245
aVBut they know its too toxic with the public to say it outright so they have to go about it discussing 'alternatives like insurance systems' and hiding behind political speak instead.
p6246
aVI think the real problem is that parties on the right have different interpretations of what a "free market" is.
p6247
aVUKIP and the Tories generally mean that the market is minimally regulated.
p6248
aVThey don't mean that the market is regulated to enforce competition among providers (as happens in the German health-insurance market).
p6249
aVThis is a common problem in English-speaking countries.
p6250
aVThe result is oligopoly and rent-seeking.
p6251
aVYou want to see what a private-provider health-care system will look like in the UK?
p6252
aVLook at the energy or rail markets, not at the German health system.
p6253
aVWhen you have a major party that objects in principle to enforcing competition, that's what will happen when they get into office.
p6254
aVIf you want your health-care system to be held ransom by large corporations that have no accountability to anyone but their shareholders, go right ahead and pretend you are adopting the German model.
p6255
aVWhat you'll really get is the health-care equivalent of the privatised rail network. 
p6256
aVI love how the papers today are smearing.
p6257
aVFarage said there will need to be a debate on the current arrangements of the NHS\u000a\u000aEvery paper: FARAGE WANTS TO REPLACE NHS!!!!!!
p6258
aVThe reason why the system is failing us is simply because we don't allow debate on the health system.
p6259
aVIt's like some sort of kingdom of heaven to lefties. 
p6260
aVI think it's failing because it's being deliberately dismantled with the aim of full privatisation.
p6261
aVWhich is, let's be honest, what both Cameron and Farage would like to see happen.
p6262
aVAnyone with two braincells can translate his politician speak to privatisation. 
p6263
aVSurely this will lose him a load of those working class votes he seems to want so bad.
p6264
aVThe NHS is brilliant. 
p6265
aVYet, American media would lead their viewers to believe that most Britons are unhappy with their healthcare system.
p6266
aVI wouldn't mind that if they offered free insurance to those who need it and regulated the price and lowered taxes due to the savings made.
p6267
aVSo no £1000 for a doctors visit, but paying for what you use instead of paying all the time.
p6268
aVYeah because insurance companies in America in no way have a history of jacking up insurance premium prices over tiny indiscrepancies or illnesses, have in no way treated the people of the US like fucking cattle to such an extent that the US Government had to enshrine in law that practices such as unjustified rate hikes, dropping insurance claimants when they actually became ill or denying you coverage based on your health status purely to stop them from doing it.
p6269
aVNo, this hasn't happened at all.
p6270
aVNot even fucking once to any US citizen ever.
p6271
aVOk, I'm saying don't have those bad things
p6272
aVNo, what you're saying is "Let's have our cake and eat it.
p6273
aV" and what I'm saying is "Dude that cake is like three weeks old and I'm pretty sure someone jizzed in it"
p6274
aVNope, I'm saying lets have low tax and cheap healthcare rather than high tax and free cosmetic surgery
p6275
aVDo you really plan to reject reality and substitute your own, in the process risking the health of millions of people including yourself for the sake of the modicum of pride that comes from a frankly kind of featherweight debate online?
p6276
aVIf we go with the US Model, we will have the US Model's problems.
p6277
aVIt is that simple. 
p6278
aVYou don't have to exactly copy someone if using the same idea, you can improve on it you know
p6279
aVWould you trust our Government, or any Government for that matter, to forsee the issues I stated and nip them in the bud?
p6280
aVAfter all it's not like the Insurance Companies will lobby to advise Government on insurance.
p6281
aVYou know, like Health Care Service Providors do in regards to NHS Privatisation or like transport companies do in regard to what is quickly becoming a revolving door of privatisation and nationalisation in that department or like accountancy firms do in regards to financial matters like selling off the Royal Mail in which the accountaincy firms themselves undervalued it, bought a shit-ton of shares and made millions on top of their contract, or like Babcock International now running the Defence Support Group which provides and repairs equipment for our armed forces.
p6282
aVThis is the same Babcock, by the way, that seems to perform with stellar efficiency and quality when under private sector contracts but has repeatedly fucked its' standard services up when on the Government's money.
p6283
aVSo yeah, sure.
p6284
aVI bet our Government will in no way bring a person or company with an Insurance background to advise them on the legislation of any such Insurance-based provision of medical services and I'm sure that person or company will make the risks of Insurance Companies screwing people over for the sake of profit (like they already do and have a long history of doing in the US) because on this occasion I'm sure they'll just want to be so fucking NICE to us won't they?
p6285
aVI can't tell what's worse, the fact that you honestly think that the current system wherein everyone automatically gets insurance (It's called "National Insurance" by the way, look at your paycheck) at a fixed rate that costs almost nothing, will never be revoked as long as you are a citizen of this country, pays for medical treatment regardless of your employment or social status, doesn't discriminate based on past or present health issues or family medical history and is not only completely organised and recorded and processed by the Government so you can focus on getting better rather than trying to remember the exact date you were first admitted to hospital as a child because a long-ass pile of forms in front of you demands to know...with this, a system wherein companies will bid with one another to fuck you over as much as possible while calmly telling you that they'll fuck you over the least with a shit eating grin on their face.
p6286
aVI can tell you now, there's no way any Insurance Premium would cost less per month per person than NI does, and until it does, with the same written-in-law guarantees, no US-style system will ever be able to compare itself to the NHS.
p6287
aVAnd frankly mate if you love it so much then I dare you to head out to the US for a year or so next time you get seriously ill and try and get your shit insured and see how that works out for you.
p6288
aVThere's a reason the US went from that system towards Universal Health Care rather than away from it.
p6289
aVOH GOD.
p6290
aVAmerican here.
p6291
aVFOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T LET HIM!
p6292
aV
aVI dont really care as this will never happen, but it does make me question his grip on reality.
p6293
aVI thought being down to earth and sensible and not ideologically obsessed was meant to be a UKIP strength!
p6294
aV?
aV&gt; it does make me question his grip on reality\u000a\u000aYou don't seem to have a grip on how democracy works.
p6295
aVIt's unlikely to happen because most people don't want it to, but if that changes at any point in the future...
p6296
aVAt this point, I'm really more worried about Mr Farages mental health.
p6297
aVClearly he has been overdoing it...
p6298
aVNow you're equating Farage to the whole of UKIP.
p6299
aVIt's already stated in the article and other articles that it isn't a UKIP policy because UKIP members are against Farage's stance.
p6300
aVWhile he may be the figurehead, he is by no means the policymaker there.
p6301
aVI do however commend him on his chops in saying that the way the NHS is funded and operates needs to be debated, because it does, the NHS is going to become more and more expensive as the generations age, the current way of operating and funding isn't working as it is, yet alone in 10 years time.
p6302
aVThat's a fair comment, I should not equate the two.
p6303
aVI'm not convinced we do need to debate how the NHS is funded.
p6304
aVThe government already take pretty much everything they can get away with from me (income tax, NI, SLC, 20% VAT, road tax, "sin" taxes, stamp duty, council tax etc).
p6305
aVAll I ask or want in return is a properly funded NHS.
p6306
aVIf they can't afford that, they can cut their vote buying programs for pensioners or their invading-sandy-places-budget or this nonsense about keeping people in school forever.
p6307
aVSorry to go all stern on you!
p6308
aVComing back to Mr. Farage, I guess I am caught:  On one hand I wish politicians would speak their minds more and I've always liked that he does.
p6309
aVOn the other hand, when someone says something this barmy, it makes me doubt their mind.
p6310
aVSo I will just have to take the rough with the smooth.
p6311
aVThat crazy stupid motherfucker
p6312
aVWhy the fuck would anyone in their right minds want a healthcare system modeled after the US's??
p6313
aVI live here and I despise it.
p6314
aVIf I ever get seriously ill I am so royally fucked for my finances.
p6315
aVThey overcharge for everything.
p6316
aVIt doesn't work on any level except the insurance company's. 
p6317
aV&gt;Why the fuck would anyone in their right minds want a healthcare system modeled after the US's??

aVFive 'new' policies in the manifesto (note that not all are necessarily new):\u000a\u000a&gt; * Raising the minimum wage to more than £8 by October 2019 \u2013 accelerating increases to guarantee they reach this level before the end of the next Parliament\u000a&gt; * Helping train passengers and commuters with a fully-funded fare freeze\u000a&gt; * Supporting the squeezed middle with a firm commitment not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.
p6453
aV&gt; * Protecting tax credits in the next parliament, to back working families\u000a&gt; * Introducing a new National Primary Childcare Service to help working parents.\u000a
p6454
aV&gt; Supporting the squeezed middle with a firm commitment not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.
p6455
aVSerious question - that doesn't rule out any below-inflation rises in the thresholds to stealthily raise taxes by dragging more people into the net, does it?
p6456
aVNo it certainly doesn't.
p6457
aVIt was Gordon Brown's preferred method of tax rises as well.
p6458
aVExactly, no commitment at all to keep the thresholds in line with inflation.

aVYou mean...

aVNow if the income tax personal allowance would be pinned to the minimum wage we would be getting somewhere.
p6464
aVThis is ukip policy, FYI
p6465
aV&gt;Supporting the squeezed middle with a firm commitment not to raise the basic or higher rate of income tax, National Insurance or VAT.
p6466
aVDoes this mean that they will not raise top rate to 50p or they will not raise beyond 50p?
p6467
aVBecause I was under the impression Balls had promised to raise back to 50p.
p6468
aVThe Basic rate is the 20% rate, the higher rate is the 40% rate.
p6469
aVThe (current) 45% rate is the additional rate (which they'll knock back up to 50%).
p6470
aVThere will also be a 10% rate added in somewhere which used to be called the 'starting rate' (not sure where or how yet).
p6471
aVWhere did £8 come from?
p6472
aVPlease don't tell me they just plucked it out of the air.
p6473
aVLiving Wage is [currently £7.85/h](http://www.livingwage.org.uk/what-living-wage), so presumably it's that with a bit chucked on to cover inflation between now and 2019.
p6474
aVSo presumably the living wage will rise too because of inflation, because they also say that they will 'promote the Living Wage' on page 10?
p6475
aVSo is this supposed to be the living wage or not?
p6476
aV&gt; So presumably the living wage will rise too because of inflation\u000a\u000aI'd guess so - that's basically what I was saying.
p6477
aVI speculated that the £8 figure is intended to account for a likely raise in the Living Wage by 2019.
p6478
aVIsn't it funny that we're all having to speculate though, especially seeing as labour are today focussed on restoring their financial credibility, yet I can't find their full reasoning for concluding that £8 will be the optimum minimum wage in 5 years time.
p6479
aV£7.85 is the current living wage (outside London).
p6480
aVUnless we have catastrophic deflation, it will rise past £8.
p6481
aVNote it says 'more than £8', because we cannot predict what the rate of inflation will be in 2019.
p6482
aVWont the 'living wage' cause inflation?
p6483
aVNo unless they print money to pay it.
p6484
aVI don't think you understand how inflation works.
p6485
aVI agree, we shouldn't have to speculate.
p6486
aVTo be clear I'm not defending it; just offering commentary. 
p6487
aVThis game has been going on a while now.
p6488
aVThe glaringly obvious solution is to peg the minimum wage to some price index or other at a particular level of purchasing power, thus avoiding having to raise it every government.
p6489
aVBut that would mean the they couldn't promise to raise it every damn election without actually raising it in the long term, so neither party wants that.
p6490
aVJust you wait, labour will promise to raise it from 8  in 2020 to somewhere just ahead of inflation (which will catch up in the course of the next parliament). 
p6491
aVCuriously, Living Wage isn't wedded to inflation.
p6492
aVFor a start, instead of being related to a standard inflation measure, it is instead calculated against a number of primary metrics (rent, council tax and child care costs).
p6493
aVSecondly, in order to make it more palatable to businesses (bless 'em, they tried), each yearly increase is capped to 2% above general wage inflation.
p6494
aVThis second point is a bit of a kicker, by the way.
p6495
aVWithout the cap, the current UK living wage would be £9.20.
p6496
aVInstead it is capped to £7.85.
p6497
aVAnyway, all that uncertainty is a pain in the ass for producing "costed manifestos", seeing as you don't have a foggiest how it is going to change over time.
p6498
aVIf you want to "cost" it, it helps an awful lot if you pick a solid figure.
p6499
aVFor obvious reasons, Labour don't actually have to limit themselves to £8 if they don't want to- that's just the minimum they'll have to do to say they've fulfilled their pledge.
p6500
aVIf everything turns out rosier than their current guesses, they can always raise it higher.
p6501
aVThanks for that explanation.
p6502
aVEven if the living wage did stay as it was, £8/hour wouldn't cover the London living wage.
p6503
aVI think that's why they've included it.
p6504
aVThis is not the living wage.
p6505
aVThe living Wage is £7.85 right now and has gone up by about 20p each November so (assuming that continues) by the end of 2019 it will be £8.85 or possibly higher and the gap will likely increase in 2020 and beyond.
p6506
aVThat's before we even consider the London living Wage which is currently £9.15. 
p6507
aVIt's approximately a continuation of the average minimum wage growth from 1999 to 2014\u000a\u000aIt's not that big a pledge, even the Tories might meet it by accident.
p6508
aVAnd employers can circumvent it by calling their jobs apprenticeships.
p6509
aVThere is still a logic to paying less to apprentices - they aren't expected to be running a home, and they do get a qualification at the end of it.
p6510
aVBut on the other hand, a lot of employers try to pay below minimum wage to apprentices.
p6511
aVI thought the point of the low pay commission was that we wouldn't turn the minimum wage into a political football.
p6512
aVit should be noted that whilst the low pay commission give advice, the government isn't bound to accept it, and more importantly the minimum wage has risen faster than average wages or rpi/cpi and so it is feasible that the rate of increase might well be curtailed in future.
p6513
aVLabour are basically committing to continuing a rise in minimum wage at a similar rate to the average til now, which would  make minimum wage workers relatively better off.
p6514
aVAssuming inflation stays low, of course.
p6515
aVStill, I'd love to see their full working out of how they came to the conclusion that £8 is optimal, wouldn't you? 
p6516
aVI doubt it'd be enlightening, because it'd be something like "£8 is a nice round figure for the end of next parliament, and it's broadly in line with the trend", written in the margin on a briefing note to one of the Eds.
p6517
aVMy experience with finely calculated figures and complex economic models is that they do not survive contact with politics intact.
p6518
aVIt's better to use the calculations as a guide and do the reckoning of the politics in a human head to my mind.\u000a\u000a
p6519
aVConsidering it's already due to be at £6.70 by October it's not a huge ask to raise it to 8 over a 5 year parliament, I hope they stick to this if they get in power.
p6520
aVI wonder if they will also increase the rate at which you pay tax like the Lib dems were promising, 11400 wasn't it?
p6521
aVI wonder over the course of 5 years which would make you better off?
p6522
aVI actually think that raising the level at which you pay tax is as important and fair way of getting the lowest paid more money, but it needs to go hand in hand with minimum wage rises.
p6523
aVI actually think this is one area the Liberals deserve massive credit for achieving in, whatever your thoughts on the rest of their time in government.
p6524
aVMy guess is they looked at the living wage, looked at their likely tax revenue, decided they couldn't afford the bump all the way up there in one parliament and compromised at more than £8.
p6525
aVhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20204594\u000a\u000aLiving wage perhaps?
p6526
aVits £7.85 at the moment apparently.
p6527
aVSo at 2% inflation 7.85*(1.02^4)= £8.50\u000a\u000aSo... umm, I guess that's more than £8.
p6528
aVinflation is currently 0, hard to see it rising too
p6529
aVThat's true, and there's a certain amount of bias when pegging these sorts of things directly to inflation, so I suppose £8 will be fairly close to the living wage in 2019.
p6530
aVAs I've pointed out in another post, the living wage isn't actually tied to CPI (or RPI).
p6531
aV&gt;For a start, instead of being related to a standard inflation measure, it is instead calculated against a number of primary metrics (rent, council tax and child care costs).
p6532
aVSecondly, in order to make it more palatable to businesses (bless 'em, they tried), each yearly increase is capped to 2% above general wage inflation.
p6533
aV&gt;This second point is a bit of a kicker, by the way.
p6534
aVWithout the cap, the current UK living wage would be £9.20.
p6535
aVInstead it is capped to £7.85.
p6536
aV&gt;Anyway, all that uncertainty is a pain in the ass for producing "costed manifestos", seeing as you don't have a foggiest how it is going to change over time.
p6537
aVIf you want to "cost" it, it helps an awful lot if you pick a solid figure.
p6538
aVFor obvious reasons, Labour don't actually have to limit themselves to £8 if they don't want to- that's just the minimum they'll have to do to say they've fulfilled their pledge.
p6539
aVIf everything turns out rosier than their current guesses, they can always raise it higher.
p6540
aVOk so, some highlights for me:  \u000a  \u000a&gt; We will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019, banning exploitative zero-hours contracts and promoting the Living Wage.
p6541
aVSo: the minimum wage pedge seems sensible but if you are raising the minimum wage to the living wage (as they seem to be doing) how you can you promote a living wage?
p6542
aVAs for banning zero-hour contracts: I was on one for years and it was fine for me.
p6543
aVI don't like this kind of knee jerk reaction because it implies a distinct lack of either creativity or understanding.
p6544
aV&gt; We will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds, while doubling paid paternity leave for fathers.
p6545
aVThis is going to cost a lot.
p6546
aV&gt; We will help with household bills freezing energy prices until 2017, while reforming the broken energy market.
p6547
aVThis is dangerous.
p6548
aVParticularly when you make a considerable chunk of change off selling energy (oil).
p6549
aV&gt; We will build up our NHS so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a Mansion Tax on properties worth over £2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance.
p6550
aVI get the Mansion Tax maybe raising some money (but I'm not sure there are enough over £2m properties for this to work) and more levies on tobacco isn't a bad thing but "tackling tax avoidance" never brings in as much as polticians like to think.
p6551
aV&gt; With a Labour Government, migrants from the EU will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years  \u000a  \u000aSeems reasonable to me but a bit odd to see it here.
p6552
aVI get that they are trying to shore up against UKIP though - which is a tragic reason to do anything.
p6553
aV&gt;  work to strengthen integration within our communities.
p6554
aVWhat does this even mean?
p6555
aV&gt; We will work to reform the European Union, and we will retain our membership of it.
p6556
aVreform = good.
p6557
aV&gt; We will not make promises we cannot keep  \u000a  \u000aSigh.  
p6558
aV'I don't like this kind of knee jerk reaction because it implies a distinct lack of either creativity or understanding.
p6559
aV'\u000a\u000aThis means nothing if they think it can win votes.
p6560
aVPopulism and opportunism.
p6561
aVThey want to raise the minimum wage to slightly above the current living wage in 4.5 years time.
p6562
aVThe living wage is updated yearly, so it's quite possible it will have surpassed their £8 figure by October 2019.
p6563
aVFrom 2011-2014 the UK living wage went from £7.20-£7.85.
p6564
aVI'll admit its worded quite unclearly though.
p6565
aV&gt; So: the minimum wage pedge seems sensible but if you are raising the minimum wage to the living wage (as they seem to be doing) how you can you promote a living wage?
p6566
aVWell the commitment is to £8 by the end of the next parliament as I understand it, and by that point due to inflation the living wage will still be higher.
p6567
aVThey're really only raising it in line with inflation.
p6568
aVLabour policy seems to be to offer as-of-yet unspecified tax rebates to companies that pay their workers the living wage.
p6569

p6608
aV](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21814039)\u000a
p6609
aVWhat they aren't telling you is that councils are massive hoarders of empty property, and local councils combined with central government are some of the biggest hoarders of unused land in this country.
p6610
aVWell they also hold the most land in the country.
p6611
aVIt stands to reason that they would also hold the most unused or vacant properties.
p6612
aVUnless they hold a significantly higher percentage, in which case I'll eat a small section of my hat.
p6613
aVAlso thinking about it, the councils hold a lot of buildings built, or upgraded in the post war period.
p6614
aVThese tend to be problematic to demolish or refurbish due to the shitty nature of the buildings, and the presence of asbestos and other nasties.
p6615
aVSometimes it's just not worth the money to redo it all/
p6616
aVYep this is a huge issue.
p6617
aVIf you imagine that your council holds the largest amount of property in the area then it stands to reason they also hold the largest amount of damaged / dated / problem properties that cost a significant amount to fix.
p6618
aVThat means it takes allot longer under their budget constraints to get around to fixing them.
p6619
aVThe counter argument however is that if these were sold to provate owners the work would be done allot faster. 
p6620
aVAren't council housing stocks notoriously low though, so selling them off will just lead the even more council money going to private landlords.
p6621
aVI mean I see the benefit of your point, but the only way I'd think it's a good idea is if the council is forced the reinvest the money in council housing stock (e.g Westminster council can't just sell all of it's stock and give everybody tax breaks)
p6622

aVNo mention of immigration. 
p6637
aVPage 49.
p6638
aVCheers.
p6639
aVI have been going by the Guardians breakdown.
p6640
aVBut unsurprisingly it is just more meaningless rhetoric. 
p6641
aVTrue.
p6642
aVThe only measure on there is in the number of border staff they would employ.
p6643
aVWhat do you imagine the Liberal Democrats are going to say about immigration?
p6644
aVI suppose we'll find out soon enough.
p6645
aVFuck knows, to be honest.
p6646
aVI'm still trying to gauge if it's a 'thing' for them if not.
p6647
aVWhatever they decide, I hope it's as rational and unemotional as possible.
p6648
aVIf I were Clegg I'd leave it alone.
p6649
aVHe's at the head of the only block of seats that could conceivably deal with a coalition or the left or right, he's not going to impress the kippers anyway and the backbench Tories already blame him for everything they have brought on themselves.
p6650
aVNo sense punching himself in the face.
p6651
aVI think they'll have to argue for some reductions.
p6652
aVIndeed before their policy was taken down before the manifesto goes up they described how they were very proud of increasing border checks etc and rather disparaging of labour for the amount of immigration let in.
p6653
aVWell we have a points system for non EEAs in place and freedom of movement for EEAs so there's not much you can do apart from enforcement and leaving the EU.
p6654
aVYour better using oposong media.

p6656
aV[From the "Build your Manifesto"](http://www.labour.org.uk/manifesto/immigration). 
p6657
aVThat's much easier to read than their actual manifesto.
p6658
aVThanks.
p6659
aVThey said that they want to control immigration more than the conservatives; citing the conservatives and their failed goals of lowering immigration.\u000a\u000a
p6660
aVThere is so much content which promises nothing and means nothing... \u000a\u000a&gt;The threat from Islamist extremism is increasing.
p6661
aVHundreds of British citizens\u000ahave joined Islamic State \u2013 a movement that has engaged in savage violence,\u000aand racial and religious hatred.
p6662
aVThe British people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so\u000aagain, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.
p6663
aVI mean, there's not much to disagree with there, and they *do* say what they're doing to tackle it (extremism) further down the page, but there's fluff like this all over it - feels like it's been written by a student trying to hit a minimum word count, haha.
p6664
aVI'm slightly scepitcal as to how they can say everything is 'fully costed'.
p6665
aVAlthough I have never read a manifesto before.
p6666
aVWhat I would expect is say a table (perhaps as an appendix) of policies and changes detailing the expected costs and expected increased revenue from tax raises and then balancing them off, or in this case leaving a surplus since they have pledged to reduce the deficit year on year?
p6667
aVAll I can see is 'we will fund x by increasing the bank levy' or 'we will fund y by implementing a mansion tax on homes over £2m' included in the narrative occasionally.
p6668
aVSome of this reads well, how much of it is actually practical and not populism I guess we will have to wait and see.
p6669
aVNot a fan of the house of lords reform idea at all.\u000a
p6670
aVThe IFS will comb through this over the afternoon.
p6671
aVTables and figures aren't as fun or appealing to the general public.
p6672
aVThe information will be out soon enough.
p6673
aVIndeed, the IFS (and co.) are my favourite bit about manifesto launch week.
p6674
aVI'm particularly hoping for a "Labour's manifesto is solid"/"Conservative's manifesto is short a few billion" combo (as indeed I'm sure other people are hoping for the reverse).
p6675
aVMakes for some spectacular headlines and interviews if there's a mismatch like that.
p6676
aV&gt; Not a fan of the house of lords reform idea at all.
p6677
aVCan I ask why not?
p6678
aVPolitics and politicians are what destroys the HoC.
p6679
aVThe partisan nature and clashes of egos means that often people are more interested in trying to 'beat' other people than to try and pass any decent legislation or debate anything properly.
p6680
aVThe House of Lords, although is full of many party apointees seems to be a lot less like this.
p6681
aVI guess because they know that they have the job for life and don't have to worry so much about whips and elections.
p6682
aVIt allows for the input of professionals and experts who are not politicans and ultimately I think the democratic principle is mostly intact since the HoC ultimately can pass legislation without the lord's approval.
p6683
aVLet's not ruin it by putting in more elected members who are essentially just shiny PR people and keep it as a centre of expertise and wisdom that can judge in the interest of the country over a long period of time, rather than until the next general election.
p6684
aVOne of the proposals that was floating around last time it was discussed was for a house of 300 members who were elected 100 at a time every 4 years, for total term lengths of 12 years, with a term limit of 1 term.
p6685
aVThat would make it a very different house from the Commons.
p6686
aVWhat is your opinion on proposals like this?
p6687
aVThe key is the language.
p6688
aVThey say they will reduce the deficit every year.
p6689
aVThat isn't hard to do.
p6690
aVReducing the deficit by £1bn a year is reducing the deficit.
p6691
aVWhile saying they will balance the books is meaningless.
p6692
aVIt is a term they use so they can cop out.

p6708
aVThey're going for the Blackpool vote.
p6709
aVNo mention of electoral reform.
p6710
aVWho the bloody hell am I meant to be voting for if none of them will commit to sorting out the damn voting system?
p6711
aVI thought exactly the same thing.
p6712
aVIf Labour had committed to voting reform then I'd possibly vote for them.
p6713
aVAs they haven't, I expect I will vote LibDem (it will definitely be in their manifesto - it always is).
p6714
aVToday - 'On voting reform.
p6715
aVUKIP believes that the dated First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system is no longer relevant in the four/five/six/ party politics of the 21st century.
p6716
aVWe want a new electoral system in which every vote counts.
p6717
aV' Albeit they don't explicitly state which system they would prefer, every vote counts assumes a system not too dissimilar to PR.
p6718
aVHopefully the manifesto will go into more detail.
p6719
aVI've heard that from a few UKIP candidates but none of them want to tell me what system is appropriate.
p6720
aVGiven their archaic ways I'll assume it's an electoral college system :D\u000a\u000aWill be eyeing up their manifesto though.
p6721
aVGiven FPTP however, voting for them where I live would be a complete waste of time.
p6722
aVOur candidate is insane and not even from the UK.
p6723
aVI hope they don't pledge to a certain system.
p6724
aVThere's dozens of systems of PR and I'd much rather they commission a report investigating the efficacy of different systems than say "we will institute AV+!
p6725
aV" 
p6726
aVThere was a comprehensive report done back in the late 90s under Blair - they could just rely on that.
p6727
aVNo need for a new one.
p6728
aVit wasn't a comprehensive report.
p6729
aVPart of the criteria was to preserve a strong link between geographical constituencies and an MP; something that is not unanimously agreed to be worthwhile to preserve.
p6730
aVAs a result, proper proportional representation was not properly considered.
p6731
aVSTV, while investigated, was dismissed because constituencies would be so large as to burden the voter with too many choices, for being too complicated, and for being different to the systems in the London Assembly, devolved governments and the European Parliament.
p6732
aVThe report explains the method behind a couple of properly proportional systems, but did not investigate them properly at all because they do not preserve the constituency-MP link. 
p6733
aVFunny how when they say "every vote counts" my immediate thought would be "but who gets to vote?
p6734
aV"\u000a\u000aProbably paranoid, but given their election anthem could be "turn back time", I do wonder...
p6735
aVThey only find it outdated because it doesn't suit them.
p6736
aVTry dragging their sorry moral position into the 21st century and you'll soon find out that outdated is not really a problem for them.
p6737
aV &gt;With Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18\u000a\u000aWhat does this actually mean?
p6738
aVThat science and humanities students will still have to take English and maths classes in the sixth form?
p6739
aVThis just seems like a waste of time to compensate for poor maths and English teaching in Primary and Secondry.
p6740
aVBring back the Grammars Milliband.
p6741
aV&gt;guarantee all teachers in state schools will be qualified\u000a\u000aHas there ever been any evidence produced that teachers with these so-called qualifications are any better than those without?

p6745
aV&gt;We will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities.
p6746
aVOur aim is to make sure our national institutions, including Parliament, the police, judiciary, civil service, and the **boardrooms of our companies**, are more representative of our diverse country.
p6747
aVHe exactly is this to be achieved?
p6748
aVAre companies going to have to appoint 'token' ethnic minority executives now?
p6749
aVWith Labour, students will continue to study English and Maths to age 18.
p6750
aVSo under 18's are well informed enough to vote but not pick their A levels?

aVI am still puzzling over what this could mean.
p6755
aVSurely it doesn't mean they have to do English and Maths to A-Level, I would very much doubt it.
p6756
aVNah, I wouldn't think so.
p6757
aVI'm guessing there will be a lesser version of that.
p6758
aVHonestly, I don't see a point in doing maths beyond GCSEs unless you wanna do a mathsy course at uni. 
p6759
aV&gt;Has there ever been any evidence produced that teachers with these so-called qualifications are any better than those without?
p6760
aVOne of the primary schools I went to was full of unqualified teachers until it was taken over by Cognita and qualified ones were installed, and it's performance has since fallen.
p6761
aVThe countries with the best education systems (Finland etc.
p6762
aV) have extremely highly-qualified teachers with very stringent requirements.
p6763
aV&gt;No no no please don't call it the 'Senate'.
p6764
aVIf you insist in destroying the workings of the British constitution at least preserve its poetry.
p6765
aVOn the one hand, it does sound very America.
p6766

aVIt was about as democratic as it got back then.
p6769
aV&gt; On the one hand, it does sound very America.
p6770
aVOn the other, it could be rather Roman, which I like.
p6771
aVIt won't end well: \u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwRjc2vH4Uw
p6772
aV&gt; Has there ever been any evidence produced that teachers with these so-called qualifications are any better than those without?
p6773
aVThey aren't, necessarily.
p6774
aVBut all good teachers should be able to get the qualifications, and at least some of the bad unqualified ones would presumably fail them.
p6775
aVGood unqualified teachers won't suddenly stop being good teachers just because they've been forced to take a teaching qualification.
p6776
aVThe idea that every teacher is bad unless they have a PGCE is being pushed by the trade unions massively.
p6777
aVCan anyone explain what they teach in a PGCE course that makes people automatically better teachers, and why trade unions are so insistent on it?
p6778
aVIt just seems to be a part of a 'closed-shop' mentality.
p6779
aVTeaching courses like PGCEs often cover theories of learning, educational psychology, teaching children with learning and physical difficulties, and the study of pedagogical literature and practice.
p6780
aVWhilst I wouldn't say that taking one of these courses automatically makes one person a better teacher than someone who hasn't, I'd say its preferable.
p6781
aVIn my opinion trade unions are for them because they feel that teaching doesn't seem to be valued as highly as other professions which require qualifications by this government, and that they are necessary to do the best job.
p6782
aVThats just my viewpoint on things though. 
p6783
aVmore importantly, why do you think removing the already limited training availalbe would increase the quality of teachers? 
p6784
aVWhere did you get the idea that I'm in favour of removing training?
p6785
aVI'm just saying, nobody buys the idea that teachers need a piece of paper in order to be good teachers.
p6786
aVPrivate schools are proof of this.
p6787
aVWhy exactly are the trade unions and labour so insistent on it?
p6788
aVIs it just to keep the supply of teachers low?
p6789
aVwell the piece of paper is a recognition of completing training to be a teacher.
p6790
aVso the piece of paper isn't important, the training received in order to obtain the paper is.
p6791
aVmuch like any other qualification.
p6792
aVprivate schools are not proof of this at all, the better results they get are down to better resources/lower pupil numbers/differences in attitudes of pupils and parents amongst other things and most private school teachers have QTS(qualified teacher status i.e.
p6793
aVa pgce or equivalent).\u000a
p6794
aV&gt; well the piece of paper is a recognition of completing training to be a teacher.
p6795
aVso the piece of paper isn't important, the training received in order to obtain the paper is.
p6796
aVIt's a figure of speech.
p6797
aVWhat does the training entail and why is it wanted so very badly by unions and labour, and what exactly do they teach you that makes you into a good teacher?
p6798
aVYou've missed my point about private schools- private schools wouldn't hire bad teachers, so the idea that a PGCE makes one a good teacher is irrelevant if they thrive despite not having many teachers who have a PGCE.
p6799
aVMy very best teachers in life did not have any teaching qualification whatsoever, and they were the ones who taught me in my undergrad.
p6800
aVI agree with you on this.
p6801
aVI don't think doing the PGCE makes you a good teacher, it's just seems like an effort to elevate the profession. 
p6802
aVmany things, it's a year long course and i can't be bothered to go into specifics, but it's not so much what they teach you as an examination of weather you're able to teach or not.
p6803
aVa good question to ask is why would anybody want to remove teacher training when the countries with the best education systems have a 4 year training course to become a teacher.
p6804
aVit isn't to keep the supply low, there's a shortage of qualified teachers both nationally and globally, the profession also has a high drop out rate.
p6805
aVMany undergraduate lecturers have a PGCE equivalent the PGCHE, admittedly not all do but universities are hiring more and more, mainly because they're better. \u000a
p6806
aV&gt;  it's a year long course and i can't be bothered to go into specific\u000a\u000aSo what you're saying is that you have no idea whatsoever.
p6807
aV&gt;  a good question to ask is why would anybody want to remove teacher training when the countries with the best education systems have a 4 year training course to become a teacher\u000a\u000aThe implication there being that we teach or would teach exactly the same things that those other educational systems do.
p6808
aVYou've yet to actually explain what they teach you that makes you into a good teacher that current non-qualified teachers with 20 years experience don't have.
p6809
aV&gt;  Many undergraduate lecturers have a PGCE equivalent the PGCHE, admittedly not all do but universities are hiring more and more, mainly because they're better\u000a\u000aWhy do you think it's OK to just make stuff up?
p6810
aVAre you a trade unionist, or are you just an unquestioning labour supporter?
p6811
aV"Why do you think it's OK to just make stuff up?
p6812
aV" -\u000ait is the truth whether you believe it or not, look up the Dearing report 1997.
p6813
aV"So what you're saying is that you have no idea whatsoever.
p6814
aV"\u000aI have a degree in education, I know what the course entails, as i said its more of a test than a course that teaches you things, it tests you to see if you are able to teach before setting you free on the classroom, why is that a bad thing?
p6815
aVif anything we need to expand the PGCE as 1 year isn't enough time imo.
p6816
aV"The implication there being that we teach or would teach exactly the same things that those other educational systems do.
p6817
aV" - no it doesn't , there are international recognized markers we use to compare education systems internationally.
p6818
aVa key one set is by the OECD look it up.
p6819
aVIm nether a trade unionist nor a labour supporter, just someone with an interest and understanding of the subject. \u000a
p6820
aV&gt;I know what the course entails\u000a\u000a&gt;says nothing about what it entails\u000a\u000aSure mate, although with a degree in education (lmao) I'm sure you haven't got any biases in proving to us that the academic study of education is a prerequisite to being a good teacher.
p6821
aV&gt;  it is the truth whether you believe it or not,\u000a\u000aIt is not true that taking a one year course makes one a better teacher.
p6822
aVdo you you really have no argument other that?
p6823
aVtypical kipper 
p6824
aVYou quite obviously haven't worked in HE if you think that taking a one year course makes you a better lecturer.
p6825
aVPGCHE is a two year course.
p6826
aVI don't need to believe it, the fact uni's are hiring them over others speaks for itself
p6827
aV&gt; the fact uni's are hiring them over others speaks for itself\u000a\u000aMaybe wherever you went to uni, but this is not the case for any university of worth.
p6828
aVAgain, you haven't explained how a course makes you a better lecturer.
p6829
aVI don't need too.
p6830
aVa one year examination of whether you're a good teach or not before letting you teach ensures a better quality of teacher.
p6831
aVim also not a teacher...
p6832
aVI have a 3 year degree in Education studies, and i'm going into my MA in Educational policy next year at the institute of education. \u000a
p6833
aVHow does one teach the ability to inspire and motivate?
p6834

p6836
aVOne of the primary schools I went to was full of unqualified teachers until it was taken over by Cognita and qualified ones were installed, and it's performance has since fallen.
p6837
aVNope.
p6838
aVI went to a public school and most were not PGCE qualifified, they were doctors or engineers or lawyers who were A: older B: family orientated \u000a\u000aAnd we and every other school we played rugby against did pretty well

p6841
aVThe idea of old grammar schools being a massive boon to social mobility is a bit misleading.
p6842
aVIf they can figure out a way to bring in state run selective schools as general education policy without massively defunding the schools that most people go to that would be great but that's not what happened in the 60s.
p6843
aVAs it is, more and more are going to independent school, many of which are fully capable of doling out bursaries to poor kids.
p6844
aV&gt;Nations and Regions\u000a\u000aOh so England isn't allowed to exist any more? 
p6845
aVI would guess it is just trying to get representatives to represent similar sizes.
p6846
aVSo rather than 5m for Scotland, 5m for Wales, 5m for Ireland and 40m for England, England will be broken into 8 sections each for 5m.
p6847
aVOf course, this is of the top of my head so who knows. 
p6848
aVMuch too sensible an idea :)
p6849
aVSo we'll destroy England to get around a problem federalism exists to prevent?
p6850
aVMakes sense.
p6851
aVI'd rather see the end of the Union than the end of the country I call home, what gives Scotland and Wales the right to nationhood while England is deemed unworthy?
p6852
aVThis is nothing but shameful gerrymandering, Labour would rather literally Balkanise and destroy my country rather than compete on an even playing field.
p6853
aVIf Labour wanted to slice up Scotland or Wales like a joint of beef there would be outcry yet the Labour party won't even recognise England as a nation.
p6854
aVThey wouldn't give the English people a vote on the matter either, being a party of authoritarianism.
p6855
aVIt wouldn't be  fair devolution, it would be an act of vandalism. 
p6856
aVLol, you've totally misinterpreted and you're embarrassing yourself with your hysteria.
p6857
aVEngland will continue to exist.
p6858
aVI am not sure how it "destroys" England.
p6859
aVRepresenting Yorkshire (or any other region) individually doesn't make England "less real" or anything - especially compared to now where it basically gets zero representation in the same sense as Scotland/Wales/Ireland does (or 100% depending on how you interpret Westminster I guess).
p6860
aVEither way, we already have local regions holding power (London, greater Manchester) that includes budgets etc.
p6861
aVGiving them a bit more say on some devolved issues (local policing, house building policies, transport maybe) via regional blocks is hardly "slicing up England like a joint of beef".
p6862
aVI mean, what does that even really mean?
p6863
aVDo you think England is a monolithic homogenous block or something?
p6864
aVAs if divides do not already exist.
p6865
aVThe idea it just taking "localism" to the next level - closer to how it was pre-Thatcher before she consolidated power in Westminster. 
p6866
aVYeah, remember when England was divided into administrative counties and the country fell apart?
p6867
aVEngland was never divided into counties, most of them are older than England itself.
p6868
aVIn any case devolution by county wouldn't actually be a terrible idea.
p6869
aVWhat I object to is England being sliced up like a joint of beef while the other Home Nations are permitted an identity, a voice and an existence.
p6870
aVFair devolution is regional devolution.
p6871
aVPopulations matter more than "Scotland/Wales/NI each get 1 widget, England gets 1 widget, that is fair".
p6872
aVThe established English regions all have similar populations to Scotland/Wales/NI.
p6873
aVThe established English regions are universally disliked or ignored because they are meaningless, arbitrary boundaries designed for the sole purpose of ending England as a distinct political and cultural area.
p6874
aVIt's Labour's gerrymandering at it's absolute worst, they point-blank refuse to accept England as a nation in it's own right.
p6875
aVI don't like nationalists of any description one bit but I can understand the grievances of English nationalists when the Labour party who are supposed to represent them do the opposite and deny their collective existence!
p6876
aVThis party wants to slice up a country which has already refused regional devolution in a referendum because it's a horrible idea, they have no democratic mandate to destroy England and yet they'll push ahead in classic Labour fashion.
p6877
aVIf Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland have an issue with England they are at perfect liberty to hold a referendum and leave the Union.
p6878
aVEngland has a right to exist just as much as Scotland or Wales, what do you not get about English people being a group just as valid as the Scots or Welsh who have the right to a nation of their own?\u000a\u000a
p6879
aV&gt; England as a distinct political and cultural area.
p6880
aVEngland is actually many different distinct political and cultural areas.
p6881
aVThat is why England needs regional devolution, not some one-size-fits-all bodge.
p6882
aVThe counties within the south west, for example, have little in common with Surrey or Manchester but share more in common with each other (similar issues and problems, similar demographics, similar party allegiances)\u000a\u000aA single English parliament would do nothing for most of the country, would cost more than what we have today, and solve very little.
p6883
aVRegional devolution brings us truly up to par with the other countries within the UK.
p6884
aV&gt;  It's Labour's gerrymandering at it's absolute worst, they point-blank refuse to accept England as a nation in it's own right.
p6885
aVYes, the manifesto is chock full of statements describing how they plan to abolish England.
p6886
aV&gt; This party wants to slice up a country which has already refused regional devolution in a referendum because it's a horrible idea, they have no democratic mandate to destroy England and yet they'll push ahead in classic Labour fashion.
p6887
aVThat wasn't proper devolution, it was a half-assed talking shop, and it was a decade ago.
p6888
aVDon't try and use it as some sound basis for your argument.
p6889
aV&gt; what do you not get about English people being a group just as valid as the Scots or Welsh who have the right to a nation of their own?
p6890
aVand what do you not get about England not being a unified bloc and where trying to run it as such is impractical and useless?
p6891
aVI live in England, I want regional devolution.
p6892
aVYou might not.
p6893
aVThen do the same for Scotland and Wales, carving up one while the others remain whole is an insult.
p6894
aVThat's an issue for Scotland/Wales/NI to explore - but I doubt that they'd go for it, just as devolving to individual counties in England would make no sense - populations are too small and it'd cost a shitload, and some counties are much larger than others
p6895
aV[We have had this arguement before.

p6897
aV&gt; If you insist in destroying the workings of the British constitution\u000a\u000aYou can't destroy that which doesn't exist.
p6898
aVOf course it exists.
p6899
aVIt doesn't have to be codified.
p6900
aVUncodified doesn't really mean anything when it comes to our country.
p6901
aVWe have no concept of a constitution at all, we just have a collective unwillingness to accept that things don't have to remain as they are.
p6902
aVOr rather, those of us who do recognise that changing stuff is alright are left powerless because we're stuck with FPTP.
p6903
aVWe do have a constitution, it's just unwritten.
p6904
aVThis does not mean it doesn't exist; have a skim over http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom for example.
p6905
aVJust because it's not codified into a single document doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\u000a\u000a
p6906
aVI'm big on reforming the Lords, implementing Leveson and the economic policies presented here.
p6907
aVSome stuff like simultaneously trusting 16/17 year olds to vote but forcing them to study maths and english is questionable, though.
p6908
aVOn Europe they've made promises that they can't keep, but I'm not one who is advocating for removal from Europe anyway.
p6909
aVOverall I give it 8/10, likely to vote.
p6910
aVReminder that Labour included democratic reform to the House of Lords in their 2001 and 2005 manifestos.
p6911
aVI'm still waiting for them to adhere to their 2001 promise for no top-up tuition fees, or the 2005 promise on a referendum for the EU constitution
p6912
aVReminder that the commons passed a bill for a wholly elected lords in 2007, and could have pushed past the Lords block, but chose not to. 
p6913
aVReminder that the Lords is full of lobbyists, Labour are a neoliberal party now and are more influenced by lobbying and donations that voters or public opinion.
p6914
aVCommons don't want an elected Lords in practise, since it would challenge the supremacy of the house of commons.
p6915
aVAt the moment they can push anything like they through the Lords eventually, and the Lords won't block a manifesto commitment.
p6916
aVIf the Lords were elected though, they would have a "mandate" too, and would use that to block things from the house of commons they didn't like.
p6917
aVWould result in stalemates and reduced power of the house of commons.
p6918
aVPersonally I am all for some form of reform, but I don't think fully-elected is the way to go.
p6919
aVYou would result in party politics a lot more, which the Lords is less influenced by currently than the commons.
p6920
aVThe purpose of the house of Lords recently has been to scrutinise and amend badly written legislation, and block terrible things like detention without trial.
p6921
aVAn elected Lords would likely mimic the makup of the house of commons, and just rubber-stamp the government\u2019s bills.
p6922
aVI would like a combination of: appointed Lords who have proven themselves capable in a diverse set of roles such as Law, Academia, Charity and Business; jury service style Lords, who are picked at random to serve for 5 years on the house of Lords, adding diversity to the chamber; elected lords from some form of elections which are quite different to the current House of Commons election system, preferably banned from being members of parties and all running as independents.
p6923
aVI'm solely making a point about Labour's track record in pledging and failing to deliver HoL reform at every election.
p6924
aVAs it happens, I'm not in favour of an elected Lords either. \u000a
p6925
aVlottery appointed lords from the General Public?
p6926
aVoh yes please.
p6927
aVI can't wait to see Cardine the council house queen debate the Head of Classics at Oxford University.\u000a
p6928
aVVery unlikely that major Lords reform would happen without a big Labour majority and sizeable Conservative support.
p6929
aVI'm pretty much okay with that because I wouldn't want such major constitutional change to be pushed through without a big majority of MPs in favour of it.
p6930
aVOtherwise we'd just have the prospect of any reforms being undone or halted in the next Parliament.
p6931
aVAlso, I think the name 'Senate' is cheesy, because it's so obviously meant to ape the American system.
p6932
aVI'm largely in favour of making the upper house more accountable and representative, but I don't see why we shouldn't keep the name 'Lords' it just sounds better and it's part of our history. 
p6933
aVThe SNP, Plaid, Lib Dems, UKIP and Greens would all vote for Lords reform if the package was right.
p6934
aVOnly the DUP (from among the small parties) oppose it.
p6935
aVIf Labour and the above listed parties have more than 50% of the seats between them (and if Labour are implementing any of the policies in this manifesto, we have to assume that's the case), it would have no problem blowing past Tory and DUP opposition.
p6936
aVOn the subject of the name, I don't particularly mind the word Senate, and I don't think it should still be called Lords if the entire function of the place is different.
p6937
aVI'd prefer something in the format of "House of thingy" though.
p6938
aVMaybe "House of the Regions", or something, I don't know.
p6939
aVThe American system was so obviously meant to ape the Roman system
p6940
aV[The SNP want to abolish the lords.
p6941
aV](http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2015/jan/snp-debate-end-absurd-house-lords)
p6942
aV..and replace it with an elected house, so exactly like Labours proposals.
p6943
aVSince the Lib Dems agree too, I can't see any reason why we wouldn't get the HoL replaced in the next parliament.
p6944
aVLast time the HOL voted against it, and then Labour backed down.
p6945
aVThe NHS section was very light on detail.
p6946
aVThey appreciated that a&amp;e is heading for disaster, but you can't just guarantee GP appointments within 48 hours, for that to happen you need more GPs and we're not training enough doctors to cope.
p6947
aVManifesto seems OK but where are the details of the cuts?
p6948
aVCan't balance the books without huge cuts , 13b I believe is the figure Lab would need to make\u000a\u000aMin wage to 8.00 by October 2019.
p6949
aVThis isn't really much of an increase, by then the living wage will probably be in the region of 10.00-11.00\u000a\u000aTuition fee cuts good but paying for it by clobbering pensions is bad.
p6950
aVSeems like raids on pensions are becoming a bi-annual thing from both the main parties\u000a\u000aFreeze energy bills until 2017 WUT?
p6951
aVHasn't Labour spent the last few months claiming they never actually intended to 'freeze'\u000a\u000aInoffensive manifesto light on details
p6952
aV&gt; This isn't really much of an increase, by then the living wage will probably be in the region of 10.00-11.00\u000a\u000aNice unsubstantiated assertion.
p6953
aV&gt;raids on pensions\u000a\u000aGod forbid the biggest benefits expenditure in the country gets used to stop the young getting fucked over until they retire. \u000a\u000a
p6954
aVThe style of pension that just fell out of fashion was terrible anyway, final salary is not a fair system. 
p6955
aV| Manifesto seems OK but where are the details of the cuts?
p6956
aVCan't balance the books without huge cuts \u000a\u000aI imagine you can balance a budget in two ways, increasing revenues and decreasing spending.
p6957
aVIncreasing taxes is also not the only method to increase revenue.
p6958
aVDecreasing unemployment has the double benefit of reducing program payments and increasing revenue.
p6959
aVAusterity during contractions rarely works because you are pulling money out of the economy leading to further contractions.
p6960
aVIf you stop cutting and start investing then your revenue could grow.
p6961
aVYou'd have to have a very careful look at such a plan to ensure that your investment would get return.
p6962
aVAnd there is a question on the time frame of the return.
p6963
aVBut the fallacy that cuts are the only method to balance a budget is misleading and has been very harmful in many parts of the world during the Great Recession. 
p6964
aV&gt; Can't balance the books without huge cuts\u000a\u000aThen don't.
p6965
aVI just love the vulgarity of the unbalanced budget advocates
p6966
aVThink the UK's going to run out of pounds?
p6967
aVAs if they're gold or something?
p6968
aVNah, Greece is what happens.
p6969
aV"run out of pounds"?
p6970
aVWhat kind of economics class did you take in college?
p6971
aVThere are a number of HUGE negative consequences to running consecutive deficits and increasing the debt.
p6972
aVInflation, interest rates, credibility...
p6973
aVThe poor and immigrants like myself are the ones who end up suffering the most with a fiscally irresponsible government.
p6974
aVAlso, the national debt is a form of redistribution of wealth - from the future generations to the current generation.
p6975
aVFuck the children, right?
p6976
aVLet's just leave a massive debt so they can't enjoy the same public services that we enjoy today. 
p6977
aV&gt; What kind of economics class did you take in college?
p6978
aVI'd recommend reading up on [Modern Monetary Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory).
p6979
aVIn short: countries that issue their own free floating currency, and have all debt denominated in that currency, do not run out of that currency.
p6980
aVWhilst *all* nations have to ensure that demand in the economy doesn't exceed what the economy can produce, monetary sovereigns are not ever forced to run their economies *below* capacity due to a shortage of the currency they choose to use, as Greece might be.
p6981
aVParable introduction [here](http://heteconomist.com/parable-of-a-monetary-economy/).
p6982
aV&gt; Inflation,\u000a\u000aImmaculate inflation?
p6983
aVInflation without a supply side constraint?
p6984
aVHow's that supposed to work?
p6985
aV&gt; interest rates\u000a\u000aSet by the Bank of England.
p6986
aVJust look at Japan - world's lowest interest rates (because the BoJ wants them to be) despite world leading debt.
p6987
aVThe two just aren't connected if you're a monetary sovereign.
p6988
aVAlso very low inflation, so I really don't know where you're drawing either of those from.
p6989
aV&gt; credibility\u000a\u000aHeh.
p6990
aVGov't gets denied pounds due to not being "credible"... all whilst you can get a mortgage on your house?
p6991
aVHow's that supposed to work?
p6992
aVOr what, we're forcing people out of work today just to impress bankers?
p6993
aVSound logic that.
p6994
aV&gt;fiscally irresponsible government\u000a\u000aThe government has long been fiscally irresponsible, and it's caused [huge amounts of damage](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-per-capita-ppp) to the economy and made many poorer for it.
p6995
aVProblem is, like so many, you've come to believe that the damage they've been inflicting to the economy is somehow good for it.
p6996
aVIt's not, and the government has a lot to answer for w/ this lost half-decade or so.
p6997
aVQuick question on this, I am by no means an economic scholar I understand the MMT theory (I think) but whilst it is saying this is something that can be done, I don't get the impression that it would be at all desirable.
p6998
aV1) Does this not assume that there is a near infinite demand for UK debt?
p6999
aVSurely as the interest we pay on the gilts increases exponentially the eventual supply of the gilts we have to issue has to outstrip demand (a bit like a pyramid scheme??)?
p7000
aV2) Also surely this and the presumed increased inflation would then have huge effects on the value of GBP relative to other currencies as well?
p7001
aVIf this is repeated ad infinitum and the resulting huge inflation results in a worthless pound how are we to import the goods that we would not be able to source or make in our own country, if say the rates of inflation result in the inability to trade internationally with our currency?
p7002
aV3) It also says that the government has to issue the currency?
p7003
aVSo surely this can't even apply in this country since I thought the bank of england, which is independent, controls the supply of money by setting interest rates and deposit ratios etc?
p7004
aVAgain I'm not too hot on economics so if I'm wrong please let me know.
p7005
aVEDIT: I see there's a large section criticising the fundamentals of this theory as well........
p7006
aV&gt; 1.
p7007
aVDoes this not assume that there is a near infinite demand for UK debt?
p7008
aVFirstly, understand that UK government debt = UK non-government savings (due to [sectoral balances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectoral_balances)).
p7009
aVThis is important just from the phrasing of your question - you're implying (correct me if I'm wrong), that the government is *choosing* to run a deficit, and so has to find buyers for its debt.
p7010
aVThing is, it's the other way around today.
p7011
aVPeople *want* to save, and have wanted to for years thanks to the GFC, and hence why every year the government's found that the tax man's collected fewer pounds than the government spent that year.
p7012
aV*Because people have saved the difference*.
p7013
aVEvery year the average person puts aside a pound of after-tax savings, *by definition*, the government has ended up with an after-tax deficit.
p7014
aVThe government then identifies that as "bad" and tries to make it harder for us to save.
p7015
aVIt raises taxes, lowers spending... but the next year rolls around and another deficit has occurred.
p7016
aVWhy?
p7017
aVBecause we've saved despite how difficult the government's made it for us.
p7018
aVOne thing that *does* happen as the government makes it harder for us to save is that some people will inevitably fail in their goal.
p7019
aVThis is unemployment, etc.
p7020
aVPeople that have ended up losing their source of income, their savings, so that other people with tighter controls over their budgets succeed at theirs.
p7021
aV(Basically another way of looking at the [paradox of thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift)).
p7022
aVYou'll know that the public doesn't want more savings when the government tries to push through a pork barrelling budget and yet the deficit doesn't increase.
p7023
aVThink of boom times.
p7024
aVThink of Clinton's surpluses in the US, Howard's in Australia.
p7025
aVWhen the private sector wants to indebt itself, the government's not going to be able to stop it.. just as when the private sector wants to save, the government can't stop it (at least not without damaging the economy).
p7026
aVNow if the government *really* forced the budget to be more deficit, you'd end up with inflationary pressures in much the same way as today trying to *force* the deficit down has lead to an underemployed economy.
p7027
aVEssentially for the currency issuer, if it hurts when it does that, *it should stop doing that*.
p7028
aVBut it'd be inflationary pressures, or, assuming an inflation targeting Bank of England, slightly higher interest rates for *all* in the economy.
p7029
aVIt wouldn't be anything like what you see in Greece/Spain, for what the UK's charged on sterling denominated debt just cannot be divorced from the risk-free rate.
p7030
aV&gt;Also surely this and the presumed increased inflation would then have huge effects on the value of GBP relative to other currencies as well?
p7031
aVIf it hurts when you do that, stop doing that.
p7032
aVThe important thing to do as a currency-issuer is ensure that a shortage of spending of the currency isn't leading to real resources going idle.
p7033
aVIt's mad to force people into involuntary unemployment due to a shortage of spending of pounds.
p7034
aVBut if you've gone beyond that point, if the currency's no longer the constraining factor, feel free to back off.
p7035
aVInflation just costs us all, so there's no point to pushing into it.
p7036
aV&gt; So surely this can't even apply in this country since I thought the bank of england, which is independent,\u000a\u000aUnderstand that a UK sovereign default would wipe out the entire financial sector.
p7037
aVIt'd wipe out all pensions, knock billions off the balance sheets of UK banks, basically everything would go under.
p7038
aVWiping *trillions* off private sector balance sheets would just be catastrophic.
p7039
aVAll lenders have to do is reason that the UK gov't would sooner print than default and it'll never be forced to do either.
p7040
aVThis can easily be shown.
p7041
aVNow the gov't granted the BoE control over the pound, it gave it its charter, it can change these things, and if it came down to changing the charter or having the economy collapse, it absolutely would.
p7042
aVAnd because it *can*, it doesn't actually have to, for lenders will never deny it pounds in the first place.
p7043
aV&gt; I see there's a large section criticising the fundamentals of this theory as well\u000a\u000aAll are very flawed.
p7044
aVIf you'd like me to address any, feel free.
p7045
aVHoly shit what the fuck did I just read.
p7046
aV&gt;"Just print more money, it worked for Rome!
p7047
aV"\u000a\u000aThanks Marx
p7048
aVThat is a really poor response to a detailed post - if it's so ridiculous, tear apart a few of the examples.
p7049
aVyou know thats exactly what we're doing atm right?
p7050
aVread up on quantiative easing. 
p7051
aVQE is over tho.
p7052
aVIf you have the ability to print, you never actually have to.
p7053
aVThink about it.
p7054
aVFor the government to *have* to print, it'd first have to be denied pounds by lenders.
p7055
aVCan you *imagine* a situation where you can borrow pounds but the gov't can't?
p7056
aVWhere a bank can borrow pounds, but won't onsell them to the gov't for risk-free nominal interest to them?
p7057
aVIt can't happen.
p7058
aVIt'd be like Japan running out of yen.
p7059
aVInflation (through printing money) is a stealth tax on the poor, as those with wealth keep it in assets, not cash (and are therefore unaffected by inflation).
p7060
aVWe're facing record low levels of inflation, even deflation for the next few quarters.
p7061
aVWhere is this fear of inflation coming from?
p7062
aVWe're over 2% away from hitting our upper bound of the inflation target.
p7063
aV&gt;Can't balance the books without huge cuts , 13b I believe is the figure Lab would need to make\u000a\u000aI'll just reply with this:  \u000ahttp://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/labour-could-end-cuts-next-year-and-still-meet-deficit-targets-says-ifs

p7066
aV&gt; Min wage to 8.00 by October 2019.
p7067
aVThis isn't really much of an increase, by then the living wage will probably be in the region of 10.00-11.00\u000a\u000aPlease remember that atm inflation is literally 0.\u000a
p7068
aVYou're never going to like everything in a party's manifesto, there's always going to be some bits that make you go "eeeeh..."\u000a\u000aI'm pleasantly surprised by the number of things in this manifesto that are big wins for me.
p7069
aVI was going to vote Labour anyway, but I'll do so with considerably more enthusiasm than expected.
p7070
aVWe'll see what the Conservative manifesto bring, but I think nobody will be able to accuse the two main parties of being the same.
p7071
aVThere are people who'll accuse UKIP and the Green Party of being the same, never mind Labour and the Tories. 
p7072
aVWasn't planning on voting Labour this time but, I must admit, this is ticking a lot of my boxes.
p7073
aVQuite the late resurgence for Labour.
p7074
aVTories must be shitting it.
p7075
aVSame, I'm a natural Lib Dem but in a con/lab swing seat, until about 2 weeks ago I would have given token support to the Libs as I disliked both main parties equally, but I think Labour have won me over enough to vote tactically. 
p7076
aVSee if you can find a Labour supporter in a Lib/Con marginal who will swap their vote with you
p7077
aVI think in this election there is an identifiable major philosophical difference between the parties, Miliband has gone a little more left than most people were expecting him to while still remaining pretty centrist.
p7078
aVTory manifesto soon.
p7079
aVJust you wait.
p7080
aVWait for the IFS costing before deciding. 
p7081
aV&gt;We will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on\u000athe current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the\u000anext Parliament.
p7082
aVWhat do they mean by "a surplus on the current budget"?
p7083
aV'The current budget generally refers to day-to-day government spending but excludes the capital budget, which covers investment in infrastructure projects'
p7084
aVThanks.
p7085
aVSo this could mean extra borrowing for infrastructure projects early in their term, then they'd start paying off the debt after that.
p7086
aV&gt;Raising the minimum wage to more than £8 by the end of 2019\u000a\u000aI agree that the minimum wage does need to increase but I think that would be too steep an increase too fast.
p7087
aVIt would be difficult for some businesses to be able to pay.
p7088
aVI think going up to £7 by the end of 2016, £7.20 by 2017, £7.30 by 2018 and £7.50 by the end of 2019.
p7089
aV&gt;A one-year freeze in rail fares, costing £200m, paid for by delaying upgrades to the A27 and A358 trunk roads.
p7090
aVWhy should people in Sussex and the South West be punished?
p7091
aVAlso, no party seems to be getting the message about rail and travel fares.
p7092
aVKeeping them in line with inflation is no good when people's wages aren't increasing.
p7093
aVRail fares in this country are a joke and they should be making them **FALL**, nothing else.
p7094
aV&gt;Twenty-five hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year olds and a new right to pre and after-school help, paid for by rise in bank levy\u000a\u000aDon't have any children or experience in any of this so can't really comment but if it gives people more quality care for their children then that will be good.
p7095
aV&gt;Freezing gas and electricity bills until 2017, so they can only fall not rise.
p7096
aVSo, he can do this for electricity and gas but not travel?
p7097
aVNot to mention that this won't work.
p7098
aVHow will you freeze them?
p7099
aVWhat level?
p7100
aVHow will you regulate it?
p7101
aVI wouldn't be surprised if companies just up their prices before they frozen and then we're stuck with high prices.
p7102
aVI don't trust Miliband to be someone to be able to tell businesses what to do.
p7103
aV&gt;A £2.5bn fund for the NHS paid for largely by a mansion tax on properties valued at over £2m\u000a\u000aSure, but we should target health tourism as well\u000a\u000a&gt;Scrapping winter fuel payments for the richest pensioners, capping child benefit rises and protecting tax credits.
p7104
aVI agree with this.
p7105
aVIf you have a certain amount and get a certain amount in your pension each month/year then you shouldn't get the benefits that are for people who are hard up.
p7106
aVThey should be entitled for certain things but there has a limit.
p7107
aV&gt;A 50p tax rate on incomes over £150,000 a year and abolishing non-dom status.
p7108
aVRises in VAT and national insurance ruled out.
p7109
aVI don't agree with this.
p7110
aVCorporations should pay more I believe.
p7111
aVIf someone has worked hard to earn their crust to the above amount what would be the incentive if they were to lose 50% of it?
p7112
aVNot to mention that I don't think it will work as they'll find loopholes and ways around it which will take time to chase.
p7113
aV&gt;A cut in university tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000\u000a\u000aI think there should be a reduction - perhaps removal of the cost of accommodation.
p7114
aVI think the £9000 should include that rather than have another cost for that.
p7115
aVMy $0.02
p7116
aV&gt; If someone has worked hard to earn their crust to the above amount what would be the incentive if they were to lose 50% of it?
p7117
aVThey don't; they lose 50% of everything *above* £150k.
p7118
aVBut I don't agree with the policy either. 
p7119
aVYeah, it's 20% to 31,865, 40% to 150,000 and I think 45% on another above that.
p7120
aVI still don't understand why they are so angry about zero hours contracts.
p7121
aVSome people want them, so surely they should be making laws to help people who don't want them get out?
p7122
aVAlso not sure why they haven't backed off the lowering tuition fees when everyone slammed them for it.
p7123
aV&gt; Ensure all young people study English and maths to age 18\u000a\u000aWhy?
p7124
aVMaths post GCSE is very specialised.
p7125
aVEnglish is rather pointless to continue aswell.
p7126
aVOn the whole though I do like most of it.
p7127
aVEspecially the government reforms.
p7128
aVA little too economically authoritarian for me, but thats to be expected.
p7129
aV&gt; I still don't understand why they are so angry about zero hours contracts.
p7130
aVSome people want them, so surely they should be making laws to help people who don't want them get out?
p7131
aVThe plan is to make it so that if you have regular hours in your ZHC then you can have it written into your contract after 12 weeks if you want.
p7132
aVI'm not convinced it will have a huge impact (but obviously for those who want it, it will do).\u000a\u000a
p7133
aVIn practice this means  employers changing your hours every 11 weeks so they don't count as "regular".
p7134
aVOr fuck you off completely.
p7135
aVI've been on one, and it really was shit.
p7136
aVWhen I joined I told them I categorically could not do Tuesdays and Fridays because of uni.
p7137
aVOnly a few weeks there and I'm working a Friday and being told that if I can't find my own cover for it, I have to work it.
p7138
aVI was underworked some weeks and overworked others.
p7139
aVI could make no plans because of fears I'd be working.
p7140
aVThere really was nothing good about it. 
p7141
aVIf you are on a Zero-hours contract they can't make you work any particular shift, since you aren't contracted to do that.
p7142
aVYou should be able to simply refuse.
p7143
aVOf course, if you need to the money then it's not so simple :(
p7144
aVIt could be that the people studying mandatory maths and english are studying different things from the people that selected them, like a literacy/numeracy safety net sort of thing
p7145
aVIt doesn't state if they plan to make English and Maths A-level compulsory or to run new courses alongside A-levels.
p7146
aVI think it's pointless and unfair to force all students to take 2 A-levels and reduce their choice from four to two.
p7147
aVThe second makes more sense, but the extra workload could negatively affect A-level results.
p7148
aVStudents will hate it.
p7149
aVThe simpler solution to me would be to improve Maths and English at secondary level.
p7150
aVIf they're the most essential subjects, why not devote more hours to them and give the students a qualification on a slightly higher level to a GCSE?
p7151
aVIf only it was as simple as some people wanting zero hours contracts.
p7152
aVI was unemployed a couple of years ago and almost every single entry level position I could apply for was zero hours, which was very much not what I wanted at all.
p7153
aV&gt; Also not sure why they haven't backed off the lowering tuition fees when everyone slammed them for it.
p7154
aVPresumably they calculate students will love them for it, and others will be too busy loving/criticising the rest of their policies to complain about it.
p7155
aVI agree with you on the maths front.
p7156
aVI think everyone has a natural level of maths ability they can reach, and for some people this is GCSE level.
p7157
aVSome of my friends found maths really easy, and could whizz through higher problems, whereas others (even pretty intelligent people) took several attempts to pass GCSE.
p7158
aVAdded to the fact that a lot of A and AS level maths is esoteric for most people, I think forcing people to do maths until 18 isn't particularly beneficial, unless they make this compulsory course a lot more applied than the A level maths I took (e.g.
p7159
aVperhaps frame it in the context of the economy and budget management).
p7160
aVHowever, I think English language should be studied to 18, since everyone can make use of improved writing skills later in life, and I don't think there is such a sharp ceiling to English language ability as there is to mathematical ability.
p7161
aVI'd say an A/A* English Language GCSE student has a comfortable grasp of English, not least because it requires a good understanding of grammar and text structure.
p7162
aVTo be honest, there are certain students in my school who aren't able to achieve a C grade in English after, I'm guessing, 7 attempts starting from year 10 to year 12.
p7163
aVIt's embarrassing but I guess some people have different peaks.
p7164
aVForcing them to choose English beyond GCSE is laughable.
p7165
aVI think a better approach to fixing the problem is having a stricter mark scheme and making the C harder to achieve, and then making them retake it if they fail to achieve that grade. 
p7166
aVIn my experience, you'd be surprised at how poor the writing is of some very intelligent people, even those who did well at GCSE.
p7167
aVExamples: one of my friends did really poorly in his literature review project (for chemistry) principally because of poor writing.
p7168
aVHe will have been one of those people who were told that English wasn't important after GCSE because he was going on to do science.
p7169
aVAnother wrote a beautifully emotive and persuasive introduction to a project, but which was totally inappropriate for a scientific text.
p7170
aVAgain, I'd make the English classes focus on more applied work, such as developing writing styles, and understanding how to write in different contexts (this is versus in-depth analysis of literature, although students would be encouraged to read more).
p7171
aVI really don't believe a student can peak at English the same way as in maths, since there are fewer (if any) abstract concepts that may represent an insurmountable conceptual boundary.
p7172
aVA lot of English seems to me to be progressive learning, e.g.
p7173
aVwidening your vocabulary, or picking up different writing motifs (for want of a better word).
p7174
aVIn Scotland, the curriculum says that literacy and numeracy are the responsibility of all teachers, even out with those subjects.
p7175
aVSo, for example, things that you study in Biology should still aim to improve or maintain your numeracy skills.
p7176
aVIt could be a similar idea, which makes more sense than actually forcing students to take the subjects as part of/on top of their A-Levels
p7177
aVI'm not sure about the new laws on domestic and sexual violence.
p7178
aVI'd like to think that these things are already very illegal and that what needs to be done is investment in police training and deployment so that more cases reach the courts in a state where the CPS can do something with them.
p7179
aVI think there could also be squads of detectives trained and managed by the National Crime Agency that could be sent into trouble spots so that they could investigate where the local police don't have the experience (or frankly the tact) to police the situation properly.
p7180
aVBut all that would cost serious money.
p7181
aV&gt; As a priority, we will set up a people-led Constitutional\u000aConvention to directly address this and to drive political reform of Westminster.
p7182
aVLabour is committed to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions, to represent every part of the United Kingdom, and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber.
p7183
aVI would vote for left-wing parties if they didn't keep trying to push some elected Senate.
p7184
aVI'm not sure where the support for this has come from, the primary benefit the House of Lords gets from being appointed is that they can focus on governing and not party politics or elections.
p7185
aVMore Tory economics and faux progressive social and taxation policies.
p7186
aVSame shit, different guy.
p7187
aVIf Labour were truly progressive they'd end austerity.
p7188
aV&gt; We will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto \u000acommitments independently audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility at each general election.
p7189
aVThis I like.
p7190
aV&gt;No ethnic minorities shown on their Ed Miliband foreward picture.
p7191
aVLabour have become racist, I cannot vote for them.
p7192
aVHe is an ethnic minority tho.
p7193
aVActually, he's two. \u000a\u000a
p7194
aVA nerd and someone from North London?
p7195
aVThat's what some of the papers are saying, anyway...
p7196
aVSeriously?
p7197
aVIn 2013 UKIP were slated by Channel 4 for not having any ethnic minorities on the front page of their conference brochure.
p7198
aVWhat a racist comment is that!
p7199
aV?
aV*bashes you over the head with it*
p7200
aVWhich was fucking stupid, just as actually expecting having a minority on your manifesto actually means shit.
p7201
aVSure, and that's a bit pants.
p7202
aVI'm more surprised that Spudgunn has seen that, and has said that Labour is racist and will not vote for them.
p7203
aVI mean, there's far better reasons not to vote for a party.
p7204
aVwhoosh
p7205
aVThe Conservative response [seems pretty weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNpiO9onZk).
p7206
aVI assume these are just [driving round and round](https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/587538840405028864) outside.
p7207
aVNice to see Gove's plan to be more unlikable than his wife is going well.
p7208
aVWow, that was surreal. 
p7209
aVGiven Sturgeon's popularity after the leader's debates I think this may well be a way of losing the election for the Tories.
p7210
aVPeople protest manifesto launches now?
p7211
aVChrist that video is terrifying.
p7212
aVLike an episode of Doctor Who...

p7215
aVMeh\u000a\u000a*Ok there's some good stuff in there.
p7216
aVI don't want the rich to be paying a smaller share of their income in tax than the poor, that needs to be addressed if we're going to pretend to have a fair society.
p7217
aVI'm always wary of the old bait-and-switch or whatever with both parties.
p7218
aVFor example "raising" the minimum wage to £8 by 2019?
p7219
aVHmm\u000a\u000aIt looks like they want to move to a baccalaureate system, that's a pretty major tinkering.
p7220
aVI'm of the opinion that we need more consistency in state education, but that's probably a pipe dream.
p7221
aVAccording to the telegraph version:\u000a\u000a&gt; The £200 million cost will be funded by delaying road projects in Somerset and Portsmouth.
p7222
aVand from the manifesto: \u000a\u000a&gt; We will continue to support the construction of High Speed Two, but keep costs \u000adown, and take action to improve and expand rail links across the North to \u000aboost its regional economies.
p7223
aVfor fucks sake.
p7224
aVLet's screw over the south west and its crumbling infrastructure some more because they don't vote Labour, while ploughing ahead with projects for the Labour-leaning north\u000a\u000aStill not voting for those tossers.
p7225
aVThanks OP, was having trouble locating the actual document
p7226
aV[Nick Robinson: "Labour\u2019s manifesto: Is he ready?

aVAre they responsible?

aV"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32288498)
p7229
aV&gt;Even under the triple lock Labour could borrow much more than the Tories (up to £39bn by 2020) and they are not committed to eliminating the deficit by the end of the next Parliament.
p7230
aVSterling work for your Conservative masters, Nicky boy.
p7231
aVI'm sure they'll reward you with a safe seat when your time's up at the beeb.
p7232
aVHow dare he analyse Labour proposals. 
p7233
aVHas he analysed them?
p7234
aVOr has he just said more borrowing is possible by the backdoor?
p7235
aVIs that not analysis?
p7236
aVI mean take the full quote:\u000a\u000a&gt; Even under the triple lock Labour could borrow much more than the Tories (up to £39bn by 2020) and they are not committed to eliminating the deficit by the end of the next Parliament.
p7237
aV&gt; This is because Ed Balls treats investment spending different from day to day spending.
p7238
aVMany economists would say this is very sensible but it is a lot less tough than George Osborne would be and, even, than the Liberal Democrats.
p7239
aVHe's taken the policy (the 'triple-lock'), explained the effect (allows up to £39bn in borrowing by 2020), explained why that's the case (investment spending isn't included) and compared it to other parties' proposals.
p7240
aVThat's exactly what I'd want him to do as the political editor for the BBC.
p7241
aVHe even said "many economists would say this is very sensible" like the Tory bastard he is. 
p7242
aV&gt; explained the effect (allows up to £39bn in borrowing by 2020)\u000a\u000aThat isn't the effect though is it?
p7243
aVThat's a loophole which he says exists, not sourcing it anywhere.
p7244
aVIf you're bandying around a figure of £39bn you need to say where you get that figure from.
p7245
aVEdit: I think I just found the origin of the £39Billion figure from a [ThisIsMoney news story](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-3029102/Who-spend-Labour-Conservative-economic-plans-hold-key-Number-Ten.html) dated 8 April 2015\u000a\u000a&gt;According to analysis of Labour plans by the Treasury, this could mean nearly £140bn of extra borrowing over the course of the next Parliament under Labour, including a deficit of almost £39bn in 2019-20 as opposed to a surplus.
p7246
aVSo the Treasury i.e.
p7247
aVGeorge Osborne has had this £39Billion line that it's been pushing for a week now and Nick has picked it up and run with it.
p7248
aVIf the IFS say *exactly* the same thing with no proviso I promise I'll retract and apologise.
p7249
aVSo he shouldn't scrutinise?
p7250
aVHe's doing his job, the tories will get the same treatment when theirs is out
p7251
aVHe's attacked the single novel innovation and the thing they'll try to sell the whole thing on.
p7252
aVHe's spreading FUD here.
p7253
aV"freeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter"\u000a\u000aThis makes them a no for me.
p7254
aVThis policy is just too economically illiterate.
p7255
aVI assume you feel the same about the Tories promising to freeze train fares? 
p7256
aVFor me that's just a kick in the teeth.
p7257
aVAfter spending the last 5 years hiking them up above inflation, only to now promise that they'll keep them frozen at this high they've created.
p7258
aVI do feel the same way about the Tories promising to freeze train fares... in pretty much exactly the same way Labour are also planning to freeze train fares.
p7259
aVThankfully, rail shortages are less severe than energy shortages.
p7260
aVhttp://labourlist.org/2015/04/labour-announce-a-fully-funded-fare-freeze-in-their-manifesto/\u000a\u000aThe general population seems to believe that you can make everyone have more of everything simply by legislating prices to be low.
p7261
aVThat's why politicians suggest stuff like this; it wins votes.
p7262
aVFinally I have found someone else who agrees that getting involved in free markets is a terrible idea.
p7263
aVWhat's worse is their intention to get involved in private rental agreements, why do they feel they can affect those?
p7264
aV? 
p7265
aVEnergy companies do make ludicrous profits.
p7266
aVAnd any savings they make via oil prices dropping etc are rarely passed onto the consumer.
p7267
aVI was under the impression it was an industry with pretty low margins? 
p7268
aVAnd this means price controls will magically work this time (as opposed to the hundreds of times they have made the problem worse) because...?
p7269
aVPrice controls are already in existence.
p7270
aVBig six energy cartel has a natural monopoly and can set prices at whatever they want.
p7271
aVEnergy is a resource too important to be in private control.
p7272
aV&gt;Price controls are already in existence.
p7273
aVBig six energy cartel has a natural monopoly \u000a\u000aYou got any evidence for this?
p7274
aV&gt;and can set prices at whatever they want.
p7275
aVWhich is the opposite of a price control.
p7276
aVYou contradicted yourself.
p7277
aV[Read this](http://www.standard.co.uk/business/an-electricity-and-gas-price-cartel-why-ofgem-cant-tell-6794661.html)\u000a\u000a[Read this for the solution] (http://reidfoundation.org/portfolio/repossessing-the-future-a-common-weal-strategy-for-community-and-democratic-ownership-of-scotland%E2%80%99s-energy-resources/).
p7278
aV**Article 1**\u000a\u000a&gt;Just because Ofgem says it has found no evidence does not mean a cartel does not exist.
p7279
aVIt also doesn't mean that a cartel does exist.
p7280
aVThere is no evidence in this article to back the idea that a cartel exists.
p7281
aVThe author simply has assumed it is a cartel because feels, and hinted that Ofgem is wrong because he feels it's wrong.
p7282
aVWhere's the fucking evidence of price collusion?
p7283
aV**Article 2**\u000a\u000aThis is irrelevant to the question of whether there is an energy generation cartel.
p7284
aVIt doesn't even mention such a thing.
p7285
aVI like you.
p7286
aVI think it's terrible that labour are going to stand a chance in this election by spouting policies and slogans that appeal to those without an understanding.
p7287
aVFreeze energy prices resonates well with someone who is struggling, I understand that, but they don't see the bigger picture.
p7288
aVScrew the rich is definitely something that resonates well, but you can't just tax the hell out of them either.
p7289
aVIncrease the minimum wage certainly appeals to them, not against an increase but it has to be done very carefully so as not to negatively affect smaller companies and more importantly inflation. 
p7290
aVI wish people would remember that they would have frozen bills at an all time high if they were in power.
p7291
aVThey dont have  a scoobie
p7292
aVGood summary: http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/13/labour-election-manifesto-key-points
p7293
aVSeems very solid.
p7294
aVNothing exactly *revolutionary*, but if the IFS can confirm that this is fully costed (and even if it requires a little borrowing I'm okay with that) then I'm very likely to vote Labour.
p7295
aVPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, commenting on Labour\u2019s manifesto launch:\u000a\u000a\u201cLiterally we would not know what we were voting for if we were going to vote for Labour.\u201d\u000a\u000aThe IFS says the plans would leave Labour making between £18bn worth of cuts or none at all.
p7296
aVThe electorate may question Labour's Damascene conversion to fiscal prudence if they leave the door open to making no cuts in public spending.
p7297
aV&gt; \u201cLiterally we would not know what we were voting for if we were going to vote for Labour.\u201d\u000a\u000aNo wonder.
p7298
aVIt is typical pre-election pie in the sky nonsense.
p7299
aVWe need change.
p7300
aVNothing will ever be costed if the EU is involved, they haven't signed off their accounts in 19 years with at least £100 billion unaccounted for.
p7301
aVNicely done, bringing in Europe on an unrelated topic.
p7302
aVUKIP's Law: 'All problems can ultimately be reduced down to Brussels and immigration.
p7303
aV'
aV&gt; *UKIP's Law: '~~All~~ Most problems can ultimately be reduced down to ~~Brussels and immigration~~ the EU.
p7304
aV'*\u000a\u000aThe truth hurts.\u000a
p7305
aVNo I'm not really hurting.
p7306
aVYou're not very good at verbal jousting or arguing your point.
p7307
aVIt only hurts if you accept it, clearly you are consciously ignorant of such things.
p7308
aVThat's because I didn't argue my point.
p7309
aVWhen you see through the facade things become significantly clarified and I often forget that a lot of people are blissfully unaware of reality.
p7310
aVMy point is that all these 'pledges' are categorically irrelevant as over the course of the next parliament we will be paying over £260bn in *interest* of our National Debt which will no doubt he heading towards £2trillion.
p7311
aVThis is of course on top of our annual contributions which is increasing rapidly every year and was over £11bn in 2013.
p7312
aVThe fact is this, we will never pay of this debt whilst we are in the EU (or ever to be honest).
p7313
aVThe main parties are pro-EU (they are their paymasters after all) so anything they say is most likely a lie and on the off chance it isn't, it won't make the slightest difference in terms of paying off our debt.
p7314
aVFull stop.
p7315
aVUnrelated?
p7316
aVOur national debt interest is over £1bn a week.
p7317
aVEven if this manifesto *was* costed, over the course of the next parliament we would be paying over £260bn in *interest* of our ND which will be heading towards £2trillion.
p7318
aVWe are in an economic black hole thanks to the EU.
p7319
aVAnything economic in Labour's manifesto is an irrelevance.
p7320
aVI'd like their commitments to balanced budgets and properly costing their spending plans to be bound by legislation.
p7321
aVI dislike their intentions to replace the Lords with a senate (the name is just awful).
p7322
aVTheir devolution plans are a bit to vague at this moment in time.
p7323
aVThe wording doesn't strike me as universal devolution but devolution to a few key (labour loyal) cities.\u000a\u000a
p7324
aV&gt; I dislike their intentions to replace the Lords with a senate (the name is just awful).
p7325
aVIs it just the name that you oppose?
p7326
aVPersonally I think Lords reform is desperately needed, but I would take any commitment with a pinch of salt.
p7327
aVIf you've read Robin Cook's *The Point of Departure* you can see how difficult it is to get Parliament to agree on change that momentous
p7328
aVLargely because the MPs all secretly hope to get a peerage when they leave the Commons
p7329
aVI'd prefer our current system to an elected rubber stamp echo chamber with a daft name.
p7330
aVThe Lords may not work in theory but it does in practice.
p7331
aVI don't see why we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to Lords reform.
p7332
aVAnd the monarchy for that matter.
p7333
aVWhy can't we elect officials called Lords that sit in the House of Lords?
p7334
aVWhy can't we elect a King instead of a president?
p7335
aV&gt; Why can't we elect a King instead of a president?
p7336
aVGod would cry that he doesn't get to pick any more.
p7337
aVGod can get a vote just like everyone else.
p7338
aVThat's how it works already in the current one-man one-vote system.
p7339
aVGod's the man, and he has the vote...
p7340
aV&gt;And we will make changes to DNA retention, so that rape\u000asuspects have their DNA recorded and stored - Page 53\u000a\u000aSuspects in rape cases now to be treated as criminals.

aVReads like a mills and boon novel.
p7342
aVI'm studying science, where is important to get good at delivering condensed information that's readable so people know what you're on about.
p7343
aVThis manifesto, manifestly fails at that, and I feel sorry for the journalists who are going to have to trawl through this for headlines.
p7344
aVIt's laid out in bullet points.
p7345
aVHow much easier could they make it?
p7346
aVPretty pictures. 
p7347
aVLook again.
p7348
aVBits of it are in bullets.
p7349
aVNot every policy, which makes it a pain to actually get the full picture.
p7350
aVI stand by what I said
p7351
aVFollow the Guardians breakdown with the link I posted. 
p7352
aVIt looks like every section is summarised in bullet points.
p7353
aVCan you give me an example of what policies are not included in the summary?
p7354
aVThe guys just lazy at reading more than a page!
p7355
aVThe key difference is rhetoric.
p7356
aVUsing emotive language is bad writing in science, but parr for the course in a lot of other contexts, particularly persuasive writing.
p7357
aV"delivering condensed information that's readable so people know what you're on about"\u000a\u000aI think a lot of scientific texts fail at this as well, though. 
p7358
aVQuite liking the space they've given to constitutional reform, in particular doing something with the HoL.
p7359
aVI've always though that the HoL was just best abolished and we use a uni-cameral system, but I'd like to hear more about how they'd fill the Senate (PR?
p7360
aV) and what its powers would be.
p7361
aVPage 15 looks like a really shit boy band. 
p7362
aVis it just me or is this littered with punctuation mistakes? 
p7363
aValso:\u000a&gt;Labour will:\u000a\u000a&gt;Invest £2.5 billion more that the Conservatives to recruit 8,000 more GPs,\u000a20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives
p7364
aVIt sounds no different to any other major party manifesto to be honest.
p7365
aVI guess now we have lost control over big important things like law and employment regulations our government is left bickering over small boring issues trying to make them sound big and exciting wile coming up with new buzz words.
p7366
aVAll very safe and "tinkering around the edges".
p7367
aVVery little of actual vision or principle to be found in this document.
p7368
aVDisappointing.
p7369
aVlol what exactly where you expecting?
p7370
aVnationalise the means of production and seize privately owned land?
p7371
aVWouldn't mind a strong program of nationalisation.
p7372
aVI like labour, but this is a 'business as usual' manifesto.
p7373
aVVAT should go down and income taxes need to go up. 
p7374
aV[The Guardians breakdown.
p7375
aV] (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/13/labour-election-manifesto-key-points) Far too many generic policies that they have no hope of successfully implementing.
p7376
aVOf course they want to give 16 year old's the vote.
p7377
aVTheir economic polices are a shambles. 
p7378
aVShambles in what sense?
p7379
aVI see them as helping the workers of Britain get more money n their pockets, helping SMEs grow and building real growth on all levels.
p7380
aVI have to admit I don't like the 50p tax rate and I'm not sure about non-doms.
p7381
aVInsignificant points in the grand scheme of things aren't they though.
p7382
aVThe deficit is £90bn.
p7383
aVThey plan spending increases but their proposals to raise money will raise nothing extra.
p7384
aVSuch as the 50p tax rate and abolishing non-domicile tax status. 
p7385
aVYou're taking a lot for granted in saying neither of those proposals will raise any money.
p7386
aVIt's true that nobody knows how much they will bring in.
p7387
aVNon-dom status could bring in up to 4 billion.
p7388
aV(source: http://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2015/apr/08/how-much-would-ending-non-dom-tax-status-raise-britain).
p7389
aVAs for the 50p tax rate, we still don't know how much money that will raise because it wasn't in place long enough to have an effect (everyone was allowed to defer for 1 year, by which time the Tories had reversed the change).
p7390
aVThe institute for fiscal studies said that restoring the 50p rate would bring in £100m a year.
p7391
aVThat estimate could be incorrect by orders of magnitude and /u/naturalredditor would still be correct to say that it's an ineffective policy.
p7392
aVWait and see.
p7393
aVYou will hear a lot of independent organisations say the exact same thing. 
p7394
aVIFS said non-dom *might* not raise any money.
p7395
aV*Might* not.
p7396
aVThey don't say "won't" or "probably won't".
p7397
aVJust *might*.
p7398
aVAnd when you read it in context, the headline is snipped from a lengthy conversation in which an analyst speculates freely about possible effects, including a dichotomy of worst case and best case scenarios.
p7399
aVAlongside *might* not, he also says *might* raise 1 billion or more.
p7400
aVSource: http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2015/04/ifs-labours-non-dom-policy-might-not-raise-more-revenue/
p7401
aVOh get a grip.
p7402
aVYou say could bring in up to 4 billion.
p7403
aVYeah, but in reality it will be around zero.
p7404
aVThis is meant to be one of their big policies to generate more revenue.
p7405
aVThe other being the top rate of tax.
p7406
aVEven if they do generate revenue, it won't be anywhere near enough. 
p7407
aV&gt; Yeah, but in reality it will be around zero.
p7408
aVHere in reality, we don't like to make claims about things without evidence for them.
p7409
aVDo you have any, or have you just made that up?
p7410
aV*I* don't say it.
p7411
aVI'm providing sources.
p7412
aVAre you saying the Institute for Fiscal Studies should get a grip?
p7413
aVSaying that at the most it could raise that much.
p7414
aVBut in reality it doesn't work out like that.
p7415
aVJust like how France raising income tax didn't work out in such a manor. 
p7416
aVIt's also about direction of travel - If loopholes are being removed, and higher rate of taxation is raised, it sets the stage for more aggressive moves to tackle issues such as abuse of corporation taxation or capital gains vs income taxation, or even genuinely looking to simplify taxation to remove loopholes.
p7417
aVI don't it is  insignificant to cut the starting point of tax to 10p, instead of 20p.
p7418
aVOr building new homes so people can get on the property ladder.
p7419
aVThe economics of the manifesto is to help the working class and provide stability for them.
p7420
aVThe deficit reduction plan is left wanting however, which is a concern.
p7421
aVUseful link.
p7422
aVThanks.
p7423
aV&gt;The next Labour Government will balance the books.
p7424
aVI'm sceptical to say the least.
p7425
aVThe [IFS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11341489/Top-economist-warns-Labour-will-borrow-extra-170-billion.html) doesn't have much faith in Labour's proclamations, and neither does [Lucy Powell](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11502751/We-will-borrow-more-if-we-win-the-election-Labour-admits.html) by the looks of it.
p7426
aV&gt;so that the highest one per cent of earners, with an income of over £150,000, contribute a little more to help get the deficit down\u000a\u000aFor a party committed to generating a strong economy, they sure do like to ignore the [deadweight loss](http://www.nber.org/papers/w5055) of income taxation.
p7427
aVThey'd be much better off progressively raising VAT *if they had to*.
p7428
aV&gt; For example, we will introduce a tax on properties worth over £2 million to help raise the £2.5 billion a year for an NHS Time to Care Fund \u2013 part of our plan to save and improve the health service.
p7429
aVSlapping a tax on something doesn't raise revenue in such a straightforward manner.
p7430
aVThe [CPS](http://www.cps.org.uk/files/factsheets/original/120924143301-somequestionsonthemansiontax.pdf) notes that 33pc of all properties over £2m have been in the same ownership for a decade, meaning the tax could disproportionately harm pensioners.
p7431
aVAnd the nature of the tax--being a wealth tax--makes it incredibly difficult to accurately value and burdens the economy with a deadweight loss significantly higher than other forms of taxation.
p7432
aV&gt;We will not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax or National Insurance.
p7433
aVAm I misunderstanding?
p7434
aVWhat happened to reversing the top-rate cut?
p7435
aV&gt;increase the National Minimum Wage to more than £8 an hour by October 2019 \u000a\u000aNo doubt a popular policy, but nonetheless [economically dubious](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663).
p7436
aV&gt;ban exploitative zero-hours contracts\u000a\u000aPointless populist policy.
p7437
aV&gt;guarantee an apprenticeship\u000a\u000aBullshit.
p7438
aV&gt;reduce tuition fees to £6,000 a year\u000a\u000aBad idea.
p7439
aVThe way that repayments are structured means reducing the overall debt burden would disproportionately help the wealthy, not the poor. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p7440
aV&gt; &gt; We will not increase the basic or higher rates of Income Tax or National Insurance.
p7441
aV&gt; Am I misunderstanding?
p7442
aVWhat happened to reversing the top-rate cut?
p7443
aVThe basic and higher rate refer to the 20% level and the 40% level.
p7444
aVThe current 45% level which they are going to up to 50% is the additional rate.
p7445
aVIt's a bit of a mess of nomenclature (especially if they add the 10% rate back in as well).
p7446
aV&gt;For a party committed to generating a strong economy, they sure do like to ignore the deadweight loss[3] of income taxation.
p7447
aVThey'd be much better off progressively raising VAT if they had to.
p7448
aVI think a progressive consumption tax is unelectable as a policy for any party because explaining the benefits of such an action is too obtuse for the majority of voters (and it will be misinterpreted as an attempt to screw over the poor regardless of how you try and sell it), even though complete removal of income tax and it's replacement with a progressive consumption tax would be a massive improvement.
p7449
aV&gt; Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more\u000amidwives\u000a\u000aYay!
p7450
aV&gt; We will guarantee people a GP appointment within 48 hours\u000a\u000aYay!
p7451
aV&gt; By 2020, patients will\u000await no longer than one week for vital cancer tests\u000a\u000aYay!
p7452
aV&gt; we will ensure the NHS is protected from the TTIP treaty\u000a\u000aYay!
p7453
aV---\u000a\u000aToo bad it's riddled with other expensive false promises, some of which go too far, some of which fall drastically short.
p7454
aVNot awful though. 
p7455
aV&gt;&gt; Labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, and 3,000 more\u000amidwives\u000a\u000a&gt;Yay!
p7456
aVI've always wondered laps up this shit.
p7457
aVwhy do you support national  level politicians making recruitment decisions for  specific operational staff in the nhs?
p7458
aVIf some hospitals want more nurses, then great..
p7459
aVBut there is no point in ed sending them a dozen extra nurses if the hospital actually needs a new xray machine.
p7460
aVI'd respect a simple funding pledge far more than this patronising headline-baiting bollocks. 
p7461
aVThey don't literally assign them hospitals to work at.
p7462
aVThey are making them available for those hospitals that do need them (and there are many of those).
p7463
aVAnd of course the hospitals spend their money on what they want - say a new X ray machine - but Labour are simply pledging more staff which *are* definitely required in case you didn't know. 
p7464
aVPeople seem to forget that downvotes are meant for posts that add nothing to conversation.
p7465
aVFor the most part, the sub has a mentality of "Downvote anything that I disagree with, and visa versa.".
p7466
aVOn the contrary, upvotes should be given to posts that bring up new arguments, or engage in the discussion. 
p7467
aVI agree.
p7468
aVI think a lot of debate subs would be better if they had the downvote removed.
p7469
aVIt creates less of a circle jerk for what ever is popular at the time.
p7470
aVI think I've seen some pretty good discussions on this sub, and it's nice that it's only really bigotry that gets notably downvoted. 
p7471
aVtheres a policy on r/syriancivilwar of no cheerleading thay I think would work very well on this sub.
p7472
aVE.g people saying "fucking tories", "Cant barrage the farage" or "labour = paedophile party" etc.
p7473
aVThis wastes everyones time and lowers the tone of discussion.
p7474
aVThere is also a strictly enforced rule against personal attacks as well.
p7475
aVAgain a lot of the time people come on here and call everything to the left of hitler "leftist scum" etc.
p7476
aVThis would also raise the tone with deletion of time wasters.
p7477
aVOther than that I think its a good thing that UKIP supporters are as vocal as others.
p7478
aVBut I remember a guy saying I should be executed for treason for being not anti-EU which is a classic example of internet craziness one wouldnt say that in real life to a family member or friend who held a different opinion.
p7479
aVSure, I'd be in favour of those suggestions, definitely.
p7480
aVSo long as we arn't policing explicit language, or tone?
p7481
aVI'm all for coming down on those that waste our time by using the examples you've given.
p7482
aVI think people should have a right to call me a cunt, or tell me that my views are abhorrent.
p7483
aVOr use snidey jabs and a condescending attitude.
p7484
aV(I fucking haaaaate this).
p7485
aVIt's just a waste of time, but I feel that people should be free to express that view.
p7486
aVIf the post doesn't go on to explain WHY, or give reasons?
p7487
aVShoot the fucker down.
p7488
aVI'd be happy to see all 1-liner "I love your views" and "I hate your views" comment downvoted to oblivion.
p7489
aVThey add nothing to the conversation, either way.
p7490
aVI think you touched on a broader and bigger problem with the whole "leftist scum" and "tory pricks" etc.
p7491
aVJust tribal in-group out-group bullshit.
p7492
aVS'why I don't understand tying myself to any group.
p7493
aVI'll vote for a party, sure.
p7494
aVBut each one has it's flaws.
p7495
aVAttaching a sense of identity to one will only increase biases and cloud judgement.
p7496
aVYeah I dont care about rude words or tone etc but its when people just blindly shout their sides line and clearly arent discussing that it becomes a waste of time.
p7497
aVWhile its obvious that people who start insulting personally have lost any argument they still waste time and lower the tone.
p7498
aVThere are a lot of Kippers *and* a lot of anti-kippers that do a lot of downvoting here.
p7499
aVI've made very similar comments in two different threads, been downvoted in one, and upvote in the other.
p7500
aVNo point moaning about it.
p7501
aVJust sort by New, and you can largely negate the effect. 
p7502
aVYup, me too.
p7503
aVI've said similar things and been voted up or down dependant on time of day, who saw it first, etc, just like a lot of Reddit.
p7504
aVI actually think we're fairly balanced around here and though I don't always agree with everyone (nor should I), I'm proud that we have a 'safe space' (!
p7505
aV) where all can air their views and be responded to.\u000a\u000a
p7506
aVIf it was a safe space then people would not be getting down voted for a different view, it should be used for people not contributing to the conversation. 
p7507
aV&gt; it should be used for people not contributing to the conversation.
p7508
aVYeah except barely anyone follows reddiquete and they won't follow it so just get on with it, shall we?
p7509
aVThat's a fair point, I've wondered if reddit should change the up voting rules or just remove the downvote button altogether. 
p7510
aVI know /r/casualconversation did something like this where they removed the downvote button, something like that would be nice here but I can imagine there would be issues.
p7511
aVYea as far as I'm aware the best you can do is hide it, and whenever a sub I frequent does this I just unhide it.
p7512
aVI think it would definitely be a good idea for Reddit 
p7513
aVI get the gist of what you're saying, but I meant that you won't get banned for it or consistently downvoted every time (unless you really are just a racist or something)
p7514
aV&gt;I don't always agree with everyone\u000a\u000aThat's how you know it's balanced.
p7515
aVI swear the point where I'm surrounded by people that only agree with me I start to get a little worried.
p7516
aVA shame how so many on the UK subs would see that as the perfect scenario
p7517
aVExactly.
p7518
aVDiscussions amongst people who choose to debate politics over the internet will inevitably centre on the 'extremes'.
p7519
aVMost people are relatively centrist, and don't particularly care to debate politics online.
p7520
aVTherefore, we see Reddit skew itself towards the "far right" (r/Libertarian and r/Conservative) and the "far left" (r/socialism and r/communism).
p7521
aVTo a lesser extent on UK focused subreddits, we have both a lot of Greens and a lot of UKIP supporters.
p7522
aVBy contrast, we have a disproportionately small number of Labourites/Tories.
p7523
aVPersonally, I'm fine with this sub skewing *very slightly* right wing, because r/UnitedKingdom is horrendously left wing to the extent that almost anyone conservative or pro-capitalist or religious is shouted down by the hivemind.  
p7524
aVI feel I can agree here.
p7525
aVThis sub does get a lot of extreme views and UKIP articles, but you make one comment that isn't "punish rich people" on the UK sub and you will get a lot of incoming hate.
p7526
aVMassive hyperbole right here.
p7527
aVHe's got a point though, many on /r/unitedkingdom would make the poor were poorer as long as the rich were less rich.
p7528
aVThe politics of envy are strong there.
p7529
aVI know what you mean on the small number of labourites/Tories.
p7530
aVAs somebody who actually quite likes Cameron and Osborne I regularly read the comments in this sub and just despair.
p7531
aVOn the flip side I've read the transcripts of Natalie Bennett's and Nigel Farage's speeches from the past week and I find myself wondering how people end up disliking other sections of the same society so much that they would throw their lot in with these half formed ideas.
p7532
aVIt's concerning to say the least.
p7533
aVNatalie Bennett and the greens hardly attack LibLabCon to the degree that UKIP do...
p7534
aVI wasn't talking about them attacking LibLabCon, I was thinking more of the actual policies and ideas they have been discussing.
p7535
aVCan you elaborate?
p7536
aVI'm not sure what you mean.
p7537
aV&gt; Personally, I'm fine with this sub skewing very slightly right wing, because r/UnitedKingdom is horrendously left wing to the extent that almost anyone conservative or pro-capitalist or religious is shouted down by the hivemind.
p7538
aVI agree.
p7539
aVA few weeks ago I submitted an AMA thread on /r/unitedkingdom as someone who is quite liberal and a slightly left-leaning member of UKIP, and who disagrees with several of their policies.
p7540
aVI thought it would be an interesting discussion to have but it turned into abuse within minutes.
p7541
aVIt got so bad that I had no choice but to delete the entire thread.
p7542
aVPeople see UKIP and they instantly think "racist", thanks to a small number of former UKIP idiots who talk nonsense on Twitter.
p7543
aVShame.
p7544
aVIt isn't downvotes that make somewhere 'hostile to debate'.
p7545
aVThis sub has a strong UKIP presence, but it's still much more open to debate than most political places on the net, which are all too often just circle-jerks.
p7546
aVI agree.
p7547
aVAnd actually a lot of Green posts *are* upvoted here.
p7548
aVI find bigotry is generally downvoted regardless of political slant, whereas r/uk is much more partisan.  
p7549
aVAt certain times of the year /r/unitedkingdom may as well be a RSS feed from the Grauniad.
p7550
aVI find bigotry is quite often heartily upvoted on this sub, but then downvoted at other times.
p7551
aV&gt;I find bigotry is quite often heartily upvoted on this sub\u000a\u000aI'd like to see what your definition of bigotry is.
p7552
aVA lot of people have a really loose definition that can encompass almost anything.
p7553
aV*My* definition would be broadly the same as most people, though it's not always clear cut, it's often veiled, and we could argue all day about what counts as islamophobia, racism, sexism...
p7554
aVIn a sense it can simply mean intolerance of different views.
p7555
aVSometimes there is no mistaking it though.
p7556
aV&gt;could argue all day about what counts as islamophobia, racism, sexism\u000a\u000aExactly, so it's often not constructive to suggest someone is a bigot unless you can actually prove it. \u000a
p7557
aVI tend to see it as the sorts of views that are symptomatic of people that have a fear or dislike of the usually targeted groups
p7558
aVSure.
p7559
aVI tried to write a reply about the types and levels of bigotry we see around here, but it was turning into an essay.
p7560
aVThe word has changed (probably due to the filter bubble that is Twitter) to mean anybody deemed "not wholeheartedly committed to the progressive SJ agenda". 
p7561
aVI feel the problem here is the massive support for radical parties, UKIP and the Greens are both on the far side of the political spectrum in opposite directions, so it makes for hostile debating because both sides couldn't be more different.
p7562
aVActually you know a lot of the time all you need to do (actual policies aside) is switch around the words "racist" and "immigrant" and they're pretty similar.
p7563
aVHa, yeah, they say the same thing about fascists and communists being pretty similar aswell, I guess that's why people say the political spectrum is like a cylinder than a square.
p7564
aVAt the end of the day, if you take your idea of what is right, ignore everyone else's wants, needs and opinions.
p7565
aVRun with it and try force everyone else to go along with it because it's what you want, you're always going to be a certain type of person.
p7566
aVEventually the details i.e Muslims should have less of X, or men should have more of Y and so on are actually pretty arbitrary and insignificant.
p7567
aVThe methods and mindset are almost totally identical. 
p7568
aV18 months ago this sub may as well have been called "r/Left-Labour" and in 18 months it'll probably be "r/Green" or something.
p7569
aVIt's the ebb and flow of political life and there is no reason to get butt hurt about it.
p7570
aVJust keep fighting for what you believe in. 
p7571
aV&gt;butt hurt\u000a\u000a\u0ca0_\u0ca0\u000a\u000aThe worst of all Americanisms.
p7572
aVYou do the math\u000a
p7573
aVArsesore
p7574
aVOndbrifo
p7575
aVYes.
p7576
aVSomebody has been offended or hurt so let's use a homophobic slur to characterise them as weak.
p7577
aVHow is that now part of adult discourse on a political discussion board?
p7578
aV&gt; homophobic slur\u000a\u000aIt's a childish insult but lets not resort to shrill pearl clutching.
p7579
aVSit back down in your chair and relax.
p7580
aVThanks for giving such a great example of the petulant 14-year-old /pol/ bullshit that's so prevalent on here.
p7581
aV"Shrill pearl clutching" FFS.
p7582
aV*sigh*\u000a\u000aYou are literally getting upset over someone(possibly a child like you said) using the word "butthurt".
p7583
aVGet a grip on reality man.
p7584
aVOr switch off the computer and go outside, because you're not ready for the internet yet.
p7585
aVAnd now the "no, you're upset" line.
p7586
aVSuch utter bullshit, take it back to 4chan.
p7587
aVWords fail me.
p7588
aVCome on, I'm all for tackling bigotry but the biggest problem facing the social justice movement is muppets who see bigotry where there is none and go apeshit at the drop of a hat.
p7589
aVUsing the term butthurt does not make someone a homophobe, hating gay people makes somebody a homophobe.

aVYou can try and implement a real-life version of Newspeak but that's not going to tackle the cause of bigotry, just the symptom.
p7591
aVYea, in hindsight, sorry for that.
p7592
aVThe original rationale for the choice was a function of the OPs username and my also wanting to imply it was a slightly petulant internet first world problem. 
p7593
aVYo dude, like, whatever man.
p7594
aVPeace out, fam.
p7595
aV&gt;The worst of all Americanisms\u000a\u000aAmericanaphobe racist pig.
p7596
aVI hate porkist's like you.
p7597
aVSwine.
p7598
aVProbably the answer I like the most.
p7599
aVI'm new to this sub and just wanted to start a conversation and maybe get people to think before downvoting someone just because they disagree with them. 
p7600
aV[deleted]
p7601
aVI'll be honest here, if downvotes aren't your thing, this probably isn't going to be a sub you enjoy.
p7602
aVPolitics is divisive, subjectively, pretty much everyone else is wrong in our opinions.
p7603
aVPersonally I just say what I think and let the hate rain down, at least I made people think.
p7604
aVYour thread currently has over 150 upvotes, and you're still pretending to be opressed?
p7605
aVHahaha I wasn't 'pretending'.
p7606
aVI just gave my opinion with a snappy title and it's got a lot of attention.
p7607
aVIt's also sparked debate and hopefully encouraged people to be downvote others less :). 
p7608
aVAlso, how can you honestly think this sub might as well be called "UKIP politics" when none of the top rated threads for the month are about UKIP?
p7609
aVhttp://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/top/\u000a\u000aThe first one that even appears on the page is anti-UKIP.
p7610
aVBecause some days half the submissions are about UKIP.
p7611
aVYou should know that, you submit a good chunk of them.
p7612
aV:P 
p7613
aVIt's an unwritten law of Reddit those who complain about downvotes are downvoted into oblivion.
p7614
aVGet a grip mate, it's only fake Internet points.
p7615
aV &gt;it's largely pointless to post unless you are pro-UKIP as you get downvoted into oblivion.
p7616
aVWhat an absolute load of bollocks.
p7617
aV[Look at the top posts of this month.
p7618
aV](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/top/?sort=top&amp;t=month) Nothing is specifically 'pro-UKIP' and the fifth highest post is some picture making fun of something an obscure UKIP candiate said.
p7619
aVYou're just imagining things.
p7620
aVThe UKIP presence in this sub is larger than in others, but they don't by any measure dominate the place.
p7621
aVThis is the strongest evidence, the only people who think this subreddit is a "ukip circlejerk" are those who just hate UKIP having any amount of support whatsoever.
p7622
aVNo, but you're one of the biggest UKIP shills on here.
p7623
aVYou're not helping the subreddit be fair and representative when you flood it with Farage daily.
p7624
aVThere's a big difference between posting useful content, and endlessly spamming one viewpoint.
p7625
aVThere have been days when I've looked at the sub's front page and near half of the threads have been in some way related to either Nigel Farage, UKIP, or anti-immigration topics.
p7626
aVIt's tedious and boring.
p7627
aVYou're more than welcome to post other things that interest you.
p7628
aVWhat I post is well within the rules of the subreddit.
p7629
aVAbsolutely.
p7630
aVI'm not saying you can't do what you do.
p7631
aVBut there's a difference between posting within the rules and posting with good practice for the health of the sub.
p7632
aVIt sometimes seems like you take advantage of the fact that non-UKIP users tend to be less vocal on this subreddit lately.
p7633
aVIn an ideal world, everybody would post constantly from all aspects of the political spectrum.
p7634
aVBut they don't.
p7635
aVSo I feel like it's worth cutting back on UKIP posts to better reflect how UK politics actually are.
p7636
aVThat's just my opinion of course; you're obviously free to post how you like.
p7637
aVI don't think the mods should take extra steps to do anything about this.
p7638
aVIt's just my feelings about your posting style.
p7639
aVWhat a silly opinion.
p7640
aVIf you're unhappy that /u/ProfessorZ00M is posting stuff about UKIP a bit more frequently than about other parties and it gets you so butthurt that you have to request to him to cut back on his UKIP posts then post some of your own articles!
p7641
aVAlternatively, don't come on the sub!
p7642
aVSimple :)
p7643
aVI do post some of my own articles.
p7644
aVAnd I'm perfectly entitled to be unhappy about over-posting of certain political views that distorts the subreddit from that of an accurate representation of the wider userbase belief demographics.
p7645
aV&gt;Alternatively, don't come on the sub!
p7646
aVYes, everyone unhappy about the overabundance of UKIP content should just leave.
p7647
aVThat *definitely* wouldn't turn this into a massive UKIP circlejerk.
p7648
aVWe all want happy times on the subreddit - or at least as happy as a politics subreddit can be.
p7649
aVI'm just not so sure some of the UKIP brigading we've seen lately will get us there.
p7650
aVBut then this is the internet, so we can all do as we please!
p7651
aV&gt; Yes, everyone unhappy about the overabundance of UKIP content should just leave\u000a\u000aI did not suggest you should leave.
p7652
aVI suggested that if you don't want to post your own articles but you are going to complain about there being too many UKIP articles or that there is a UKIP circlejerk, which quite frankly I completely disagree on, then you should leave.
p7653
aVPlease don't twist my words.
p7654
aVYou think that anybody who doesn't post on a subreddit but is unhappy with the state of a subreddit should leave?
p7655
aVThat's similar to making the argument that anybody that doesn't vote in the elections but is unhappy with the state of politics shouldn't be able to have an opinion on the state of politics.
p7656
aV&gt; You think that anybody who doesn't post on a subreddit but is unhappy with the state of a subreddit should leave?
p7657
aVNo, I am saying that anybody who is unhappy with the state of a subreddit but does nothing to try and change it besides complain about circlejerk and bias should shut up or leave.
p7658
aVBut many users read Reddit but don't post.
p7659
aVPassively interacting with Reddit is a perfectly legitimate usage of the site.
p7660
aVWhy can't they have an opinion?
p7661
aVThat's akin to saying 'if you don't like what's happening in government, do more politically.
p7662
aVBecome a campaigner etc.
p7663
aV' But that's not always what people want to do, and that's okay.
p7664
aVSome people just want to view a balanced subreddit.
p7665
aVThat's all I'm getting at here.
p7666
aV&gt; Why can't they have an opinion?
p7667
aVThey of course can!
p7668
aVBut no-one will know about it if they don't post it, and so nothing would change!
p7669
aV&gt; That's akin to saying 'if you don't like what's happening in government, do more politically\u000a\u000aYes, it is, because that's exactly what I am trying to say! 
p7670
aVCalm your tits Adolf.
p7671
aVWho are you to tell this guy he can't express his displeasure about something on this subreddit?
p7672
aVHmm... sounds a bit like bloody political correctness gone mad it does.
p7673
aVCan't even complain anymore or the Ukip PC Brigade will get you!
p7674
aVThat's a strawman.
p7675
aVI didn't say he can't complain about the subreddit.
p7676
aVI said if he is *only* going to complain without actively trying to change things then he should leave.
p7677
aVAgain, don't twist my words.
p7678
aVOr compare me to Hitler.
p7679
aVOr claim I am in a Ukip PC Brigade when I do not support UKIP nor did anything I said have to do with political correctness.
p7680
aV&gt;I said if he is only going to complain without actively trying to change things then he should leave.
p7681
aVWhy would you say that when, literally, the comment you were replying to he demonstrated he does actively try to change things.
p7682
aVAnd you've got the front to say I'm making a strawman?
p7683
aVHis comment certainly demonstrated that, yes.
p7684
aVHis post history however did not because he has only made 2 posts here all year.
p7685
aVIt was not a strawman. 
p7686
aVSpeaking of post history.
p7687
aVIs it not strange that you've you've made nearly 90 comments all in defence or support of Ukip in the last thirty days yet... you don't support Ukip?
p7688
aVWhy not just be honest.
p7689
aVNope, I do not support UKIP, I am just against the mass immigration and they are the only proper party that wants to properly control immigration.
p7690
aVMainly I find myself defending them if someone is being ignorant and claiming they are racist, etc.
p7691
aVYou don't like UKIP, fine, I disagree with them on many things.
p7692
aVBut don't write them off as racist when they are not, that is very silly in my opinion.
p7693
aVWhy is immigration such a big issue for you though?
p7694
aVYou know, just stepping back and taking some perspective on all the things that need fixing socially economically and politically, immigration is such a non-issue.
p7695
aVSo it's really difficult not to wonder where these people are coming from when their main political thrust is hinged on this one issue and blaming immigrants for the vast majority of societies woes.
p7696
aVIt's like, you know how there's a problem in some places with Grey Squirrels?
p7697
aVWell imagine if there was a guy who ran on a platform of curtailing Grey Squirrels, but he *always* talked about Grey Squirrel; seemingly disproportionately to the impact they were actually having on society.
p7698
aVPeople would question him on the economy and he would respond with examples of how the Grey Squirrels are having a negative impact.
p7699
aVThey'd ask him about healthcare and he'd talk about how the Grey Squirrels are a burden.
p7700
aVPeople would ask about crime and it would elicit a response about Grey Squirrels in some way.
p7701
aVIt's always the Grey Squirrels.
p7702
aVPeople would rightly, I think, assume that this guy has some serious issues with Grey Squirrels. 
p7703
aV&gt; Why is immigration such a big issue for you though?
p7704
aVWhy are you assuming I think it is such a big issue?
p7705
aVIt is not the biggest issue in my eyes whatsoever, but it *is* an issue.
p7706
aVYou cannot claim it is a non-issue when Lib-Lab-Con all agree net migration must come down and it causes or aggravates issues.
p7707
aV&gt; It's like, you know how there's a problem in some places with Grey Squirrels?
p7708
aV...... People would rightly, I think, assume that this guy has some serious issues with Grey Squirrels.
p7709
aVOK, that was a really stupid and biased allegory for starters.
p7710
aVBut to say that people who think mass-immigration is an issue all have issues with immigrants themselves is not only massively stupid but also quite dangerous as it allows the opinion that mass-immigration is an issue to simply be dismissed as racist and as bigotry and stops for any proper debate over an actual issue to be had, censorship almost.
p7711
aVWith regard to the suggestion that *all* people who think immigration is a problem are racist I would disagree.
p7712
aVAnd from the fact that you think that's the argument I'm making I don't think you've quite grasped the point I'm trying to make.
p7713
aVFirstly let's be frank here.
p7714
aVUkip supporters *do* think immigration is a big issue and it's clearly the *most important* issue to them.
p7715
aVI mean right or wrong do we at least agree on that?
p7716
aV&gt; I don't think you've quite grasped the point I'm trying to make.
p7717
aVWell I do apologise for that but maybe next time you are trying to drive a point across, don't do it in an allegory about grey squirrels.
p7718
aV&gt; it's clearly the most important issue to them.
p7719
aVI mean right or wrong do we at least agree on that?
p7720
aVA big issue to them, yes.
p7721
aVIt's all you hear Farage talk about most of the time which I think is quite a shame.
p7722
aVBut it's not the most important.
p7723
aVWe'll say 2nd most important, after leaving the EU.
p7724
aVUKIP is after all a euroskeptic party that was founded as a party whose main goal was to leave the EU.
p7725
aVWhen it was first founded they didn't have an immigration policy as far as I know because it wasn't an issue then. 
p7726
aVCan anyone make a pie chart or something?
p7727
aVI set the homepage to 'sort by new' and in the most recent 50 posts only about 7 were UKIP/Farage.
p7728
aVThere are lots of UKIPers here but then it suits reddits demographics, there are a lot of greens too.
p7729
aVFor what its worth I am strongly left wing and anti-ukip and I don't see this sub as being particularly biased.
p7730
aVIf anything the bias on this sub is anti-establishment, but again reddit is mostly made up of young white men so that isn't surprising. 
p7731
aVI've just been to /r/unitedkingdom,  I don't tend to bother, just to check-up, and what did I find?
p7732
aVA pro-Labour circle-jerk, you may be comfortable there.
p7733
aVYou may not like ukpolitics having a Tory/UKIP presence, but they're welcome here.
p7734
aVUKIP are so frequently attacked, supporters where hard hats and are constantly ready for attacks, hence the voting battles have become partisan.
p7735
aVThe attacks will become less frequent after the election, this'll allow things to settle down a bit.
p7736
aVThis place is way better than /r/uk.
p7737
aVBlame the r/unitedkingdom mods.
p7738
aVThey banned all UKIP supporters to here. 
p7739
aVReally?
p7740
aVDo you have proof?
p7741
aVI don't mean to sound contradictory, I'm just trying to be objective.
p7742
aVAnyway, perhaps this subreddit might benefit from the lack of a downvote button.
p7743
aVGive it a week, maybe, see what happens.
p7744
aVThere was a period a while ago where the mods thought they had a brigading problem centered around UKIP and other "right wing" political views, and went very heavy handed on the moderation, resulting in a temporary swing in the other direction.
p7745
aVThe problem was that temporary swing became partly ingrained and now the uk subs have quite different makeups, UK being mostly center left and UKpol being polarised between right and left.
p7746
aVThe ukip supporters could help fix the problem by visiting both subs, but quite often things just end up breaking down into arguments and each side gets more firmly entrenched.
p7747
aVIt kind of came because /pol/ did actually start brigading this sub and UK.
p7748
aVEveryone in the brigade supported UKIP and were extremely racist to boot.
p7749
aVThe mods were a little heavy handed in their response, but the brigade did exist. 
p7750
aVI'm a bit careful about saying what was and was not brigading.
p7751
aVIt definitely existed to a point, but not all the stuff that was hit was.
p7752
aVThis isn't true.
p7753
aVThe subs used to be extremely left wing before the brigading.
p7754
aVIf anything it's got better.
p7755
aVI got downvoted for suggesting that no one was forcing us to be monarchists.
p7756
aVAs if yes, someone is...jeez...
p7757
aVIt's widely known and has been discussed in various threads which are usually deleted.
p7758
aVThere certainly were a few posters who banged the UKIP drum night and day.
p7759
aVThey reflected poorly on both themselves and the rest of UKIP.
p7760
aVBeing a UKIP supporter does not in itself get you banned, other than in the minds of such people. 
p7761
aVWhat happened was the mods of r/uk are not UKIP supporters and were worried about the increase of UKIP support on the sub.
p7762
aVThey then decided to ban UKIP supporters but allow them to post on the much smaller r/ukpolitics sub as they also controlled it and didn't want to enable the creation of an alternative UK sub which wasn't hostile to UKIP supporters. 
p7763
aVNo it wasn't that's not what happened at all.
p7764
aVWhat happened was /pol/ started brigading the shit out of /r/uk and /r/ukpolitics and a bunch of them got banned for doing it, not only from the mods but also from the Reddit admins who can see things like IP's and know when people are brigading or using alt accounts.
p7765
aVThen /pol/ went to shit so a bunch of people stayed here but don't like to admit it and make up this lie about 'hurr baned 4 suprting ukip'.
p7766
aVThat Bulldog user himself even admitted before that he got banned for using alts when he used to complain that he was 'banned for supporting UKIP' also.
p7767
aVNo one buys that story other than UKIPpers and the horde of 'new users who just stumbled on /r/ukpoltics innocently'.
p7768
aVbulldog got banned because he had to keep creating alts in order to post on r/uk as they kept banning him for making UKIP related posts.
p7769
aVIts a sly tactic isn't it?
p7770
aVBan someone for making UKIP related posts and then get the admins to perma-ban them when they create a new account to get around the ban.
p7771
aVThe whole 4chan raid excuse was mostly a ruse to enable them to ban UKIP supporters.
p7772
aVAnyone who expressed support for UKIP they put a lock on.
p7773
aVThey banned people for using the phrase "cultural enrichment" and crap like that. 
p7774
aVYeah, we also banned a load of people.
p7775
aVUntil May 2014 the automoderator list was largely centered around banning one mad Scottish guy.
p7776
aVIn August 2014 we were pushing over 100 bans and 100 names in auto-moderator. 
p7777
aVThat mad Scottish guy **really** hates me.
p7778
aVI'm way beyond hating him back and I'm now concerned for his mental health :/
p7779
aVWho is this mad Scottish guy?
p7780
aVWhy would Bulldog be banned though?
p7781
aVIn my experience, he was never abusive and seemed pretty polite, though I conceded I might have missed something as I am not here every day.
p7782
aVThere are people who behave appallingly on here that are tolerated, I have just PMd you with an example of the kind of harassment that continues unabated on here.
p7783
aVWhy would you shadowban with Auto mod instead of just banning them?
p7784
aVIf you ban someone they know they are banned, so they just register another account.
p7785
aVIf you shadow ban someone and occasionally downvote them, they can literally spend months posting away to no one. 
p7786
aVThe /pol/ raid wasn't a ruse at all.
p7787
aVThere's whole archives full of brigading posts on /pol/ along with tons of screenshots that were took when they were raiding.
p7788
aVThere's 0 point in even trying to deny it, like I said literally no one buys your story about "Admins and Mods trying to destroy UKIP" other than UKIPPers and the people who are brigading anyway. 
p7789
aVYep, documented by people who are just as bad as them who set up shit like badukpolitics. 
p7790
aVReddit admins don't allow vote brigading, though.
p7791
aVPosts on /r/badukpolitics and so on are always no-participation links.
p7792
aVIt's completely different to the /pol/ downvoting/"can't barrage the Farage"/etc.
p7793
aVspam.
p7794
aVWhy even bother to defend them?
p7795
aVThe admins aren't trying to destroy UKIP and I never said that.
p7796
aVI imagine they couldn't give a crap just like they don't give a crap why mods ban people from subs.
p7797
aVWhat they do care about is people trying to get around the bans.
p7798
aVMods can go cry to admins over users creating new accounts to get around their bans and admins will attempt to deal with it.
p7799
aVAnd yes, the mods on r/uk used a few throw-away posts on /britpol/ calling people to raid r/unitedkingdom (which had about as much weight as a call to raid somewhere on here) as a ruse to ban large numbers of people who expressed support for UKIP, so much so that a large increase in permanent UKIP support has been noticed on this sub. 
p7800
aVbrit/pol/*
p7801
aVBulldog got banned because he was using multiple alts to upvote posts that he created in attempt to push them up the page.
p7802
aVIt's exactly the sort of thing we don't want. 
p7803
aVNot true.
p7804
aVHe created alts to post in /r/uk after he was unjustly banned from there.
p7805
aV*he*?
p7806
aVCome on bulldog, stop pretending
p7807
aVWhat utter balls.
p7808
aVHe was banned for making a pain in the arse of himself.
p7809
aVI love this Victim mentality you all fall into when you get caught.
p7810
aVIts almost like you guys have a playbook..What you really dont like about r/uk is that people pull you up on your dodgy figures and complete lack of facts, your distortions and general nonsense.
p7811
aVLast time I looked that was being Pro Truth not Anti UKIP, although it seems to amount to the same thing.
p7812
aVThis is extremely disingenuous flappybored.
p7813
aVYou're better than this.
p7814
aV&gt; No one buys that story other than UKIPpers and the horde of 'new users who just stumbled on /r/ukpoltics innocently'.
p7815
aVYou say this often yet NEVER provide evidence.
p7816
aVI mean, how did *you* 'stumble' across ukpol?
p7817
aVWhy is it that you are here with good intentions but others (who coincidentally hold different opinions to yourself) aren't?
p7818
aVYou sound like a paranoid madman and utterly incapable of removing motive from any inquiry, if I am honest.
p7819
aVNot everything is a fucking conspiracy.
p7820
aVYou're already onto your third account?
p7821
aVJesus what happened to other 2?
p7822
aVI believe this is his 6th actually!
p7823
aV/u/SinghaleseTerrier received -90\u000a\u000a/u/SinghaleseTerrier2 recevied -65\u000a\u000aViews the left disagree with and who - with reactionary zeal - will downvote, gets you removed whilst the infamous Cybernats -who crop up on here - calling everybody 'cunts', are tolerated.
p7824
aVAsked Ivashkin to sort it out, lets see what he says.
p7825
aVWhat do you mean by 'sort it out'?
p7826
aVYour views aren't the main reason you get downvoted, I don't know any other person on here with similar views who has been downvoted so much they're on their 6th account.
p7827
aVYeah, even bulldog's on his 4th or 5th (not counting voting accounts.
p7828
aVHe should stand for Tower Hamlets)
p7829
aVplus bulldog was banned by mods/admins, not because he annoyed people to the point of getting downvoted so much that his accounts last less than a week\u000a\u000aedit: at this point this pretty much sums up terrier's attitude: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAuR5bkIlQ
p7830
aVBrilliant.
p7831
aVYeah, sometimes the common denominator is a little closer to home. 
p7832
aVBut when we call people cunts it's charming.
p7833
aVMake some posts supporting UKIP in /r/UK.
p7834
aVSee how long you last.
p7835
aVYou don't even need to go as far as UKIP, last time I mentioned I'm economically Tory I got called "Fucking Tory Scum" and downvoted into oblivion.
p7836
aVFucking Tory Scum.
p7837
aVHere, have an upvote.
p7838
aVMy favourite was being called conservashill.
p7839
aVLink?
p7840
aVI've heard it said that the right thinks the left is wrong, the left think the right are evil.
p7841
aVI don't think the left think the right are genuinely evil, just fearful and easily manipulated.
p7842
aVDid you post them day and night like you do here?
p7843
aVThis is meant to be a discussion forum, not a marketing channel
p7844
aVI had 2 accounts banned there, didn't even give a reason when I asked what rule I broke, also had an account banned here for no reason when this place was still far left, asked the mods and had no response. 
p7845
aVIt's on both sides, I had an account banned for arguing that the spikes outside selfridges were a lazy and ineffective solution to the homeless problem.
p7846
aV(The spikes were later removed and found out to be little to do with the homeless, so it's a moot point now anyway.
p7847
aV) Asked for a reason twice, they gave none.
p7848
aVI think they're just banning things on a whim really. 
p7849
aVMaybe you're being downvoted because that's a stupid thing to say.
p7850
aVThe EDL is extremely and openly anti Islam. 
p7851
aVWell it is now, it didn't used to be as bad honestly.
p7852
aVAnd thats not the point anyway, they banned me because they didn't agree with me.
p7853
aVEdited my comment too because it takes away from the point. 
p7854
aVI first heard about the EDL in 2010, guess who from?
p7855
aVYep, the openly racist guy at work.
p7856
aVThat doesn't matter, I still had no reason to be banned. 
p7857
aVI don't know about that all I was referring to was your claim that the EDL didn't used to be that bad.
p7858
aVI can say with certainty that at least as far back as 2010 they were mega-racists.
p7859
aVAye this.
p7860
aVr/unitedkingdom mods are the fourth reich and the sort of plebs who would happily donate to CAGE and pelt stones at grannies at UKIP meetings
p7861
aV"banned to" - not familiar with this expression.
p7862
aVYou mean you've all been forced to come here and can't leave?
p7863
aVI'm not a UKIP supporter - but compared to the sickening bias in /r/unitedkingdom this sub is extremely politically... not neutral, but bipartisan.
p7864
aV[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2semhu/al_murray_the_pub_landlord_is_going_to_stand/cnos116) received 25 downvotes.
p7865
aV&gt;UKIP isn't a protest party.
p7866
aVI suggest you read the research of Matthew Goodwin and Rob Ford - it's the product of a serious value divide which has existed in the country for decades and hasn't been given significant political expression before.
p7867
aVEven if you disagree with it, it's a bizarre thing to have downvoted so many times and can only be attributed to a serious bias in existence there.
p7868
aVAs a vehement opponent of UKIP I actually agree with that post. 
p7869
aVIf you're wanting to discuss bias, I'd avoid throwing words like "sickening.
p7870
aV" It doesn't suggest a very non-biased viewpoint. 
p7871
aVYep, you can tell by how much people argue (;
p7872
aVno we don't!
p7873
aV*takes off shirt*\u000a\u000a#YES WE DO
p7874
aV/r/unitedkingdom appears to drifting right as well tbh, I'm starting to agree with a lot more posts there than I used to.
p7875
aVIt used to be on par with /r/shitredditsays.
p7876
aVAny examples of them "drifting right"?
p7877
aVI checked out the thread about the latest mass immigration stats on there, and the only response was that we need to build more houses... not control immigration!
p7878
aVIt seems like on most issues related to immigration in /r/unitedkingdom and /r/europe it's swinging to the right, but that can be ascribed a number of reasons: that immigration tends to be a hot topic for rightists so they'll naturally be drawn to the thread, that certain off-reddit and on-reddit groups brigade into it, and that slightly because of extraneous factors (grooming scandals, more terrorist attacks) general public opinion is moving further in an anti-migration tendency. 
p7879
aVyeah it sucks when people try to fix a problem rather than just cling on to their racism, fucking lefties!
p7880
aVWhat?
p7881
aVPeople who want controlled immigration are trying to 'cling on to their racism'?
p7882
aVIt's really crazy - most countries outside of the EU have a controlled immigration policy but when people mention it here it is deemed racist!
p7883
aVI really can't get my head around that.
p7884
aVJust ignore it.
p7885
aVIt's just mindless crap.
p7886
aV&gt; cling on to their racism\u000a\u000aI see you're one of the few who still pretends UKIP is a racist party.
p7887
aVExcept building endless houses isn't a fix, it's a band-aid.
p7888
aVPreventing people who are a net gain on the economy from coming here  isn't even a band-aid though, it's shooting off your foot because it needs scratching.
p7889
aVPlus our housing situation needs sorting anyway so it's far from a band aid.
p7890
aVWhat economic benefit do non-EU migrants bring to the UK?
p7891
aVWhy not increase the benefit of EU migrants by being more selective about which ones get here?
p7892
aVA bit of TLDR history.
p7893
aVThis sub used to extremely anti-UKIP.
p7894
aVAdmitting you supported UKIP on this board used to be asking to be downvoted into oblivion automatically.
p7895
aVYes /pol brigaded the sub with UKIP supporters - but fuck me if I give a shit.
p7896
aVPeople are too quick to forget what it used to be like to have a UKIP opinion on this board before then.
p7897
aVThe mods have actually done a good job of looking after this sub - people like UKIP more than they used to.
p7898
aVTry to get used to it. \u000a
p7899
aV&gt; The mods have actually done a good job of looking after this sub\u000a\u000aThe mods have said they're fine with the sub being all about point-scoring while debate around the actual issues crashes and burns.
p7900
aVThis seems to be your opinion rather than actual facts.
p7901
aV&gt; This seems to be your opinion rather than actual facts.
p7902
aVTo quote /u/Ivashkin:\u000a\u000a&gt;I think that honestly this sub is a very good representation of British politics.
p7903
aVPeople screaming about their various identities and trying to score points while actual issues that desperately need addressing crash and burn around them.
p7904
aVMe:\u000a\u000a&gt;But *should* it be like that?
p7905
aVIvaskhin:\u000a\u000a&gt;No, but that train left the station a long time ago\u000a\u000aTranslation: We don't want to even try to do anything about it.
p7906
aV([source](/r/ukpolitics/comments/2xmd5b/im_done_with_rukpolitics_and_heres_why/cp22ci4?context=3))
p7907
aVI quite like free debate though, even if I sometimes hate what it results in.
p7908
aVThat is fair.
p7909
aVModerating when someone calls someone else a name is a bit limp.
p7910
aVIf the threads go off-topic thend so be it.
p7911
aV...I'll repeat.
p7912
aV&gt; This seems to be your opinion rather than actual facts\u000a\u000a
p7913
aVIvaskin said that's what happens in this sub.
p7914
aVHe also declined, elsewhere in that thread, to change moderation styles \u2234 the mods are fine with it \u220e
p7915
aVYour interpretation of a conversation that most likely had a slightly different context.
p7916
aVThings like this don't impress me.
p7917
aVI'm sorry.
p7918
aVIf anyone's interested in what it used to be like, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1ub093/nick_griffin_declared_bankrupt/ceg9vnh) was a typical discussion about UKIP and [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/18jctn/had_a_run_in_with_our_local_ukip_council/c8fayn0) what happened when someone revealed themselves as a UKIP supporter.
p7919
aVI don't think the problem was that he revealed he was a Ukip supporter, it was that he actually explained what Ukip stood for...   \u000a  \u000a&gt;Against windfarms *and* solar panels(?
p7920
aV)  \u000a  \u000a&gt;Against same-sex marriage  \u000a  \u000a&gt;Abolish asylum  \u000a  \u000a&gt;Ban further entry to the country by muslims  \u000a  \u000aThe difference now is they've slowly started to learn *not* to talk openly about what they really believe any more. 
p7921
aVAbsolutely, it's become acceptable to support UKIP without going into depth about your beliefs. 
p7922
aVI think you missed the point, that's not a good thing.
p7923
aVThe point is that Ukip have just gotten more media savvy and learned to obfuscate their bigotry and racism behind more inventive language.
p7924
aVOh no, it's definitely not a good thing.
p7925
aVIt just seems to have become acceptable in this sub. 
p7926
aVEven so, those are all just opinions and they actually *were* downvoted into oblivion.
p7927
aVIt's also the comments made towards him: \u000a\u000a &gt;Because he's a shameless bigot who, in any civilised community, would be ostracised.
p7928
aV&gt;You're a horrible person and I despise you.
p7929
aV&gt;You're a bad person\u000a\u000a &gt;you are the lowest of the low.
p7930
aV&gt;What's it like in your small, out of the way village?
p7931
aVDo you still burn Wicker men to ensure a good harvest?
p7932
aVWhat was it like when you first saw a plane?
p7933
aVIt's like they're magic, aren't they?
p7934
aV&gt;a self-righteous bigot without the strength of character to look in a mirror.
p7935
aVDo you seriously condone this sort of abuse against people for holding opinions?
p7936
aVNone of these comments would draw positive scores here now - not because we've been overrun by UKIP supporters but because the variety of opinion here has meant that people now have to learn to put up with seeing things they disagree with, and the ones that can't handle that have gone to britishpolitics.
p7937
aVIf someone says bigoted things, I don't think it's 'abusive' to call them a bigot or a bad person.
p7938
aVI mean, are you serious?
p7939
aVWhat did he say that was bigoted?
p7940
aV'Bigotry' actually means something beyond just being a buzzword you can throw out to justify self-righteous abuse.
p7941
aV&gt;Bigotry is a state of mind where a person obstinately, irrationally, unfairly or intolerantly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.
p7942
aVSome examples include personal beliefs, race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or other group characteristics.
p7943
aVYou've got sexual orientation, religion and national origin.
p7944
aVTake your pick.
p7945
aVGive a quote which demonstrates bigotry.
p7946
aV&gt;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman, I don't want Parliament redefining it.
p7947
aVThis man wants to prevent people who's lifestyle he doesn't agree with having the same freedoms he has.
p7948
aVWhich clearly stems from his idea that homosexuality is wrong.  \u000a  \u000a
p7949
aVHa, of course it doesn't.
p7950
aVIt's a straightforward opinion on what the nature of marriage should be.
p7951
aVSome people disagree with you.
p7952
aVIt doesn't make them bigots or mean they have some sort of underlying prejudice.
p7953
aVGet over it.
p7954
aVAnd don't rush to people's defence just because they fall on your side of an argument.
p7955
aVIf the comments made in that thread were against someone with your opinions you'd agree with me.
p7956
aVNothing wrong with substantive comments from anyone of any political leaning but I downvote every comment which is just UKIP boilerplate.
p7957
aVThis isn't a place for people to simply constantly reiterate their parties core beliefs and repeat their idiosyncratic terminology ad nauseum. 
p7958
aVThis thread gets made every other week and it's always wrong.
p7959
aVThreads on this sub go left and right in opinions constantly, upvotes and downvotes are often split semi-evenly.
p7960
aVJust because the r/UnitedKingdom green party crowd bans everyone in here from that sub and then refuses to come here for any political discussion other than "this sub is too biased!!!
p7961
aV" doesn't mean this sub only allows opinions from UKIP voters.
p7962
aVAlso, just because the UKIP voters here make an effort to post political news from their alignment and Greens don't doesn't mean that Green political news isn't allowed.
p7963
aVI'm sick of this constant to and fro between the pro and anti-UKIP posters to be frank.
p7964
aVThere seem to be as many meta posts complaining about UKIP supporting users as there are pro-UKIP posts.
p7965
aVWORKERS OF THE UK UNITE!
p7966
aVDOWN WITH THE FASH!
p7967
aV(If you'd kindly sign your name after each downvote, that'd be great ;) )
p7968
aVYou are taking upvoting/downvoting too seriously.
p7969
aVIf you have made a valid point that is worth others reading then that should be enough - regardless of whether others agree with you or not.
p7970
aVIf your post us upvoted or downvoted then at least someone has read it and been moved to respond in some way.
p7971
aVThe worst possible option for me is where there is no response and the comment languishes with no votes at all.  
p7972
aVIf a comment gets downvoted enough it will be hidden or people will assume it is a bad comment due to the downvoting...
p7973
aVI always expand those to see what others olbject to and I don't base my opinions on what others think.
p7974
aVThere is /r/britishpolitics which is smaller and more heavily moderated.
p7975
aVIt also suffers from downvotes problems though (what sub doesn't?
p7976
aV). 
p7977
aVI think it's still got quite a bias.
p7978
aVIf you make a post about Nigel Farage for example people will just comment "what a wanker" with nothing else to add and they'll get upvoted a lot for it.
p7979
aVSame people who run that run r/badukpolitics, surprise surprise.
p7980
aVI don't know if there's much more you could do to establish you had an agenda.
p7981
aVMe or them? 
p7982
aVThem
p7983
aVIt's interesting that you mention the greens; people here don't let people get away with saying stupid stuff like on /r/unitedkingdom.
p7984
aVI expect that ironically your own biases are making you think like this.
p7985
aVI Will buy you a month of reddit gold if you find an example of someone being downvoted despite being diplomatic.
p7986
aVOf course I have my own biases, I am a human being after all!
p7987
aVI'm sure your comment about not letting people get away with saying stupid stuff is part of your bias too.
p7988
aVWell, what do you define as diplomatic?
p7989
aVDo you really think reddit and this sub downvotes people based on level of diplomacy? 
p7990
aVFor example, people who are used to r/uk will see blind criticism of the right wing as something to be upvoted.
p7991
aVHere, if you want to criticise UKIP it requires analysis that you wouldnt see on r/uk.
p7992
aVSo this makes this place seem biased.
p7993
aVI'd say it's more equal, but the new normal is against Ukip
p7994
aVhow about this?
p7995
aV: http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2w63fq/why_do_people_tolerate_unite_against_fascism/conylmu?context=3\u000a\u000a-5 points, nothing inflammatory about the post.
p7996
aVVery dismissive of the community, implies that everyone else is wrong.
p7997
aVI wouldn't count that.
p7998
aVIt's not dismissive though?
p7999
aVAnd it doesn't imply they're wrong for doing so?
p8000
aVIt just states the fact that /r/ukpolitics is very anti UAF.
p8001
aVI don't think anyone denies this.
p8002
aVJesus mate you came up with a really bad example.
p8003
aVAnd to be fair there is a lot to dislike about the UAF thugs.
p8004
aVNo name calling, insults, implications, smugness or value judgements in that post.
p8005
aVI don't even say that I'm a fan myself (I've yet to pass judgement on them).
p8006
aVA simple statement of UAF's unpopularity on here, and that defences of their tactics would be better found elsewhere.
p8007
aVHow does that deserve the downvoting?
p8008
aVYour opinions on the UAF don't have anything to do with it.
p8009
aVPeople downvote posts they don't like - nobody can stop that.
p8010
aVTry not to let it bother you.
p8011
aVThe UAF have proven time and time again that they are not nice people - that is why people don't like them.
p8012
aVIt's really as simple as that.
p8013
aVYeah, I don't really care about the downvotes personally, I was just using it as an example for the OP.
p8014
aVI think someone owes me a gold!
p8015
aVEr..
p8016
aVI've left my wallet in my car...\u000a\u000aAll I was saying is that you could have made a better example.
p8017
aVThis post got downvoted.
p8018
aVThere's an example right there! 
p8019
aV[deleted]
p8020
aVI don't ever say true though do I?
p8021
aVI say good answer, as in a rebuttal from someone who actually supports them (which is what the OP wanted).
p8022
aVYou're projecting a lot here.
p8023
aVYou see the problem with most people who cause trouble is that they are delusional and not self aware.
p8024
aVAre you implying something about me, or...?
p8025
aV&gt; Are you implying something about me, or...?
p8026
aVNo absolutely not, sorry for the confusion.
p8027
aVah cool, no worries!
p8028
aVI think a key difference here is that UKIP supporters don't really care about downvotes to the same degree as lefties.
p8029
aVLeft wing people, who tend to be more collectivist minded community-based people, are more susceptible to group shaming and ostracisation.
p8030
aVThey have more invested in the opinion and viewpoint of their peer group.
p8031
aVAll for one and one for all.
p8032
aVKippers are more individualist.
p8033
aVUnfazed by downvotes because they have courage in their convictions and have confidence to argue the UKIP view.
p8034
aVLefties are more likely to go with the flow, not go against the grain of a sub, and follow the hive.
p8035
aVAnother thing - I think lefties tend to be young.
p8036
aVYounger people, raised online, are only used to engaging with others online through a filter bubble and are unused to coming up against a group that hold deeply contrasting views to things they hold dear and they once thought were universally held.
p8037
aVYounger people, i.e under the age of 25, are totally used to using the web where internet-based peer group validation goes hand in hand with any discussion or debate.
p8038
aVIf it isn't upvotes, it's Facebook likes, Twitter retweets, instagram shares.
p8039
aVSocial media gives people the ability to curate their community/followers/friends to such a high degree which in turn means it has become  quite predictable to know how your post or content will be received by your community, so when A is confronted with a mix of up/downvotes and no clear hivemind, A is unable to predict with a strong degree of accuracy how their post will be taken by the sub which then leads to feelings of confusion, anger and possibly isolation.
p8040
aVThe fact that UKIP posters don't really mind downvotes to the same degree as others goes a long way to explaining why bans are being handed out for posting pro-UKIP views on other subs.
p8041
aVModerators, who tend to come from the community themselves, and are generally of a liberal/left bent, see people unfazed by downvotes as a danger to their community and a direct threat to their authority.
p8042
aVThey feel a sense of purpose and duty to protect "their" community from "incorrect" thinking.
p8043
aVThey feel a sense of justification in handing out bans based on negative peer-group validation, or angry people spamming the 'report' button.
p8044
aVNot all moderators, there are some good guys, but enough do.\u000a\u000a
p8045
aVI think his is a case of confirmation bias.
p8046
aVI get down voted here all the time for supportng UKIP, and criticising the Greens. 
p8047
aVAll other subs are hostile to UKIP supporters.
p8048
aVSo they have gathered here.
p8049
aVUKIP are over-represented here, 24% are UKIP supporters.
p8050
aVBut then 8% are SNP, 17% Lib Dem and Greens 21%.
p8051
aVSo if we compare to outside world support, UKIP are nowhere near as over-represented as these other parties.
p8052
aVIt is Labour and the Conservatives that are severely underrepresented.
p8053
aVUKIP are exciting and new.
p8054
aVLot's to discuss and talk about, so people post about them.
p8055
aVMostly because of the bullshit people have deployed to attack UKIP.
p8056
aVJust a bunch of fruitcake racists with no policies.
p8057
aVSo people post to inform.
p8058
aVThen the dickheads post more of the same bullshit.
p8059
aVUKIP represent all of the UK.
p8060
aVNot parts of it.
p8061
aVThey also have a stance that no other relevant party has, they are anti EU and want out.
p8062
aVAround half of people want out of the EU.
p8063
aVSo no surprise people want to hear what they have to say. \u000a
p8064
aVThe Greens are exciting and new.
p8065
aVLot's to discuss and talk about, so people post about them.
p8066
aVMostly because of the bullshit people have deployed to attack the Greens.
p8067
aVJust a bunch of fruitcake marxists with crazy policies.
p8068
aVSo people post to inform.
p8069
aVThen the dickheads post more of the same bullshit.
p8070
aVSee what I did there?
p8071
aVUKIPers complain that others misrepresent them, but then they post attack pieces from the Telegraph that lie about Green party policies and have a massive circle-jerk pretending those articles are accurate.
p8072
aVIt's hypocritical.
p8073
aVNo it isn't.
p8074
aVGreen supporters are welcome in other subs.
p8075
aVThey are also over-represented by around 400%.
p8076
aVTheir members don't post much about the party.
p8077
aVThere hasn't been any sort of campaign against them like there has been UKIP. 
p8078
aVWhat?
p8079
aVNatalie Bennett's 'car crash' interview coverage?
p8080
aVArticles attacking the most out there policies and leaving the popular ones out?
p8081
aVI'd say both parties have been unfairly attacked, it doesn't have to be one or the other. 
p8082
aV&gt;Natalie Bennett's 'car crash' interview coverage?
p8083
aVIt was an absolutely horrific interview and would have gotten coverage regardless of who it was.
p8084
aV&gt;Articles attacking the most out there policies and leaving the popular ones out?
p8085
aVScrutiny of insane policies are not attack pieces, and in many cases their popular ones such as citizens income also fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny.
p8086
aVThe Andrew Neil interview is a good example of that.
p8087
aVYou really can't compare the Greens (who were actually complaining that they didn't get the same level coverage that UKIP gets, and are now complaining that the coverage is negative) treatment in the media to UKIP's.
p8088
aVCome back when the remarks of a Green councillor nobody has ever heard of makes the ten O'clock news and the front pages of national newspapers and I might start to agree with you.
p8089
aVHaving some popular policies does not forgive the "most out there" ones.
p8090
aV[deleted]
p8091
aVSomeone's [just posted one](http://nopenothope.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/calls-to-burn-down-ukip-shop-by-members.html?m=1)
p8092
aV[deleted]
p8093
aVThe parliamentary candidate herself didn't do anything, she is apparently guilty by association because a member of that group posted a call for violence, that's a very tenuous link to the Green Party, it would be like calling the mods here racist because they allow racist ideas to be expressed here.
p8094
aV[deleted]
p8095
aVHe personally posted that cartoon, not some random member of a group was in.
p8096
aVDon't you see anything wrong with that cartoon?
p8097
aV[deleted]
p8098
aVThe cartoon portrays anyone black or Muslim as violent, and the white  Aryan family as victims.
p8099
aVThat's some pretty racist propaganda, and if was turned the other way round I'm sure you'd agree.
p8100
aV[deleted]
p8101
aVWhat's your interpretation of the cartoon then?
p8102
aVWhat is each character meant to represent?
p8103
aVIs it saying the media doesn't report on violent Muslim extremism, because it does.
p8104
aVWhat is the black guy with the guns supposed to signify?
p8105
aVAnd the white family? 
p8106
aV[deleted]
p8107
aV&gt; Are you just playing dumb or what?
p8108
aVAre you?
p8109
aVDo you not know what the word represents means?
p8110
aVI'm asking you, what do you think this cartoon is saying?
p8111
aVThat the media attacks white families?
p8112
aVI'm asking what it means to you, obviously you think it means something, it's not a fucking trick question.
p8113
aV[deleted]
p8114
aV&gt; This cartoon is saying that the media focus of attacks is on traditional, harmless concepts such as patriotism and the traditional nuclear family\u000a\u000aWhen has the media attacked patriotism or the traditional nuclear family?
p8115
aVUnless you believe to be patriotic you have to be racist or anti-immigration, things which are attacked?
p8116
aVOr that accepting things such gay marriage count as an attack on nuclear families, which is retarded.
p8117
aV&gt; Gang culture, honor killings, and radical jihadism are represented on the left.
p8118
aVNot just blacks and Muslims then?
p8119
aVBecause that's what it looked to me like the cartoon was trying to say, and that's probably why the BNP and Britain First loved it so much too.
p8120
aVJesus christ man, you should be ashamed of yourself.
p8121
aVWhy don't you just be honest about what you believe instead of weaselling around.\u000a  
p8122
aVThe reason low level UKIP members get so much attention is because they have come out with racist, Islamophobic or Xenophobic things.
p8123
aVIf a Green member made a similar comment, or anyone did, they would get the same amount of attention too. 
p8124
aVIslamophobia doesn't exist 
p8125
aVCare to elaborate?

aVHaving a phobia is an irrational fear; fearing a religion that promotes violence, slavery and pedophilia is perfectly rational in my opinion.
p8127
aVObviously not all Muslims are bad but the religion is.
p8128
aVMost religions promote certain things in their texts that we all disagree with.
p8129
aVThat doesn't make the religion inherently bad though.
p8130
aVChristianity and Judaism also promote pretty awful things. 
p8131
aVFirstly, I would argue that Islam does so more than either of the other two religions.
p8132
aVSecondly, I think Christianity and Judaism are bad too; I'm not championing any of them.
p8133
aVThe problem is that Islam is on a totally different scale of barbarism when compared to other popular religions and furthermore Islam is the religion which we are allowed to criticize the least.
p8134
aVIf you write an article in a newspaper denouncing Christianity nothing significant will happen but if you do the same for Islam you are labelled as an intolerant racist.
p8135
aVI thought, as a liberal country, we should be allowed to criticise each other?
p8136
aVApparently not in our skewed overly politically correct society.
p8137
aVLet me stress once again that I am not labeling all Muslims as bad people because I know that is what people generally think if you criticise Islam.

aVThe stories about pedophiles that were MP's worries me greatly though.

aV[deleted]
p8143
aVThat's fair and I was wrong and I sincerely apologise.
p8144
aVIt's deplorable that this has not been mentioned and I hold my hands up. 
p8145
aVI've not seen my grandmother plastered across the national news.
p8146
aVThe party really bears no relavence?
p8147
aVSo I'm assuming you heard about the [Labour councillor who compared a German resident to Hitler's wife](http://goo.gl/P0Nv0D)?
p8148
aVWhat about the [one who used the term 'queer little arse-licker'](http://goo.gl/QRTTio)?
p8149
aVOr the [one who accused a gay councillor of having a gimp in his basement](http://goo.gl/tDFFw6)?
p8150
aVAnd of course we all know the [Lib Dem councillor who shared Britain First material.
p8151
aV](http://goo.gl/scMZDo) And the [one who used a nazi slur against a fellow councillor](http://goo.gl/YlmVaK).
p8152
aVThen there's the [Conservative councillor who tweeted 'Am Machete - now THAT'S how you deal with immigration!
p8153
aV' He was allowed to keep his job.
p8154
aV](http://goo.gl/zNRfya) Also the [one who said that being "brown" and a woman is a handicap](http://goo.gl/HP6aEZ), which is probably worse than anything any UKIP councillor has ever said.
p8155
aVOdd are, you haven't heard of any one of these incidents before now, but you've probably heard of the former UKIP councillor who, when he was a Conservative, wrote a letter to David Cameron warning that gay marriage would cause extreme weather events.
p8156
aVYou might even know Rozanne 'Negoid Features' Duncan by name.
p8157
aVDon't kid yourself.
p8158
aVThe mainstream media, including the BBC, has a strong tendency clutch at much finer straws when attacking UKIP than it does with the major parties.
p8159
aVI'm not a UKIP supporter and I can see that.
p8160
aV&gt; Just a bunch of fruitcake marxists with crazy policies.
p8161
aVSo people post to inform.
p8162
aVIt's weird because I think they're nuts because I've watched people try and argue them and fail miserably.
p8163
aVAbsolute bollocks mate, UKIP supporters are a minority here, anything anti ukip always get tons of upvotes, I think the Lefties are upset their hugbox has been disturbed. 
p8164
aVUKIP supporters like to play the discriminated against white male minority card, you guys are pretty funny as long as nobody takes you seriously
p8165
aVIf there was a hugbox I have to be honest and say I would buy one.

p8167
aVHow does the massive upvoting of this thread sit with your narrative? 
p8168
aVYou say you are "pretty into politics".
p8169
aVand yet  you still haven't come to understand that different people have different political opinions.
p8170
aVIts not that this sub is particularly pro UKIP, as when they make a mistake they get called out on it.
p8171
aVThe problem is you are just not used to not having your anti-UKIP views challenged.
p8172
aVIf you want an echo-chamber, stick to /r/unitedkingdom
p8173
aVLet's just be clear though: "having your views challenged" and "being downvoted and abused for expressing your views" are not the same thing. 
p8174
aVCould you show me an example of someone being "abused" for expressing their views. 
p8175
aVNot really - I'm on my phone on the bus.
p8176
aVYou don't have to look hard to find personal insults and such.
p8177
aVThat's what I meant. 
p8178
aVWhat saviourman said.
p8179
aVIf I post anything critical of UKIP or pro left wing it gets downvoted regardless of the quality of the post.
p8180
aVI actually posted a thread inviting people to ask me questions about the Greens and why I supported them, so I am very used to having my views challenged! 
p8181
aVHaving your views challenged is very different from being unfairly criticized.
p8182
aVWere the things people said untrue?
p8183
aVThe greens have some very questionable policies, largely because they are a fringe party, and have no hope of leading government.
p8184
aVEven the party leaders don't believe their manifesto will ever be implemented.
p8185
aVIts simply a way of bringing attention to themselves.
p8186
aVIf they were to become more popular, their manifesto would change drastically, and become much more centrist, so its not surprising that as it currently stands, the green manifesto is very easy to criticize. 
p8187
aVThe Green party manifesto hasn't been published yet, their policies get published in full on their website as soon as they get agreed but they don't all necessarily get prioritised into the manifesto, some remain merely "aspirations".
p8188
aVNo other party is so open with it's policy making process, this is why Green policies get criticised because it's very easy for their enemies to cherry pick a few that are badly worded or open to (mis)interpretation and focus on them.
p8189
aVMate you really need to open your eyes and move beyond this sort of 'world is unfair and against my precious Green party' view.
p8190
aVPeople are quite obviously taking issue with more than just poorly worded policy (even though obviously this isn't exactly going to reflect well on any party advocating anything of claimed merit).
p8191
aVBut it's not like there's anything stopping you living that way yourself.
p8192
aVThat's the beauty of liberalism, and there are always alternate ways to reach sustainable ends.
p8193
aVThe other parties aren't 'secretive' about how they make policy at all.
p8194
aVIt's just not done in such a direct way since their organisations are far larger, more developed and have more resources to juggle.
p8195
aVJust join them and have a look for yourself...
p8196
aVEither way, saying something like, "You just haven't seen our best policies yet" isn't really going to convince anyone -- believe me.   
p8197

aV"hostile to debate"?
p8200
aVYou're complaining about a few down votes?
p8201
aVThe 'left' have whole  fake UKIP subbreddit setup, in an attempt to poison opinion here.\u000a\u000a
p8202
aVUs ukipers have to hang out here as the same happens to us at r/unitedkingdom
p8203
aVThis sub has a larger-than-proportional but not overwhelming UKIP presence.
p8204
aVI believe there was a poll recently and about 1/3 said they firmly support UKIP, 1/4 said they're on the fence and the remaining (~5/12) said they're certainly not voting UKIP.
p8205
aVNow compared to actual polls that's a much larger than average presence, and especially for the generally left-leaning redditor.
p8206
aVI do often see pro-UKIP posts being upvoted for seemingly no reason, but just the fact that UKIPers are still probably a minority on this sub means it can't really be thought of as pro-UKIP in general.
p8207
aVit just isn't good reddiquette
p8208
aVI posted yesterday about how Steve Emmens of UKIP said last night at the UEA NHS question time Trans*people should pay for their surgery,and called a Trans women how asked ''it'',and her tweet last I checked it was being downvoted with no comments.
p8209
aVYeah, *real* democracy sucks, maybe we should only allow one up or downvote from each constituency, see how that works out.
p8210
aVSometimes armchair politics is like that.
p8211
aVPeople shout loudly in relative comfort on here because it makes them feel and sound like a large slice of society.
p8212
aVRegardless, they're politically a minority. 
p8213
aV"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, ,then they down vote you and then you win.

aV"  Nigel Farage talking to the UKIPIDF 2015

p8222

p8230
aV/s\u000a\u000a
p8231
aV&gt; I'm sure I'll get downvoted or criticism for this but I'm fed up with it and people need to remember you're not winning anyone over by simply downvoting people who disagree with you!
p8232
aVRight now you're on +156, so you're not getting downvoted much.
p8233
aVUntil I posted this thread that was not the case! 
p8234
aVWhy is it only Kippers here?
p8235
aVAnyone who is Green is out hugging trees.
p8236
aVThe Labourites are too busy circle-jerking their oppression by laying around on steps outside a Banking corporation, the Lib Dems all agreed with Nick and went Tory.
p8237
aVThe Tories have an assistant to do their internet stuff so don't comment.
p8238
aVThe UKIPers are here because they are a new enough party to still want to discuss their ideals with the people that are only here to see what the Kippers are saying. 
p8239
aVI'm a Green Party supporter and I am not currently hugging a tree.
p8240
aVAlthough I am sat at a wooden table...

p8245
aV2.9 Million they spent on the European elections!
p8246
aVThats double what Labour spent!

p8251
aVIs this the kind of thing you were hoping for OP?
p8252
aVHaving been on here for a few years it has definitely moved to the right.
p8253
aVMy overall feeling based on what I've seen is that UKIP see the Greens as their main threat.
p8254
aV&gt;My overall feeling based on what I've seen is that UKIP see the Greens as their main threat.
p8255
aVIs this a joke?
p8256
aVUKIP and the Greens basically have no overlap in the kinds of voters they attract.
p8257
aVThe level of hatred UKIP supporters show towards the Greens here shows they feel threatened, and this has only been the case since we got more members than UKIP.
p8258
aVClearly you do feel threatened, not because there is an overlap in voters, but because it's destroyed your narrative of being the only insurgent anti-establishment party out there.
p8259
aVOr it could be because the Greens have pretty much the opposite views to UKIP supporters?
p8260
aVIt's not a joke.
p8261
aVIt's my opinion based on what I've seen going on on this sub.
p8262
aVThat is all.
p8263
aVBased on what?
p8264
aVWhy would UKIP or their supporters feel threatened by the Greens of all people?
p8265
aVPossibly because the Greens are actually an antiestablishment party while the Ukip are just purple Tory. 
p8266
aV*tips fedora*
p8267
aVDo you even lift, bruh?
p8268
aVHow the fuck would I know?
p8269
aVProbably because they are opposite political theories.
p8270
aVI can imagine a ukipper being anti green policies.
p8271
aVI bet they would say global warming is bollocks etc.
p8272
aVIt's true though that there is an anti green pro Ukip sentiment on here.
p8273
aV&gt;How the fuck would I know?
p8274
aVThrough logic and observation.
p8275
aV&gt;Probably because they are opposite political theories.
p8276
aVSo?
p8277
aVThat doesn't constitute a threat.
p8278
aVThe Greens are not doing damage to UKIP nor are they vying for the same voters.
p8279
aV&gt; I can imagine a ukipper being anti green policies\u000a\u000aEveryone blessed with critical faculties and the numeracy of a nine year old is anti green policies.
p8280
aV&gt;I bet they would say global warming is bollocks etc.
p8281
aVYou bet?
p8282
aVHow about you observe and find out instead of making assumptions?
p8283
aV&gt;It's true though that there is an anti green pro Ukip sentiment on here.
p8284
aVPerhaps.
p8285
aVI don't see why that is a problem in itself.
p8286
aVThe fact that the Greens are going from one cock up to another and that none of their policies can withstand even the most basic scrutiny doesn't help.
p8287
aV'Everyone blessed with critical faculties and the numeracy of a nine year old is anti green policies.
p8288
aV'\u000a\u000aYet when choosing policies over parties the majority of people choose Green policies?
p8289
aVhttp://voteforpolicies.org.uk/
p8290
aV&gt;majority of people choose Green policies\u000a\u000aThat site is not a legitimate poll.
p8291
aVThe people who fill that out do not represent a proportionate cut of the population.
p8292
aVMrs Miggins aged 87 from Penzance is not going to use voteforpolices.org.
p8293
aVMuch like reddit, that site will be used predominately by young people.\u000a
p8294
aVYet it still gets spammed daily on UK subreddits.
p8295
aVI'm not especially young and neither are my friends.
p8296
aVInteresting argument though - most UKIP voters are old and computer illiterate. 
p8297
aVNo my argument is that for any opinion poll to be credible it has to account for all demographics.
p8298
aVThat site doesn't and you know it.
p8299
aVIt's not just computer literacy.
p8300
aVPeople over the age of 35 generally have entrenched political opinions that aren't subject to yearly changes.
p8301
aVA 40 year old generally knows who he or she will vote for, and won't need an internet test to confirm it.
p8302
aVGreens/LDs can also promise the moon on a stick in their manifesto, which is what the VfP test is based on (2010 version), not necessarily what is achievable or realistic.
p8303
aVYou could start a political party promising free cute Russian girlfriends for everyone and gain some internet popularity from it.

aVI note that you, Pallas_ and ProfessorZOOM all seem to be friends.
p8309
aVYou use 'fuck' and 'bollocks' when speaking to him, he calmly replies to you, not swearing.

p8316
aVAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
p8317
aVI think you are proving the original posters point.
p8318
aVyou wouldn't go to /r/athiem expecting a balanced rational debate between an athiest and a christain.
p8319
aVWhy would you come here expecting a balanced rational debate between anyone? 
p8320
aVThe sub isn't called /r/UKIP, it's /r/UKpolitics, so it's reasonable to expect some degree of debate and balance of opinion, though that obviously doesn't happen.

aVI'm sure there are subs for that.

aVStrawman arguments are also another problem with this subreddit and arguments I see you constantly make.
p8346
aVBollocks, the pathetic meme that people are constantly smearing UKIP is utter tripe.

p8348
aVGive me a break...
p8349
aV&gt; Especially when it comes from people who have "a vote for labour is a vote for child rape" as their mantra.
p8350
aVWell, they wouldn't be wrong, given Labours track record.
p8351
aVHow about "A vote for UKIP is a vote for racists" then with UKIP's track record?
p8352
aVIt's just as asinine as the labour mantra. 
p8353
aVI wouldn't disagree. 
p8354
aV"We have the bravery to bring back slavery"
p8355
aVI think Casetteboy is acting In a reckless and provocative manner, we need to put aside the rhetoric and get around the negotiating table.

p8362
aV"\u000a\u000aOuch
p8363
aV&gt; But a new EU law coming into effect on Wednesday 1 October, will mean the makers of the satirical videos can only be sued if their version of a work conveys a discriminatory message, or competes with the original, BBC News reported.

p8372
aVI wonder how he makes these, very good.
p8373
aVHe probably makes a transcript first and then edits it all together. 
p8374
aVYeah, I think you'd write out the scripts of a few clips, try and out a few words together and let it write itself.
p8375
aVThe rap takes on an extra degree of complexity though
p8376
aVcassetteboy is immense.
p8377
aVI love his stuff.
p8378
aVSurprised there aren't more people in this sub saying that this video represents the real  conservative message and it's all a conspiracy to make the poor poorer and sell the NHS.

p8385
aVHopefully this will go viral and, although it's a parody, it will be able to inform people about the Conservatives.
p8386
aVAre.... you actually serious!
p8387
aV?
aVYou don't want people to be told how it really is?
p8388
aVI feel like a parody video which literally stitches together sentences people would never say is a pretty poor way of "how it really is"\u000a\u000aI mean I'm the furthest from a Conservative you're gonna get but this could just as easily been a video about how the Greens can't wait for fracking or that UKIP thinks there are too many white Brits in the country.
p8389
aVYes, but Cameron is a notorious supporter of ATOS work scheme's forcing cancer stricken people to work for like £2 an hour for their benefits, banker's bonuses, NHS privatization and just a general disregard for the poor.
p8390
aVHe hasn't addressed the massive issue of income inequality in this country so all these jokes can be made with factual foundations.
p8391
aVThe Greens have never supported fracking, neither have UKIP supported mass immigration.
p8392
aVThing is, I completely agree with your points.
p8393
aVBut there are much better ways of conveying that information than a video which could have been made to say just about anything.
p8394
aVI see where you're coming from, but personally I think it's good.
p8395
aVIt will go viral and draw attention to some serious flaws of the Tory party.
p8396
aVYou're embarrassing yourself.
p8397
aVGood argument.
p8398
aVCan't expect much more from a Tory supporter to be honest.
p8399
aV&gt; this could just as easily been a video about how the Greens can't wait for fracking or that UKIP thinks there are too many white Brits in the country.
p8400
aVHow do I get somebody to make these?
p8401
aVGive them a recording of speeches from members of either party, piece em together and give it a beat.
p8402
aV"We believe that fracking" - "is the most important thing" - "and furthermore" - "we should condemn" - "the planet" are all sentences I'm sure you'd hear at a Green Party meeting.

aVAre there videos of whoever the current Green leader is doing speeches?
p8404
aVIt would be even more funny if it wasn't too true.
p8405

aVAs funny as I found this, I consider this as taking away from a legitmate debate, when we take something to the logical extreme of ideology.
p8410
aVAs much as I hate the Tories, I don't think this is how they should be engaged. 
p8411
aVIt's a joke.
p8412
aVIf it makes you feel better here is new labour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-YyWwJSvc
p8413
aVAs someone who supports the conservative party, that was hilarious although there were only a few true lines: \u000a\u000a"I'm hard core\u000a\u000aand I know the score\u000a\u000awe are the party\u000a\u000aof the motherfuckers\u000a\u000awe don't care\u000a\u000aabout them mother suckers"
p8414
aV&gt;about them other suckers\u000a\u000aFTFY
p8415
aVFixed what?
p8416
aVwe shpuld just let the tories run things why bother with the other parties \u000a
p8417
aV[deleted]
p8418
aVNot sure I've ever heard an original joke.
p8419
aVMaybe some of Stuart Lee's work is original in a sense but his best stuff just cross-feeds from Samuel Beckett.
p8420
aVHumourless fucking lout you are.
p8421
aVThing is if he publicly went to a cheese seller and said this it would make him more normal.
p8422
aVHe only succeeded in *Bree*ding contempt for his party.
p8423
aVThis shouldn't go un*feta*-d
p8424
aVI see what you did there.
p8425
aVMeh, I made it too obvious. 
p8426
aVhttp://awkwardedmilibandmoments.tumblr.com/
p8427
aVIronically that tumblr made me see Miliband as less awkward because most of the pictures aren't that awkward.
p8428
aVThey just have really funny captions 
p8429
aVI agree, but I think the captions are really weak for a tumblr blog.
p8430
aVWhen people moan at how much of a geek Miliband is, they forget the possible reason the Labour party went uncharismatic for their leader (and arguably why charisma is a trait we, as a country, should avoid in prospective leaders in future at all costs) - after all, the last charismatic person we elected turned out to be a lying, two-faced, war-mongering, self-serving, religious nutjob who cost the country far more than money.
p8431
aVI'd happily vote for a geek, I'd love a geek in office and I think it would do wonders.
p8432
aVBut is Milliband the right geek?
p8433
aVIs he actually a geek?
p8434
aVPhotos of him holding a banana funny should be something he should be able to embrace and make fun of (it was a fantastic photo), although ultimately photos don't matter.
p8435
aVIt's things like him [getting stuck in a loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTggc0uBA8) regurgitating (particularly crappy) talking points.
p8436
aVOr down right not being able to make a solid argument that make me not think he's a geek, but awkward and a bit incompetent.
p8437
aVDo I think he could actually enact and push through his policies (of which I like the concepts, but think the chosen execution plans are horrible)?
p8438
aVNot really.
p8439
aVThe banana photo was David Miliband (one 'l').
p8440
aVThe Dave Miliband
p8441
aVAslate hit the nail on the head with Ed
p8442
aVAgreed.
p8443
aVNot that I agree with Boris Johnson's policies but he's infamous for being a different kind of personality in politics compared to the others.
p8444
aVThe major reason he's successful is because he cultivates those differences.
p8445
aVMiliband just sort of potters around, going through the motions and ticking off his interactions with the public from his checklist.
p8446
aVA "geek" that actually owned their personality would probably get my vote, but Miliband does nothing.
p8447
aVWhat do you mean when you say 'geek'?
p8448
aVSociety has tells us people who are a bit obsessive about things are charismatic and adorable ala the big bang theory.
p8449
aVIf you want the truth, he's a pretty boring bloke that's obsessed with politics.
p8450
aVEd in his element would be long, contemplative discussions about the future of social democratic politics.
p8451
aVNot something that can wow the celebrity obsessed public, eh?
p8452
aVAs for him not being able to pass legislation, I beg you to look at his record in government; he went 4 days without sleep in order to secure the Copenhagen deal with countries like China and pushed the climate change act, signing us up to cut emissions by 80%.
p8453
aVThat's pretty fucking incredible considering the fact that government is generally allergic to long-term thinking. 
p8454
aV...which is all utterly irrelevant because he's not cultivating that persona.
p8455
aVPerception is everything, and Ed's perception is "oh yeah, that guy exists.
p8456
aVWhat does he *do*, exactly?
p8457
aV"
aVThat's because he wants his campaign to be about policies instead of personalities.
p8458
aVEnergy price freeze, banking break up, restoring wage/wealth link, regional development and localism, rent control and housebuilding.
p8459
aVThis is the bread and butter of miliband's 21st century socialism.
p8460
aVAnd it will get him nowhere because the game of politics does not conform to his will.
p8461
aVThe "Game of Politics" is exactly what you, the electorate want it to be.
p8462
aVWould you rather we choose our leaders based on superficial traits or ideology and policy?
p8463
aVWelcome to the real world, where the electorate doesn't as a group make the perfect decision.
p8464
aV...and before that...\u000a
p8465
aVJohn Major wasn't exactly charismatic.
p8466
aVA sex machine, obviously.
p8467
aVBut not charismatic.
p8468
aVI was thinking further back than that.
p8469
aVWhen?
p8470
aVI don't think there was ever a time that John Major wasn't a sex machine.
p8471
aVHe had more charisma than Kinnock, though, and his tenure was just when they started allowing cameras in the Commons, so personality politics wasn't as strong.
p8472
aVOh great thanks I really wanted to see my breakfast again ;)
p8473
aV[deleted]
p8474
aVIt's not as simple as "oh I like him".
p8475
aVIt's about your belief in that person to get shit done.
p8476
aVAngela Merkel is not exactly Mrs Flash Git like Blair was Mr Flash Git, but she has a forceful personality.
p8477
aVShe is able to communicate her vision, then go and get that done.
p8478
aVShe is capable of sitting across the table from any world leader from Putin to Obama, and really grab what's best for Germany and it's people.
p8479
aVMilliband is giving me the vibe that he is weak, and could easily be pushed around.
p8480
aVHe shows not an ounce of leadership.
p8481
aVThe idea that he could sit down with Putin on our behalf sends a shiver down my spine.
p8482
aVI don't think it says anything negative about people that they don't want to vote for someone who is a life long loser.
p8483
aVWhy would we want a born loser representing us and our country?
p8484
aVEd belongs in the back office. 
p8485
aVIdk, he seemed to be pretty instrumental in not getting tangled in the mess that is Syria.
p8486
aVI mean, what are your choices?
p8487
aVHumanoid David Cameron?
p8488
aVNick Clegg who might as well be invisible?
p8489
aVAwkward Ed?
p8490
aVDoes it really matter?
p8491
aVSurely we want more from our politicians than mere charisma. 
p8492
aVI like the way religion was thrown in there despite the fact that he never did anything for religion while in office.
p8493
aVIn fact he was famous for not touching religion or any policies connected to it.
p8494
aVTony Blair set up faith schools.
p8495
aVI'd say that's pretty related to religion.
p8496
aV&gt; Tony Blair set up faith schools\u000a\u000aWhich is why I began attending a Church of England Primary school in the 80s, roughly ten years before Tony Blair became PM.\u000a
p8497
aVCoE schools have always been about because CoE is our national church but then he set up more faith schools and extended them to other religions (mosty Islam).
p8498
aVI don't have a problem with Islam.
p8499
aVI have a problem with religious schools because I believe in a secular education system similar to what France have.
p8500
aVI agree.
p8501
aVAn education that isn't peer reviewed and crafted by experts is just daft.
p8502
aVVoltaire's Pangloss has no place in our society.
p8503
aVHowever if you're going to have CoE schools it would be discriminatory to other religions to not allow them to set up schools as well.
p8504
aVI see nothing wrong with having religious schools provided they are held to the same rigor and standards of secular education.
p8505
aVI will say though, having lived in France for three years as an adult and being married to a French woman, that their relationship with religion is not as utopic as appears on the surface.
p8506
aVFrance's culture is very normative to the point that breaking those norms is infinitely more arduous than here.
p8507
aVMost UMP voters in France would vote UKIP, even if they don't like the reputation of the FN.
p8508
aVThey're all pretty racist and sexist.
p8509
aVI never realized just how tolerant and open British society was/is until I lived abroad.
p8510
aV'Happy hour' (as pigs call it) on the Tube aint got shit on Paris' Metro.
p8511
aVDoesn't mean you ought to avoid it at all costs. 
p8512
aVIt's true.
p8513
aVHe shouldn't be marketed as the "normal bloke".
p8514
aVI don't want a normal bloke in the running for PM.
p8515
aVPlay him off as a geek, someone passionate about ideology, or whatever.
p8516
aVNot normal - he isn't. 
p8517
aVI don't know why people seem to think ideology is a good thing in politicians.
p8518
aVThe very nature of ideology means that those with a particularly strong sense of them tend to make terrible decision makers, because they're unable to think critically or respond well to new information.
p8519
aVIt's really easy to see how true that is, look at anyone from places like the BNP, /r/shitredditsays or those guys selling Socialist Worker newspapers.
p8520
aVThey aren't the people you want running the country.
p8521
aVWell it depends on if the ideology is sensible or not.
p8522
aVBNP's 'ideology' (which to call an ideology is an insult to the word) is bollocks.
p8523
aVLook at Thatcher, a true conviction politician with a firm ideology, being PM wasn't a game to her.
p8524
aVNo major politician today seems to have any real passion or conviction, they seem to want the job for te job itself, not because they have a firm belief that they can improve Britain.
p8525
aVImage and publicity stunts seem to be more important nowadays than actual manifestos.
p8526
aVedit: And for the anti-Thatcherites, look at Atlee, another conviction politician, offering a third way between free market capitalism and pure socialism, stuck to welfare and defence budgets during a time of great austerity.
p8527
aVFar more concerned about improving britain and sticking to his guns than trying to appear nice and lovable for the camera.
p8528
aVTwo things about Thatcher.
p8529
aVShe never really cut government spending, she possibly changed priorities to some extent and slowed down the growth of expenditure, but it still rose every year that she was in office.
p8530
aVOn top of that she didn't really succeed in creating the Britain she wanted to see.
p8531
aVShe thought that reducing people's reliance on government and making it less involved would make everyone wealthier.
p8532
aVShe also thought people would return to a more reserved Victorian style sensibility and we would become a nation of shopkeepers.
p8533
aVInstead she had massive unemployment and stagnating median incomes (which still haven't risen much) while a small minority became arrogantly, ostentatiously wealthy.
p8534
aVAt the same time independent businesses have hardly thrived, constantly losing ground to big chains and multinationals.
p8535
aVIt's hard to see how her being a ideologue really helped.
p8536
aVAll it really did was prove that her ideology was wrong, in that those policy programmes don't create the outcome she expected.
p8537
aVAlso I don't understand how the BNP's ideology could not be an ideology.
p8538
aVIt's pretty much the dictionary definition.
p8539
aVThey have an frame of reference that completely effects their thought process.
p8540
aVThey are far and away the most ideological party to have won office in Britain in recent years.
p8541
aVTo say that isn't an ideology, because you don't like what they say is a failure to really understand what ideology and is a no true Scotsman argument.
p8542
aVYou're right about the BNP having an ideology, I concede to that.
p8543
aVThatcher's government certainly saw a growth in spending, mainly because of her need to pay higher unemployment benefits.
p8544
aVIt also saw a growth in bureaucracy which was contrary to her ideology.
p8545
aVHowever you have to look at the historical context to see that Thatcher effectively ended the 20 odd years of stagflation that consensus politics and the priority on maximum employment had failed to end.
p8546
aVHer shift to curbing inflation first had it's desired effect and her period saw a growth in GDP and of small businesses.
p8547
aVShe ended the union's preponderance over the gov't and their stifling of productivity, inertia to modernisation and constant demand for wage rises which were only furthering the rampant inflation.
p8548
aVThatcher's conviction put an end to all that where Heath had committed his infamous u-turn and labour struggled with its internal identity crisis.
p8549
aVJust because she never fully got her desired results doesn't mean we should just give up on ideology, it becomes a question of the balance between pragmatism and ideology and Thatcher was definitely a pragmatist when it came to expenditure.
p8550
aVShe recognised the growth in unemployment as failing industries that were draining subsidies were closed, and whilst Britain went through a shift in unemployment from industry to service, and responded accordingly by sticking to unemployment welfare.
p8551
aVThere is no ideology that is 'right', different ideas work in different circumstances and when they no longer seem to work, the electorate plays its part in ending the application of that ideology.
p8552
aVHer being an ideologue definitely helped in taking Britain out of its stagflation rut where other politicians would pander to quick fire answers that only served to extend their own time in office.
p8553
aVI don't want my politicians to try to convince me that they're a cool funny guy with a good image, changing their stance when talking to different groups of people.
p8554
aVI want my politician to truly believe in something, and to sell that something to me rather than themselves and their cult of personality image.
p8555
aVLet the electorate decide which ideology they want don't try to fool them into liking you as a celeb.
p8556
aVI have respect for the likes of Bevan, Disraeli, Atlee and Thatcher because they weren't just career politicians trying to get the top job, they had a vision and let the electorate decide whether their vision was worth something.
p8557
aVYou speak as if the only options are an out and out ideologues or cardboard cut out personalities.
p8558
aVNot people who are actually capable of weighing up all the options before they come up with a policy.
p8559
aVThatcher changed a system which was failing, but she left us with one which ultimately collapsed and left us back in the shit again.
p8560
aVShe left us with a paradigm where we have a banking sector that's so powerful no politician on either side will dare stand up to it.
p8561
aVMeanwhile median incomes are stagnant and our country's entire economy is based in the bottom south east corner.
p8562
aVI think there's a lot of truth in this - particularly around what Thatcher did and didn't manage to achieve.
p8563
aVI would dispute she was ideologue though.
p8564
aVI think her electoral talent was to convince voters that she did have an ideological vision and that the changes in 80s Britain were caused by her policies and statecraft when in reality rising and increasingly volitile globalisation was much more significant.
p8565
aVIn practice (and often secret) she was quite pragmatic - she didn't slash public spending, she negotiated with terrorists (sensibly), opposed the reunification of Germany in the interests of the UK and implemented almost no socially conservative legislation.
p8566
aVYes, I'd agree, but it's better to fairly show your party leader as being ideological, than to disguise them as someone who regularly goes to greggs\u000a
p8567
aVIndeed, the last thing this country needs is a PM who is passionate about ideology.
p8568
aVWe need a PM who is pragmatic and that has a strong sense of "if it's stupid and it works, it's not stupid".
p8569
aVpragmatism - expedience\u000a\u000aterrorist - freedom fighter
p8570
aVAbsolutely
p8571
aVHow fucking cringeworthy can you lot get?
p8572
aVHe's a politician, not Leonard from the Big Bang Theory.
p8573
aVThis geek shit that was in the news over the weekend is seriously insulting young voters, there's Farage who tries to appeal to the beer swilling, fag smoking every-man, and he gets the shit ripped out of him for it, now, the same people who have a dig at Farage are keen to have the leader of the opposition turned in to a geek celebrity to appeal to the young and left.
p8574
aVAny young person isn't going to be taken in by this.
p8575
aVYou are right though, he isn't normal.
p8576
aVI'm not saying he *should* be marketed like that, just that it's closer to the truth than how he is now.
p8577
aVWhich geek stuff in the news were you referring to?
p8578
aVI seriously hope people wouldn't be taken in by leaders at all.
p8579
aVYeh but it would be so randum xD.
p8580
aVLeft wing people are smart so geeks would be awesome for us XD
p8581
aVYour comment made my eye twitch a little.
p8582
aV&gt;He's a politician, not Leonard from the Big Bang Theory.
p8583
aV**Mili(re)brand** for the General Election, probably?
p8584
aV!
aV&gt;and he gets the shit ripped out of him for it\u000a\u000aNo, butthurt lefties on reddit try to.
p8585
aVNobody else cares.
p8586
aVWell to be fair it is all an act, he went to a public school that is part of the Eton Group, ffs.
p8587
aVTIL going to public school means you can't drink or smoke.
p8588
aVYou've read the Guardian or Independent this week, haven't you!?
p8589
aVI saw that headline but didn't read the article.
p8590
aVSo I don't think your opinion is your opinion at all, it's something you've read and latched onto.
p8591
aVI have, but it wasn't a "normal" op-ed; Victoria Coren tweeted a link to her column and it was a sarcastic piece about all of Labours great ideas for marketing Ed.
p8592
aVStuff sending him out to pubs and getting him to do weekly shops.
p8593
aVMy opinion on this has been the same since even before he was elected leader; I thought the same while he was running.
p8594
aVDavid was the clever one, and Ed was supposed to be "In touch" with the party core voters.
p8595
aVBut he isn't.
p8596
aVWhat are you talking about?
p8597
aVHe is just your average neighborhood Eton educated chap.
p8598
aVPubs are full of 'em where I'm from.
p8599
aV(/s)
p8600
aVHe didn't go to Eton though, just an everyday comp.
p8601
aVThe fact that everyone just assumes he went to Eton illustrates the problem he faces.
p8602
aVAnd it's truly ironic given that Farage attended Dulwich College...
p8603
aVWhat problem?
p8604
aVSticking to the subject of idiologies - Farage probably knows that he is never going to win over the type of voter over that is prepared to (basically) lie to themselves and overs on a regular basis about him and UKIP.
p8605
aVIronically these people are what we call ideologues... 
p8606
aVWho lies about UKIP?
p8607
aVThe UKIP councillors who tweet about gay people causing floods?
p8608
aVHow can a party possibly be suitable for government when it contains people who think that the best response to severe flood warnings would be to round up the gays?
p8609
aVHow about the fact that Farage is one of the the most abusive and wasteful MEPs, representing some of the worst value for money in Parliament?
p8610
aVThe idea that UKIP get lied about in the media is a typical victim complex.
p8611
aVThey're terrible but people who support them don't really care how terrible they are because it's not about facts.
p8612
aVErgo, to them anything bad about UKIP is a lie.
p8613
aVThe conclusion is reached first. 
p8614
aVzzzz..
p8615
aVYet again bring up individuals (that have on vast majority cases been fired or at the very least warned to change their ways) as if they represent the party.
p8616
aVAll the while I might add ignoring the numerous cases in other parties that are being recorded just as frequently.
p8617
aVTHAT is your deceit and we're not falling for it. 
p8618
aV&gt; THAT is your deceit and we're not falling for it.
p8619
aVYou're right.
p8620
aVI am perpetuating an intentional deceit that UKIP are a bad party even though really I think they are the best one.
p8621
aVThe sun shines out of Nigel Farage's arse but everyone who doesn't support him is jealous of his googly frog eyes and so we invent slights against UKIP and cover up all wrongdoing by every other party so that the hard working, hard drinking, hard smoking plumber down the pub who reckons there's too many brown people and funny looking Polaks when he goes down the town centre can have the opportunity to tell us that we are engaged in a left wing secret conspiracy against the only politician who's 'got it right'.
p8622
aVYou sound ridiculous.
p8623
aVIt's not a deceit.
p8624
aVMost people in the UK genuinely do not believe that UKIP are a good party.
p8625
aV&gt; You're right.
p8626
aVI am perpetuating an intentional deceit that UKIP are a bad party even though really I think they are the best one.
p8627
aVThe sun shines out of Nigel Farage's arse but everyone who doesn't support him is jealous of his googly frog eyes and so we invent slights against UKIP and cover up all wrongdoing by every other party so that the hard working, hard drinking, hard smoking plumber down the pub who reckons there's too many brown people and funny looking Polaks when he goes down the town centre can have the opportunity to tell us that we are engaged in a left wing secret conspiracy against the only politician who's 'got it right'.
p8628
aVThis one we call a strawman argument.
p8629
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man\u000a\u000a&gt; You sound ridiculous.
p8630
aVIt's not a deceit.
p8631
aVI might sound ridiculous.
p8632
aVThat does not make me wrong.
p8633
aVThis one we call an argument ad ridiculum.
p8634
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ridicule\u000a\u000a&gt; Most people in the UK genuinely do not believe that UKIP are a good party.
p8635
aVThis one we call an argument ad populism.
p8636
aVIt's a strange position to try and take given that UKIP are surging in the poles!?!?!!!
p8637
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBasically.
p8638
aVYour logic is flawed, your deceit is easy to detect and your argument is invalid.\u000a
p8639
aVI'm not going to carry on arguing with you because I think you're a GCSE student after that list of 'le logical fallacies'.
p8640
aVI don't think you understand them.
p8641
aVYour point was that I and those that do not support UKIP are deliberately deceitful.
p8642
aVThe inference can be made that you believe the object of this deceit to be UKIP supporters, because you claim that UKIP supporters a not 'falling for it'.
p8643
aVThat is not a straw man representation of your views, according to your original post.
p8644
aVI gave the first paragraph example because it demonstrates how ridiculous it would be if that was the case.
p8645
aVDemonstrating that a belief is ridiculous is not an 'appeal to ridicule'.
p8646
aVA demonstration that the logical outcome of a belief is ridiculous is a strong argument.
p8647
aVThe logic is as follows: \u000a\u000a1) People and media against UKIP are deceitful.
p8648
aV2) Therefore they do not believe the things they say, but rather must believe a different thing.
p8649
aV3) If the view of people who oppose UKIP are different to what they claim, they must not believe UKIP is bad for Britain.
p8650
aV4) If they do not believe UKIP is bad for Britain, they believe it is good or neutral for Britain.
p8651
aV5) Therefore, people who oppose UKIP invent lies and attempt to deceive UKIP supporters even though they believe UKIP would be good or neutral for Britain.
p8652
aVThe final conclusion is ridiculous, and my final point that most people do not support UKIP.
p8653
aVWe know this because only ~30% of a ~30% turnout voted for them in the EU election.
p8654
aVOnly ~10% of the country therefore voted for UKIP.
p8655
aVFarage himself has said that UKIP probably had the highest turnout of supporters.
p8656
aVTherefore, even if only half of UKIP supporters voted, only 20% of the country supports UKIP.
p8657
aVIf ~80% of people do not support UKIP, then by the conclusion (5) above there must be an enormous proportion of the country who secretly believe UKIP would be good or neutral for the country but engage in active deceit of others.
p8658
aVThis makes no sense.
p8659
aVUKIP like to portray themselves as fighting for a silent majority, but it is totally bullshit.
p8660
aVIf the majority of people supported UKIP, they would vote for them at the EU elections.
p8661
aVFinally, as an aside, I have found that practically anyone who supports UKIP does not understand the EU.
p8662
aVIf you advocate leaving an organisation that is so important, shaking up our entire economy and political structure, then you should understand the Treaty of Lisbon, the seven institutions, the *Factortame* decision, the differing legal effect of directives and regulations, Schengen (and why we aren't in it), and the legislating process.
p8663
aVIf you don't have even a clue of how those things work then literally all you have to base an opinion of the EU on is whether a foreigner stole your job or if there are too many Polish people in town.
p8664
aVWithout understanding, you can't validly make arguments that are not hopelessly informed.
p8665
aVAnd if an unskilled foreigner who doesn't speak English did steal your job then you should take a long hard look at yourself.
p8666
aVI must admit I stopped reading after the first ad hominem attempt and then the further twisting of what I clearly said.
p8667
aVI called you out.
p8668
aVYou don't like it which is why you are now becoming enraged.
p8669
aVIf you take one thing from this "GCSE student" of 31 years of age let it be this: You are the reason that the UKIP vote will become entrenched.
p8670
aVThe floating voter will look at our actions and at your actions (that of a spoiled liberal, stamping his feet and casting inaccurate assertions and shaming language at those who don't agree with him) and say, "to hell with him.
p8671
aVAt least the UKIP voters are honest".\u000a\u000a
p8672
aVI think you're living in a fantasy land.
p8673
aVYour response shows that you have no response to my points, demonstrating nicely how UKIP supporters have no actual knowledge of the matter, just a sneering contempt for anyone more educated or left wing than them. 
p8674
aV&gt; just a sneering contempt for anyone more educated or left wing than them.
p8675
aVIrony at it's very finest!
p8676
aVHave a nice day my intellectual superior.
p8677
aVYou can 'market him' all you like, he doesn't look like a PM.
p8678
aVCan you imagine him shaking hands with Obama on the Whitehouse lawn?
p8679
aV*shudder*
p8680
aVWhat the hell does it matter what he looks like?
p8681
aVChrist on a bike.
p8682
aVGrow up. 
p8683
aVI'd argue it's not what he looks like that matters (although like it or not, that plays into many people's opinion of him) but rather how he presents himself.
p8684
aVHe's not a statesman.
p8685
aVHe doesn't speak with conviction or confidence.
p8686
aVHe has a lisp and speaks so nasally that it's annoying (which again, shouldn't come into it, but it does).
p8687
aVI, and many others, just shudder at the thought of the man trying to hash out a deal with the likes of Obama or Putin.
p8688
aVThey'd tear him apart - he's simply not made of the material a highly publicised and constantly watched leader needs.
p8689
aVYou have an extremely cartoonish idea of how government actually works. 
p8690
aVThat Butcher is looking like he's about ready to kill Ed...
p8691
aVI don't really get why people don't like Miliband.
p8692
aVI think his slight awkwardness is endearing.
p8693
aVHe seems like the most reliable of the top three to me.
p8694
aVMilliband is really annoying me.
p8695
aVI used to be fully Labour, but now I don't know where I stand
p8696
aVIt always amazes me when people say they can't support a Party because of its leader.
p8697
aVAny party is a spiral of ideology featuring the input of thousands of people all vying for a common cause.
p8698
aV"Moyes is really annoying me.
p8699
aVI used to be fully Man Utd but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000a"The Pope is really annoying me.
p8700
aVI used to be fully Christian but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000a"The Queen is really annoying me.
p8701
aVI used to be fully British but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000aIf you really think you can let one man change your political beliefs; then maybe you should examine why you are voting in the first place.
p8702
aVTell labour what you think, throw an egg, spam him on twitter; whatever you want.
p8703
aVBut voting should be about your core beliefs &amp; aligning them with the party that suits them best.
p8704
aVIf awkward public appearances from a middle-aged man are enough to change that; then you need to look at yourself, not Miliband's  cringe-worthy TV shenanigans. 
p8705
aVLeaders can change parties to a great extent.
p8706
aVLook at the nature of Labour shifting from Foot to Kinnock to Blair's New Labour then to Brown's halfsided New Labour to Miliband's One Nation Labour.
p8707
aVThe nature of Parties is not as consistent as you may think.
p8708
aVLeaders didn't change Labour.
p8709
aVLabour elected leaders that represented change from within.
p8710
aVFoot-&gt;Kinnock-&gt;Smith-&gt;Blair was part of a long process of moving towards the centre for Labour.
p8711
aVLeaders aren't passive forces that are brought to the top by other people, leader's are the active force of change that create a momentum of people and support, thus pushing themselves to the top.
p8712
aVSo effectively leaders did change Labour, or at the very least, are a major factor in the change of a party official position.
p8713
aVMeh the whole "great men" v "social trend" argument gets done to death.
p8714
aVIt is a bit of both.
p8715
aVBlair wasn't selected out of the blue.
p8716
aVHe was selected as the final plank of a long running process.
p8717
aVYes he also helped accelerate that process.
p8718
aV&gt; "The Pope is really annoying me.
p8719
aVI used to be fully Christian but now I don't know where I stand"\u000a\u000aIn the Catholic church, what the Pope says goes, so in that example it would be perfectly reasonable to doubt the whole faith if you don't like its leader.
p8720
aVWell to be honest labour do seem to be changing for the worst, at least to me they do, and I don't know if it's due to Ed or if he's just the scapegoat.
p8721
aVNot like the good old days of Tony or Gordon, eh?
p8722
aVThat blokes nasally voice has really made me question where Labour are heading.  
p8723
aVThe way I see it, they did great with Tony, Gordon was alright and by then they were too confident with their seat, then they lost to the tories and realised that they desperately needed to sort their shit out
p8724
aVWhat incisive analysis.
p8725
aVYou should go for Paxmans old job.
p8726
aVWhy do you think they are changing for the worst?
p8727
aVIf anything I think they are changing for the better, just not fast enough for my liking.
p8728
aVWell they've had the unions ripped out of the policy making thanks to Ed, which is a good start.
p8729
aVI don't think they're changing for the worse, at most going stale.
p8730
aVThey've lost their PR punch since the end of the Blair era, and when I see Ed Balls I'm forced to immediately projectile vomit.
p8731
aV&gt; Well they've had the ~~unions~~policy ripped out of the policy making thanks to Ed\u000a\u000aFixed.
p8732
aVI agree but leaders are usually the ones that dictate media representation,  which can be really irritating. 
p8733
aVNot really you need an effective leader that it tough and can be a global statesman representing our interests abroad, neither of which are traits of Miliband.
p8734
aVGiven that they're [changing their stance on immigration](https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/471305578740846593) based on a bad round of voting, neither do they.
p8735
aVIf I were to vote today it would be for labour.
p8736
aVHe's stood up to powerful people and that's what I want in a leader. 
p8737
aVYou also need leaders who choose their battles well.
p8738
aVAre the unions really the thing that's currently holding Britain back?
p8739
aVDid they cause the financial crisis?
p8740
aVWill they cause the next one?
p8741
aVA leader can only fight so many battles, and if he chooses the wrong enemies, he will weaken himself too much to fight the fights that really matter.
p8742
aVIt appears to me that Milliband is more a man of passion than of intellect.
p8743
aVThat's dangerous.
p8744
aVHe's the sort of man who could easily drag us into an unnecessary war.
p8745
aVThat's funny because he's already dragged us out of one. 
p8746
aVPossibly true.
p8747
aVAlthough many other voices were also pointing out how stupid it was to get dragged into Syria.
p8748
aVAny war in Syria would have been unpopular with the general public.
p8749
aVHowever I don't see that as indicative of how he would behave as a PM.
p8750
aVSaying no to one war whilst in opposition, offers little guarantees as to how he'd likely to respond to completely different circumstances as a PM.
p8751
aVBasically we need someone who can think things through carefully, and see through propaganda from both our enemies, and our allies.
p8752
aVI'm not convinced that Milliband fits the bill.
p8753
aVI'm no fan of Miliband either, in fact he appears fairly ineffective at lots of things even if you allow for the fact we don't necessarily want another leader with Blair-style charisma.
p8754
aVHowever I had a horrific moment of realisation the other day when someone on TV (probably Nick R) pointed out to me that it's overwhelmingly likely the next PM will be Cameron or Miliband.
p8755
aVEspecially now it looks like Labour don't have the time or inclination for a leadership battle.
p8756
aVBut I think I'd rather Ed be in charge, and pushed hither and thither by public and party opinion, than five more years of Cameron cutting every benefit he can get his grubby hands on.
p8757
aVIMHO the current Tory engineered housing bubble will collapse 1-2 years into the lifespan of the next government.
p8758
aVCould be sooner depending on international events.
p8759
aVIf the government is weak - e.g.
p8760
aVa minority government, or a government with a very small majority, then this will cause it to fall apart and we'd get another general election.
p8761
aVSo that would make the next election of little relevance.
p8762
aVSo the only scenario that really matters for voting is how each of the parties would react if they have a substantial majority, or lead a stable coalition.
p8763
aVFor the Tories the result would be fairly predictable.
p8764
aVMore cuts.
p8765
aVHowever what about Labour?
p8766
aVHow would Milliband react to declining tax revenues and a drastically worsening deficit?
p8767
aVI find his reaction to be much harder to forecast.
p8768
aVIf he tried bringing spending under control, he'd lose control of his own party.
p8769
aVIf he kept spending and building up more debts, he'd risk losing control of the economy.
p8770
aVI've got no idea how that would play out, but there is a lot of potential for nastiness there.
p8771
aVPersonally I'm done with the major parties, and I'm likely to vote Green in the next GE.
p8772
aVNo way they will win, and but at least I will get to smugly say "I tried..." when our children ask us what happened to their planet.
p8773
aVVery interesting point; there are few in Labour who seem to have the economic credentials to weather a storm like that.
p8774
aVI guess the best we could hope for is that if it were them in charge, and the bubble did burst, they were able to manage it in such a way that reduced prices are actually felt substantively by the working and middle classes.
p8775
aVBut I think the bubble is unlikely to 'pop' any *more* than it did in 2008-09, which wasn't actually that much in the end.
p8776
aV&gt; which wasn't actually that much in the end\u000a\u000aActually it was quite substantial.
p8777
aVThe economy still hasn't fully recovered yet.
p8778
aVThe problem with any second collapse is that it would be cumulative.
p8779
aVWe would enter it with much higher debt levels and much less fat that can be easily trimmed from the government budget.
p8780
aVSo even if in absolute terms the decline in the economy is smaller, we'll be in a much worse state to cope with it.
p8781
aVits easy to stand up to people when you are not in power and nobody cares what you do.
p8782
aVNo it isn't easy at all.
p8783
aVTo have the Murdoch press and the Daily Mail against you and your family must be very difficult.
p8784
aVIt's true that he went out of his way to defend his father against slander, and won that round.
p8785
aVWhich showed some backbone I suppose, although he was clearly in the right to do so and the Mail was clearly in the wrong, surprise surprise. 
p8786
aVIt is easier to stand up to people when you are in a position of power
p8787
aVI think the Syrians cared what he did, one way or another.
p8788
aVI wish someone would hit the nail on Ed's head.
p8789
aVIt looks like he fell over and flattened his nose.
p8790
aVUKIP seem to complain about the negative publicity, but I'd suggest the Greens are getting the raw deal by getting no publicity.
p8791
aVYou can spin bad press, but it's a lot harder to spin no press.
p8792
aVI'd like greens to get more press so that they have to actually answer for their anti science nonsense and then hopefully they'll reform their ideas so that I, and others put off by this, would vote for them.
p8793
aVAnti Science?
p8794
aVTheir views on nuclear and GMO's are more based on other issues, such as how carbon intensive uranium mining is, and how expensive to maintain nuclear plants are (along with the waste issue).
p8795
aVGMO's is mostly their opposition to corporate control of farming and the danger of monocultures failing.
p8796
aVHowever, anti science?
p8797
aVThe Green Party want's to spend 3% of GDP on science (which is about 10x more than we currently spend) and for research money to be split through the Haldane principle.
p8798
aVMost of the people complaining about the Green Party haven't actually done any research into their policies and are just repeating stuff they have read elsewhere.
p8799
aVPretty much 
p8800
aVWell [they still reference studies that they commisioned](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html) to show that nuclear was causing cancer in Wales, even though [the study was shown to be completely made up.
p8801
aV](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/) So that's anti science, as is their senior members telling protester to destroy a GM crop trial despite the scientists asking people to meet with them to discuss their issues, because the issues the Greens were shouting about did not apply to that trial.
p8802
aVFor instance, most GM research is done by universities for non-profit uses like alleviating suffering in the third world.
p8803
aVAnd modern crops are just as monocultured, you can make GM crops as diverse as the modern crop.
p8804
aVAnd nuclear is hardly CO2 intensive, there is a study I've seen green members use a few times (it's used by someone else on a TED debate on nuclear) where the CO2 of nuclear seems really high, but when you look into it, they look at things like the workers getting to work, and the other stuff, but don't look at that for wind, so straight off the source is bogus, but then also, they estimate that nuclear power will cause a nuclear war, and so they count in burning cities into their equations!
p8805
aVBURNING CITIES FROM A NUCLEAR WAR!
p8806
aVIn reality, the mining is no more intensive than the mining of coal, and the mining of coal, is really not the issue with coal.
p8807
aVIf we get off fossil fuels, then we're going to start using electric vehicles anyway, so it will be nuclear powered.
p8808
aVFinally, since wind, the green parties solution to energy but please don't ask tough questions because THE FUTURE WILL FIX IT, can only ever subsidise a main energy source, because we can't store energy, then the Green's suggestion actually involves heavy use of coal/gas (coal then, since they also make up things about fracking to oppose our use of gas).
p8809
aVSaying a nuclear + wind system is more CO2 intensive than a fossil + wind system is just bullshit.
p8810
aVIt's true that they have some things to answer for, but why not give them the benefit of the doubt and lend them your vote?
p8811
aVIf they get more votes, they'll get more publicity at some point where they upset a major party - that might not be far off if they get more EU election votes than the LDs.
p8812
aVThen their pro-immigration, anti-nuclear stances will be brought up, and they'll have to justify them, or change.
p8813
aVRealistically speaking, if they had any major successes, maybe a few more MPs with a hung parliament - at this point likely - they could join Labour (and the remaining Lib Dems) in a coalition.
p8814
aVTheir more misguided policies would not make it into a coalition agreement, or would be watered-down.
p8815
aVSee my reply to other commenter as to why there's a difference between the anti nuke and pro immigration.
p8816
aVShort version is that pro immigration is a policy you can have an opinion about, but in their anti nuke they use lies and outdated stats to convince people to follow their view.
p8817
aVThe first is key to democracy, the secondis actively working against it.
p8818
aVI think it's fine for you and others to act as you suggest, to try and change from the inside, but personally, as a scientist in Ecology and a keen conservationist,  I know that GM and nuclear power are our two best tools to combat climate change and habitat loss and future famines.
p8819
aVSo I won't support a party that uses lies to harm those tools.
p8820
aV&gt;  I know that GM and nuclear power are our two best tools to combat climate change\u000a\u000aOnshore wind provides cheaper energy than nuclear power.
p8821
aVAll that's needed is a government that cares about the environment enough to override the nimby's currently blocking expansion of onshore wind.
p8822
aVI'd suspect that the Green's are the best candidate for that role.
p8823
aVWhilst I personally wouldn't completely rule out nuclear, I'm a long way from being convinced that it's one of our best tools.
p8824
aVI would really recommend reading "sustainable energy without the hot air" by david mckay who is the chief scientific adviser to the DoE.
p8825
aVIt does a superb job of cutting through the crap and attempts to give a scientific and economical account of the pros and cons of almost all technology's available to us in our little island nation.
p8826
aVpage 60-67 deals with both shallow and deep water wind farms.
p8827
aVpages 161-176 deals with nuclear.
p8828
aVI'm not trying to incite an argument with this rather than give those who are interested, a way to become better informed and be able to back up their arguments with facts (the reference list and suggested reading in the book is second to none).
p8829
aVPersonally i am extremely pro-nuclear as a technology, and think that it is an integral part of the future energy generation of this country and, for that matter the world.
p8830
aVHowever, as i say it is only a part, and i would love to see the government actually go through and put a tidal barrage on the seven river.
p8831
aVI find the hardest part of debates over energy future's and technology's to be implemented is that emotive illogical arguments are given time such as the NIMBYesm of the arguments against the seven barrage and anything nuclear.
p8832
aVanyway went off on a bit of a ramble the link for the book is below hope you have a read.
p8833
aVhttp://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/book/tex/sewtha.pdf
p8834
aVThanks for the link.
p8835
aVI would like to read it some time and will bookmark it.
p8836
aVHowever at the moment I have a fair sized pile of books to read, both fact and fiction.
p8837
aVPersonally I prefer offshore wind as a power source.
p8838
aVI know it's not as effective as onshore, but we really do not have enough space onshore for the number of turbines required.
p8839
aVNo shortage of space out to sea though.
p8840
aVI live in east anglia, and can see the turbines of the giant offshore wind farms when I'm working, and I think they're fantastic.
p8841
aVHowever... they don't work if the wind isn't blowing and while it's pretty damn windy over here, there are still times when they stop spinning due to either too much or not enough wind.
p8842
aVI believe we need nuclear for the short term.
p8843
aVIt's pretty safe (really safe if you compare it to coal or gas in terms of human suffering - those poor miners in Turkey) and the biggest problem with it is the disposal of the waste.
p8844
aVOne of my lecturers at university is working on some pretty cool stuff to do with bacteria and radioactive waste disposal.
p8845
aVHopefully in the future we will be able to dispose of the waste much more safely, and faster.
p8846
aVRight now, the problem is keeping the lights on until we have enough turbines and solar panels. 
p8847
aV&gt; we really do not have enough space onshore for the number of turbines required.
p8848
aVWe've got space for many more turbines than we currently have.
p8849
aVWorry about offshore sometime we've forced all those aristocrats with vast private estates in Scotland to cover them with turbines.
p8850
aVWhy would we force the aristocrats to build turbines over their land?
p8851
aVIt's their land, they can do what they want with it.
p8852
aVBesides, you don't seem to have thought that idea through.
p8853
aVThe power has to get to the national grid somehow.
p8854
aVIt requires significant infrastructure in terms of cables, copper and pylons to get the energy from the site of production to the grid.
p8855
aVI'm from Suffolk, and live near (ish) to Sizewell nuclear power station.
p8856
aVAs well as it being windy here, the other reason they picked the East Anglian coast for the location of the turbines is that we already have the power lines in place to get the energy to the grid thanks to Sizewell.
p8857
aVI guess (I'm no expert here)that it's a heck of a long way from the Scottish highlands to the nearest point that could handle the amount of power input that the turbines create.
p8858
aVBesides, its really easy to install the turbines offshore.
p8859
aVThey bang them up really fast, it's surprising. 
p8860
aV&gt; Why would we force the aristocrats to build turbines over their land?
p8861
aVIt's their land, they can do what they want with it.
p8862
aVBecause (a) we need power and (b) I can't give a stuff about their inherited feudal rights which were based on conquest and repression.
p8863
aVWe aren't living in the 16th century anymore, and feudalism should have died a long time ago.
p8864
aVPerhaps a good start might be to tax these landlords properly, and stop them from receiving massive government farm subsidies to support their grouse shooting hobby.
p8865
aVOnce their land becomes uneconomic as their private \u000aplayground for shooting birds, then building wind turbines should follow.
p8866
aV&gt; The power has to get to the national grid somehow.
p8867
aVScotland already has several nuclear power stations, just like East Anglia.
p8868
aVThe SNP has a "no nuclear" strategy and plans to replace those nuclear power stations with renewables.
p8869
aVSo in order to implement the SNP strategy then the infrastructure will need to be in place.
p8870
aVAdding even more renewables should be completely feasible.
p8871
aV&gt; Because (a) we need power and (b) I can't give a stuff about their inherited feudal rights which were based on conquest and repression.
p8872
aVWe aren't living in the 16th century anymore, and feudalism should have died a long time ago.
p8873
aVModern inheritance laws = feudal system.
p8874
aVWell, that's quite a statement to make.
p8875
aVFeudalism did die a long time ago, and aristocratic privilege is nearly gone too, with only a few last dregs left.
p8876
aVLooking at the house of lords here, needs reforming IMO.
p8877
aVWhy should we punish the current members of the aristocratic families, by confiscating their land, for the perceived crimes of their ancestors?
p8878
aVSeems like a rather extremist view to me.
p8879
aVBeing born into a wealthy family is not a crime, nor in any ones' control.
p8880
aVBesides, I'm not too fond of the idea of planting wind turbines all over beautiful Scottish highlands, then setting up chains of pylons to finish the job off of ruining natural beauty.
p8881
aVYou might respond by saying that the beauty is reserved for the aristocrats who own the land, but I'd rather it exist than be wiped out all together.
p8882
aVShould we clear the forests in order to build turbines?
p8883
aVShould we knock down the stately homes of the wealthy, and those owned by the National Trust in order to provide more room for our energy demands?
p8884
aVWhy should we do any of that when we have offshore power as an option?
p8885
aVOne last point.
p8886
aVScotland is having a referendum on independence.
p8887
aVWhat happens if we legislate for the change you suggest and then they go independent?
p8888
aVPerhaps we should look into energy production south of the border.
p8889
aVI still believe that in this densely populated little island we have, we should save the space on the land for living and use the space around us for our energy needs. \u000a
p8890
aV&gt; Feudalism did die a long time ago, and aristocratic privilege is nearly gone too\u000a\u000aIf only that were the case.
p8891
aVIn reality some of the old feudal lords such as the Duke of Westminster and Duke of Buccleuch are still very much with us, and both have large estates in Scotland.
p8892
aVhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/who-owns-scotland-1320933.html\u000a\u000a&gt; Why should we punish the current members of the aristocratic families, by confiscating their land, for the perceived crimes of their ancestors?
p8893
aVWhy should we allow them to benefit from the perceived merits of their ancestors?
p8894
aVPersonally I believe that Britain would be a much better place of inequality was reduced, and this looks like a pretty good place to start.
p8895
aVI'd confront inequality by, for example:\u000a\u000a- Increased taxation for land ownership\u000a- Reducing farm subsidies (and getting agricultural subsidies for grouse shooting, as these people currently manage, is ridiculous)\u000a- Properly enforcing inheritance taxes on the wealthy (nice side effect - budget deficit reduced)\u000a\u000a&gt; Besides, I'm not too fond of the idea of planting wind turbines all over beautiful Scottish highlands, then setting up chains of pylons to finish the job off of ruining natural beauty.
p8896
aVI'd agree, that isn't ideal.
p8897
aVBut it seems to me to be a small price to pay for confronting climate change.
p8898
aVIf we don't act now, or we merely pay lip service by adopting token uneconomic measures as appeasement (offshore wind), then the price to pay in the future will be much higher.

aV\u000a&gt;Whilst I personally wouldn't completely rule out nuclear, I'm a long way from being convinced that it's one of our best tools.
p8901
aVThen you have done next to no research on the matter.\u000a
p8902
aVAnd where, in your post, can I find evidence of your research?
p8903
aVif you want to make the case for nuclear being cheaper, then please do so.
p8904
aVJust read this: http://www.withouthotair.com/\u000a\u000aYou will discover that there is no way that wind power could provide all of our energy needs, even if we covered 70% of the country with perfectly efficient wind turbines.
p8905
aVWind *does* make a cheap and useful contribution, but it's not enough on its own.
p8906
aVNuclear could provide all the power we need.
p8907
aV&gt; You will discover that there is no way that wind power could provide all of our energy needs\u000a\u000aI don't disagree.
p8908
aVI am simply disagreeing with the emphasis some posters have placed on nuclear when it isn't the cheapest source of non-carbon energy available.
p8909
aVUntil we get fusion, nuclear fission is one of the very few technologies that can provide the energy we need to keep our society functioning.
p8910
aVSolar is promising, but it works best in deserts.
p8911
aVSo the UK would need long and vulnerable transmission lines to get useful amounts of power from North Africa.
p8912
aVBut what the Greens tend to conveniently forget/ignore is that wind can only ever, I mean EVER, even if we get it to as best as we think we ever can, be used as a supplement to a main power source.
p8913
aVIt can, reduce your use of that main fuel part of the time.
p8914
aVIt's not constant and it's not predictable.
p8915
aVWe can't store energy, so even if we built as much as we theoretically needed (more on this in a bit) it still wouldn't be able to power us.
p8916
aVSo if we dive totally into wind, which is what the greens suggest, then we'd either have to go big nuclear, or stick with coal.
p8917
aVSo yes, lets build windfarms where we can, but lets not pretend that that is in any way going to solve the problem of carbon emmisons.
p8918
aVWind is a distraction, and the Green party knows this, but they're so stuck in their 60's era anti nuclear thinking that they would rather distract than actually take steps to stop climate change.
p8919
aVTo do that, you HAVE to go nuclear, there is no other realistic option.
p8920
aVAnd going back to the issue of space, I urge you to watch this interesting and informative talk by David Mackay who explains about energy generation per land area.
p8921
aVThere is a lot more wrong with wind than it's lack of reliability.
p8922
aVhttp://www.ted.com/talks/david_mackay_a_reality_check_on_renewables
p8923
aV&gt; Three completely independent reports on the wind variability issue appeared in June and July 2009, all with the same message: the variability of wind needs to be taken into account, but it does not make the grid unmanageable; and the additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.
p8924
aV...\u000a\u000a&gt; The report quantifies the additional costs of variability due to all causes (additional short-term reserve, extra backup for peak demand periods, and constraints when wind production exceeds consumer demand).
p8925
aVIt suggests that these costs, with 40% of the electricity supply coming from wind, might add about 5.5% to domestic electricity bills.
p8926
aVhttp://www.claverton-energy.com/wind-energy-variability-new-reports.html
p8927
aVSo what I said then?
p8928
aVAssuming 40% of your power comes from wind when it's windy, and we magically have space for it, and we don't mind the occasional brownouts.
p8929
aVyou're still burning coal for 60%-100% of the energy depending on the weather.
p8930
aVHow is that better than the same amount of wind if you so cared, but then 60%-100% nuclear?
p8931
aVI've already shown information that demonstrates brownouts won't occur.
p8932
aVYou're not paying attention.
p8933
aVThere are also other forms of alternative power in addition to wind.
p8934
aVAnd, as I've said repeatedly, although no-one seems to pay attention, I don't completely rule out nuclear power.
p8935
aVI just don't see it as necessarily being the main component of our response to global warming as some previous posters seem to insist on.
p8936
aVWell actually that link didn't address the issue of brownouts it just said "dont' worry about it" and then had busted links, but lets assume that's not an issue though for now for simplicity sake.
p8937
aVWhat other form of energy would you have as your main power provider, since it can't be wind, or solar, or hydro for obvious reasons.
p8938
aVWhat would you use to power 60% (if we're going with the best case) to 100% of the power (when the weather isn't ideal) of our power?
p8939
aVOh dear.
p8940
aVCongratulations on basing your opinion on one aspect of cost and nothing else. 
p8941
aVNice assumption you made there.
p8942
aVI don't base my opinion solely on cost, which is why I don't completely rule out nuclear.
p8943
aVIf cost was the only factor in deciding between forms of alternative energy, I would rule nuclear out.
p8944
aVNow do you actually have any point to make, or are you just here for baseless one liners?
p8945
aVOnshore wind is a terrible idea.
p8946
aVCompletely unnecessary.
p8947
aVIf you want wind turbines you can go stick them where they have the least impact on people.
p8948
aVOut at sea, where funnily enough they produce more energy.
p8949
aVNow then.
p8950
aVWind Turbines are not innovative.
p8951
aVThere are organisations that are looking to tap into wind better.
p8952
aVThis involves operating turbines at higher altitudes.
p8953
aVTheir proposals are for tethered turbines not structures as the higher you go the bigger the wind turbine structure has to be.
p8954
aVOrganisations are proposing systems that can produce the same energy, at half the cost and with 90% the resources of current wind turbines.
p8955
aVAlso as the wind is more consistent at higher altitudes they would generate electricity 66% of the time as opposed to just 33%.
p8956
aVIt is important to note the wind turbines as we see them in the UK won't get any cheaper than they are.
p8957
aVThey cost what they cost.
p8958
aVAlmost all household electricity will be provided by de-centralized solar over the coming decades.
p8959
aVThe cost of solar is decreasing, while the performance is increasing.
p8960
aVThis is at a time when battery technology is also improving and we will perhaps see a major breakthrough in storage technology in the next 10 years.
p8961
aVBut it is important to note that renewable methods are not effective at being reliable or generating large amounts of electricity.
p8962
aVWe need this for our manufacturing base and very high density areas.
p8963
aVSo we have two options, fossil fuels or nuclear.
p8964
aVNuclear has it's obvious benefits over fossil fuels.
p8965
aVBut nuclear energy is a part of our trajectory as a species.
p8966
aVWe will not advance as a society without it.
p8967
aVWe will not explore the universe and colonize other planets and moons without it.
p8968
aVBeing anti nuclear and anti GM is as anti science as you can get.
p8969
aVWe will not find a cure for cancers and other age related diseases without genetic modification.
p8970
aVThe train for the Green's will not stop at food.
p8971
aVIt will expand out to all genetic modification. 
p8972
aVOffshore wind is a much more expensive way of generating electricity than onshore.
p8973
aVThe only reason our politicians like it is because they are afraid to stand up to nimbys.
p8974
aV20% more.
p8975
aVNot much.
p8976
aVBut care to address anything else. 
p8977
aVOk - I can only give you my opinions, which don't completely match those of the green party.
p8978
aVHowever they are close enough that I'm happy to vote Green.
p8979
aV&gt; If you want wind turbines you can go stick them where they have the least impact on people.
p8980
aVOut at sea, where funnily enough they produce more energy\u000a\u000aOnshore wind is considerably cheaper than offshore wind.
p8981
aVAnd there are plenty of areas where they could be sited with minimal impact on most people.
p8982
aVPart of the problem for the mainstream parties is that the people who are impacted tend to be wealthy and politically influential country land owners, many of whom represent the vestiges of our aristocracy.
p8983
aVDid you know 50% of the land in Scotland is owned by only 432 people?
p8984
aVI don't care if these people have their view spoilt.
p8985
aVWe have a planet to save.
p8986
aV**GMO:** I've got nothing whatsoever against research into genetics, and I'd be happy to support it for medical use.
p8987
aVHowever, when it comes to GM crops, I do have a problem trusting some of the large agri-chemical companies involved, many of whom have a history of sharp business practices and deceit.
p8988
aVUltimately in order to seriously confront global warming, then we will first necessarily have to confront global capitalism, since a society based on continual acquisition is not compatible with sustainability.
p8989
aVOnce that's done then maybe it will be possible to create a framework in which GM crops may be a fruitful way forwards.
p8990
aV**Your science fiction fantasies:** We are an enormous way away from any meaningful space colonization.
p8991
aVIn order to get there we will need to deal with shorter term issues, such as climate change, first.
p8992
aV&gt; renewable methods are not effective at being reliable or generating large amounts of electricity\u000a\u000aActually, the best method of reliably and cheaply generating large amounts of electricity is renewable.
p8993
aVIt's a pity hydroelectric isn't equally available in all areas.
p8994
aVHowever industry could potentially be relocated to areas where it is available.
p8995
aVThis already happens to an extent (e.g.
p8996
aValuminium smelters in Scandinavia)\u000a\u000aReliability of supply is why, in the short term, I personally wouldn't completely rule out nuclear.
p8997
aVHowever I would also support further research into improving energy storage methods, where there is potential for enormous progress.
p8998
aVIf either cheap energy storage, or transmission, becomes available, then the case for nuclear disappears.
p8999
aV&gt;Actually, the best method of reliably and cheaply generating large amounts of electricity is renewable.
p9000
aVIt's a pity hydroelectric isn't equally available in all areas.
p9001
aVExactly why a logical conversation can not be had with yourself or the Green party.
p9002
aVWhat fucking relevance is that?
p9003
aV&gt;However I would also support further research\u000a\u000aWhat does that even mean?
p9004
aVAllow the private sector to innovate.
p9005
aVThat is what it does.
p9006
aVIn terms of a government they should be setting competitions with rewards not forcing their wind mill agenda on people.
p9007
aV&gt;Your science fiction fantasies\u000a\u000aThe fact that you call them fantasies is alarming.
p9008
aVSo you propose that we stall innovation and progress until a time when we actually want to explore other planets, moons and colonize them? 
p9009
aV&gt; Allow the private sector to innovate.
p9010
aVThat is what it does.
p9011
aVYou've swallowed too many capitalist myths.
p9012
aVMany of the most major technological innovations of the past century, including the nuclear power that you advocate, and the internet on which we converse, come from government innovation.
p9013
aV&gt; The fact that you call them fantasies is alarming.
p9014
aVSo you propose that we stall innovation and progress until a time when we actually want to explore other planets, moons and colonize them?
p9015
aVNo, of course not.
p9016
aVYou're just attacking a straw man.
p9017
aVHowever Space colonies didn't happen in 1999, and they aren't going to happen for the next several decades either.
p9018
aVThe challenges to overcome are enormous.
p9019
aV&gt;come from government innovation.
p9020
aVOriginates and then the private sector takes over.
p9021
aVWhich is why my point still stands.
p9022
aVIt is the fact that you are backing shitty wind mills as some sort of radical solution.
p9023
aVhttp://www.google.com/makani/challenge/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.google.com/makani/solution/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.google.com/makani/technology/\u000a\u000a
p9024
aV&gt; It is the fact that you are backing shitty wind mills as some sort of radical solution.
p9025
aVAnd it is a fact that you are backing nuclear power as some sort of radical solution.
p9026
aVIt isn't.
p9027
aVNuclear has been with us for decades, and we know what to expect.
p9028
aVWe can already measure it's performance and it's less cost effective than "shitty wind mills".
p9029
aVAs for your links, it's an interesting technology.
p9030
aVMaybe once it's developed it will represent another alternative to nuclear.
p9031
aVIt won't represent an alternative to nuclear it represents an alternative to shitty wind mills.
p9032
aVLook to the future and stop looking at the past and present.
p9033
aVYour proposals and the ones of the Green party are incredibly dull and boring and uninformed.
p9034
aVLiterally no research has been conducted by the Green party into such technologies as I have linked to you.
p9035
aVIt is not a progressive party. 
p9036
aV&gt;Look to the future and stop looking at the past and present.
p9037
aVAs I implied earlier - you are basing your arguments on science fiction fantasies.
p9038
aV&gt; Literally no research has been conducted by the Green party into such technologies as I have linked to you\u000a\u000aConducting research is not the job of political parties, but of scientists, and the Green party has pledged to increase funding into research for alternative energy sources, such as this appears to be.
p9039
aV&gt; Your proposals and the ones of the Green party are incredibly dull and boring and uninformed ...It is not a progressive party.
p9040
aVSo how does that differ from any of the mainstream parties?
p9041
aVThe job of political parties should be to govern, not to publish futurist manifestos.
p9042
aVYou should also be made aware that the term "Progressive" tends to be used in mainstream politics for parties favouring income redistribution, which definitely does include the Green party.\u000a
p9043
aV&gt; science fiction fantasies\u000a\u000aWhat like the links I gave you? \u000a\u000a
p9044
aV&gt;Nice assumption you made there.
p9045
aVI don't base my opinion solely on cost, which is why I don't completely rule out nuclear.
p9046
aVIf cost was the only factor in deciding between forms of alternative energy, I would rule nuclear out.
p9047
aVYou would rule out our cheapest long term solution?
p9048
aVOkay....\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9049
aVBecause nuclear isn't cheapest.
p9050
aVBut it provides more power over the long term.
p9051
aVThe French have invested more into Nuclear power than they have wind power despite having a larger land mass to population ratio to do so.
p9052
aVMaintenance on large areas of wind farms is extremely expensive and despite animal farming not being affected much land for crops is already in short supply here.
p9053
aVNot bashing wind but wouldn't it be more effective to force all new buildings designed for families to have solar panels and a small wind turbine on top of the house.
p9054
aVThe government could then put together a committee to review existing household structures that would be the best for such a scheme to be iplimented on and subsidise company's or families to have these added to the homes.
p9055
aVIf done over the course of the next 30 years this could tackle a large part of our co2 emissions.
p9056
aVAlso what happens when nuclear fusion becomes possible?
p9057
aVI predict it'll be ready within 15-30 years time.
p9058
aVThe life time of 1 or 2 wind turbines.
p9059
aVThe money we've invested on green alternatives will be too much and we won't be able to afford a fusion plant for say the next 30 years after that.
p9060
aVAt which point the price will have increased substantially as companies will be wanting to win multi billion contracts with countries like China, India and Brazil all rising super powers.
p9061
aVEdit: Apparently spell check thinks oval means Brazil.
p9062
aV&gt; Maintenance on large areas of wind farms is extremely expensive\u000a\u000aSo are waste storage/disposal and decomissioning costs for nuclear.
p9063
aVInsurance costs are also extremely expensive for nuclear (which is the reason the US abandoned building new nuclear power stations)\u000a\u000a&gt; If operators had to be insured for the whole potential damage, then, according to calculations by Versicherungsforen Leipzig GmbH for German nuclear power plants, this would lead to a price increase for nuclear energy of \u20ac0.139 to \u20ac2.36 per kWh.
p9064
aVCalculations for France lead to a price increase of \u20ac0.047 per kWh.
p9065
aV&gt; This insurance cost would raise current electricity prices for the French nuclear industry by 60%, for the German industry by at least 100%, while electricity prices for households would increase by 25% in France and by 50% or more in Germany.
p9066
aVhttp://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2265605/the_true_cost_of_disaster_insurance_makes_nuclear_power_uncompetitive.html\u000a\u000aNot requiring nuclear plants to be fully insured represents a hidden and enormous government subsidy for nuclear relative to other power sources (apart from coal, which somehow manages to dodge paying the cost of the enormous health problems it causes).
p9067
aV&gt; Not bashing wind but wouldn't it be more effective to force all new buildings designed for families to have solar panels and a small wind turbine on top of the house.
p9068
aVIn the UK wind is more cost efficient than solar.
p9069
aVHowever if we can find some way to cheaply transmit power from the Mediterranean area...
p9070
aVSolar may however still be useful for providing a more balanced and diverse supply.
p9071
aV&gt; Also what happens when nuclear fusion becomes possible?
p9072
aVThat's not likely to happen any time soon.
p9073
aVHowever if it does become possible, and it is cost effective, then I'd fully support it.
p9074
aV&gt; The money we've invested on green alternatives will be too much and we won't be able to afford a fusion plant for say the next 30 years after that.
p9075
aVThat's ridiculous.
p9076
aVIf a fusion plant becomes profitable then it will be built.
p9077
aVSpending money on wind now won't significantly reduce the production capacity we have available in the future.
p9078
aVCathartis is providing you with false information.
p9079
aVCurrent wind electricity generation as we see them in the form of wind turbine towers is as cheap as that specific technology will get.
p9080
aVIn fact when the subsidies are removed the cost will go up.
p9081
aVHowever the future of household electricity supply is de-centralized solar.
p9082
aVEven in the UK.
p9083
aVDon't fall for the lies about how solar is too ineffective in the UK due to the weather.
p9084
aVAs Elon Musk states, only 10-20% of solar generation depends on the specific ''bright light''.
p9085
aVThe cost of solar will continue to decrease while the efficiency increases.
p9086
aVSome physicists highlighting that one day solar panels will be like wall paper in cost and physical nature.
p9087
aVThe problem currently for de-centralization is power storage.
p9088
aVThis is seeing decreasing costs and also increases in efficiency.
p9089
aVOf course the obvious benefit to have de-centralized power is that you do not pay any rates.
p9090
aVGoing renewable is no guarantee of electricity prices going down, in fact they have gone up.
p9091
aVDe-centralized power is an upfront investment.
p9092
aVYou are paying fror something that would last for 20+ years.
p9093
aVWhere as thanks to inflation the amount for centralized power will continue to go up year on year (in general).
p9094
aVExpect a massive shift to de-centralized solar household power in the UK during the 2020's. 
p9095
aVI think most Green Party members can be brought over to that, those who understand science at least.
p9096
aVThat's why I said lend your vote.
p9097
aVThey share your goals, probably, but not your methods. 
p9098
aVI'm afraid for me, I can't support until they change that.
p9099
aVI'm an ecologist, so my priorities are scientific truth, and the environment, so I can't support a party that [produces fake studies about leukaemia clusters in Wales supposedly from the Sellafield plant](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/) and then even after they know that the study was false [CONTINUE to cite it on their website](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html) in order to turn public opinion against the only way our country can continue it's standard of living without continuing to pollute at such extraordinary levels.\u000a
p9100
aVWhat a great post!
p9101
aVI was only going to suggest on the OP's topic, perhaps the major Green story is the conversion of Liberal Democrat voters over to the Greens in the EU Elections?
p9102
aVThe Greens seem to be targetting them.
p9103
aVI think this is part of it, I'm not liking labour because of their civil rights record last time they were in office, I refuse to vote lib dem until the members who promised to vote one way and then voted another are gone (so a long time) and so what am I left with as a dirty commie lefty liberal?
p9104
aVGreens probably, but then as I say above, they're working against democracy by spreading misinformation.
p9105
aVSo today I'm voting Labour... as a best of a bad bunch.
p9106
aVMy problem with your argument is that they could just as easily say "look how many people voted for these policies, they must agree with us!
p9107
aV" Which is a strong disincentive to change them.
p9108
aVI would much rather they looked into WHY people weren't voting for them, and see how many young-lefty voters (many of whom would *love* a viable alternative to Labour) they're leaving out there because of their anti-science policies.
p9109
aVSpeaking from an entirely personal perspective they would also have to sort out their economic policies for me to vote for them, as their current ones are a fantasy. 
p9110
aVThat's true, it could also be interpreted as a measure of support for such policies.
p9111
aVThe only thing is putting them up to public scrutiny, which they're not going to get if they're out of the limelight.
p9112
aVAnd as an aside, which of their economic policies do you disagree with?
p9113
aVI wrote a long-ish [comment in another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/249mwl/why_you_should_be_voting_for_the_pirate_party/ch56pdj) about some of my problems with Green economic policy.
p9114
aVSimply put - they ignore reality.
p9115
aVIt's a manifesto written with the certainty that it will never be implemented and they'll never be called on it.
p9116
aVPeople who vote green do so for one of few reasons ("the environment" being top of their priorities, hard-lefties disillusioned with Labour, or a straight protest vote - I'd love to see research on more nuanced positions).
p9117
aVAs things stand (2010 manifesto) they ignore reality.
p9118
aVRenewables simply cannot compensate for the base load in electricity supply we lose when the next tranche of power stations are closed down.
p9119
aVThe numbers simply don't add up.
p9120
aVSo we need an alternative, there is a sensible conversation to be had around if that should be gas, nuclear or a combination of both, but the Green party don't want to be involved with it.
p9121
aVTheir economic policy is a lefties wet dream - but again, the numbers simply do not add up.
p9122
aVIt ignores the reality of living in a society with free movement of capital, and while the right over-state the perils of that as a matter of routine (we are still a nation of 70m consumers, demand exists, supply will too) there is no question that there is a point for every business where it simply doesn't make sense to be based here. 
p9123
aVMakes sense, thanks for explaining that.
p9124
aVStill, their economic policies, even if they are a little too radical, make them an alternative for those who believe that Labour has shifted too far in favour of big business over workers' rights.
p9125
aVI understand the concerns about economic policies going too far left, but the obscene increases in inequality suggest that the opposite is the case under decades of neo-liberalism.
p9126
aVNot only that, but favouring major multinationals over small to medium enterprises discourages competition and local prosperity. 
p9127
aVIt's not that they're radical that I object to... it's that the numbers don't add up.
p9128
aVI'm not even talking in a complicated modelled sort of way, I mean they are promising HUGE deficits from day 1... while I'm no hawk (Keynes was right, both sides of his principles), it's unsustainable, and with the current mood in financial markets we'd be in trouble.
p9129
aVAgain, real world over pipe-dreams.\u000a
p9130
aVWhy's a libsoc advocating voting if you don't mind me asking?
p9131
aVBecause I think we should be pragmatic about voting and democracy.
p9132
aVIt doesn't have to be a symbol of consent for the status quo.
p9133
aVEvery vote for say, the Greens, makes the establishment parties' majority that bit slimmer.
p9134
aVIt's a statement that you *exist* politically.
p9135
aVThat your vote will be counted.
p9136
aVAnd the more people think of their vote not as an instant payback, but an investment in politics, the better.
p9137
aVIt shows that you are not politically apathetic.
p9138
aVAnd that's incredibly important.
p9139
aVIt takes 5 minutes to go out and vote, to show that you are paying attention and you do *not* consent to the main parties' political mandate. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9140
aVThey have moderated on many things in the previous years, and I'm sure if their supporters wish it, the nuclear policy can change too.
p9141
aVTheir policy statements don't seem to be changing on that, and [they still reference studies](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html) that claim nuclear is killing people, [even though the study is known to have been completely fabricated](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/).
p9142
aVI'd like them to change, but I can't vote for them until they do.
p9143
aVThe green party also wants to completely open up immigration:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries.
p9144
aV&gt; \u000a&gt; In step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.
p9145
aVAnd:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG405 Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are a lot more problems with the green party than just their anti-science stance.\u000a 
p9146
aVI don't mind increased ease of immigration process.
p9147
aVAnd I especially don't see an issue with bringing immigrants already here into the legal working, taxable,  non-gang run fold.
p9148
aVIt lets them intergrate without fear of deportation and it robs the gangs of their power and income.
p9149
aVEasing the process is not the same thing as reducing controls.
p9150
aVCan you really not see any problem with this?
p9151
aVI can see why some might, but I mean that's the point of democracy, vote for the guys who most agree with your views.
p9152
aVSo like conservatives want to increase controls yeh (?)?
p9153
aVI disagree, but I think it's a legitimate viewpoint and SOME party should have it.
p9154
aVThe Green's anti science stuff though is spreading misinformation and refusing to acknowledge facts.
p9155
aVThats different because thats preventing people from making an informed choice.
p9156
aVPeople think green = environment, green say nuclear power is super dangerous and they tell loads of (false) stats about their harm (and also somehow call it elitest and hypocritical... with no explanation) and so people think nuclear = bad for environment, when almost all experts disagree and have for decades.
p9157
aVSame with their anti GM stance and spreading lies about its use, its risk, its benefits and activly tell people to smash scientific trials based on false facts.
p9158
aVThat's not a different viewpoint, thats shaping people's viewpoibt based on a lie.
p9159
aVIt would be like if Torys wanted to lower immigration and so told people we need to because 90% of immigrants were found to have built a bomb in 12 months of arriving.
p9160
aVThey don't say that, they tell the (selected) truth like all politicians and argue their view, which is fine.\u000a\u000a
p9161
aVI'm curious.
p9162
aVCan you give examples of these "false stats"?
p9163
aVIt's also not hard to note that the nuclear industry has a history of issuing false stats, starting with their original promises of "electricity too cheap to meter", and more recently illustrated by the discoveries made by the investigations following the Fukushima disaster.
p9164
aVWell the famous one was [when they went on about supposed leukaemia clusters in Wales supposedly from the Sellafield plant](http://www.marklynas.org/2011/04/time-for-the-green-party-and-guardian-ditch-nuclear-quackery/)., when in fact when people went to repeat the study they found that the scientists (led by the Green party head of scientific communication at the time, and still linked to them) had just made up numbers, made up everything, there were no clusters, there was no danger at all\u000a\u000aThis is a study they [CONTINUE to cite on their website, despite it being proven to be patently falsified](http://greenparty.org.uk/archive/news-archive/1005.html)\u000a\u000aAs for Fukishima, what false stats do you mean?
p9165
aVThere is a  difference between "later found to be untrue" to "intentionally releasing false info".
p9166
aVThere's a lot of intentional false info around fukishima, but it's not from the nuclear side.
p9167
aVWhat you need to know about fukishima is that a total worst case scenario happened at a modern nuclear reactor, and nobody died of anything to do with the nuclear aspect.
p9168
aVNobody is predicted to **die of** cancer because of the Fukishima incident, not even the workers who went in to help clear it up (Don't get me wrong, they went in thinking they would die, and they were bloody heros, but luckily, it wasn't as bad as thought and all tests seem to show they'll be fine, it's like they flew in a plane a few times).
p9169
aV**Edit: in bold**
p9170
aV&gt; As for Fukishima, what false stats do you mean?
p9171
aVI recall several examples.
p9172
aVHere's one that I managed to find after a short search:\u000a\u000ahttp://enenews.com/tepco-admits-to-reporting-false-radiation-levels-for-past-2-years-at-fukushima\u000a\u000a&gt; Nobody is predicted to get cancer because of the Fukishima incident\u000a\u000aPlease source this claim.
p9173
aVI find it hard to believe given the levels of radiation exposure the workers at the plant suffered.
p9174
aVAlso, the world health organisation disagrees with your claim:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/28/us-japan-nuclear-cancer-idUSBRE91R0D420130228\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you've been reading misleading propaganda from the nuclear industry.
p9175
aVEdit: Also, the green party web site link points to an archived 2004 report.
p9176
aVI see nothing wrong in it's presence.
p9177
aVWould you expect mainstream science to purge it's archives of all papers that are subsequently found to be incorrect?
p9178
aVOr for newspapers to remove any stories from their archives that are subsequently found to be false?
p9179
aVSorry, I should correct myself on a re-read of what I put, nobody is predicted **to die** of cancer caused by it.
p9180
aVThere is a slight increase predicted in the number of very rare quite treatable cancers in certain people who can get regular checkups.
p9181
aVBTW, that Reuters article on the WHO report doesn't understand what relative risk is.
p9182
aVRead the actual report.
p9183
aVWhat I've been reading, is scientific articles published in proper peer reviewed journal, like those Green science reports WERE NOT.
p9184
aVAnd yes actually, science DOES put massive "THIS PAPER HAS BEEN RETRACTED" notices on papers that are found to be false.
p9185
aVand in many cases remove from online (which can be accessed on request, again with massive "RETRACTED" notices on.
p9186
aVBecause the intentional distribution of false or misleading science is an incredibly serious offence in the scientific community)
p9187
aVYep I had almost this exact conversation with someone couple of days ago.
p9188
aVI agree with the Greens on many issues but as long as they spread misinformation, oppose nuclear and don't put forward any better solutions, I'll never vote for them.
p9189
aVThey'll be forever confined to the Brighton new age hipster crowd.
p9190
aVIn fact, in many respects the Greens are the flip side of UKIP - just appealing to emotions and fears, with little rationality. 
p9191
aVI'm pretty sure ukip don't even believe in climate change.
p9192
aVThey do not.

aVThe Greens' migration policies are excellent.
p9200
aVThey are the only ones not pandering to the knuckle-draggers.
p9201
aVDo you also agree on their policy to remove any preference for skilled immigrants?
p9202
aVThe arguments for preferring "skilled" to "unskilled" migrants bemuse me.
p9203
aVEssentially, they amount to "people can come in and take *your* job, but we're going to give government protection to the jobs of those idiots who didn't pay attention in school".
p9204
aVOverall, I favour a global free-movement regime.
p9205
aVAnd your argument is "We shouldn't prefer people who are actually skilled and useful to society, but should let everyone, including people who didn't pay attention in school".
p9206
aVHow strange.
p9207
aVIt's called freedom.
p9208
aVNo, no it's not.
p9209
aVYes.
p9210
aVYes it is.
p9211
aVRemoving all immigration controls would make us all better off.
p9212
aVThere are sober estimates that it would [double global GDP](http://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/).
p9213
aVAnd we would all be much freer in a world where governments don't take it upon themselves to tell us where we can and can't live.
p9214
aV&gt; There are sober estimates that it would double global GDP.
p9215
aVAnd how would it affect our country?
p9216
aVLess than 1% of Muslims think that homosexuality should be legal.
p9217
aVWhat would happen to the rights of gays in this country if a large population of Muslims moved here?
p9218
aVYou can't just ignore the effect that the influx of a different culture would have.
p9219
aVAh, the inevitable islamophobia.
p9220
aVMillions of Muslims live in the UK already.
p9221
aVThey sky hasn't fallen in yet.
p9222
aVYet.
p9223
aVThe Muslim youth is highly radicalised.
p9224
aVSome quick quotes:\u000a\u000a&gt; Forty per cent of younger Muslims said they would want their children to attend an Islamic school\u000a\u000a&gt; Three out of four young Muslims would prefer Muslim women to "choose to wear the veil or hijab," \u000a\u000a&gt; One in eight young Muslims said they admired groups such as al-Qa'eda that "are prepared to fight the West".
p9225
aV&gt; 36 per cent of the young people questioned said they believed that a Muslim who converts to another religion should be "punished by death.
p9226
aV" \u000a\u000a&gt; Forty per cent of Muslims between the ages of 16 and 24 said they would prefer to live under sharia law in Britain\u000a\u000a&gt; UK Muslims (in 2006) comprised just 2% of the population, but committed 25% of all anti-Homosexual crimes \u000a\u000aJoin /r/exmuslim some time and read about Islam from their point of view.
p9227
aVAll religious extremists pose a threat to modern civilization.
p9228
aVThat's just as true of crazy Christians in the US as it is of crazy Muslims wherever.
p9229
aVThe solution is the same as it ever was: education, trade, commerce.
p9230
aVYou won't broaden an extremist's world view by locking them away in a grindingly poor 3rd world country.
p9231
aVEven if you keep them out, don't think it will make you safe: The World Trade Centre bombing was planned in Afghanistan and implemented by Saudis.
p9232
aV&gt; All religious extremists pose a threat to modern civilization.
p9233
aVYes, but remember that your idea of "extremists" represents around half of the Muslims in the world.
p9234
aV(Around 50% of the world's Muslims believe that you should be killed for apostasy).
p9235
aVAnd that's just a single measure.
p9236
aVIf you go by treatment of homosexuality, then the vast majority of Muslims are extremists.
p9237
aV&gt; You won't broaden an extremist's world view by locking them away in a grindingly poor 3rd world country.
p9238
aVYou also won't broaden their world view by just letting them come over here.
p9239
aVMuslims in this country are **more** extreme (roughly double the percentage) than their parents.
p9240
aVIt is the **children** that have become extreme.
p9241
aV&gt; Even if you keep them out, don't think it will make you safe\u000a\u000aSafety is relative.
p9242
aVThe question is - will we be safer with extremists in our country or out?\u000a\u000a
p9243
aV&gt; The question is - will we be safer with extremists in our country or out?
p9244
aVPersonally, I'd be much happier if we could deport bigoted fuckwits.
p9245
aVIf young British Muslims are more radicalised than their parents, then it's a reaction to over a decade of hysterical islamophobic scaremongering from the likes of you.
p9246
aV&gt; Personally, I'd be much happier if we could deport bigoted fuckwits.
p9247
aVOr just not let them in in the first place.
p9248
aV&gt; then it's a reaction to over a decade of hysterical islamophobic scaremongering from the likes of you.
p9249
aVThe British Muslims are nowhere near as bad as many other Muslim countries.
p9250
aV&gt; A 2010 Pew Research Center poll showed that 84% of Egyptian Muslims believe those who leave Islam should be punished by death.
p9251
aVWill you blame that on me too?
p9252
aVIran kills people for apostasy.
p9253
aVIs that my fault too?
p9254
aVIslam is the problem.
p9255
aVYet you prefer to stick your head in the sand and somehow blame the people who point this out.\u000a\u000a
p9256
aV&gt; Iran kills people for apostasy.
p9257
aVIs that my fault too?
p9258
aVI'd say that's mainly the US's fault.
p9259
aVCutting off Iran from world trade and cultural engagement has given all the power to their religious hard-liners.
p9260
aVIn general, Iran is a populous, well-educated, moderate country.
p9261
aVTheir Islamic Revolution was an extreme reaction to Western meddling that had lead to the Shah's totalitarian regime.
p9262
aVIf they'd been left to get on with it, Iran would have been reintegrated into the global system by now.
p9263
aVHave you even even *met* an Iranian?
p9264
aVYou realise that Christians were every bit as "scary" as scary Muslims, only a couple of centuries ago?
p9265
aVHell, there are millions of scary Christians even today.
p9266
aV(Btw I take my quotes from respectable polls.
p9267
aVIf you doubt any, just ask and I'll cite.
p9268
aV)
aVHow would the state be able to afford to support so many people?
p9269
aVWhy would the state have to support them?
p9270
aVLook at the recent addition of several relatively poor Eastern European countries to the EU's free movement regime: That hasn't added *any* extra burden to the UK public purse.
p9271
aVQuite the contrary - these extra immigrants have helped keep taxes lower for the rest of us.
p9272
aVhttp://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/great-uk-immigration-scare
p9273
aVPeople for whom immigration is a priority probably aren't voting green anyway.
p9274
aVThere's other parties that scratch that itch
p9275
aVLike which?
p9276
aVUKIP are a terrible choice for other reasons.
p9277
aVlibdems come somewhat close.
p9278
aVSpecificly ukip :)\u000aTories too.
p9279
aVNow I don't give toss about immigration, we could probably do with more of it.
p9280
aVI do care about energy policy, I do care about environmental policy and I do care about rational economic policy.
p9281
aVThe Tories have failed on all three
p9282
aVThey also want to completely dismantle the armed services.
p9283
aV&gt;PD200 The citizens and communities within a green society will create for themselves rewarding work, adequate housing, material security, appropriate education, accessible and sensitive public services, a secure present and hope for the future, all within the framework of a sustainable, ecologically benign economy.
p9284
aVThe world we build for our children will not depend on exploitative economic relationships or on new roles for outdated security alliances, but on the acceptance of our global interdependence.
p9285
aVThe present environmental destruction threatens our common survival; we have no choice but to build common and co-operative responses.
p9286
aV&gt;PD201 Warfare in the context of present offensive weapon systems, nuclear or non-nuclear, is so dangerous that it can not be regarded as a sane instrument of policy.
p9287
aVCommon security measures seek to build trust and co-operation, to prevent destructive conflict, to build a just local and global society based upon fairness.
p9288
aVIn a Common Security framework potential adversaries co-operate to enhance each other's security and well being, rather than competing for military advantage in a spiralling arms race.
p9289
aVAn important element of common security is the progressive reduction and eventual abolition by treaty of all offensive weaponry.
p9290
aV&gt;PD300 The policies espoused in the rest of this PSS are all intended to build a culture of trust among peoples, as well as the primary goals they proclaim.
p9291
aVIn particular, International (IP) and European (EU) policy is intended to create a world where regions collaborate where necessary and interact peaceably.
p9292
aV&gt;PD301 We would promote town twinning, exchange visits, pen friend schemes and Internet-based methods for learning about other countries and cultures by direct contact.
p9293
aVOne of the main purposes of embassies would be to learn about culture and current affairs of their host countries by immersion in a wide variety of local activities.
p9294
aVThe UN should provide significant support for building effective law and order systems that are not affected by corruption, and for support of free and democratic elections.
p9295
aV&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation.
p9296
aVCommitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary.
p9297
aVAny threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.
p9298
aVI really REALLY want to know what the fuck they've been smoking.
p9299
aVTown Twinning?
p9300
aVREALLY?
p9301
aV&gt; Town Twinning?
p9302
aVREALLY?
p9303
aVWhat's the issue with town twinning?
p9304
aVAs a viable part of a defence and security policy?
p9305
aVI can think of many other things that would actually be a much more effective defence and security policy than that.
p9306
aVLike waking up in the morning.
p9307
aVIt's part of a defence policy which is predicated on the idea that we're safest when we have greater levels of international understanding and cooperation.
p9308
aVA small part of that is town twinning. 
p9309
aVIt costs twenty to forty thousand a year, can be turned off and on at the drop of a hat, and really, who cares about it?
p9310
aVBut explain their rationale for thinking that it's more than purely a PR gesture.
p9311
aV(P.S.
p9312
aVDid those towns in Russia care they got untwinned from wherever because of Russias gay rights?
p9313
aVHint: The answer is no.
p9314
aV)\u000a\u000a&gt;Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary.
p9315
aVAny threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.
p9316
aVWhat this means in effect is that they believe they can mothball all of this equipment without needing to use it, which will mean a sell off because that kind of equipment cannot be just left laying over there thataway otherwise it degrades and deteriorates beyond use without constant maintenance.
p9317
aVSo if we sell off all the equipment then we might as well not bother having any soldiers, sailors, airmen or marines because they won't have any equipment to train with.
p9318
aVSo that means all the institutional knowledge is lost too.
p9319
aVSo please, we have town twinning which does bugger all in the grand scheme of things, and we have no equipment and no institutional knowledge either.
p9320
aVThe ramp up time on that is far and away going to be longer than anything the green party can imagine.
p9321
aVLet's take a look at the Yugoslav wars shall we?
p9322
aVIt took roughly a year for the Yugoslav wars to kick off, two years for the UN to intervene with MARITIME GUARD and then 3 years for the UN to try to intervene on the ground with UNPROFOR and in the air with Operation Deliberate Force.
p9323
aVUnless the Greens think Town Twinning is going to work to stop people like Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from committing atrocities.
p9324
aVI'm sure that sending him strongly worded letters saying "Please stop" would have worked.
p9325
aVI'm going to have to say that if the Greens had gotten into power at any time from even 5 years before the start of the conflict with their current proposals then we in the UK would have been able to do absolutely nothing to help to try and rein in the Yugoslav wars.
p9326
aVThe contempt I feel for the greens for this kind of policy and decision making is only but a shadow of the contempt that the rest of Europe would have felt for the UK.
p9327
aVThere was also the Northern Mali Conflict\u000a\u000ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mali_conflict\u000a\u000aAlso how about the Libyan Civil War?
p9328
aVhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya\u000a\u000aI'm sure that begging "please don't do this" would work oh so well.
p9329
aVI'm not going to godwin this thread by talking of appeasement or you know who, but danegeld has never worked in history and I don't see why it would work now.
p9330
aVHow can they possibly consider either of these to be good policies? 
p9331
aVBecause it is estimated that removing all immigration controls would double global GDP?
p9332
aVBecause some people have absolutely no problem with people moving from one place to the other and there needs to be a party that reflects that view?
p9333
aVI like the way you think!
p9334
aVGot a source for that stat though?
p9335
aVhttp://openborders.info/double-world-gdp/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/great-uk-immigration-scare\u000a\u000aHere's two.

aVThe paper is in the first line of the first link.
p9337
aVDanke
p9338
aVThey also explicitly want to allow immigration through fake marriages:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.
p9339
aVRead the page :  http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html\u000a\u000aThere's just too much to post here.
p9340
aVEdit:  I have to add one more.
p9341
aVThey also want to completely eliminate the preference for skilled workers:\u000a\u000a&gt;  Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.\u000a\u000a
p9342
aVHa, they have this quote:\u000a\u000a"Only after the last tree has been cut down,\u000aOnly after the last river has been poisoned,\u000aOnly after the last fish has been caught,\u000aOnly then will you find that money cannot be eaten.

aV"\u000a\u000ayet want to ban GM foods? 
p9344
aV&gt; yet want to ban GM foods\u000a\u000aNo, they don't.
p9345
aVThey want a moratorium while GMO effects are scientifically assessed and they want to make sure that any modifications are purely beneficial for growers/consumers - not vendors.
p9346
aVAnd yet the only way to actually test GMO effects and doing research is by running trials...\u000a\u000aOh wait.
p9347
aVhttp://greenparty.org.uk/news.html/2012/05/25/why-im-going-to-rothamsted-to-protest-about-their-gm-wheat-trial/
p9348
aVWell, their actual policy stance on GMO is "more research".
p9349
aVThat link is to a comment from a single member two years ago.
p9350
aVOf course, there are plenty of members who are fiercely opposed to GM, yet I am also a member and I am not.
p9351
aVJenny Jones isn't just "a single member" though; she's one of the more prominent politicians in the Green Party.
p9352
aVShe's one that regularly appears in the press, she ran to be London mayor, and she was Deputy Mayor alongside Ken Livingstone for a while, and now she's a member of the house of Lords. 
p9353
aVThey want a moratorium on it in the same way UKIP want a moratorium on Climate Change.
p9354
aVIt's a foregone conclusion to them.
p9355
aVYeah, I love the greens, but their anti-nuclear (as an energy source, not weapons) and anti-GM really makes me mad
p9356
aVnuclear weapon wise I think we should just half our number to save a bit of cash, I think some is as much as a deterrent as lots.
p9357
aVMy theory is that the Green Party will, by the time of the next General Election, have successfully maneuvered themselves into the political space previously occupied by the Lib Dems.
p9358
aVWhat I mean by that is this:  I think many people were shocked when the Lib Dems went into coalition with the Tories, because a lot of people hadn't grasped that the Lib Dems and Tories have long shared a core ideology of free-market capitalism, and for a long time they were, instead, seen in the popular imagination as basically an idealistic, underdog version of Labour for middle-class people.
p9359
aVAnd it's that what I think the Greens are gonna move in on.
p9360
aVThey will be the new idealistic, underdog version of Labour for middle-class people, and as a Labour-voter myself, I genuinely wish them luck with that.
p9361
aVBut the Greens are more to the left of Labour and would benefit poorer people more than the middle class...
p9362
aVFine by me.
p9363
aVThe poorer you are the more you need help, generally speaking.
p9364
aVBut it invalidates /u/wolfbagga's point about the Greens being good for the middle class.
p9365
aVThe Greens are good for the lower class and awful for everyone else - I mean come on, that 'Robin Hood' tax?
p9366
aVYou're assuming everyone just selfishly votes for policies that most benefit them rather than what they think is right.
p9367
aVI don't see how it's selfish to look out for primarily yourself and your family.
p9368
aVSeems like common sense to me, and basic human instinct.
p9369
aV(of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.
p9370
aV"I joined them for selfish reasons"
p9371
aVWell you can be Mr Selfless then, but most people quite clearly do vote for the policies that *they think* would most benefit them. 
p9372
aVSome people do, some people don't.
p9373
aVThe typical green voter doesn't was my point.
p9374
aVhttp://greenparty.org.uk/values/policies-2010/2010manifesto-economy.html\u000a\u000aThere seems to be an awful lot more there aimed at the rich.
p9375
aVTo me it seems that the more money you have the more you're taxed, which is to me fair given current wealth distribution (or lack thereof...).
p9376
aVI meant more that the typical Green voter is middle-class as opposed to working-class, rather than who the policies are aimed at.
p9377
aVYeah you're probably right.
p9378
aVThe lower classes are typically Labour voters and the upper classes typically vote conservative...
p9379
aVI imagine those in the middle get split between the rest of the parties.
p9380
aVSounds good to me.
p9381
aVI disagree.
p9382
aVIn the Lib Dems people see fair social policy but also financial responsibility.
p9383
aVThe greens lack this aspect and the only space they are going to take in my opinion is that of Labour's which I hope they do, Labour is a very strange party ideologically, they're technically left but advocate things such as Internet censorship, foreign wars, increased tuition fees, etc.
p9384
aVI believe there should be a real mainstream left wing party.
p9385
aVI'm actually thinking of voting Green.
p9386
aVI like pretty much everything they have to say.
p9387
aVI think I will vote Green locally, but not at a European level with their policy on immigration.
p9388
aV&gt;MG400: It will not aim to allow increased net migration to Britain other than for humanitarian reasons or as a result of other Green Party policies.
p9389
aVSeems like a non-issue to me.
p9390
aVI believe it is likely that humanitarian issues will increase in the future due to instability - either politically or environmentally.
p9391
aVPersonally I would prefer a stricter policy.
p9392
aVYea it's really too bad about the anti nuclear and anti gm 
p9393
aVI've been thinking about this and I'm not sure that's a reason not to vote for them, in the short term.
p9394
aVSomeone may want to correct me, or provide examples, but I can see it being the case that when a smaller party grows and gains more influence then they will examine various aspects of their policy that are unfeasible or impractical.
p9395
aVCertainly there are people who stand for parties that don't agree with all their policies.
p9396
aV~~The one that leaps to mind is Anne Marie-Waters who is on the National Secular Society council/board of directors, yet is standing for UKIP in the European elections.
p9397
aVUKIP have several demonstrably anti-secular policies, as they're rather 'Britain is a Chrsitian country' oriented.
p9398
aV[Just found this blog post on the subject which might give a background (haven't read it yet).
p9399
aV](http://freethoughtblogs.com/godlessness/2014/04/29/4-questions-for-anne-marie-waters-and-secularists-voting-ukip/)~~\u000a\u000aedit - [following some reading (i.e.
p9400
aVthe blog post one day *after* the one above!

aV) it seems that Anne Marie-Waters has resigned from the NSS.
p9402
aV](http://freethoughtblogs.com/godlessness/2014/04/30/anne-marie-waters-resigns-from-the-nss/) Bugger - I need another example!
p9403
aV(I'm a physicist, ftr - regarding the Green/nuclear thing.
p9404
aVI like nuclear.
p9405
aVGrew up looking at a nuclear power station.
p9406
aVHasn't effected me.
p9407
aVOr affected.
p9408
aVEh.
p9409
aV)
aVThat's a lot fewer o_O points than any other party.
p9410
aVTheir platform is all democratically decided anyway, so probably the best thing to do is join up and vote for them to change their manifesto.
p9411
aVMuch easier than going with one of the other parties for the sake of those two issues and hoping they'll bend every single other policy to match.
p9412
aVSource?
p9413
aVEdit: courtesy of /u/DerekJDurand \u000a\u000aAnti Science?
p9414
aVTheir views on nuclear and GMO's are more based on other issues, such as how carbon intensive uranium mining is, and how expensive to maintain nuclear plants are (along with the waste issue).
p9415
aVGMO's is mostly their opposition to corporate control of farming and the danger of monocultures failing.
p9416
aVHowever, anti science?
p9417
aVThe Green Party want's to spend 3% of GDP on science (which is about 10x more than we currently spend) and for research money to be split through the Haldane principle.
p9418
aVYeah.
p9419
aVOne would think the current German situation would have convinced them that nuclear is vital to reducing CO2 emissions.
p9420
aVBut Greens always have put the appearance of doing good above actually doing so.
p9421
aVThey want to completely open immigration:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.
p9422
aV&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries.
p9423
aVIn step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.
p9424
aVetc.
p9425
aVThey want to instantly ban GMO.
p9426
aVThey want to ban all future nuclear power stations in the whole of the EU, and have already voted for that.\u000a\u000a
p9427
aVReducing immigration controls is not the same as removing them entirely, they aren't calling for completely open immigration.
p9428
aVBut a lot more open than it is today, and with enough loop holes that it is effectively open.
p9429
aVFor example, they want to make it perfectly fine to marry someone just for purpose of getting in.
p9430
aVAnd allow anyone that illegally immigrates to become an legal immigrant as long as they don't get caught for 5 years.
p9431
aVProof:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.
p9432
aVand:\u000a\u000a&gt; MG405 Migrants illegally in the UK for over five years will be allowed to remain unless they pose a serious danger to public safety.
p9433
aVhttp://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html\u000a\u000a\u000aAnd on top of that, they want to completely elliminate the preference for skilled labour:\u000a\u000a&gt; Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.
p9434
aV&gt; they want to make it perfectly fine to marry someone just for purpose of getting in.
p9435
aVProbably because it's very hard to prove to a border official that you are marrying for love and not immigration status, and it causes a lot of distress and wastes a lot of time and money for them to try and dis-prove people are marrying for love, and you end up with [cases like this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sham-wedding-border-agency-bogus-uk-visa-520374).
p9436
aV&gt;And allow anyone that illegally immigrates to become an legal immigrant as long as they don't get caught for 5 years\u000a\u000aAgain there is logic to this, if they've managed to evade arrest for 5 years and live here unsupported by the state for all that time, we may as well make it legitimate so they can become full tax-paying members of society rather than working in the black market.
p9437
aVI believe the Lib-Dems have a similar policy.
p9438
aVIf the border force are doing their job, they'll catch illegal immigrants before 5 years by raiding employers that use illegal immigrant workers (which are a big problem as they will be paying them under the minimum wage and undercutting legal workers).
p9439
aV&gt;Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.
p9440
aVYeah I agree that ones a bit off (the desirable skills part) if it applies to economic migrants and not just refugees.
p9441
aVAny evidence this policy is harmful for the UK? 
p9442
aV&gt; They want to instantly ban GMO.
p9443
aV&gt; They want to ban all future nuclear power stations in the whole of the EU, and have already voted for that.
p9444
aVSo not very different from the mainstream parties then?
p9445
aVWe already have a moratorium on GMO and it's nearly 20 years since the last nuclear power plant was built in the UK.
p9446
aVWhy don't they consider nuclear power stations as a viable energy source if they are the "green" party?
p9447
aVBecause of the waste issue.
p9448
aVObviously.
p9449
aVDo you think Nuclear plants are without drawbacks?
p9450
aVI'm going to be voting Green, but I happen to agree that Nuclear opposition at this point is naive.
p9451
aVI'd *like* alternatives to step in but they simply aren't ready so Nuclear has to be seen as the least-bad option for where we are now.
p9452
aVHowever, when it comes to the next cycle of power creation, I'd like us to be saying "renewables are now viable", not "Ah well, we've been using Nuclear for the last 30 years, might as well carry on".
p9453
aVThe Greens are the only party who will genuinely push for that.
p9454
aVIf they were actually in government, I believe they would have to climb down on the anti-nuclear stance.
p9455
aVBut they are not in government nor are they likely to be.
p9456
aVThorium produces 98-99% less transuranic waste and has been used commercially as a fuel source since the 1960s.
p9457
aVIn addition, nuclear "waste" can actually be used as fuel again at a later stage so it's not entirely useless.
p9458
aVIt's also far, far more abundant and could probably even be mined in the UK.
p9459
aVThe only reason we used uranium for ours was that it lets you make bombs and that was something we wanted to do.
p9460
aVThe Green's energy policy makes no sense at all; nuclear (fission now, fusion later) should be the mainstay of our energy economy alongside renewable projects that make sense (e.g.
p9461
aVa Severn barrage).
p9462
aVI am interested in Thorium, although I understand that it's unlikely to be used commercially for another 20 years.
p9463
aVIf the Nuclear energy advocates are right, our need is more pressing than that.
p9464
aVThis is a common area of confusion.
p9465
aVThorium can and has been used commercially in traditional reactors since the 1960s; India still have two thorium plants that have been operational since the 1980s.
p9466
aVWhat will not be viable for another 20 years are molten fluoride salt reactors that can actually use uranium or thorium as fuel (but have only ever been demonstrated with uranium).
p9467
aVThorium can be used in a traditional reactor set up already, what people are talking about for the future are molten salt reactors that were initially intended to power aircraft with nuclear energy but essentially amount to a way to build reactors smaller and therefore get more electricity per unit of space.
p9468
aVOK, but the study/testing being done in Norway is the one the UK is interested in - and that's the new sort, no?
p9469
aVI guess I should have phrased it "We're not going to get any Thorium plants in the in the UK for 20 years".
p9470
aVYeah that would be molten salt reactors, which whilst awesome are not necessary to leverage thorium as a fuel source - they're just generally better whether you use uranium or thorium.
p9471
aVThere's no reason the UK couldn't build 5 or 6 thorium reactors instead of, say, HS2. 
p9472
aVI'd like to see the policy track: conventional thorium or uranium reactors--&gt;molten salt reactors--&gt;fusion.
p9473
aVI'm kind of with them in principle on open immigration.
p9474
aVThe problem is that the rest of the world isn't there yet.
p9475
aVWouldn't an ideal society be one where anybody could move from country to country freely?
p9476
aVHell no.
p9477
aVIn Iran you can get the death penalty for leaving Islam or for being gay.
p9478
aVIn Egypt 64% support the death penalty for apostasy.
p9479
aVWhat would happen to this country if there was a mass uncontrolled immigration of these types of people?
p9480
aVThe green party also want to have basic income.
p9481
aVThat would provide a huge incentive for people to come.
p9482
aVThese two things are in no way compatible.
p9483
aVYep basic income is a great idea and as nation we are set up to provide such a thing as we already have a huge welfare budget and an NHS.
p9484
aVHowever you can not implement a basic income successfully with mass uncontrolled immigration. 
p9485
aVThat's what I am saying.
p9486
aVThe rest of the world still needs to catch up so its not really viable at the moment, but I am firmly of the belief that if all borders in the world opened at once there wouldn't be too much trouble and it would be a very enlightening thing for many people.
p9487
aVIf all the borders of world opened while the world is in its current state, or if every country became westernised and dropped religion etc?
p9488
aVIt is an interesting thought.
p9489
aVThat I am not sure I agree with but.
p9490
aVIf all borders were droped over the world.
p9491
aVSo anyone can move to any country they wish.
p9492
aVWould then we not have a situ where people become a valuble resourse.
p9493
aVMost of the issues in the west.
p9494
aVExist because chaeper labour is abailable in other less well developed nations.
p9495
aVBut those nations have there own issues due to lack of freedom and development.
p9496
aVIf the citizens of any nation could go anywhere.
p9497
aVWould not those less developed nations need to try and prevent them from leaving.
p9498
aVIf we have a world with an idealistic level of freedom of movement.
p9499
aVThen the only way to keep workers would be to make life more desurable for them. 
p9500
aV&gt; Would then we not have a situ where people become a valuble resourse.
p9501
aVNo - the exact opposite.
p9502
aVEvery country has large numbers of unskilled unemployed people.
p9503
aV&gt; Exist because chaeper labour is abailable in other less well developed nations.
p9504
aVWhich also have huge numbers of unemployed unskilled people.
p9505
aV&gt; Would not those less developed nations need to try and prevent them from leaving.
p9506
aV14.6% of people live in developed countries.
p9507
aVThey wouldn't fit.
p9508
aVThe result would be that the developed countries would be dragged down to the level of the developing countries.\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9509
aVCan't people claim asylum for those reasons anyway. 
p9510
aVIf they are the ones being persecuted, sure.
p9511
aVBut what about the persecutors?
p9512
aVShould they be given immigration status too?
p9513
aVWhy are you asking me about immigration status, when I'm talking about asylum?
p9514
aVAre they the same?
p9515
aVAlso why would the persecutors ask for asylum, are you talking about in general or if there was a revolution/coup/civil uprising? 
p9516
aVWhy are you asking about asylum when I'm talking about immigration?
p9517
aVIt was you that replied to me first.
p9518
aVBecause in that post you seemed ignore that people can claim asylum for those reasons which seemed to make your claim about open immigration redundant.
p9519
aVI wanted to know what your take on it was.
p9520
aVAh.
p9521
aVNo - I was complaining that we don't want to let in lots of people with the beliefs that we should kill people for leaving Islam, being gay, etc.
p9522
aVI wasn't complaining about letting in asylum seekers.
p9523
aVOr are you talking about people who fake being gay/ex-Muslim in order to come into the country?
p9524
aVI don't know how much of that actually happens, or what the process is for proving that you need asylum.
p9525
aVI think you are seriously overestimating the numbers of that sort of people who would actually want to come here.
p9526
aVThe green party also want to implement a Basic Income.
p9527
aVSo what percentage of 7 billion people would like to move to the UK and get a guaranteed minimum income for the rest of their life without having to work?
p9528
aVI'm not even being rhetorical - what percentage of the earth's population would do that in your opinion?
p9529
aVMake it only available to long term residents then.
p9530
aVProblem solved.
p9531
aV0.000031%\u000aDon't ask me to estimate a stupid number.
p9532
aV&gt; Don't ask me to estimate a stupid number.
p9533
aVYou were the one complaining that I'm over stating it, yet you have absolutely no idea how many it would be to the point that you can't even guess.
p9534
aVYou're kind of implying that we'd be flooded with "loads" of people who hate gays or whatever.
p9535
aVYou asked me for a *percentage*.
p9536
aVThere is a difference there.
p9537
aVI don't think it'd be loads, it'd be "some", but I can't put a percentage of THE WHOLE WORLD POPULATION on it.
p9538
aVI doubt I'll be lynched on the streets by a muslim if that's what you're trying to suggest...
p9539
aVAs long as you don't dare to leave their religion, be gay, insult their religion, draw Muhammad, or get accused of being a witch, then you'll probably be fine! 
p9540
aVI'm strongly in favour of a more liberal immigration policy, though I'm aware that I'm swimming upstream on that one.
p9541
aVWhile I've got nothing against GMO in theory, I'm very much against the IP protection that backs it up.
p9542
aVI think they have got it wrong on nuclear power, but I'm going to vote for them tomorrow in spite of that, because I agree with quite a few of their other policies. 
p9543
aV&gt; While I've got nothing against GMO in theory, I'm very much against the IP protection that backs it up.
p9544
aVWhy?
p9545
aVAre you against IP protection on medical drugs too?
p9546
aVOn software?
p9547
aVMusic?
p9548
aVGames?
p9549
aV&gt; I'm strongly in favour of a more liberal immigration policy, though I'm aware that I'm swimming upstream on that one.
p9550
aVDo you agree with them on removing the preference for skilled immigrants?
p9551
aVDo you also agree with them on having a Basic Income?
p9552
aVBecause for me, that's incompatible with a very open immigration system.
p9553
aV&gt;Are you against IP protection on medical drugs too?
p9554
aVOn software?
p9555
aVMusic?
p9556
aVGames?
p9557
aVSome IP protection is necessary to encourage innovation.
p9558
aVThis needs to be carefully limited to avoid creating barriers to entry, to avoid excluding smaller businesses, and to exclude rent seeking.
p9559
aVAt the moment IP protection has gone too far and it needs to be pruned back quite severely.
p9560
aVAs far as GM foods are concerned, IP protection could give  a small number of companies control over the bulk of the world's food supply.
p9561
aVMonopolies are never good things.
p9562
aV&gt;Do you agree with them on removing the preference for skilled immigrants?
p9563
aVI'm reasonably happy with the current EU arrangements, though the UK should join Schengen.
p9564
aV&gt;Do you also agree with them on having a Basic Income?
p9565
aVBecause for me, that's incompatible with a very open immigration system.
p9566
aVI'm in favour of a Basic Income, though it would be difficult to introduce until we get housing sorted out.
p9567
aVBut it's only practical to give Basic Income to UK citizens.
p9568
aVIn practice this would limit unskilled immigration because the unskilled migrant would be competing with a UK citizen in receipt of a Basic Income.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9569
aV&gt; This needs to be carefully limited to avoid creating barriers to entry, to avoid excluding smaller businesses\u000a\u000a\u000aThey also need to be strong enough for the exact same reason.
p9570
aVBut you know what else raises the barrier to entry?
p9571
aVConstantly raising the cost, time and risk to bring a product to market.
p9572
aVIf you were a small GMO company with a good product, what do you think would happen to you if the green party got in after promising an immediate halt on all GMO products, along with promising much stronger restrictions and regulations?
p9573
aV&gt; At the moment IP protection has gone too far and it needs to be pruned back quite severely.
p9574
aVWhat's your evidence for this in the context of GMO foods?
p9575
aVIt costs millions of dollars and many years to bring a GMO product to market.
p9576
aVThe IP protection needs to be long enough and strong enough to ensure that the company has a good chance of getting their money back from that.
p9577
aV&gt; As far as GM foods are concerned, IP protection could give a small number of companies control over the bulk of the world's food supply.
p9578
aVMonopolies are never good things.
p9579
aVThen please think about the effect of drastically increasing the risk and cost of bringing a GMO product to market.
p9580
aVThis is what is creating the monopolies.
p9581
aVNot the current IP protection.
p9582
aVLook at how much hate and attack Monsanto get for no reason.
p9583
aVWhy would any new company want to enter that field?
p9584
aV&gt; I'm reasonably happy with the current EU arrangements, though the UK should join Schengen.
p9585
aVThen you disagree with the green party in drastically reducing the restrictions?\u000a
p9586
aV&gt;If you were a small GMO company with a good product, what do you think would happen to you if the green party got in after promising an immediate halt on all GMO products, along with promising much stronger restrictions and regulations?
p9587
aVAdmittedly that is a problem with the Greens.
p9588
aVThey protested  Rothamsted's GM  research, thus adversely impacting on a smaller and more ethical competitor to Monsanto.
p9589
aVThe Greens don't seem to get the concept of least-worst options, either with GM or more importantly nuclear.
p9590
aVI don't think the Greens are perfect by any means, and I don't agree with all of their policies.
p9591
aVI just agree with them more than I do with LibDem, Conservative or Labour.
p9592
aV&gt;Then you disagree with the green party in drastically reducing the restrictions?
p9593
aVI'm voting Green to send a message to the other parties in favour of a more open immigration policy, in the same way as some people vote UKIP to send a message asking for a more restrictive immigration policy.
p9594
aVI don't expect the Greens to get far enough to actually implement their policy, though I would't be too upset if they did. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9595
aV&gt; I just agree with them more than I do with LibDem, Conservative or Labour.
p9596
aVWhat do you disagree on with LibDems?
p9597
aV&gt; I'm voting Green to send a message to the other parties in favour of a more open immigration policy\u000a\u000aMore open than we have currently?
p9598
aVI thought you said that you were fine with the current policy?
p9599
aV&gt;What do you disagree on with LibDems?
p9600
aVI disagree with the Orange Book faction of the LibDems, because I'm not in favour of private sector provision of public services.
p9601
aVI especially disagree with the ongoing privatisation of the NHS.
p9602
aV&gt;More open than we have currently?
p9603
aVI thought you said that you were fine with the current policy?
p9604
aVI support the current right to freedom of movement within the EU, and I'd like to keep the rest of the immigration policy as is, or at least as was before the current government started tightening it up further.
p9605
aVI wouldn't object to a more open immigration policy, but I agree with the Greens that this would need to be subject to environmental considerations.
p9606
aVPolicy MG400 says "It will not aim to allow increased net migration to Britain other than for humanitarian reasons or as a result of other Green Party policies.
p9607
aV"\u000a\u000aGreen immigration policies [here](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html).
p9608
aVI agree with the broad thrust of these.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p9609
aV&gt; I disagree with the Orange Book faction of the LibDems, because I'm not in favour of private sector provision of public services.
p9610
aVI especially disagree with the ongoing privatisation of the NHS.
p9611
aVAgreed.
p9612
aVI have my own complaints with libdems - including the way that they campaigned for eliminating university fees and then voting to triple them!
p9613
aVAnd then excusing that by saying that they had only promised to eliminate the fees if they were elected.
p9614
aV&gt; Green immigration policies here.
p9615
aVI agree with the broad thrust of these.
p9616
aVOkay - I think we agree on the facts, but just disagree on what is best.
p9617
aVWhich is fine by me.\u000a
p9618
aVWhile I understand the premise of the article it's a little unfair to make the comparison.
p9619
aVUKIP are getting more coverage because they're a non-Labour non-Tory party that might win a major election in many decades, and it would be the first time ever that someone outside of the main two has won a European one.
p9620
aVAt the same time there are enough nutters in UKIP to continuously generate headlines about them saying something outrageous, which gives them even more publicity.
p9621
aVYes, the Greens are increasing in support, but it isn't at the same level.
p9622
aVAs based on the polling on [this website](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/uk-polling-report-average-2), the Green party only have 4% support in comparison to 15% support for UKIP.
p9623
aVThis is 54x less then what UKIP are on.
p9624
aVAs well as this, every UK general election that both parties have contested, UKIP have beat the Greens every time -  having at least double their votes from 2001 onwards.
p9625
aVUKIP is clearly a bigger party with a broader support, even though the Greens are represented in parliament and UKIP aren't\u000a\u000aFurthermore the Greens have 140 councillors, UKIP have 223, Greens have 2 MEPs, UKIP have 9.
p9626
aVGreens are polling at 3%, UKIP are polling at 14%.
p9627
aVGreens were 7th in the General Election (behind the BNP), UKIP were 4th.
p9628
aVThere really is no true comparison between the Greens and UKIP, they are on a completely different level
p9629
aVLooking at http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/ then the final Survation Euro poll has the Greens at 4%.
p9630
aVOpinum have them at 5%.
p9631
aVTNS didn't bother to separate them out from the 13% "Others".
p9632
aVComres show them at at 6%.
p9633
aVNow, they're not bad numbers by past standards for the Greens, but they're also not the sort of numbers that are going to deliver a swathe of Green MEPs either.
p9634
aVAnd they're certainly in no danger of being only the third party since 1920-something to top a UK-wide poll.
p9635
aVThe problem is UKIP gets more news coverage, then more things get brought up (found out or just more in public eye) , so they then get more coverage.
p9636
aVFree publicity good or bad.\u000a
p9637
aVDifference between a party polling under 10% and a party set to win which isn't lab/con.
p9638
aVLast survey I checked had ukip at 15% and the greens at 10% \u000a\u000anot much in it
p9639
aVIt's the European election tomorrow that's what people care about right now.
p9640
aVI don't know about you, but I only care about how the euro elections suggest the battlegrounds for the real election next year.
p9641
aVI suspect I'm not alone in ythis
p9642
aVPerhaps but the papers are more interested the current events.
p9643
aVIf the greens were polling 1st in the EU elections we would hear about it.
p9644
aVUndoubtedly :)\u000a\u000aI guess we'll have to console ourselves with an article saying support has tripled, even without the publicity boost that ukip has been getting
p9645
aVThat doesn't mean anything, though.
p9646
aVTiny parties like "Left Unity", "4 Freedoms" or "An Independence from Europe" have increased in numbers of support many times over than the Greens, that doesn't mean they're significant in this election.
p9647
aVPerhaps if we have a referendum and stay in the EU, the next election would be the day the Greens take over UKIP's place.
p9648
aVIt would explain why their European membership policy is exactly that.
p9649
aVOr to pit it another way: ukip are a protest vote in the euros that will go back to the Tories in the general election.
p9650
aVThe greens are mot tied to Europe, it's not an important part of their manifesto, so their support should remain strong in the general. 
p9651
aVThat would be completely true if we didn't have a first past the post system that causes many Greens to abandon their party to vote tactically in general elections.
p9652
aVHonestly, that's one of their biggest problems, that people so often don't vote for what they want, but against what they don't want.
p9653
aVThat usually means voting Labour or Tory, despite many people considering either of them the second worst option.
p9654
aVThe Euro elections are the real elections, the General Elections are no more important than council elections nowadays.
p9655
aVParty campaign  effort and spending suggests they disagree :)
p9656
aVRubbish.
p9657
aVParliament is still more powerful.
p9658
aVThe British Parliament can write laws.
p9659
aVThe EU Parliament doesn't even have the power to write legislation.
p9660
aVThe real power in the EU lies with the commission, which is chosen, indirectly via General Elections in the member states.
p9661
aV&gt; Last survey I checked had ukip at 15% and the greens at 10% \u000a\u000aReally?
p9662
aVSource?
p9663
aVI may have conflated the two polls here:http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/category/ukip\u000a\u000aThat would assume ukip get the polled 13 for the general and the greens keep their 9 current.
p9664
aVI think that was my thought process, unless there actually was a poll I can't find now
p9665
aV&gt; That would assume ukip get the polled 13 for the general and the greens keep their 9 current.
p9666
aVI think that was my thought process, unless there actually was a poll I can't find now\u000a\u000aIf you look at the detail of that poll it puts the Greens on 4% in the General Election.
p9667
aVThis would obviously be a very good result for them, but not remotely in the UKIP ballpark these days.
p9668
aVYou are the first to ask :) on mobile for next 4 hrs, after that 
p9669
aV&gt; You are the first to ask :) on mobile for next 4 hrs, after that\u000a\u000aTake your time :-) \u000a\u000aI took a look at some recent polls and couldn't see any related to the general election with greens on anything close to 10%.
p9670
aVBecause the media &amp; political establishment see a threat to the status quo from UKIP so are putting a lot of effort into destroying them.
p9671
aVThey're not giving them positive media coverage.
p9672
aVThe greens clearly aren't seen as a threat in the general election and in the EU elections at least they're pro-EU so why would the other pro-EU parties care that much if they do well?
p9673
aVUKIP are the political establishment who will enforce the status quo. 
p9674
aVOr maybe enforce the _status quo ante_ and return us to some imagined pre-1960's rural idyll when women stayed at home, homosexuality was illegal, and Britain still had an empire, a death penalty and pounds, shillings and pence.
p9675
aVActually I think they'd happily take us back to pre-industrial serfdom, before the Reform Act and the Tolpuddle Martyrs started making life difficult for decent, hardworking British landowners who sup pints in tweed jackets and cords.
p9676
aVI don't think you're that far from the truth.
p9677
aV[deleted]
p9678
aV&gt; but personally I believe its an apt punishment for serious crimes e.g.
p9679
aVserial killing, child murder, mass murdering etc.
p9680
aVOf course you do.
p9681
aVRight wingers very rarely have any empathy for human life other than their own in general.
p9682
aVThere's a reason "Right Wing" is known as "sociopath politics".
p9683
aVA very common trend.
p9684
aVDon't need to look at the website - the comments from their Councillors and supporters are more than enough. 
p9685
aV[deleted]
p9686
aVAnd what happens if 6 months after they are killed you find out they are innocent?
p9687
aVI _have_ looked at their web-site, and their manifestos.
p9688
aVNow and in 2010.
p9689
aVSame old Tories.
p9690
aVOkay, an off-shoot of the Tories.
p9691
aVThey don't have an official position on the death penalty - don't want to frighten the voters yet - but in their 2010 election manifesto, they wanted to chip away at maternity leave and make it more difficult for women to maintain a career.
p9692
aVThey also wanted to get rid of the minimum wage and a few other employment rights; but I think they'd have to get the UK to leave the EU to do it.
p9693
aVLimits on working hours, rules about the redundancy process.
p9694
aVAll these protections, UKIP would happily tell you, are forced on us by the EU.
p9695
aVAnd UKIP would cheerfully get rid of them so that employers can be better off and employees worse.
p9696
aVIn 2010 they wanted to replace the current tax bands with a single rate of maybe 25 or 30 percent.
p9697
aVThat's great news for higher-rate tax-payers at 40% or the much talked about 50%, but leaves the lower-paid worse off unless you juggle with the allowance to compensate.
p9698
aVIt's a regressive tax.
p9699
aVYou know who else implented a single rate of tax?
p9700
aVVladimir Putin.
p9701
aVAnd there the rich just got richer.
p9702
aVI know about UKIP.
p9703
aVI know where those ideas come from.
p9704
aVI know where their instincts are.
p9705
aVI know xenophobia when I see it.
p9706
aVMaybe because UKIP has the chance to top all the three traditional parties while not so for the greens???
p9707
aV?
aVIt really doesn't.
p9708
aVIt's barely polling above the Lib Dems for national elections, and most of those are bound to be voters in Tory strongholds.
p9709
aVUKIP won't win many seats, let alone enough to actually pose any serious threat. 
p9710
aVWere talking about the EU parliament elections not the General election.
p9711
aVThe EU parliament election is PR not first past the post.
p9712
aVAnd for the EU elections, UKIP has a chance of achieving a plurality. 
p9713
aVDepends entirely on turnout.
p9714
aVIt'll either be UKIP or Labour that achieves a plurality.
p9715
aVGreens might come out ahead of the Lib Dems.
p9716
aVThis is 100% accurate and yet you get down-voted, sad.
p9717
aVLabour may still well win and I wouldn't be at all surprised if the Greens beat the Lib Dems.
p9718
aVPeople get downvoted for no reason on this subreddit.
p9719
aVKarma doesn't signify a comment's quality any longer.
p9720
aVNot since 4chan has taken over.
p9721
aVMust... silence.... dissent... 
p9722
aVAnd greens will still end up in fourth or fifth place, When any elections in the world are mentioned do you believe that those in fourth and fifth place as somehow more worthy of getting attention then a party that has a chance of getting the most votes?
p9723
aVWhen it's unexpected?
p9724
aVSure.
p9725
aVGods only know we've got more than enough coverage about UKIP.
p9726
aVIt's boring.
p9727
aVLet's spice it up a bit.
p9728
aVIf it's boring then stop listening.
p9729
aVThe quality of political coverage does not correlate with how interesting it is.
p9730
aVEconomics is boring.
p9731
aVBureaucracy is boring.
p9732
aVSocial reform is boring.
p9733
aVVariety for variety's sake is interesting - but a waste of time.
p9734
aVUnless you want equal time delivered to the BNP, because that would be interesting!
p9735
aVBNP coverage would be utterly hilarious.
p9736
aVNational Front, too. 
p9737
aVIf it makes you feel better I also find the coverage for greens in r/UKpolitics, Boring.\u000a\u000a
p9738
aVIt's been mostly UKIP coverage here, there's been a few threads/stories about the Greens but not many you could easily have avoided them.
p9739
aVProblem is the greens aren't really saying anything different of any real consequence.
p9740
aVIt's just "bankers this", "social housing that", whenever they get any publicity they don't really speak much about any policies.
p9741
aVUKIP are sort of similar in that they don't have any policies either but they do go on and on about leaving the EU which people actually want, whereas the green's consistent message is green stuff which nobody cares about. 
p9742
aVI'm not the biggest Greens fan in the world, but clearly you don't know much about them.
p9743
aVThey have quite detailed policies you can find all over the place, probably the most radical out of the big 3 and UKIP, considering their offerings, from the NHS to education.
p9744
aVAgain, not the biggest fan of their nuclear policy and GM crops, but you are right in saying UKIP have absolutely no policies other than anti-EU since Farage disowned the parties' 2010 GE manifesto.
p9745
aVIf you read their rather pitiful offering this year, it has 13ish pages, all but 2 of which are pictures.
p9746
aVOn the two real pages, it basically says "no immigrants, no Europe, no climate change" but in different ways. 
p9747
aVClearly enough people care or they wouldn't be polling ahead of the Lib Dems.
p9748
aV&gt; Clearly enough people care or they wouldn't be polling ahead of the Lib Dems.
p9749
aVYes, but this says a lot more about the Lib Dems than the greens though.
p9750
aVThe polls indicate that the greens are on roughly the same share of the vote and about to get the same number of MEPs (two) as they got last time.
p9751
aVThis story isn't very newsworthy, is it?
p9752
aVThe fact that the Lib Dems drop below the Greens is the story here.
p9753
aVGreens support the idea of basic income.
p9754
aVBetween that and their energy policy we're talking pretty radical social change
p9755
aVBasic income combined with a complete relaxation of all immigration laws sounds like a terrible idea!
p9756
aV&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries.
p9757
aVIn step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.
p9758
aVhttp://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html
p9759
aVIt's pretty economically rational.
p9760
aVWe're economically productive enough to have the bulk of people in artificial jobs like mid management and still have 7% unemployment.
p9761
aVWell they don't shout very loud about it, their members are just too beta i've seen it on Question Time overwhelmingly weak women with no presence or inspiration. 
p9762
aVMeh, I prefer competence over theatrics.
p9763
aVWhen she was on newsnight the basic income was main topic of discussion.
p9764
aVWife reckons she might be the UK Merkel.
p9765
aVI imagine you dislike her too based on presence and inspiration?
p9766
aV:)
p9767
aVDidn't see that newsnight episode and haven't bothered to watch any of Merkel as what's the point? 
p9768
aVUKIP tends to get the turnout on EU elections, as they're basically the only party whose voters actually care about the EU, because they want to leave. 
p9769
aVUKIP are tipped to win in the EU elections, the greens may come 4th.
p9770
aVYou mean the Melon Party?
p9771
aVThere is no Green Party, it's just another useless left-wing pile of shit led by an insane Australian feminist.
p9772
aVThat and they're pro-EU.
p9773
aVYeah that's the one. 
p9774
aVI'm leaning towards voting for them, but I can't get my head around their energy policies.
p9775
aVSociety improves the more abundant and cheap energy is.
p9776
aVWe won't progress by restricting our energy usage, we'll progress by finding new ways to generate previously unheard-of amounts of power, cheaply.
p9777
aVThe green party wants to curtail our energy usage so it'll fit currently available renewables.
p9778
aVWe need to be increasing our energy output (regardless of the generation method used), not reducing it.
p9779
aVThe best way of improving our output at the moment is nuclear.
p9780
aVGreen party is against nuclear, because, it seems, of NIMBY's.
p9781
aVTheir energy policies do, at least, have potential.
p9782
aVHell, Austrailia's Right Wing govt.
p9783
aVjust wiped 90% of climate change funding.
p9784
aVThe Greens could presumably be persuaded over to the idea of nuclear.
p9785
aVTheir support is definitely growing, hardly surging though.
p9786
aVTypical Guardian spewing nonsense.
p9787
aVThe media prefer to talk about a wildcard party which has already had a million voters in one election compared to the Green's 250,000.
p9788
aVSupport may have surged in both, but it's stupid to ignore UKIP's lead.
p9789
aVThe same people who bang on about the Greens getting an MP means they have more support.
p9790
aVNo it doesn't.
p9791
aVYeah because UKIP's lead has been *totally* ignored by the press.
p9792
aVGreens aren't actually much up on their previous EU achievements in polling, it's just that the Lib dem collapse has made them look more important.\u000a\u000a
p9793
aVThey have a blatant disregard for science.
p9794
aVMost parties do, but a party which claims to support Green policies shouldn't have such an obvious disdain for the subject...\u000a\u000a(I'm referring to their nuclear stance in particular, but also GM to a certain extent.
p9795
aV)
aVPsst.
p9796
aVRepost.
p9797
aVTa - first linked here http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/262tm4/green_party_support_is_surging_but_the_media/ as you say, but this post has more comments so I'll leave it here for now.
p9798
aVReddit didn't pick up the repost because the Share function on the Guardian app uses the gu url shortener.
p9799
aVPeople want to read about UKIP because it's dramatic and exciting; if the Greens want some press perhaps they should suggest shooting Graham Norton, or blame crime on the Poles.
p9800
aVBasically what I said, go to a zoo and kick a few of the inmates on live TV, that'll get em UKIP levels of notoriety.
p9801
aV&gt;inmates
p9802
aV'surging' hahaha. 
p9803
aVI'd consider the Greens, but their economic ideas are a joke.
p9804
aVThey seem to be based on a pipedream where we have an economy built entirely on green manufacturing, which we would sell to the world, funded by a self-declared "Robin Hood Tax" which sounds good in principle, but amounts to nothing more than a pensions raid.
p9805
aVThis, of course, doesn't even start to consider that there are factories beyond Dover that could do the same thing and undercut the UK's exports.
p9806
aVIf the world wanted green technology, they would surely either prepare it themselves, or look to emerging nations with affordable rates.
p9807
aVIt would bankrupt the nation in a matter of years.
p9808
aVI also disagree with them on Nuclear Power, which I think is a far more sensible stop-gap until fusion is developed in 20-30 years time, but which is under threat from funding being diverted to renewables research.
p9809
aVThat is the power source of the future, and in my eyes, spending obscene amounts of money on relatively inefficient technologies like wind and solar power (here in the UK, at least) is madness when power consumption rises are outstripping increases in the capability of the board.
p9810
aVUnder Green energy plans, it's either a solar panel and a wind turbine the size of those in wind farms on everyone's roof, or we all go without power for half of the day.
p9811
aVThen there's their shameless "anti-austerity" drive, which echoes the empty nonsense Labour was throwing around at the beginning of the current parliament.
p9812
aVIt's very easy to sound as if you oppose service cuts from the sidelines when you're not the one doing the budgeting, but frankly, the crazy spending plans the Green party advocate would require massive funds which would inevitably require either massive spending cuts elsewhere or debts so eye-watering that they would make New Labour look positively frugal.
p9813
aVI'm an environmentalist, but one with a realistic worldview, and the Greens are fiscal suicide wrapped in a hemp blanket.
p9814
aVThe Green's are simply a think tank.
p9815
aVThey are crazy stupid with some proposals while others are good. 
p9816
aV&gt; until fusion is developed in 20-30 years time\u000a\u000aThis must be irony.
p9817
aVIn case you weren't aware, sustainable net-positive-energy fusion has been "20-30 years away" since the 60s, and it certainly doesn't lack investment.
p9818
aVThe assertion that renewables research is somehow funneling money away from fusion is completely false. 
p9819
aVNice misinformation.
p9820
aVThe "Robin Hood Tax" is a fairly mainstream idea that is backed by most of Europe.
p9821
aV&gt; but amounts to nothing more than a pensions raid.
p9822
aVRubbish.
p9823
aVLabour raided pensions.
p9824
aVThe Robin Hood Tax will be of minimal cost to long term investors like pensions companies. 
p9825
aVI like the greens and I am concerned about environmental issues in the UK especially the fact that my garden is full of plants and trees with blossom on them and not 1 single bee has visited all morning, this scares me a bit since it is blazing sunny and I live in a fielded area in N Worcs with farms around\u000a\u000aBut the truth is they couldn't run a piss up in a brewery.
p9826
aVSad but true
p9827
aVThe problem is, how can you not talk about UKIP?
p9828
aVWhen Nigel Farage goes about publicly spouting his hatred bullshit it's going to be picked up by every news outlet in the country.
p9829
aVI don't understand how he hasn't come under more scrutiny for his remarks about Romanians.
p9830
aVIf any other leader made the comments that he has, they'd be torn apart.
p9831
aVHe knows exactly what he's doing.
p9832
aVWhich is what makes him a very dangerous man.
p9833
aVI think the increasing popularity of the greens with students is a key vote that Lib-Dem won't be getting this time round.
p9834
aVHowever, we should not expect them to sack anti-gm and anti-nuclear yet as, after all, they are the environmentally friendly green party.
p9835
aVThis highlights the lack of parties in UK politics, and suggests the need for a social-democrat party.
p9836
aVI would vote for the greens but like many others I find myself held back by their immigration policy (Or lack of) and their anti-nuclear stance.
p9837
aVThe first point isn't a big deal as any party that isn't anti-EU has no realistic chance of affecting the EU freedom of movement issue.
p9838
aVThe second point is much more of a problem, nuclear is the only hope until we are in a position where renewable energy takes over.  
p9839
aVI'm going to vote for them because of their immigration policy, but like you I don't think much of their energy policy.
p9840
aVIt makes sense to use nuclear as  a stopgap till we get enough renewables up and running. \u000a
p9841
aV&gt;reposting here as other thread is less popular\u000a\u000a\u000ait's only because everyone is talking about ukip.
p9842
aVcan't expect the media to forcememe shit over what people are genuinely giving more attention, even if they are mostly speaking about said topic due to outrage
p9843
aVThe problem is, how can you not talk about UKIP?
p9844
aVWhen Nigel Farage goes about publicly spouting his hatred bullshit it's going to be picked up by every news outlet in the country.
p9845
aVI don't understand how he hasn't come under more scrutiny for his remarks about Romanians.
p9846
aVIf any other leader made the comments that he has, they'd be torn apart.
p9847
aVHe knows exactly what he's doing.
p9848
aVWhich is what makes him a very dangerous man.
p9849
aVI ilke 95% of of the Green partys policies except thier stance on nuclear power which unfortunatly stops me from voting for them.
p9850
aVSo you'd rather vote elsewhere on that 5%?
p9851
aVNot the same guy but it is a big 5%.
p9852
aVWe need nuclear power in order to have any sort of hope of surviving our looming energy crisis.
p9853
aVI agree completely but is it as big as the neoliberal stranglehold we're currently dealing with?
p9854
aVThey'll do more to sort out the energy crisis than any of the main three and definitely more than UKIP.
p9855
aVIf we hadn't privatised our power stations then perhaps we could have used that money to invest in renewable energy.
p9856
aVUKIP want nuclear energy, so how would they do more than UKIP?
p9857
aVBy investing in nationalised renewable energy rather than privatised nuclear energy. 
p9858
aVRenewable energy isn't nearly productive enough to start using en masse yet.
p9859
aVOnly because not much money has been invested in renewable energy.
p9860
aVIt's hard to make money from it.
p9861
aVI don't agree with the Green Party in terms of nuclear power or GM foods.
p9862
aVHowever, I do feel that their economic plan and their alternative energy solution could very easily work, not only that but I think they are improvements on our current system.
p9863
aVEspecially if we take offshore windfarms and hydroelectricity into consideration.
p9864
aVI suspect you agree with less than 80% of the policies with all other parties...\u000a\u000a95% is pretty damn high.
p9865
aVThe Greens vote on all their policies, the more support they get that is against a policy such as Nuclear or GM, the easier it is to change that policy.
p9866
aVBasically, don't give up on them just yet. 
p9867
aVDo you like &gt;95% of the policies of another party?
p9868
aVIt's a bad point, but it's one point.
p9869
aVHow many aspects of all the other parties make you queasy? 
p9870
aV&gt;...partys policies except **their** stance on... \u000a\u000aFTFY Guradem :)\u000a\u000a*Please don't hate me.
p9871
aVI'm only a simple bot trying to make a living.
p9872
aV*
aVThey've got my vote tomorrow.
p9873
aVSeem to be the most legitimate.
p9874
aVI don't agree with all their policies, but of all the parties to vote for, they seem to be the best.
p9875
aVThe greens are a load of idiots.
p9876
aVThey shouldnt be trusted to run a lemon stall let alone a country.....
p9877
aVI'm voting Green for locals, I was very impressed by their manifesto. 
p9878
aVInteresting to see that we're also very low on the rankings for actual spending on healthcare, when the mantra over the last few years has been that the NHS is bloated with spending and is inefficient.
p9879
aVWait a minute.... so you're telling me the Torys would just lie about one of our greatest assets we have.
p9880
aVI wonder why. 
p9881
aV&gt;I wonder why\u000a\u000a\u000aI smell a bargain...
p9882
aVIt can be both.
p9883
aVIt *is* bloated and inefficient, but it's also much less bloated and inefficient than other health care systems.
p9884
aVDamn the Tories for wanting to cut waste.
p9885
aVJust go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9886
aV&gt;Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9887
aVI've had many, always I was just in and out in 10 minutes, test results come back the next week.
p9888
aVIs there something wrong with that?
p9889
aVUh, I ordered three blood tests today and got the results to the patients within two hours.
p9890
aVI'm not sure where this inefficiency is but it's hiding itself very well.
p9891
aVIt may be hiding in the break room browsing reddit with me I guess.
p9892
aVClever bastard.
p9893
aVWell I've found the opposite.
p9894
aVI guess some run smoothly and others don't.
p9895
aVSo would it not be a good idea to have a shake up, make sure everyone gets the same service whichever hospital they may visit. 
p9896
aVSure, more healthcare spending sounds good to me.
p9897
aVMaybe *you're* the inefficiency.
p9898
aVDun dun dunnnnn!
p9899
aV&gt; Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is\u000a\u000aWhat do you mean?
p9900
aVI've had many, unfortunately. \u000a

aVI have done this many times.
p9906
aVYou sit in the waiting room for a bit, then get called in (they are often running a little late), they take your blood, you leave.
p9907
aVThinking that cutting only "gets rid of the inefficient bits" is such an utterly moronic viewpoint.
p9908
aVIt hurts everything.
p9909
aVPrivatising only makes it worse because the people who it's sold it to don't give a *fuck* about making it better, they just burn and get the fuck out.
p9910
aVThey don't want to cut waste, they want to cut its throat and give the profits to friends and future colleagues. 
p9911
aVlol yeah that's right.
p9912
aVAs we speak Cameron and his mates are sat at a table wondering how best they can profit from privatisation.  
p9913
aVYou mean like they did with Royal Mail?
p9914
aVYou truly believe that too, don't you?
p9915
aVWhy does the left assume they're all mates plotting for each other rather than just "British business", which by the way, fuels all the public sector. 
p9916
aVBecause often when such sales occur government advisors &amp; friends mysteriously make a killing. 
p9917
aVWell a lot of them did go to school together...
p9918
aVPeople don't like to hear of others making money from an opportunity they have missed.
p9919
aVThey need to blame. 
p9920
aVLabour almost managed to privatise it too. 
p9921
aV&gt; Damn the Tories for wanting to cut ~~waste~~ services.
p9922
aVFTFY
p9923
aV&gt; Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9924
aVI do.
p9925
aVRegularly.
p9926
aVI'm in, done and out most times within 15 minutes and I've often not even had to wait.
p9927
aVPerhaps you're getting yours done at a hospital and competing with the in-patients that all need bloods done as a matter of urgency?
p9928
aV&gt; Just go for a blood test in the NHS for a demonstration of how stupidly inefficient it is.
p9929
aVI don't think you know how blood tests are processed.
p9930
aVYour GP has to dispatch them to the haematology laboratory (which is often the largest hospital within your NHS trust), where it will be examined based on how urgent it has been marked.
p9931
aVIn an emergency, the sample will be bumped to the top of the pile and the results will be with your GP (and therefore you) within an hour of the laboratory receiving them.
p9932
aVAny delay is during shipment.
p9933
aVNHS trusts have been consolidating all the labwork over the past decade or so.
p9934
aVBloodwork is one of the most efficient parts of the NHS, especially within hospitals.
p9935
aVThat's the way, don't let facts get in the way of good rhetoric.
p9936
aVHave you tried doing that in any other healthcare system?
p9937
aVIt sucks
p9938
aVShhhh.
p9939
aVWe're not allowed to complain!
p9940
aVI couldn't see where they got the figures from and I'd be interested to see if they include our massive PFI bills.
p9941
aVYeah, Tories gonna spin bollocks to try to privatise it.
p9942
aVAnd labour will just pile up the debt to make it sound like they are doing something in throwing money at it, but not really caring how.
p9943
aVSo we still get more private involvement in the NHS (it didn't start under the current government and won't end under it), plus shit PFI deals which mean we don't own the hospitals we are paying for, and billions wasted on shit IT schemes.
p9944
aVWe spend quite a low amount on the NHS.
p9945
aVThe labour mistakes weren't overspending on the NHS, they were idiotic PFI schemes which leach what little money we do spend on the NHS.
p9946
aVThe debt is largely caused by the financial crash, not by spending policies.
p9947
aVThis is the same mistaken complaint made in almost every economy affected.
p9948
aVHell, the american right even blame a government which wasn't in power at the time for the debt!!
p9949
aV!
aVThe issue is not the crash, boom and bust is to be expected in a capitalist economy.
p9950
aVThe issue is that governments failed to prepare.
p9951
aVLabour were among the worst, with Brown going so far as to announce the end of 'tory boom and bust'.
p9952
aVAs such they ramped up spending and debt through the boom years (the national debt doubled under Labour) and come the inevitable bust we were left with a large deficit, made up in no small part of interest payments on the debt which should have been paid down in the boom years.
p9953
aVIt's not just a UK problem, many governments saw spending increases as good vote winners in the boom years, and ignored the coming bust, safe in the knowledge that they'd be long gone before it came time to deal with the problems they were storing up.
p9954
aVI wouldn't say Labour threw money at it.
p9955
aVThey increased spending because it had been so badly underfunded by the Tories, but all it that meant was that the UK caught up to the other couple of really badly funded countries while remaining at or near last place.
p9956
aVWe spend quite a low amount on the NHS.
p9957
aVThe labour mistakes weren't overspending on the NHS, they were idiotic PFI schemes which leach what little money we do spend on the NHS.
p9958
aVLabour (Under Tony Blair) set the ball in motion to privatise parts of the NHS.
p9959
aVWhy does this "Tories want to privatise the NHS" meme still go on?
p9960
aVIt's ridiculous.
p9961
aVAre you saying the Tories don't want to privatise the NHS?
p9962
aVI'm saying that if anyone wants to privatise the NHS, it's not exclusively the Tories.
p9963
aVIf there's a movement to say "Lets outsource some parts of the NHS, like we do in almost every other part of government", then it's not exclusively a Tory lead campaign to line their rich buddies pockets.
p9964
aVPersonally, I think there's massive sections of the NHS that could be privatised well, providing far better value for money for the tax payer.
p9965
aV&gt; "Lets outsource some parts of the NHS, like we do in almost every other part of government"\u000a\u000aTo g4S and Fujitsu and all those other fellows not cocking things up at all?\u000a
p9966
aVThere have been some bad privatisation, and quite a lot of very good privatisation.
p9967
aVWhen was the last time you were without water because of a strike for example?
p9968
aVHow about bins not being collected?
p9969
aVI live in Scotland where the water is publicly owned, it is a more expensive system to run due to the rurality and yet is the cheapest in the uk.
p9970
aVI have never went without water because of a strike.
p9971
aVDont you remember when they went on strike, and when Robo-Scargill went on the rampage and was shooting laser beams out of his eyes?, not being hysterical or anything....
p9972
aVMeanwhile privatised water in the UK is just fantastic.
p9973
aV&gt; How about bins not being collected?

VFreedom of choice.
p11182
aVMy ass.
p11183
aVIt's a perfect example of the conservative concept of choice - you can choose whatever you want, but you pay if you choose "incorrectly"...
p11184

p11188
aVA perpetual spirit of revival pervades the campus.
p11189
aVYou're being unfairly downvoted, but the title *is* true.
p11190

p11193
aVLiberty University sounds awful.

p11195
aVA few highlights:\u000a\u000a&gt; they would be fined [...] Not as much as they would be fined for possessing R-rated movies or practicing witchcraft\u000a\u000a&gt; The university, founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell, requires its 13,500 residential students to attend as many as three events each week as part of a program called Convocation...
p11196
aVSo... if you go to school there you know what the hell you're in for.

p11199
aVoops, 'math' must have been in that last year of college he missed

aVGenuinely fucking scary.
p11214
aVI don't see how the U.S. stays unridiculed by politicians in public on an international stage.
p11215
aVSeriously, as someone not from the U.S. and kinda sorta left leaning I suppose, the current administration is the least cringe-inducing in a long time.
p11216
aVOr, okay, Bush was a buffoon. 
p11217
aVI'm a not American, and totally agree .
p11218
aVI see the Republican attitude as selfish, greedy and pathetic .... 'I'm alright Jack !
p11219
aV'\u000a\u000aIs it true that the actual 'workers' only legally  have 4 paid for days holiday a year ?

aVNo.
p11224
aVYou should have to submit to one regardless of political party.
p11225
aVDemocrats are no better than republicans, they just have different view points when it comes to certain things.

aVThe best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.
p11227
aVRepublicans really represent all that is bad in modern American society.
p11228
aVThey are a force ranged against civilisation.
p11229
aVAnd Democrats display what is wrong in most of the rest of the "civilized" world.

p11233
aVThat's sadly unfortunate.

aVHer life just got fifty shades more complicated.
p11235
aVThankfully her family is [pretty well off](http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/summary.php?year=2011&amp;cid=n00030245), and that should help a lot with the cost of raising a child... \u000a\u000aWe don't (and likely never will) know the full story here... she may very well have attempted to prevent the pregnancy through recognized and approved forms of birth-control... but the irony is palatable.
p11236
aVHAHAHAHAHA!

aVNow, now..this is personal, family business and not the business of that filthy Press, donchaknow?
p11238
aVBut the GOP is also trying to kill USPS...WTF is his plan if the republicans are successful.

aVThey just haven't found the secret servers in his basement yet. 
p11242
aVThis is one of the few times I believe the swill that flows from him.
p11243
aV"The emails had been run through private accounts controlled by the Republican National Committee"
p11244
aVIs this somehow justification for Hillary's latest law breaking?
p11245
aVnope its just a little context as a side dish for your misplaced outrage
p11246
aVFunny.
p11247
aVI told my friend last night it's all stupid and if that's all they got it will work in Hillary's favor and that they should leave it alone.
p11248
aVSo much outrage huh.
p11249
aVNow I'm just mad that Hillary and Bush have even more in common.
p11250
aVHa.
p11251
aVAnd they try to call her a *Democrat.
p11252
aV*
aVWitholding emails has nothing to do with party affiliation. 
p11253
aVNo laws were broken from my understanding.
p11254
aVThe law didn't kick in until she was no longer Sec.
p11255
aVof State.
p11256
aVLike 1.5 years later actually.
p11257
aVIt's just another faux-scandal like Benghazi that conservatives are desperately trying to use to besmirch her name. 
p11258
aVI'm on year 3 of being out of school, working full time, and I can't even pay for a full semester.
p11259
aVMy yearly salary is about a year of a top law school.
p11260
aVLiving expenses, insurance, gas and all?
p11261
aVNope. 
p11262
aVyup.
p11263
aVI started College in 64, tuition was 32 dollars a Semester, in 68 when I graduated it was 150 dollars.
p11264
aVIn California back then some schools were tuition free...and those days had many young people questioning things like the Viet Nam war and The "establishment"---since that time, college became more expensive and the "man" the "establishment" found a way to limit education simply by making it into another investment for profit business for the rich.
p11265
aVHasn't been very many good student protests nor student picketing on injustices and politics since then has there?
p11266
aVThe rich don't mind "technical skills"---they truly don't want Liberal Arts Majors questioning the status quo.
p11267
aVStudents can no longer afford to think freely and act on their beliefs---they're too busy trying to keep their heads above the water.
p11268
aVMission Accomplished! \u000a
p11269
aV&gt;the meme\u2019s only notable failing has to do with overly broad wording\u000a\u000aIT'S A FUCKING MEME!
p11270
aVI feel like this same thing has happened like 4 times already.
p11271
aVEither that or I'm having some serious déjà vu.
p11272
aVI thought that also.
p11273
aVA quick google found at least one other incident from a couple of years ago.
p11274
aVhttp://littlegreenfootballs.com/page/289412_McCain_Skipped_a_Briefing_on_B
p11275
aVHis aides probably told him the read-aheads didn't answer the question that he wanted answered
p11276
aVAides are a dime a dozen and a sorry excuse when leadership is requested.
p11277
aVIf McCain gave a shit, like he is supposed to, he should have been in that briefing, should have listed what he didn't like, should list what he wants to know.
p11278
aVBut he knows he is just dicking around to spin the talking heads in Fox.
p11279
aVAt this point McCain is a burden on American tax payers.
p11280
aVclearly you don't know how Congress works.
p11281
aVYou have no conception of how complex the Federal government is and how much oversight members of Congress have.
p11282
aVThey could not theoretically read through the amount of materials that they have to read through.
p11283
aVThey could not even come close.
p11284
aVIf its' that complex, then why is McFuckalls and the rest of the republican hyenas harping off in the media?
p11285
aVHe's been there over 30 years, he should know better than to mouth off like a frat chick on a xanax overdose.
p11286
aVTheoretically?
p11287
aVWhat fucking excuse is that?
p11288
aVHe is not being asked to read.
p11289
aVHe is being asked to get his ass in there and listen.
p11290
aVIf he has time to harp on fox news, which takes more time and effort than listening, then he has no excuses.
p11291
aVThe testimonies are a show.
p11292
aVThe real answers are always submitted in writing.
p11293
aVThat's not what he said.
p11294
aVWouldn't having people with affordable health care be better for the economy?
p11295
aVOr are the conservative reps like our liberal party in Australia, they have to repeal anything labor did since it is a labor thing, even if it is a worthwhile policy! 
p11296
aVRepublicans in America need no more than the "Obama likes it" mention, in order to oppose it.
p11297
aVObama has become their standard of hate.
p11298
aVTheir hate for President Obama is greater than their love for the country, or for any sense of reason at all.
p11299
aVRepublicans are the deranged copilot in our American flight.

p11303
aVyea, like that shit's gonna happen.
p11304
aVRegardless of what type of treaty, it starts with the Executive branch.
p11305
aV* Legally-binding treaties (described in the US Constitution) require 2/3 Supermajority of the US Senate to ratify.
p11306
aV* Merely politically-binding treaties (which do not change the law, nor have the force of it) can be ratified by a majority of both houses (congressional-executive agreements) or can be something agreed to only by the executive branch (sole-executive agreements).
p11307
aVThere was a good article by Peter Weber on [The Week's, Speed Reads](http://theweek.com/speedreads/543362/irans-foreign-minister-explains-international-law-senate-republicans ) that described why this letter was so bad to essentially say "Nya, Nya, We aren't going to do diddly once the people you're negotiating with leaves office!
p11308
aV"\u000a\u000a&gt;Iran's foreign minister ultimately dismissed the GOP letter as having "no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.
p11309
aV" But it also gives some propaganda ammunition to Zarif and Iran, notes Akbar Shahid Ahmed at [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/09/tom-cotton-zarif-letter_n_6835538.html ).
p11310
aVZarif used "the GOP misstep to seize an advantage that the Obama administration has said it does not want to give Iran: the chance to say the nuclear negotiations could fail because of the U.S."
p11311
aVFrom what I've heard, the Logan Act is generally considered to be overruled by the First Amendment, and only hasn't been stricken because no one has been prosecuted with it since the very early 1800s.
p11312
aVAs if the democrats had the backbone required to enforce the law.
p11313
aVOh they do.
p11314
aVBut under this administration it's not about backbone, it's about partisanship and they have played that card so hard that they can't do high profile arrests or risk exposure.
p11315
aVWho is responsible for prosecution?
p11316
aVCongress or the Attorney General? 
p11317
aV&gt;who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government \u000a\u000aI'm pretty sure it could be concluded in some way that congress IS the authority of the United States

p11321
aVThat spineless wonder in the White House is going to stand up to a GOP Congress.
p11322
aVHave they?
p11323
aVThe act says:  "who, without authority of the United States".
p11324
aVIsn't the house and Senate part of the U.S. government?
p11325
aVI would think this act would apply only to private citizens not representatives of any branch of government.
p11326
aVOf course, I'm no lawyer and admit that I know nothing about the previous application of this law.
p11327
aVHas anyone ever been prosecuted and/or convicted under it?
p11328
aVIt's more than that, House and Senate make the laws, that is what they exist for.
p11329
aVTherefore they have authority.
p11330
aVSomewhere along the lines people have apparently forgotten that the president is not the authority, he is the executor of the law and in fact has to get authorization from congress to do just about anything he wants to do.
p11331
aVIn theory yes, but President's usually take the helm in Foreign Policy only getting congressional approval for committing troops,as Commander in Chief he has 90 days to get done what he wants beyond that he needs approval. 
p11332
aVOh, the President definitely takes the helm with Foreign Policy.
p11333
aVThat does not mean he is the only one who can/does.
p11334
aVCongress can, they just don't as a matter of diplomatic etiquette.
p11335
aVSo while they can do what they did, it definitely is a diplomatic wtf.
p11336
aVThe president does however need congressional approval for much more than troops when it comes to foreign affairs.
p11337
aVWhile the pres can meet with whoever he wants whenever he wants, he can't enter into agreements or treaties without congressional approval.
p11338
aVWhich is what the dope-head republicans are basically telling the world.
p11339
aVHey Iran, he is going to say he is doing this treaty with you guys, but it isn't official cuz we didn't say it was so it can be taken away from you at any time by any president for any reason.
p11340
aVHave a nice day.
p11341
aVA shitty thing for them to do, but not against any laws or acts, just against the norm.
p11342
aVThat's exactly what I was trying to say but some people in this thread seem to think he can act unilaterally in Foreign Policy...
p11343
aVExactly
p11344
aVYou are incorrect.
p11345
aVNot exactly sure what you are so eloquently debating.
p11346
aVThat the house and senate makes the laws?
p11347
aVThat the house and senate have authority?
p11348
aVThat the president is not the authority?
p11349
aVThat the president is not the executor of law?
p11350
aVor that the president has to get authorization from congress for most things he wants to get done?
p11351
aVBecause unfortunately, They do, they do, he isn't (at least not the sole authority, maybe that is your hang up), he is, he does.
p11352
aVSo not really sure what you believe is incorrect?\u000a

p11360
aVIs this good or bad news
p11361
aVIt's good politically that Republicans are showing themselves so subservient to the wealthy and their hypocritical disdain for a level playing field in a supposedly free market.

aV(I'm a bot)\u000a*****\u000a&gt; After years of GOP attacks on the inheritance tax, also known as the estate tax, only a few thousand of the wealthiest families are subjected to it - 4,700 total in 2013, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
p11366
aV&gt; The legislation wouldn&amp;#039;t just eliminate the estate tax - it would also allow heirs to escape the already-generous capital gains tax on any stocks and real estate they receive.
p11367
aV&gt; The estate tax is even more regressive, applying to just 0.2 percent of estates a year, at an average effective rate of less than 17 percent, since millions of dollars of the inheritance are exempted from the formal 40 percent rate.

aVwhy do I get the feeling that the republican party is going to follow his lead on this?
p11393
aVjesus christ do we really need another era of famine and disease because of these anti-vaxxers?
p11394
aVI feel like this should not be a choice; that vaccination should be compulsory. 
p11395
aVWhen science is no longer manipulated to support vaccinations; when the toxic crap like mercury is removed; when the legit concerns and fears are addressed instead of blithely waved off, then I might agree that getting vaccinated is a social obligation.
p11396
aVRight now it's more like rolling the dice with your health.
p11397
aVMercury has been removed from almost all vaccines since 2001.
p11398
aVAny vaccine that still contains [a small amount of] mercury have Ethyl Mercury, which your body pisses out.
p11399
aVThe harmful mercury found in fish is Methyl Mercury.
p11400
aVPeople freak out that vaccines have formaldehyde, which is true, they do.
p11401
aVBUT your body naturally produces a LOT more than is even ingested through a vaccine.
p11402
aVSo that's a completely non-issue.
p11403
aVVaccines also can't give you the flu/measles/mumps/whatever.
p11404
aVI believe that they USED to be able to, when people were injected with active versions of infections/diseases.
p11405
aVToday, we're given inactive, or dead, version of the virus and it cannot affect you.
p11406
aVVaccines cause autism?
p11407
aVAbsolutely not.
p11408
aVThe guy that pioneered the idea, [Andrew Wakefield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), was outed for completely fudging his data, was paid a LOT of money (read: took a bribe) to testify in a lawsuit against MMR vaccinations and then applied for patents on his own vaccines.
p11409
aVHe was a scumbag that lied about everything to make money and was stripped of his medical licenses.
p11410
aVLiterally, the only negatives are redness, itching or swelling in the immediate area of the injection - and that clearly goes away.
p11411
aVThank you for the info.
p11412
aVDo you have anything to cast doubt on what [this doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efto1LpWkKw) says?

p11419
aVNow it is 1 in 50.
p11420
aV" Is this true?
p11421
aVIs so, what is causing it?
p11422
aVI honestly don't know if vaccines are causing autism or the array of other conditions attributed to them.
p11423
aVI don't know if the many experts who claim it is junk science are correct.
p11424
aVBut I think there are enough questions raised and evidence given to **respect parents who are trying to protect their children.

aVThis Humphries lady is full of shit.
p11427
aVLet's start...\u000a\u000a&gt; "There has never been a safe vaccination"\u000a\u000aThis is utterly absurd.
p11428
aVVaccinations are why the world is why small pox does not exist, measles and mumps have been 99% eradicated and whooping cough is down by 81%.
p11429
aVVaccinations.
p11430
aVThat's the only reason.
p11431
aV&gt; "it thwarts the immune system into a balance that's very unnatural and leaves it susceptible to ... more things ..." ???
p11432
aVThis is, for example, one of those many, many times she just rambles off some vague nonsense with out a single detail or point to back up this claim.
p11433
aV&gt; "...combined with all the chemicals and antibiotics, things that manufacturing companies may not know about"\u000a\u000aWTF is this shit?
p11434
aVThese vaccines are made so precisely and in an extremely calculated manner.
p11435
aVThey don't just throw random shit and chemicals in a vial and ship it out.
p11436
aV&gt; ... some nonsense about how the metallic needle affects the way our cells react to the vaccine and its chemicals\u000a\u000aThis is a completely made up concern.
p11437
aVNot once has a modern day needle been questioned to alter the affect of any injection.
p11438
aV&gt; "if people are really seeing each other dropping dead of smallpox"\u000a\u000aDoes she know what smallpox is?
p11439
aVGoogle it.
p11440
aVIt's killed hundreds of millions of people.
p11441
aV&gt; "... and they were really seeing each other being saved by a smallpox vaccine, the line would be out of town"\u000a\u000aKeep googling smallpox.
p11442
aVBecause due to a very successful wide-spread vaccination, it has been declared completely eradicated in 1979.
p11443
aVIt's been 2:30 and everything this lady has said so far is complete bullshit.
p11444
aVI'm not watching this anymore and will take a look at the other videos.
p11445
aVedit: she's also a proponent of homeopathy, which has absolutely no evidence of working in the medical world.
p11446
aVHomeopathy is complete bullshit.
p11447
aVI agree with everything except your last sentence.
p11448
aVPlacebo does have very positive effects, and you cannot just give a sugar pill otherwise people will not buy into the idea that it helps to cure.
p11449
aVSo in that sense IMO homeopathy does provide a positive effect. 
p11450
aVSeems you can\u000a&gt;[Not only did we make it absolutely clear that these pills had no active ingredient and were made from inert substances, but we actually had 'placebo' printed on the bottle](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/22/us-placebo-idUSTRE6BL4IU20101222)

aVI always thought that more expensive ones worked better:\u000ahttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080304173339.htm
p11453
aVI read somewhere that bigger pills work better than smaller ones and an injection is even more effective.
p11454
aVI was about to leave this, after a few minutes of the second lady, but started watching the 3rd one.
p11455
aVThis one actually makes a point withing the first couple minutes (I'm only a little more than a minute in right now).
p11456
aVI haven't looked into this CDC / Merck, but I believe it and it's not surprising at all.
p11457
aVThis happens all the time with huge companies like this.
p11458
aVLook at Comcast... their high ups are all over the regulatory boards.
p11459
aVThey're greedy fucks that pay to have things their way, to make them more rich.
p11460
aVIt's fucked up that the medical (and every other industry) are corrupted by the wealthy.
p11461
aVIn order to get a drug even considered for FDA approval, you need a LOT of money and a lot of time.
p11462
aVI'd bet that more money = less money spent waiting.
p11463
aVBut anyway, it's fucked up and no one agrees with the system.
p11464
aVBut back to the original point... this has no affect on the effectiveness of vaccines.
p11465
aVAnd no matter what these people say and believe, there's is extremely little evidence (none, literally) that they are harmful and A SHITTON of evidence that they are effective and necessary.
p11466
aVI was vaccinated as a child and turned out fine.
p11467
aVOf course, the vaccines were created differently back then, and we didn't get as many of them ... and they started later in life.
p11468

p11469
aVMy guess is that a subset of the population is intolerant to some vaccines, but to study and identify who they are, first a problem has to be acknowledged.
p11470
aVIt's sorta like when the tobacco industry denied that smoking causes cancer.
p11471
aVI remember the Congressional hearing where all those CEOs sat there and flat out denied it.

aVThen the trial lawyers pried more documents out of those companies that showed they knew very well that smoking causes cancer.

aVThe debate changes when faced with people whose children got sick right after getting vaccinated.
p11475
aVInfants *should* get vaccinated, because they're at highest risk of dying from these diseases.
p11476
aVThe risk of dying from the disease is hundreds of times higher than any problems from a vaccine.
p11477
aVThat's like saying we shouldn't put seat belts on kids because they risk choking from the belt around their necks.

aV&gt; vaccines were created differently back then\u000a\u000aYeah, they were.
p11480
aVThey were created with active versions of the virus and a ton of mercury.
p11481
aV&gt; Now infants are getting vaccinated, and that's just wrong\u000a\u000aHow?
p11482
aVPoint me to a credible source that proves vaccines are bad for infants.
p11483
aV&gt; My guess is that a subset of the population is intolerant to some vaccines\u000a\u000aIs this based on any fact whatsoever?

aVThe second lady...\u000a\u000a&gt; "vaccine safety studies are short; they're inconclusive; they don't go on for a long period of time.
p11485
aVAll the studies are performed on children who are not ill..."\u000a\u000aThe length of a drug or vaccine clinical trial varies greatly, often (usually?
p11486
aV) lasting years.
p11487
aVIn cases of outbreak (ebola, etc) they're done much faster for obvious reason.
p11488
aVThe FDA doesn't release drugs with "inconclusive" results.
p11489
aVAnd trials have a wide variety of test subjects.
p11490
aVThey're tested in a lab, then usually on animals, before testing a very small set of people, followed by a larger set, sometimes (not always) using children, if the vaccine will apply to children.

aVStill, I hope people rally around this case and affect some real change.

aVThis sort of thing has been happening all too often.
p11505
aV&gt;if there was no video here, there would have been no murder indictment\u000a\u000aExactly why cops hate cameras, and exactly why they are so needed.  
p11506
aVNope, only when there absolute indisputable evidence in the public domain.
p11507
aVOtherwise it is your word against a the police, and juries are instructed to believe a cop. 
p11508
aVYup.
p11509
aVThat's why cameras are so very important.
p11510
aVIf someone sees something like this happening shoot the video and get it into the public domain ASAP.
p11511
aVThis story tells you that it works. 
p11512
aVwait 24 to 48 hours for the Police and city officals to file their reports and make statements to the public.
p11513
aVLet them dig the hole first. 
p11514
aVWhat we need is a breakthrough case in which a cop is actually convicted in a situation like this one where the main evidence is a video.
p11515
aVThat will change things.

aVYeah.
p11550
aVHe must have been special in some way.
p11551
aVHopefully he was special academically (like he skipped the third grade) and it was not because he was a Congressman's son.

aVSince teens don't need to be accompanied by an adult to obtain contraceptives at the facilities, critics say the initiative undermines parental rights.

aVOnce a kid/teenager is making the adult decision to have intercourse, I'm not sure that "parental rights" really apply to that region of their kid.

aVQuite understandably, this is killing an entire generation's love of reading.

aVAnd your solution is to add porn.

aVEveryone with two brain cells knows we haven't had an outbreak like this in the US until those illegal children came across the border and were spread around the country by Obama.

aVHe is 267 pounds.

aVI see a lot of bad cop videos and am just as outraged as anyone else but this video did not seem like a whole lot of wrongdoing, he tased her and she hit her head and now she has died.
p11622
aVthe same thing could have happened if she were tackled by him for running away and hit her head.
p11623
aVthe girl was moving (albeit not very well) after the tasing and he did not continue to tase once she hit the ground (ops title suggests he tased her *until* she became vegetative and that is simply not true.
p11624
aVI dont see the outcome of this being much different if the cop was in good shape and just chased her down either because most likely (watched a few cop takedown videos in my time) he would have just tackled her and it appears it was her head injury that killed her.
p11625
aVanyone else have any other info on if it was the actual taser that killed her or if it was the head injury?
p11626
aV[Here](http://youtu.be/ZrDox4wYBlQ?t=35s) is the video after skipping past the overly dramatic introduction

aVLet her run.
p11628
aVLet Eric Brown walk away.
p11629
aVThese people don't have to die for minor offenses.
p11630
aVThey can be tracked down later and arrested if necessary.
p11631
aVIn most of these cases these are not inherently violent or dangerous people.
p11632
aVAnd they'd probably turn themselves in once that rush of adrenalin is gone.
p11633
aVInstead we have cases like this where a stupid girl who isn't a danger to anyone gets shocked like a rabid dog.
p11634
aVIt's unnecessary however it IS the current mentality that's pretty pervasive in a very authoritarian America.
p11635
aVWe tell officers that letting someone walk away is basically a guarantee of social anarchy and dead cops on every street corner.
p11636
aVWhich is, of course, not true.
p11637
aVIt's clickbait.
p11638
aVThe title says he tasered her until she passed into a vegetative state which is just objectively false.
p11639
aVHe tazed her one time and she fell and hit her head, the force of which led to brain damage.
p11640
aVWhile this is depressingly tragic, and I certainly think the officer could've avoided the use of his tazer, the title posted here on reddit and the article and video are disingenuously misleading and clearly driven by agenda.

aVIf the Corporations won't accept responsibility, then the People need to and they need to hold them responsible.
p11649
aVI seriously doubt any American would object to the Government doing that...
p11650
aVWhy should good god fearing philanthropists like the Koch brothers have to be responsible for cleaning their own mess?
p11651
aVThat's what government is for, right?
p11652
aVShouldn't all those peons who benefited from the Koch brother's immensity foot the bill for cleaning this shit of theirs up?
p11653
aVThey should see it as the honor and privilege it is.

aVhaving to clean  up your mess isnt an unnecessary risk, getting cancer and other ailments is however.

p11664
aVSo what's the straw manning outrage over?
p11665
aVWhat they should really do, and all newspapers around the western world should do, is publish Charlie Hedbo cartoons, all on the same day.
p11666
aVIt would be such a wonderful show of solidarity, as well as a collective FY to those who would try to suppress creative and political expression.

aVWhen Larry Flynt was shot by someone upset by all the interracial porn he published, the response wasn't to publish the same porn everywhere.
p11670
aVIt's not necessary to the reporting.
p11671
aVSecond, while I'm livid at these terrorists, publishing the Hebo cartoons isn't going to just "stick it to the terrorists," but also offend millions of peaceful law-abiding Muslims.
p11672
aVIf I hated Al Sharpton or Obama, using the N word on him is going to offend more than just him.
p11673
aVLet's mock the terrorists directly and endlessly rather than go after too broad a target. 
p11674
aVI agree.
p11675
aVEven though **no one** deserves violence for expressing their free speech, that depiction of mohammed is clearly offensive to many muslims.

aVI think this would have been better than omitting it:\u000a\u000aFox "News"
p11707
aVFox is only "News" between 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. on weekdays.
p11708
aVThe rest is classed as "Opinion" which I think allows them to sidestep news reporting regulations.
p11709
aVApparently their own terms describe their channel as "for entertainment purposes"

aVI love the part where he says "I mean I don't care...." yes... yes you do.. or you wouldn't be complaining about it.
p11719
aVI find it funny that whenever there's a nuance against anything right-wing and/or Fox "News" they bitch about it.
p11720
aVIf it happens to anything/anyone else, they bitch about how that entity of overacting.  
p11721
aVWar is a large part of American culture, it's one of the reasons the US government can get away with committing frivolous acts of violence around the world, including convincing these people in uniform to go along with it.
p11722
aVEither way, the article's author is correct, using the term hero to paint "the troops" does make people sound dumb.
p11723
aVSince the Nixon administration "support our troops" has essentially been a political weapon to quickly kill all real discussion of war (which would involve real criticism, including civilian deaths) and make everyone fall into line.
p11724
aVIt's truly odd and sinister in a country where contempt for soldiers and the military is practically non-existent except in fringe far-right and far-left groups.
p11725
aVIt's practically the beginning and end to any thought certain people put into military conflicts our country engage in: "No matter what, you have to support the troops.

aVHa!
p11766
aVThey reprinted half the book in that article.
p11767
aVWhat's the context?
p11768
aVToo many to choose from, [this](http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/) is the one I found most disgusting.
p11769
aV"Savage despicable evil.
p11770
aVThat's what we were fighting in Iraq.
p11771
aV" One of the first quotes in the article.
p11772
aVCan't say I disagree with that assessment.
p11773
aVThere are valid arguments about should we have been there, did our presence create Al Qaeda in Iraq .
p11774
aVOne thing you can't argue is Al Qaeda in Iraq (which became ISIS) is pretty fucking evil. 
p11775
aVWhats the proper context for him saying how much fun he had killing people?
p11776
aVFantastic point that is at the heart of my original post.
p11777
aVMy impression Chris Kyle has a genuine hatred for the people he was fighting, Al Qaeda in Iraq and later ISIS.
p11778
aVI don't think hate is a good thing but I've never walked in his shoes and don't feel like I can sit in judgment on him.
p11779
aVWhere this article becomes propaganda is in it's perversion of the direction of this hatred.
p11780
aVHe hated people that beheaded civilians and raped children, not Arabs, not Muslims, not civilians, not "people" just trying to get by.
p11781
aVThe author tries to link Muslim extremist as just regular people, "Arab" being her preferred word.
p11782
aVI believe there are many Arabs and members of the Muslim community that would [strongly dispute any such association](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30769681) with Al Qaeda in Iraq or ISIS.
p11783
aVWe can argue over words but my impression is he didn't have fun killing "people".
p11784
aVHe hated "Savage despicable evil" and probably did enjoyed killing those monsters.
p11785
aVThe fact that the author intentionally tries to blur those lines is what makes it propaganda.
p11786
aVedit: Posting the right link this time.

aV:)
p11788
aVThe Facebook graphic by OurTime.org claimed, "There is no state in the U.S. where a 40-hour minimum wage work week is enough to afford a two-bedroom apartment.
p11789
aV" **The group left out a key distinction from the study** they cite: **Minimum wage workers can\u2019t afford a two-bedroom apartment at Fair Market Rent, a number determined by the federal government for each region set at the 40th percentile of all rents in that area.
p11790
aV**\u000a\u000a**That means that in some areas, minimum wage earners would be able to find and afford housing that is cheaper than the Fair Market Rent**\u000a\u000aTypical disingenuous progressive propaganda 
p11791
aVSo you say if people are stuck in a minimum wage situation they should only be able to live in a limited amount of places, probably the shittiest neighborhoods in the area?
p11792
aVNot necessarily anywhere near where they can find work.
p11793
aVYeah, and we'll no longer subsidize mass transit or have a minimum wage while we're at it to keep them there.
p11794
aVThat'll keep those uppity bastards in their place.
p11795
aVFuck the American Dream.

aVIts called having roommates.
p11799
aVI make three times minimum wage and live with roommates.
p11800
aVI don't understand why some entitled fucks think that they can deserve a two bedroom apartment on it.
p11801
aVI don't even see why a single person would need a two-bedroom place.
p11802
aVTed Cruz seems to have chosen to become a political whore of epic proportions.

aVCan't have that shit now can we? 
p11814
aVIs it me, or does it seem Republicans are not conservatives, but more reactionary, as instead of trying to maintain the status quo, they try to roll back Social reforms.
p11815
aVWHAT!?!?!?!
p11816
aVYou mean, Republicans don't have the best interests of the people they govern in mind?
p11817
aVThis bill wasn't going to help much by limiting payments, since that only meant more interest pilling up.
p11818
aVRepublicans are still generally assholes, but this bill wasn't going to help combat debt much.

aVOh what a surprise.

aVI think you're confused about what is meant by, women should have the right to choose whether or not they wish to give birth to children.
p11828
aVNot the state government, nor their citizens, or the average cop should be the one to decide this.
p11829
aVHopefully, I've helped clear that up for you.
p11830
aVPro-police brutality  pro-life conservatives' heads will explode from this story.
p11831
aVYes, $50k is too small.
p11832
aVBut as a point of fact, there was no "baby" involved.
p11833
aVNo child was killed.
p11834
aVThe woman was pregnant and the cop caused the woman to have a miscarriage.
p11835
aVHorrific, yes, but there's a night-and-day difference between causing a miscarriage and murdering an infant.
p11836
aVAccording to the law: \u000a&gt; Any person subject to this chapter who engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury a child who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section.
p11837
aVAnd goes on to say.
p11838
aV&gt;An offense under this section does not require proof that\u2014\u000a(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or\u000a(ii) the accused intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child.
p11839
aVYes, I get it that this occurred in the Bible Belt and many of those reactionary states push their right-wing "Christian values" onto the population in defiance of the Constitution and have anti-abortion laws that define a fetus as a living human being.
p11840
aVHell, states like Alabama *still* have laws on the books which prohibit black and white children from going to school together.
p11841
aVBut just because something is "the law" does not mean it is "just".
p11842
aVWhat I'm curious about is if the pig involved in causing the miscarriage will be prosecuted as a criminal, or if the pig(s) who tried to erase the tape recording of the event will be prosecuted.
p11843
aV(Because it would appear to me that the entire system is simply broken.

p11898
aVShe's actually accomplished a few things for consumer protection and what she tends to focus seems to be working class issues instead of corporate ones; unlike many of her co-workers.
p11899
aVI think she could accomplish more common sense bills if the bipartisan Congress, as a whole, wasn't so obstructionist to anything getting done.

p11950
aVMy state and federal taxes total 30% of my income, I'm to tithe 10% and follow the rule of saving 15% of my income for retirement that leaves me with 45% of my income to live on.

aVLabor unions are not official government representation. 
p11960
aV&gt; Labor unions are not official government representation.
p11961
aVLabor unions donate massive amounts of money to left wing political campaigns.
p11962
aVThe "representation" churches would get would work the exact same way.
p11963
aVIf they had to pay taxes then churches would be fully entitled to formally endorse candidates, run explicitly political advertising and donate to political campaigns just like every other taxed entity.
p11964
aVSure, but that's a completely different issue than "no taxation without representation" which is what I responded to originally.
p11965
aVAs it is now, we basically have a system where we bribe churches to stay out of politics.
p11966
aVWhere has that gotten us?
p11967
aVChurches are still in politics, and there are plenty of right wing funding groups that serve the same purpose now. 
p11968
aV&gt; Sure, but that's a completely different issue than "no taxation without representation" which is what I responded to originally.
p11969
aVNo it isn't.
p11970
aVIt is one and the same issue.
p11971

aVnot I ;) When I see a minister flying around in a jet and stealing from the pulpit I get sick to my stomach
p11978
aVMost of the ones doing that are doing it as part of a taxed business, not as part of their church.
p11979
aVThey're being paid as speakers.
p11980
aVAnd stealing from people doesn't change the taxing status.
p11981
aVThose people suck whether they are ministers or running a small business or head of a giant company.

aVSo, a Democrat refused to resign from her position as District Attorney, where she controlled the state\u2019s Public Integrity Unit, an entity which investigates ethics violations of elected officials.
p12003
aVThe likely reason why is that Perry, a Republican, would have almost certainly installed another Republican.
p12004
aVOne of the few positions in control of a Democrat under Perry\u2019s watch would\u2019ve vanished\u2014a big deal, given the power of the Public Integrity Unit.
p12005
aVPerry, as a means of intimidating the DA into resigning, publicly threatened to veto the Public Integrity Unit\u2019s budget.
p12006
aVAnd when she didn\u2019t step down, he made good on his tough talk, gutting all of its funding ($8 million) for two years.
p12007
aVPerry violated two laws:\u000a\u000aThe first of which prohibits public servants from consciously engaging in misuse of government property, services, personnel, or any other things of value belonging to the government that has come to the public servants custody or possession by virtue of the public servant\u2019s office or employment.
p12008
aVThe second of which bans coercion to influence or attempt to influence public officials in either a specific exercise of his official power or a specific performance of his official duty or to violate the public servants known legal duty.
p12009
aVAn Austin, Texas grand jury handed down the two count indictment late Friday afternoon.
p12010
aVIn the near future, Perry will have to present himself to a judge and be booked like a common criminal defendant, including fingerprinting and a mug shot.\u000a
p12011
aVNow THAT is going to be a mug shot heard 'round the world!
p12012
aVWhat gives the Texas Legislature the ability to criminalize a governor using their constitutional veto powers in any way they see fit?
p12013
aVVeto powers are coercive powers by nature.
p12014
aVThey let governor's and Presidents say "Do this or I won't approve this bill".
p12015
aVConstitutions usually protect against misuse by letting legislatures override them with a supermajority.
p12016
aVIn this case that didn't happen.
p12017
aVI don't know what you're talking about but Perry broke two laws.
p12018
aVELI5: The laws don't apply.
p12019
aVELI12: Threatening a veto is a central part of the governor's veto powers.
p12020
aVMaking a veto threat illegal would violate the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.
p12021
aVThat and the law he's charged with violating explicitly exempts governing bodies anyways.
p12022
aVHe also might not get any jail time (or any substantial punishment for that matter), since he's a politician with money and insider connections.
p12023
aVi would be shocked if it went down any other way to be honest.

aVHey, remember Blagojevich?

aV"Mostly false"?
p12040
aVThe article points out that the 1% far more wealth than the deficit and even has more income every year than the deficit.
p12041
aVSo this statement is TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY FALSE.
p12042
aVPolitifact is bending over backwards for the conservatives.
p12043
aVThey only say it's not completely false because the deficit is higher than the 1% current tax burden.
p12044
aVHow in the world could "taking every penny and even their dog" mean "their current level of taxation"? 
p12045
aVArrest their jive ass, and seize their assets.
p12046
aVAnd I wouldn't cut it off at the 1%, heh...
p12047
aVThey should all get a fair trial, of course.
p12048
aVI believe this can most optimally be achieved by stricter regulation, interpretation and enforcement, democratically, electorally...rather than by, say, collapse of the socio-economic system, chaos and insurrectionary civil war, which the right (and some elements of the purported left) would seem to prefer.
p12049

p12101
aVI can't understand how he can come across as being so breath-tauntingly ignorant.
p12102
aVSome of the things that this guy is attributed to are about as blatantly idiotic as the rantings of a derelict alcoholic on canned heat.
p12103
aVJust thinking, if he accidentally ended up in the White House gives me a headache.
p12104
aVFrankly, I don't get it, either.
p12105
aVSo far, he has displayed a personae that is all too comfortable pandering to the lowest common demoninator of the right and yet, he has a substantial education and a myriad of personal and political accomplishments that would lead you to believe that he is more than capable of a more politically savvy approach, even if he does favor the right (I don't).

p12156
aV" Ok, sure, they are scientists but as board members advising a policy making body it's a conflict of interest to evaluate your own work and its appropriate to recuse yourself... \u000a\u000aPerhaps that wasn't happening as frequently as it should have been.
p12157
aVDistricts are drawn at the state level, not the federal level and each state sets their own rules for how it is done.
p12158
aVWhile an admirable cause, you're targeting the wrong audience for this.
p12159
aVYou need to work at the state level or get an amendment to the constitution passed, which also does not involve the president.  
p12160
aVI hear ya bud, and I agree that change has to happen at the state level.
p12161
aVI am hoping that Mr. Obama would see the noble goal being proposed and work towards that outcome, even though he cannot directly influence districting efforts.

aVThis honestly won't do anything.
p12163
aVPresident Obama can say and do what he wants, but this is a state issue.
p12164
aVIt's a state rights issue.
p12165
aVBarring a constitutional amendment (and we all know the likelihood of that not happening), the states have sole control over this.
p12166
aVThe only way to fix it is by going to the states and demanding change.

p12204
aVJesus tucking Christ!
p12205
aVWhat you should remember is that around the 1900s southern organisations got laws passed in most southern states mandating that no school was allowed to teach that slavery was the cause of the civil war.
p12206

p12216
aVWhen one hears the blatant disregard of not only *constitutional* guarantees, but the stereotyped indifference and brutality involved by the institutions (courts, lawyers, jails, etc.
p12217
aV), and when one then thinks about how the corruption is system-wide and deep, one has to ponder the question: Can mere reforms address this or is something more dramatic required?
p12218
aVI think that the whole juvenile detention system is broken, and probably should be basically scrapped at this point.   
p12219

aVAnyone else notice before audio cuts out some saying "turn it off, everyone should be off"?

aVIf they were afraid of the gun, couldn't they just have had the two guys step out of the car and away from the gun?
p12226
aVNot when the cops were out for the hunt.
p12227
aVBad training.
p12228
aVThe cops are trained to be soldiers and not to be cops.

aVOur LEA's are broken.

p12231
aVWords are important, you know.
p12232
aVThat's exactly what he did.
p12233
aVActions are more important.
p12234
aVHow was that an execution?
p12235
aVIt was more like suicide by cop.
p12236
aVEvery single damn time there is a controversial cop shooting the victim was resisting arrest.
p12237
aVCops need to make decisions in the blink of an eye.
p12238
aVHe was dealing with a hostile person who was not following orders.
p12239
aVThe guy forced himself out of the car after being told to stay IN the car.
p12240
aVHe may have had his hands at chest level, but in 3 seconds he could have tackled the cop.
p12241
aVAlso, if you want to blame him for not having non-lethal force, thats not his fault, its the department's.
p12242
aVThe man has a prior history of shooting at police and that cop more than likely knew that and Bridgeton has a very high crime rate and has become a hotspot for gangbangers.\u000a
p12243
aVThe passenger was riding in someone else's car and may not have even known about the gun.
p12244
aVThat cop made a judgement call that ended the life of another human being without question.
p12245
aVThe other officer shot the victim in the back as well.
p12246
aVThese are coward, murderer cops and they need to brought to justice.\u000a
p12247
aVYou'll change your opinion in the future.

aVTrust me.

aVAmerica isn't a capitalist society, but a capitalistic plutocracy.

aVI heard on [today's DemocracyNow report](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/16/a_corporate_trojan_horse_critics_decry) that the US now has the 4th most unequal gap between the rich and poor of any country in the world, thus prompting me to search for information in the issue, turning up this 2013 article.
p12282
aV/r/inequality
p12283
aVThis was happening way before Obama.
p12284
aVObama just came to power after the recession which wiped out the wealth of the middle class.
p12285
aVThe middle class invested much of their wealth in their homes that when the housing crisis happened inequality went up. 
p12286
aVThanks Obama!
p12287
aVObama Obama Obama.... What about me!
p12288
aVI want some thanks too
p12289
aVRefreshing.
p12290
aVSo you admit to being Artificial intelligence.
p12291
aVThere is something really wrong about this.
p12292
aVOur family have trained dogs since 1956.
p12293
aVWe've trained for obedience, tracking, search &amp; rescue, and police work.
p12294
aVEvery dog we ever trained would not have done this.
p12295
aVIt's basic.
p12296
aVThe animal will "only" attack on command.
p12297
aVFor this to have happened, there is something very wrong with the dog, the handler, or it's training. 
p12298
aV...
p12299
aVThey will kill the dog to save the aggressor !
p12300
aVSeems like this was just a horrible accident.
p12301
aVStill, since police dogs are trained to be dangerous and live with their handlers, they should not be assigned to cops that have small children at home. \u000a
p12302
aVWell said Jon Stewart!

aVAnd Christie is the biggest pile of crap alive today.

p12307
aVNot sure about Batman but Margret Mitchell has been dead since 1949.
p12308
aVThe only ones who benefit are her heirs.
p12309
aVWhat do we continue in this country lavish wealth on those who did not earn it? 
p12310
aVCounterpoint, \u000a\u000aWhy is it that others should profit from such a unique and original work that they may dishonor, dilute or ruin?
p12311
aVAt least the creator can ensure that his family is taken care of for generations to come because of his work.
p12312
aVWhat gives society the right to this man's work without any regard for preserving it in the manner it was intended?\u000a\u000a
p12313
aV&gt; Why is it that others should profit from such a unique and original work that they may dishonor, dilute or ruin?
p12314
aVI take it you've never heard of fair use?
p12315
aVAlso Walt Disney created an empire doing exactly this.
p12316
aVWhy should these artists get protection from others doing to them what they did to others?
p12317
aV&gt; At least the creator can ensure that his family is taken care of for generations to come because of his work\u000a\u000aBecause after you're dead, you don't have a say, you're dead.
p12318
aVWhy should future generations be shackled to the past?
p12319
aV&gt; What gives society the right to this man's work without any regard for preserving it in the manner it was intended?
p12320
aVBecause all artists are heavily influenced by the societies they live in.
p12321
aVNot to mention without society, they have no wealth from their works as it's value comes from society at large giving it value.
p12322
aVUntil recently, the goal of copyright has been long understood as a means to foster creativity, not as some kind of absolute right of the creator.
p12323
aVIt's supposed to be a balance between allowing creators to profit from their works while allowing future generations to build upon and profit again.
p12324
aVIt's certainly not meant to allow people who've created nothing to continue to profit from the works of others (e.g.
p12325
aVheirs).
p12326
aV&gt; Why is it that others should profit from such a unique and original work that they may dishonor, dilute or ruin?

p12335
aVShe should challenge Hilary in the Primary to draw out stronger candidates (Cuomo, Warner) or at least show how bad Clinton is

p12337

p12338
aVLOL.
p12339
aVYeah, she's the best modern spokesperson for the fascist (aka "progressive") wing of the Democratic party.
p12340
aVAmerican style fascism is more of the smiley faced "we're here to help, this is for your own good" fascism.
p12341
aVAs George Carlin said: *"when fascism comes to America, it will not be in brown and black shirts.
p12342

p12349
aVThey do this in every state they have power in.

aVAs someone else pointed out, this measure was probably targeted more at Spanish-only speakers than Navajo specifically, but both lean Democrat so anything the Republicans can do to deny them the vote is a win in their book.

aVBecause they arnt members.
p12359

aVThere are phenomenal conversations taking place in America, and the rest of the world for that matter, about the course of humanity and these bandwidth hogginh koch brother dogs are polluting the airwaves and wasting everyone's time.
p12373
aVNot just the airwaves, but the entire political process.
p12374
aVThey are a clog in the flow of ideas, choking off any meaningful progress.
p12375
aVAs our economy sputters along years into a so called recovery leaving millions without jobs, as our debt soars to levels that all but guarantee the devaluation of our currency, as our stature around the world sinks in the shadow of one foreign policy disaster after another, as our healthcare system reels under the inept management of president Obama, the Democrats attempt to distract the public by pointing the finger at the other party.

aV&gt; Bates did say &amp;quot;Taser&amp;quot; before shooting Harris, and immediately after pulling the trigger, Bates drops the gun and says &amp;quot;Oh!

aVI&amp;#039;m sorry.&amp;quot; At a press conference on Friday, a Tulsa County Sheriff&amp;#039;s Office spokesperson claimed that Bates was a &amp;quot;True victim&amp;quot; of something called &amp;quot;Slips and capture&amp;quot; - a police term for when someone does one thing while believing they are doing something else in a high stress situation.

p12389
aVOddly, the shooter isn't the person I'm enraged at.
p12390
aVI accept that at some point, an honest mistake is going to happen.
p12391
aVNot to say that mistake should have no consequences to the the person who fucked up, mind you, only to admit that things like this can happen without intent or malice.
p12392
aVBut for the other officers at the scene to let the man die instead of fighting to save him has me enraged.
p12393
aVIn my mind, it was not the person who pulled the trigger who should be convicted of murder in this case, and several people absolutely need to see jail time for their willful inaction.
p12394
aVI'm most enraged at a system that allows a 73 yo man to buy a badge and be allowed to run around with a pistol and a taser with basically zero training acting like a cop.
p12395
aVThis was completely inevitable.
p12396
aVSooner or later someone was going to get hurt or killed and here we are.
p12397
aVThis insanity of this setup in a big city, or any city.
p12398
aVin America is appalling.
p12399
aVWhoever thought this was good idea should be the one on trial for murder.
p12400
aVThere a reason why cops go through so much training and testing.
p12401
aVI wonder how many other times this kind of shit has happened and been hushed up? 
p12402
aV"If she runs *and* becomes the Democratic candidate"?
p12403
aVMaher's money is safe -- both him and Warren knows that.
p12404
aVThere is simply no way the corporations and wealthy people that control the Democratic Party would allow Warren to become the party's nominee.
p12405
aVYeah, she's the only voice of reason that might keep America from going up in flames.
p12406
aVWhy would they support that when quarterly earnings reports are all that matter.
p12407
aVShe had probably a 15% chance of working a miracle.
p12408
aVNow its down to riots.
p12409
aV&gt; Now its down to riots.
p12410
aVIn general, I agree.
p12411
aVWarren was a pipe dream anyway.
p12412
aVNo Democratic president is going to oppose Wall Street or the wealthy people that control the vast majorities of *both* parties.
p12413
aVThe system is rigged.
p12414
aVThe [oligarchs](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/230sgy/us_is_an_oligarchy_not_a_democracy_says/) who control the Tweedledum and Tweedledee parties ensure that no serious "reform" of the US is going to come from either of our ruling parties.
p12415
aVI like what she has to say, but, that's about it.
p12416
aVShe's all bark and no bite.
p12417
aVShe says she'd like to do all kinds of wonderful things.
p12418
aVBut, what has she gotten done?
p12419
aVI think she's gonna run.
p12420
aVIf she does and she wins we'll see if she can actually deliver 1/10th of the things that have come out of her mouth.
p12421
aVI'm skeptical at best.
p12422
aVAs opposed to Hillary, who will deliver 0/10th of the things out of her mouth.
p12423
aVI am also, do not trust anyone after I put my eggs on Obama.
p12424
aVHe fucked everyone up.
p12425
aVDid nothing to the bankers , kissed Israel until just the last few months , has not helped the middle class  - wtf!
p12426
aVI also just hate Hilary the Witch, she is all bullshit, I will never ever vote for her.
p12427
aVBernie Sanders is another one I would vote for. 
p12428
aVI can't believe in the year 2015 that the citizens of Arkansas still want to pick Cotton.
p12429
aVThing about that "back-door tax" of summonses and arresting people for every little misdemeanor is that it's not just a back door tax, but it's on the poor entirely because politicians haven't got the balls to raise taxes on the wealthy even though it obviously needs to be done.
p12430
aVThey'd rather see all the poor in the country homeless then try to tax the rich.
p12431
aVIt's become more and more obvious that this is happening nationwide, and this strike just points it out in bold strokes.
p12432
aVIf we can't figure out what's going on from this amazing example I have no hope for America.
p12433
aVThe main purpose of the police, the military, the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, the laws, the courts, is to protect the interests of the plutocratic families, the corporate oligarchs and the international banksters...NOT We the People.
p12434
aVThe police are trained to behave like savage brutal thugs.\u000a
p12435
aVThe craziest thing about this case is the man who killed the two cops.
p12436
aVWe can sidestep the arguements about gun control for a min on this.
p12437
aVThis man from all accounts I've heard, was a nut.
p12438
aVIf the police didn't open themselves up to the public outrage, this man would've redirected onto something else.
p12439
aVSo we can add more to what we should be talking about here.
p12440
aVI believe that every American should be allowed to own a gun, have to go to safety classes, until it is provable they are not safe to use a firearm.
p12441
aVI think we should have some form of annual testing to make sure your accurate, know safety laws, and are mentally compatent.
p12442
aVI'm not saying expressly every year, maybe biannual or every five years.
p12443
aVThis may not be the answer either but it seems a good deal better then we got now.
p12444
aVMental health just needs a money dump from all levels.
p12445
aVLets be real here.
p12446
aVI wonder if redirecting money away from police to be tax enforcers to mental health professionals would result in more money saved in the long run.
p12447

aVNet worth was going up doing those other administrations.
p12764
aVThe Great Recession simply wiped out decades of gains and Obama's tenure has been unique in that it is the worst recovery in the post WW2 period and defies the established rule that the worst the crash, the more robust the recovery.
p12765
aVHis heavy handed approach has stifled what should have been a strong recovery and has us still worse off after 6 years of Obama than after 3 years of Reagan. 
p12766
aVthe recovery was fucked by the DO nothing Congress.. Just imagine how the recovery would of looked like if congress did their fucking job instead of trying to screw obama i mean the nation over?

p12771
aVOh, you mean a decline in net worth?
p12772
aVWell, thats not the same as poorer.
p12773
aVThey don't have the same buying power.

aVNo, I'm wondering how you account for the additional wealth.
p12778
aVHow do you calculate the entertainment wealth delivered in a modern cellphone?
p12779
aV(or, for that matter, what about your consideration of aircon, how much wealth does that deliver?
p12780
aV)\u000a\u000aI would argue that american's have lost their buying power.
p12781
aVThe argument is semantic, not political.
p12782
aV**What** additional wealth?
p12783
aVWhen they have mobile phones at all the country's poor doesn't typically have smartphones, they have base model cell phones that are more practical than ones anchored to the wall.
p12784
aVEntertainment wealth my ass.
p12785
aVYes, Americans have lost buying power (except for those in the upper 90th percentile) but it has hurt the poor the most.
p12786
aVWhat's left of the middle class has seen their wages and wealth stagnate but the poor have actually lost ground in terms of income.
p12787
aVThe nation's productivity has increased exponentially, but only a few are receiving much benefit from it.
p12788
aVAre you arguing that the access to infinite amounts of music and video entertainment is not additional wealth?

p12816
aVHow do I get permission from a corpse?

p12819
aVWell at least she can't complain about a headache !
p12820
aVum... how does an unenforceable law protect the innocent from anything?
p12821
aVSo what happens if you get oral sex from a corpse?
p12822
aVIt's much less shocking when you realize the victim was white.
p12823
aVTrue
p12824
aVWhy does it matter what color the victim is?
p12825
aVAll lives matter
p12826
aVI agree that it should make no difference what color the victim is.
p12827
aVUnfortunately, the justice system in the United States is demonstrably biased towards white people.
p12828
aVIt's not unreasonable to speculate that if the victim in this case had been a minority, the murderers would not have been indicted.
p12829
aVWell this is the most common sense plan I've heard in a long time.

p12835
aVJust watch how many down-votes this receives .
p12836
aVWhat?
p12837
aVShame on the media for exploiting tragedy toward political ends. 
p12838
aVShame on the ballsackless, flaccid politicians in congress and the whorehouse of representatives, shame on the NRA and shame on the gun owners the NRA registers and collects dues from everywhere.
p12839
aVThey've got blood on their hands.
p12840
aVShame on the media for glorifying these shooting situations more and more every time one happens, encouraging others to follow in the villain's footsteps and go for something bigger. 
p12841
aVWho is glorifying the shooting?
p12842
aVThe news media with all the constant attention that they are giving the killer in playing his manifestos, showing his pictures, talking about him non stop.
p12843
aVEveryone knows his name.
p12844
aVOff the top of your head, can you name any victims?
p12845
aVWhat about Sandy hook?
p12846
aVYou know the killer's name but no victims.
p12847
aVHow about Columbine?
p12848
aVMass killers do this to one up each other and for the attention.
p12849
aVBecause they know they will get it.
p12850
aVHere is something you should watch on why our media is doing it wrong:\u000a\u000ahttp://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1OCDCl_02NA\u000a
p12851
aVI don't think that's glorifying as much as it is informing.
p12852
aVThere is a throve of information about the killer and I think it is in the public's best interest to make up their own mind about it.
p12853
aVAlso, we are barely learning about the latest victims but I am sure that we will learn their names and about their lives in the near future.
p12854
aVI may not remember off the top of my head the names of the victims in Sandy Hook, and I often forget the name of the killer, but I will never forget the heinous act and what happened there.
p12855
aVIt doesn't mean I don't grieve for those kids any less every time I think about it and it doesn't mean that I forget what and who enabled the heinous acts either.
p12856
aVWhat does the public need to make their mind up about the killer?
p12857
aVIt's one thing if the killer is on the loose and dangerous to the public.
p12858
aVHe's dead and it's pretty clear he killed a bunch of people.
p12859
aVSo that's all that's needed to know.
p12860
aVThis is very clearly how you get copy cat killers. 
p12861
aVBecause life is not black and white.
p12862
aVNeither is death.
p12863
aVWas Chris one of the Asian kids that got stabbed to death?
p12864
aVNo.
p12865
aVHe was the last fatality. 
p12866
aVYou do know that all those kids survived and have recovered right? 
p12867
aV[No, they didn't.
p12868
aV](http://mashable.com/2014/05/24/santa-barbara-manifesto/) \u000a\u000aYou don't really recover from getting stabbed to death. 
p12869
aVI thought you were talking about a different stabbing... Way too much violence in the world :(
p12870
aVTrue that. 
p12871
aVIt must be nice thinking guns are the problem rather than the mental health of your nation. 
p12872
aVYou'd be surprised the effect weapons have on cognitive processing.
p12873
aVSince I work with them, no.
p12874
aVMental health is an issue, but it's an issue that is impossible tom100% deal with.
p12875
aVNot giving every crazy person a gun is a good step 
p12876
aVIn 2 out of every 3 deaths by gun, the shooter is also the victim.
p12877
aVIt's like thinking cars are the problem with drunk driving and not alcohol.
p12878
aVThe two are conflated.
p12879
aVYea, and the same argument goes.
p12880
aVPeople shouldnt be allowed to drive cars becuase some people drink, drive and crash.
p12881
aVSo instead of putting restrictions on all people driving cars, we should only place restrictions on drunk people driving car.
p12882
aVLikewise, instead of putting restrictions on all people owning guns, we should put restrictions on only mentally unstable people owning guns.
p12883
aVThe problem is some people think mental illness is a permanent condition - it would be like saying "when he passed his driver's test he wasn't drunk, don't see how he could have been arrested for drunk driving.
p12884
aV"  The mental state of people with guns should be checked as often as the drunkenness state of people with cars.
p12885
aVThat would make interesting headlines, u know, when the state starts doing obligatory "mental health tests" on the millions and millions of people with guns..
p12886
aVIt must be nice for you to have an excuse handed down to you by the NRA and not have to think about one yourself.
p12887
aVYeah, we want people like you having weapons.
p12888
aVWhat are you trying to say?
p12889
aVThat NRA made up an argument that is as old as man?
p12890
aVIt isnt the stone killing its the ape.
p12891
aVApes don't kill with stones.
p12892
aVIf that's what they tell you and you believe them, then you are disqualified to own a weapon.
p12893
aVThe point was that other specoes use tools to kill aswell and its never about the tool, its about the mind of the killer.
p12894
aVBanning guns would just make killer sprees find other absurd ways to kill mass people while rendering people unable to defend themselves.
p12895
aVYour tendency refering to me with personal insults tells me this debate is meaningless and your a child.
p12896
aVYou say the stupidest things.
p12897
aVToo bad you can't make a living out of it.
p12898
aVAd honimem again, wow such intellect
p12899
aVDon't get mad, I'm only being real.
p12900
aVLet me ask, what law do you feel has been blocked that would have stopped this crime?
p12901
aVHe passed a background check.
p12902
aVHe had 10 round magazines.
p12903
aVHe had handguns, not assault weapons.
p12904
aVWhat law would you propose that would have prevented this?
p12905
aVThere are plenty of ideas.
p12906
aVWe can begin with changing the weak federal laws that allow almost anyone, including the wrong people to get access to a wide variety of deadly weapons.
p12907
aVWhen you are at least 20 times more likely to be murdered with a fun just for being in the US there clearly is a problem.
p12908
aV- End the gun show loophole to include an IQ test and restrict what kinds of weapons that applicant can qualify for.
p12909
aV- Expand background checks to include a psychological evaluation.
p12910
aVWe can model this after Japan.
p12911
aV- Apparently a domestic violence conviction is needed to prevent gun purchases.
p12912
aVBut the standard is crap because SOs are gunned downs by their boyfriends/lovers/husbands at an alarming rate.
p12913
aV- Gun buyers need to attend mandatory workshops on handling/owning/storing weapons.
p12914
aVIOW, they are not to be used to replace tools (they are not tools), like that moron that wanted to make a hole in the wall to hang a tv and ended up killing his wife in the other room.
p12915
aV- Add teeth to any gun trafficking laws.
p12916
aVThis will stop dumbasses from carrying guns between states and/or through the airport.
p12917
aV- Give ATF the resources it needs to keep unscrupulous gun dealers in check.
p12918
aV- Improve access to funding and data for researchers so that smart, effective policies can be developed.
p12919
aV&gt;End the gun show loophole to include an IQ test and restrict what kinds of weapons that applicant can qualify for\u000a\u000aThe former I understand.
p12920
aVThe latter is lunacy; IQ tests aren't a reliable metric for competence or prudence.
p12921
aVI'm willing to bet Rodgers had a high IQ, and I would make that same bet for the VT shooter and the Aurora shooter.
p12922
aV&gt;Expand background checks to include a psychological evaluation.
p12923
aVAs long as it's provided at no cost to the gun owner, I could see this, though we'd have to have a serious debate about what exactly we're looking for.
p12924
aVPlease keep in mind that Rodgers was in therapy for most of his life and never officially diagnosed with anything.
p12925
aVIt is (and should be) hard to get someone declared mentally incompetent.
p12926
aVUnless we first repeal the 2nd Amendment, that's what you're testing for.
p12927
aV&gt;Apparently a domestic violence conviction is needed to prevent gun purchases\u000a\u000aYes, as there's that whole bother of "innocent until proven guilty".
p12928
aVIt's the same reason I don't think we should bar people on the terrorist watch list.
p12929
aVYou can have done nothing wrong and still be barred a right.
p12930
aVThat's a scary precedent to set.
p12931
aV&gt;Gun buyers need to attend mandatory workshops on handling/owning/storing weapons.
p12932
aVIf we expand that to gun safety courses taught as part of a high school education, I'm with you.
p12933
aVI think even people who don't want to own firearms should know how to safely handle and unload them.
p12934
aVIt would go a long way towards demystifying them.
p12935
aV&gt;(they are not tools)\u000a\u000aThere I have to disagree with you.
p12936
aVWeapon is a subset of tool.
p12937
aVWhat you're describing is 1) using a tool for something other than it's intended purpose, i.e.
p12938
aVdestroying targets and 2)already a violation of the four basic rules of gun safety, specifically knowing your target and what's beyond.
p12939
aV&gt;Add teeth to any gun trafficking laws.
p12940
aVWhat are the current penalties?
p12941
aV&gt;Give ATF the resources it needs to keep unscrupulous gun dealers in check.
p12942
aVVery little argument on that one.
p12943
aV&gt;Improve access to funding and data for researchers so that smart, effective policies can be developed.
p12944
aVIn general, I agree with this.
p12945
aVPersonally, I would add that we need to focus more on the reasons people shoot other people rather than what they shoot them with.
p12946
aVI think more lives could be saved by offering free anger management classes than lobbying for gun control. 
p12947
aVMass shootings are enabled by gun proliferation and not necessarily by anger issues.
p12948
aVThat's the bottom line.
p12949
aVThe minute you take gun control out of the solution process you are back at square one, or as we call it in America, every other day's mass shooting.
p12950
aVAnother law that comes to mind is making it illegal for anyone under 21 to own a gun. 
p12951
aVRight now, in many states, it's already illegal for a person under the age of 21 to own a handgun and in others any firearm at all.
p12952
aVIn regards to Rodgers, he was 22.
p12953
aVIf you have two people not interested in shooting each other and hand one of them a handgun, that person does not suddenly develop an interest in shooting someone.
p12954
aVThe motive precedes the means.
p12955
aVThe means do not grant the motive.
p12956
aVChange the people, they will set down the weapons on their own.
p12957
aVRemove the weapons, then people will find new weapons.
p12958
aVThat is the bottom line as I see it.
p12959
aVIt's been interesting.
p12960
aVI'll exit the conversation here.
p12961
aVPeace.
p12962
aVChange the people?
p12963
aVYou can't get people to change their eating habits even though they are morbidly obese and have had triple bypass surgery at 50.
p12964
aVBut you can change the law and solve the problem if not remove it altogether.
p12965
aVThat's the bottomline according to reality.
p12966
aVWow, you are one frightening individual.
p12967
aVHow many people called the cops on this kid before the shooting anyways?\u000a\u000a
p12968
aVWhile having non-elected officials is often good to de-politicize certain organizations (federal reserve, etc.
p12969
aV) the recent net neutrality situation reminds us yet again that just because there aren't elections doesn't mean officials will stay neutral.
p12970
aVOne might have imagined someone in the administration raising at least one eyebrow at the moment they decided to put a Comcast lobbyist in as chairman of the FCC.

p12982
aVThis morning on Fox &amp; Friends, Steve Doocy said "I haven't heard anyone else mention this but Sterling is a long time liberal democrat donor.
p12983
aV"  Ten seconds earlier they played a clip of Charles Barkley saying that the NBA was a black league and Brian Kilmeade asked "why would he say that when it has nothing to do with this?
p12984
aV" \u000a\u000aMy first reaction was , How are his political donations relevant to his racist remarks?
p12985
aVNow we see that he donated to three democrats 20 years ago and he's been a registered Republican since '98.
p12986
aVFaux News, lol.
p12987
aVThroughout that segment they also attacked the girlfriend multiple times but never directly defended Sterling.
p12988
aVSneaky.
p12989
aVIn another segment with Donald Trump they circumvented responsibility as usual by reporting that their viewers said that it was a private conversation, like that is suppose to make everything better.

aVI thought the United States of America was a Republic.
p12993
aVWell, now it's neither.
p12994
aVI don't know if this is an apt comparison... keep in mind, when the US Constitution was written... only landowners could even vote at all.
p12995
aVTrue, but land ownership was far more spread out - you didn't have a handful of people owning half the eastern seaboard.
p12996
aVTypically, landowners lived on the land they owned.
p12997
aVGeorge Washington owned like half of Virginia.
p12998
aVReally?
p12999
aVAre you sure?
p13000
aVNot exaggerating?
p13001
aVAccording to this sourced unreliable source he owned 52k acres\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_much_land_did_US_President_George_Washington_own?#slide=1\u000a\u000a\u000aKeep in mind, his first job outside the family was as a surveyor.
p13002
aVWell Virginia is about 42,000 sq miles, which comes out to about 26 *million* acres...
p13003
aVSo...
p13004
aVNo longer?
p13005
aVJesus, people.
p13006
aVDon't forget all the positive steps we've taken.
p13007
aVAnd more will come. 
p13008

aVGeez, give it a rest already, the woman has stated time and again, that she has no intention on running.
p13012
aVNo offense to those that would love to see her name on the ballot, heck I'm one of those people too, but let's respect her wishes.
p13013
aVIt's now or never for her.
p13014
aVIf she doesn't run and the next pres does 8 years, she'll be 73.
p13015
aVI don't think a 73 year old woman will e a viable candidate no matter how much we love her.
p13016
aVI hope she caves to the pressure and gives us the leader we truly want and need.
p13017
aVShe hasn't asked people to stop, and I think if she clearly did, they would.
p13018
aVWhether she's convinceable or not (which is hard to tell), the movement around trying to convince her to run also helps her accomplish what she wants as a Senator by giving her more press, more influence, more attention, more people willing to act on what she says people should do.
p13019
aVShe has never stated that she doesn't like these attempts to convince her to run, only that her intention is not to run.
p13020
aVShe also only ever ran for sentaor because she felt sort of a calling to fix the wrongs being done in washington.
p13021
aVShe's was of the good ones.
p13022
aVMakes sense we try to get her to run now before she might get corrupted like all the other do gooders seem to
p13023
aVI do not see her getting corrupted, considering how long she has been in politics already.
p13024
aVShe was organizing the effort to defeat the bankruptcy bill back in the 90s.
p13025
aVHer coalition won back then, and won again a few years later, and then lost in 2005 (the banking industry's third, and successful, attempt).
p13026
aVTARP oversight panel 2008/9, pushing for the CFPB and getting it passed, and then actually heading the CFPB and building it from scratch, all happened before she ran for Senate.
p13027
aVI wonder if she's waiting to see if Clinton shoots herself in the foot before the primary.
p13028
aVIf not she can stay by her word and do another term or two in the Senate.
p13029
aVIf Hillary does, then she can jump in to save the party.
p13030
aVI think she has to be careful of not being as political as the rest.
p13031
aVShe has said time and time again she isn't running.
p13032
aVI think that the more times she says that before she runs the more she looks like just another politician. 
p13033
aVWarren/Sanders 2016 is a ticket I would fight for.

aVfun fact, Rush Limbaugh has [ZERO](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/rush-limbaugh/) true statements on politifact!
p13037
aVEven if this were utterly true, what would the independent actions of one senator have to do with a letter, very loudly trumpeted to the media, signed by forty-seven senators?
p13038
aVThere is a considerable difference between the two.
p13039
aVOne is an independent effort by one senator; the other is endorsed by the leadership of the party and dropped with a huge splash into the middle of fairly sensitive negotiations about something that could be the difference between war and peace.
p13040
aVWhy do we pay any attention to idiots like these?  
p13041
aVThat Politifact is just as biased as those it purports to check was amply demonstrated by Obama's "If you like your healthcare plan you can keep it" lie that was Politifact's "lie of the year" for 2013 despite being earlier rated by Politifact as true or partly true.

aVIt's not real.....\u000a\u000aTake the October 2008 article, it's not about the topic at all.
p13045
aVOr the August 2009 linked article, doesn't actually have the quote they claim.
p13046
aVThe June 2012 link claims the CBO said differently, even though Politifact linked the report themselves.
p13047
aVThe October 2012 link, they actually didn't say the same thing.
p13048
aVThen the last June 28, 2012, it's just stupid as they could have pointed out that Obama did lie....but they still couldn't get what he lied about correct.

aVIf you can prove the alternative superior, sure.
p13089
aVIn this case, it's speculation, which is nothing to base good decision-making upon.
p13090
aV(shrug) All decision making is based on analysis of likely outcomes, though.
p13091
aVIn this case, since we have some early-stage ebloa vaccines in human testing now  now (although it still has to be tested on more people), and since we know that the research was interrupted for several months due to the budget issues, we can reasonably expect that we would have had it sooner if not for that.
p13092
aVYou can call it a "counterfactual" if you want, but by that logic, so is "if I had just left for work 10 minutes earlier, I wouldn't have been late, so I should leave for work earlier tomorrow.

p13094
aVNope.

p13096
aVWell, but we need the money to blow up the Middle East, and don't have any left over for medical research.

p13110
aVBut more to the point, just because they were all men but decided correctly with regard to women's rights doesn't mean the current male supreme court justices can't have a blind spot about women.

p13122
aVIts a bit tongue in cheek, and I dont like Sarah Palin either, but to rate this as "FALSE" is pretty harsh.
p13123
aV&gt;As unbelievable as it sounds, your tax dollars are funding the federal government's Zombie Apocalypse Plan.
p13124
aVI kid you not\u000a\u000aThis is what she said, in a presumably serious tone.
p13125
aVThe CDC does the zombie apocalypse thing and a PR move to garner interest in a serious topic.

p13127
aVSo yes, it is false that the Government is preparing for a real zombie apocalypse, as Sarah Palin seems to be implying
p13128

aVIt should be important to note that the 'free market' solution to this problem would have been to let them fail... not getting deeper into bed with them and exacerbating the cronyism.

aVWhat really scares me is Cruz or someone like him could get the nomination, and if the stars align right, could get elected president.
p13153
aVI mean, it was obvious to anyone who took a close look at Palin or Bush Jr. that they were far from qualified for office, yet Palin came pretty close to being VP, and Bush served two terms.

p13192
aVThis country was founded on the IDEA of individual liberty and removing that civil right at a time when the authority and force of our federal and state governments has expanded exponentially and our ability to control it has shrunk drastically is pitifully stupid and truly ignorant of history as aware of it as you are.

aVThere's no way you can claim our country was 'founded on liberty' while slavery was the law of the land.

aVOur nation was founded on protecting the interests of a new aristocracy and the French sticking it to the British.
p13203
aVNo amount of hyperbolic crap regarding liberty changes that fact.
p13204
aVThis is why selling BS to the masses to get them to vote or act against their interests is as old as democracy itself.

aVHe is on the job wether he is wearing the uniform or not.
p13253
aVIf this story was about him saving a life in danger in his civilian clothes, he'd be peddled as the hero cop.
p13254
aVHe is not a hired actor pretending to be a cop between the hours of 7 to 3.
p13255
aVHe is a hired and trained cop on his days off from work, and that's what he is, a cop even when not giving a muthafuck out in the park chasing a barb-q bite with a chug of cheap beer.
p13256
aVAnd he should know better.
p13257
aVI didn't say he wasn't a cop.

p13293
aVSomeone is in need indeed if they are on welfare and hooked on drugs, we shan't punish this person.
p13294
aVWe should instead repair and heal this person through therapy and drug rehab so they may become a benefit to society instead of a hindrance.
p13295
aVIf this person is on drugs and can't eat, not much good is going to be happening with them.

aVAccording to eyewitnesses, more than 20 officers showed up to search the building just before noon Wednesday.
p13299
aVProbably the first time in the city's history a platoon of cops has been sent to check out an alleged occupancy code violation.
p13300
aVThis time they didn't come armed with assault weapons as witnesses said has been the case in previous raids.
p13301
aVNor did they take away any supplies, something that observers say happened in Tuesday's raid.
p13302
aVWTF?

p13308
aVHe's a lieutenant?
p13309
aVThat goes a long way towards explaining this whole response.
p13310
aVIt seems to me that this whole department, top to bottom, has been indoctrinated to believe that we the citizens are the enemy, and that violent response is called for given the slightest provocation.
p13311
aVSomewhere in the training of these cops someone has taught this as proper police procedure.
p13312
aVThis has become a national problem.
p13313
aVWhere did it come from?
p13314
aVThe police have always felt a certain separation from the citizens, but never so extreme as this.
p13315
aVThere have always been asshole cops, but this is way beyond that. 
p13316
aVThat's what you get when you disarm the populace.

aVIt could be that conservative economists don't need grants.

aVI wish he had started right after the election, but there you go.
p13334
aVNow works too.

aVNot only that, most of the same Republicans who are bashing Obama for "negotiating with terrorists" right now are the same ones who were demanding that he negotiate in order to free this prisoner a few months ago.

aVDon't worry citizens!
p13344
aVOnce our rulers feel the protesters have become a sufficient nuisance -- or heaven forbid, they start to garner popular support!
p13345
aV-- Obama will order the police to crack down on and to disperse the protesters.
p13346
aVWe'll forget about the protesters and everything will be just fine then...
p13347
aVIf you need to, see Occupy Wall Street for a precedent.
p13348
aV:-(
p13349
aVWhat's wrong with the Republican party is many of their voters are isolated from the world and from minorities to the point where their only impression of black people(and Hispanics) is those on the evening news and in rap videos and they are filled with terror at the thought of losing the country to THOSE PEOPLE who don't share our values of hard work and being white.
p13350
aVThe narrative of minorities just wanting a hand out and being takers sells easily to these people and when it becomes an us against them struggle you can see the world and the actions of Democrats in very simplistic terms.
p13351
aVBut really I'm just saying the same thing the article is.
p13352

aVMarriage is a religious ceremony, leave it to religion!
p13356
aVMarriage should not be a legal bond in any way between anyone.
p13357
aVSeparation of church and state!!!
p13358
aVSimple.
p13359
aVAll people should have to get a legal bond between them through the state, and the state shouldn't discriminate on sex nonsense.
p13360
aVThen religious people are happy and people in love can be legally bonded in the eyes of the state.
p13361
aVMarriage does not, never has and never should belong to religion.
p13362
aVYour proposal has been attempted in states like New Jersey and failed, couples joined in civil union were denied equal rights as married couples.
p13363
aVMarriage started because of religion by religious people.
p13364
aVThat's why its been held in a church so long.
p13365
aVI personally don't give a fuck because I'm not religious.
p13366
aVBut I get that religious people often like to keep tradition in tact, so I understand their position as well as homosexuals position on wanting to be legally bonded in love.
p13367
aVThat's false advertising from religion.
p13368
aVPair bonding and social recognition of such bonds have been around longer than any religion.
p13369
aVNo religion owns marriage, and no religion gets to define it.
p13370
aVFurthermore, recognition of gay marriage doesn't force anyone or any religion from participating in it; they remain free to choose what marriages they do or don't perform as they always have.
p13371
aVThey can practice their traditions as they always have.
p13372
aVThey cannot impose those traditions on anyone else.
p13373
aVPAIR BONDING, that's exactly what I'm saying should be the legal standard.
p13374
aVMarriage is a ceremony before god that religion made.
p13375
aVSocial recognition of pair bonds (aka marriage) still predates religion.
p13376
aVReligion does not and never will own marriage no matter how much they complain.
p13377
aVYes they do own the ceremony of marriage as it exists in our society today.
p13378
aVThey do not own civil bonds which predate marriage.
p13379
aVMarriage is a religious ceremony to celebrate a civil bond.
p13380
aVPeriod.
p13381
aVI'm not religious, I just know history.
p13382
aVTry it
p13383
aVAs far as the law is concerned, "marriage" is a secular legal institution.
p13384
aVThe word is also used to describe both religious and secular marriage ceremonies.
p13385
aVThis is how things have been for centuries: words are allowed to mean more than one thing.
p13386
aVFWIW, marriage has a very long history, and is older than any major modern religion.
p13387
aVBoth marriage and religion probably go way back into prehistory.

p13400
aV[deleted]
p13401
aVGovernment is not attempting to define marriage except for those trying to redefine it as "exclusively between a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation.
p13402
aV" No government or court is arguing that churches cannot decline to perform marriages for whomever they choose, we're arguing that you cannot deny marriage to others simply because you don't approve of their legal or religious union.
p13403
aVShould churches who allow gay marriage be prohibited from performing them?
p13404
aVGay marriage opponents have tried to pass laws that would.
p13405
aVGovernment has a proper place in not only recognizing gay marriage as valid but protecting gay marriage from religiously-based interference.
p13406
aV[deleted]
p13407
aV&gt; I don't care what people call it, I really don't.
p13408
aVThat seems to contradict everything else you are saying.
p13409
aVRight now, the legal term for the legal institution we are discussing is "marriage".
p13410
aVThe government could do a cut-and-paste job and replace every mention of "marriage" in the law and official documents with "union", but it would take a great deal of resources, create a lot of confusion, and wouldn't achieve anything.
p13411
aV&gt; If a church/organization preformed gay weddings and declared them marriages that's their own right.
p13412
aVThey also shouldn't need to call it a marriage if they don't want to.
p13413
aVThat's already allowed, except that in some states same-sex marriages are not officially recognized, so do not provide any of the legal protections that marriage usually does.
p13414
aV&gt; I know many heterosexual atheist couples that would like if it wasn't called marriage, they'd rather not have the religious associations.
p13415
aVI'm sure there are plenty of people who would object to having their marriage renamed to a "union" or "partnership" too.
p13416
aVThe government recognizes marriages for various important purposes and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, so they have to pick *some* word to describe them.

aVIf a truth-o-meter went from true to false, both true and false would be where "truth-o-meter" currently is and "truth-o-meter" would be centered where false is.
p13432
aVFor lack of any even reasonably sane alternative they'll just keep running this jerk hoping that the Democrats field someone so awful even he'll win the election. 
p13433
aVThe GOP is trapped in a Reagan era timewarp where the year is always 1980.
p13434
aVSo every new year that comes along puts the GOP one additional year that the GOP is behind the times.
p13435
aVPublic funding
p13436
aVbecause the media doesn't want campaign fiance reform.
p13437
aVMore money in politics is more ad money in their pocket.
p13438
aVPlus other reasons (like their bosses being the doners).
p13439
aV&gt; More money in politics is more ad money in their pocket.
p13440
aVThat sums it up in a nutshell.
p13441
aVThe capitalists that control the US economy have created the most expensive system of politics on the planet.
p13442
aVAnd just like our world's-most-expensive-health-care-system, it is discriminatory and sucks and works best for the rich people at the top that control the system.
p13443
aVAlso known as "all the things the President will veto". 
p13444
aValso known as "destroy the country cuz fuck it has had a good run".
p13445
aVMaybe republicans are sick of the trillion dollar deficits Obama has ruled over
p13446
aVSo what does this man's race have to do with the story?
p13447
aVSounds like the cops were just assholes
p13448
aVThey probably wouldn't have tried to arrest a white guy doing the same thing
p13449
aVWhy would you think that?
p13450
aVHow do you know these cops are racist?
p13451
aVIt sounds like you are making assumptions about the character of the police officers because of the color of their skin
p13452
aVI knew the numbers were gonna be low in regards to people who popped positive on a drug screening but it blows my mind just how low these numbers are coming to us.
p13453
aVmaybe you should read the article, toulouse420
p13454
aVI may have phrased this wrong tell me what you got from what I said also what you got from the article
p13455
aVno, you should read it.
p13456
aVit's no skin off my nose if you don't and I've got better things to do, but a refusal to read the article you're prating about would say a lot more about you.
p13457
aVI did read it, I was shocked at the numbers because I expected the number of people to test positive to be higher.
p13458
aVWhen I say higher I was thinking the number of drug users would be 10-15%.
p13459
aVWhat I was trying to say to you is tell me in you're own words what you believe I was getting at (your interpretation of the article isn't needed), if you're not able to then why comment further. \u000a\u000a
p13460
aVThe numbers are shocking because they aren't representative of the system.
p13461
aVTheir system of collecting this data is completely fucked.
p13462
aVFirst off, they started with a sample size of around 800 people.
p13463
aVEh, OK, decent size, I guess.
p13464
aVSo then what happens...10 people answer a drug question and answer that they do/have-recently-done drugs and are asked to take a test.
p13465
aV4 of them refuse.
p13466
aV6 people are tested, 6 people who admit to using drugs are tested, and 1 has a positive test.
p13467
aVSo to the click-bait organization that is ThinkProgress, 1/800 welfare recipients do drugs.
p13468
aVYou have to look at the method in how they get their results.
p13469
aVDid you know that Los Angeles is the gayest city in America?
p13470
aV100% of the people who live there are gay.
p13471
aV*\u000a\u000a*I asked the bartender at a gay bar if he was gay.
p13472
aV1/1 people surveyed said they are gay.
p13473
aV1/1 is 100%.
p13474
aV100% of LA is gay.\u000a\u000a
p13475
aVYour right sample sizes can be misleading.
p13476
aVI'm on mobile right now so when I get home I'll crunch some numbers and argue this further
p13477
aVAfter reading ended up with a sick feeling.
p13478
aVWell he owns his assets, if he wants to retire that's his choice.
p13479
aVBut, polling your employees on who they will vote for sounds illegal? 
p13480
aVIt must be abundantly clear to even the most distracted observer that congressional Republicans are completely unprincipled, and are motivated solely by the graft that "leaning toward the green" provides for them (and their hatred of the President).
p13481
aVYou just don't get it.
p13482
aVThese companies will take the money they saved and use it to invest more in the economy (by paying execs more) which will make the economy grow (read wall street) which will make more jobs(read as tasks)  /sarcasm if that wasn't picked up
p13483
aVOh...my bad!
p13484
aVTexas is a fucking shit hole. 
p13485
aVThe town I live in has a similar crooked towing scheme where they fine vehicle owners and hold their cars even if someone else is caught sound something wrong.
p13486
aVIt's got a long list of reasons from music too loud,  no insurance, incorrect tags (even if there was a paper work mix up at the dealer or dmv).
p13487
aVIs mostly targeted towards blacks and poor people since we have large population of them. \u000a
p13488

aVAs sad as I feel for this older woman, does anyone else see the humor in the fact that as the republican party's core voters age, they'll likely be a large percentage of those disqualified from voting?
p13492
aVUnfortunately this affects low income people of all voting ages. 
p13493
aVThey've got that covered.
p13494
aVYou see, what they did was totally ignored absentee voting in these voter ID laws.
p13495
aVAbsentee ballots are the least secure method of voting and these voter ID laws do nothing to change that.
p13496
aVNo ID required to vote by mail, but if you show up in person then you better be prepared to ID yourself.
p13497
aVWhich party do absentee votes benefit the most?
p13498
aVRepublicans.
p13499
aVWho made the voter ID laws?
p13500
aVRepublicans.
p13501
aVGreg Abbott (Texas republican gubernatorial candidate and current AG), actually went as far as to set up a website and advertise on facebook to encourage people to request their absentee ballots.  
p13502
aVOops.. Old post..
p13503
aVDat picture... that's one ugly-ass Queen.
p13504
aVHe's not anti-gay, he against gay marriage because he's a christians 
p13505
aVPlease note the use of the word "Former"
p13506
aVHe had that job for eight years.  
p13507
aVso surprised...
p13508
aVThis is a good thing isn't it?
p13509
aVIt's money out of politics.
p13510
aVIt's only good if money gets out from both sides of the aisle.
p13511
aVIt's not privatization when the government hires a contractor.
p13512
aVIt's privatization when the government leaves something completely to the private sector.
p13513
aVFor instance, privatizing the schools would mean that the government would no longer provide any services.
p13514
aVIt would be something that parents would have to purchase.
p13515
aVIt is privatization, and it rips us off.
p13516
aVIf the government can directly employ someone to provide a service, they should, as that means they can apply necessary oversight.
p13517
aVA private contractor will always aim to maximize their profit while minimizing their operating costs, which means that the government will pay for a full day's work, but receive only the bare minimum that passes as a full day's work.
p13518
aVThis has worrying implications when contractory privatization affects organizations that deal with people, such as schools, prisons, hospitals, orphanages, and especially elderly care.
p13519
aVIt is why those of us that are less off will end up spending our last years miserable, bed-ridden and sedated with as much medication as possible \u2013 because, you know, the government *pays extra* for that "service".
p13520
aVYou don't understand.
p13521
aVIf the government can't hire a private contractor and manage that contractor properly, then it can't be expected to provide the service that the contractor provides.
p13522
aVThe government has no factories.
p13523
aVIt doesn't make anything (other than paperwork).
p13524
aVIt must, by definition, hire contractors whenever it steps outside the realm of government into other areas.
p13525
aVYou don't need a contractor to pass a law.
p13526
aVYou will always need contractors to fulfill government healthcare or build roads or supply cops and soldiers.
p13527
aVThe choice is either to nationalize all businesses (in which case, the government would control the means of production) or sever the tie of government and allow these businesses to operate within the bounds of the law.
p13528
aVWhere you will always have problems (as you've quite rightly pointed out) is where government and corporations work together.
p13529
aVTake away the government's power to regulate and they are out of it, along with those problems.
p13530
aVI see your point.
p13531
aVLet me reiterate that government ownership should, in my perspective, only be mandatory in fields that, in one way or other, need to provide various people with basic human needs, as those are fields that humanity has time and again shown to be completely unable to handle morally in the context of money ownership.
p13532
aVI don't care who manufactures mini Obamas for tourists.
p13533
aVI'm not sure you're understanding.
p13534
aVManagement is the easy part and that's the part the government is terrible at.
p13535
aVThe reason it is so terrible at it is because there is no profit motives in government.
p13536
aVThe reason businesses are so good at it, is only because they have to be because of the profit motive.
p13537
aVA bureaucrat has no incentive to manage such important needs for people.
p13538
aVThey get paid whether they do a great, good, bad or horrible job.
p13539
aVIt's only when their performance is so outrageously horrific do they really get punished.
p13540
aVOn the one hand you have no faith in "humanity", well humanity is part of the government, except that a bureaucrat by his/her nature must sever their tie from humanity.
p13541
aVHow else can they be "fair"?
p13542
aVGovernments do not exist to provide more humanity, they do quite the opposite, clinically classifying people and forcing them to do things they wouldn't otherwise do.
p13543
aVI see that to you, my view seems incoherent, because you have given up on fixing your government.
p13544
aVYou're ready to shift all power to business, because you think that the stereotypical government worker is a lazy bureaucrat who only makes no decisions at all, and you are astonishingly *correct* in that belief.
p13545
aVBut, the solution to bad government isn't to leave the bad government in place and let someone sell you their "better" one.
p13546
aVThe solution to bad government is making it good government.
p13547
aVYes, but how do you make it good?
p13548
aVIf you already have a large, unwieldy organization, is the answer to give it more power, people and money?
p13549
aVNo.
p13550
aVThe answer is to make it small, more efficient, so it may not have as much power, but what power it does have is efficiently used.
p13551
aVThereby, you gain by doing less.
p13552
aVYou also have to understand that every program underneath the government is vulnerable to politics, whether that means direct intervention by some high authority or merely a low-level bureaucrat attempting to curry favors with someone on high.
p13553
aVSo whatever "fixes" you put in place get circumvented by politics.
p13554
aVAlways.
p13555
aVNo matter how many civilian review boards you have, no cop is going to write a ticket for another cop or the mayor.
p13556
aVAnd truly privatizing something like (say) education, doesn't mean the government wouldn't enforce the law regarding the people running the schools, it just means it wouldn't run the schools badly as they do now.
p13557
aVLike now, government swoops in when a law is broken or someone complains.
p13558
aVThe difference would be, under a private system, the private company would pay, the customers (ie students) would be compensated and it wouldn't cost taxpayers much.
p13559
aVUnder the current system, the government has to protect us from the government program, which is an inherent contradiction because of politics.
p13560
aVSo the "protection" comes in the form of minimizing the political damage and covering up what went wrong.
p13561
aVThat means, either no one is compensated or if they are, it comes out of the government's pocket, which is our pocket.
p13562
aVAnd we pay at both ends, we pay for the bad education, the correction for that bad education, the PR to correct the "problem of the problem" and on and on.
p13563
aVWe can't fire government, because we can't fire ourselves, but we can fire a private company.
p13564
aVThat company has the incentive to deliver at least a partially good product because of the profit motive.
p13565
aV&gt; The difference would be, under a private system, the private company would pay, the customers (ie students) would be compensated and it wouldn't cost taxpayers much.
p13566
aVI already wrote about this.
p13567
aVYou are only factoring in money.
p13568
aVYou are completely forgetting everything else in the world that is not money.
p13569
aVYou will forget morality because of money.
p13570
aVYou will forget to do good because of money.
p13571
aVYou assume that there is no money in helping poor people.
p13572
aVPoor people are poor, but they are not broke.
p13573
aVThey merely have less money than, say, working class folks.
p13574
aVThe business model would be aimed at them.
p13575
aVIt wouldn't be great, but the schools in poor districts are pretty horrific.
p13576
aVAnd since for-profit schools would want the best students, the smart ones would be recruited to better schools on scholarship.
p13577
aVAnd government could provide tax incentives to the private schools that service certain areas.
p13578
aVYou assume that corporations=no morality.
p13579
aVThen how can you assume people in government are more moral?
p13580
aV&gt; You assume that corporations=no morality.
p13581
aVThen how can you assume people in government are more moral?
p13582
aVI don't.
p13583
aVI assume they will do whatever they can get away with, hence the need for oversight, vertical transparency, etc.
p13584
aVIn a privatized model, the same would utterly fail, because corporations \u2013 or, more accurately, the *people* behind the corporations \u2013 have virtually limitless resources and can "sponsor" the members of any oversight committee or similar. 
p13585
aVBut where does the oversight come from?
p13586
aVYou cannot insulate one part of government from another.
p13587
aVWhatever happens in a state reflects on the governor.
p13588
aVWhatever happens at the Federal level impacts the president and policy makers at the state level.
p13589
aVPolicy makers have zero incentive to act morally, they merely need to act in their best political interests.
p13590
aVCorporations do not have limitless resources.
p13591
aVEverything they do is a calculation to make money.
p13592
aVIf it's cheaper to bribe Congress, they do it.
p13593
aVBut if Congress had no regulation power, that would be a waste of money.
p13594
aVTheir choice would be to bribe Congress to change laws that their competition wouldn't stand for or attempt to get a leg up on competitors through competition.
p13595
aVYour model has no competition, therefore, people in their jobs have no incentive to do anything, moral or otherwise.
p13596
aVVertical transparency.
p13597
aVGranted, it does require witting folk ready to run for office.
p13598
aVEdit: http://www.pogo.org/
p13599
aV&gt; Vertical transparency\u000a\u000aCannot work and is just as corruptible as any political group.
p13600
aVAnd yes, it is political.
p13601
aVIt also has no profit motive, which means, it too, is vulnerable.
p13602
aV"Witting folk"?
p13603
aVOh, I'm sure they run, but they don't get elected.
p13604
aVI mean, where are these people?
p13605
aVHave they ever run?
p13606
aVAnd what magical protection apparatus would shield them from the corruption of party politics to get anywhere?
p13607
aVAgain, another model/solution that is just as corruptible.
p13608
aVThe beauty of the private sector is that, well, everyone is out for the money.
p13609
aVEveryone involved knows that.
p13610
aVThere are no ideologues, no political zealots, no kowtowing to religious nuts or special interest.
p13611
aVThere is only math.
p13612
aVWhat is and what is not profitable.
p13613
aVYou know where you stand, always and that knowledge allows you to make plans and move forward.
p13614
aVIt is real, pragmatic and sensible.
p13615
aVThe problem with government is that it is not any of these things unless you're constantly pressuring and monitoring it.
p13616
aVAnd even then, that pressure and monitoring may not work.
p13617
aVOr may get delayed or may simply be politically impossible.
p13618
aVAnd if you truly want government to be more responsible to outside pressure, you'd shrink it considerably.
p13619
aVMake it a real possibility that people can throw out elected officials.
p13620
aVLess powerful government means more powerful citizens.\u000a\u000a
p13621
aVAnd again, you're cherry-picking the points that are failing\u000ain the system to support your own privatization fantasy.
p13622
aVThese are things that have to be fixed anyway!
p13623
aVMy point is, you can't fix the corrupting influence of politics any more than you can fix greed.
p13624
aVThe only thing you can do is separate the various influences and balance them against each other.
p13625
aVThe current two party system cannot be balanced.
p13626
aVThey are no longer opposing forces checking one another.
p13627
aVOver the years, the policies has cemented the power structure in such a way that there is no longer competition and there was precious little within the parties to begin with.
p13628
aVThat power structure has slowly drawn in more and more of the private sector, which benefits, but also is being corrupted.
p13629
aVOnce you're in an industry that needs government approval, you have to lobby Congress or watch your competitors crush you.
p13630
aVYou sever Congress's power in that area, you diminish the corruption.
p13631
aVThe greedheads in Congress go back to the private sector, where they can make more money.
p13632
aV&gt; The current two party system cannot be balanced.
p13633
aVSuggest you make it a more-than-two party system.
p13634
aVPrivatization at scale can never work, because game theory.
p13635
aVIt is always more advantageous for two corporations to work together towards a common goal.
p13636
aVThis is why we have Coke and Pepsi, for instance, but no real third alternative.
p13637
aVWould love multi-parties or no parties.
p13638
aVHowever, you need to cut off the endless money supply and you can't do that without changing the policies that drive the money into these campaigns.
p13639
aVIt is not always more advantageous for two corporations to work together because they are both vying for the same market.
p13640
aVTheir alliance is always very uneasy, because one will swoop in for the market share whenever possible.
p13641
aVOr are you now saying that corporations are good at keeping their promises?
p13642
aVAnd as far as Coke and Pepsi go, have you not heard of the many other colas available?
p13643
aVSome people (punishableoffense) are just born with small brains.
p13644
aVNo way around it, no matter how much sense you throw at them.
p13645
aVThey just repel common sense or plain out brainwashed.
p13646
aVI think, as compared to most redditors, (punishableoffense) was relatively polite and open to my views, even though he didn't agree with them.
p13647
aVI appreciate your support, but let's all try to keep it polite.
p13648
aVYou can't win people over with vitriol.
p13649
aVmaking govt good = making govt smaller and taking them out of the equation.
p13650
aVall the govt should do is run the court system and uphold the laws, plain and simple.
p13651
aVonly the local govts should collect taxes to run the basic necessities such as trash removal and policing. 
p13652
aVDown voted.
p13653
aVAlternet is a propaganda outlet funded by the lunatic left.
p13654
aVRemember folks this guy was elected.
p13655
aVHe has a constituency that apparently feel the same as he does.
p13656
aVWhat that says about America is fairly appalling.  
p13657
aVWhat the hell?
p13658
aVDuring the last few years of his presidency, Bush was also trying to get other nations to accept people from Guantanamo who were deemed to not be a risk.
p13659
aVIs there any part of US foreign policy this guy isn't trying to screw up?
p13660
aVSpare me Lord!
p13661
aVGore had his chance and he blew it.
p13662
aVGore was the only guy that could have lost to GW.
p13663
aVGore beat Bush.
p13664
aVKerry lost to Bush.
p13665
aVWell, he did already win.
p13666
aVIf he ran and won it would be his 2nd win yet only his first term.
p13667
aVExcept of course he didn't.
p13668
aVKeep telling yourself that though...it's cute in its own way.
p13669
aVExcept of course he did.
p13670
aVI'm genuinely curious as to what makes you believe otherwise, this is an established historical fact.
p13671
aVThen , if Clinton wins the primary, she can have Gore as VP.
p13672
aVNow the question is, can Bush get Quayle or his wife to run as his VP?
p13673
aVBush vs. Gore round 2.
p13674
aVThe payback!
p13675
aVI dont vote often, mainly because i refuse to pick the lesser of two evils, but if this guy was main candidate  I would have to vote.
p13676
aVJust to make sure Ted Cruz isn't our president. 
p13677
aVYour voice is speech.
p13678
aVMoney is a megaphone.
p13679
aVYou know what's cute?
p13680
aVThe left/right paradigm.
p13681
aVI love watching both sides sink my country into the shitter simultaneously while fucktards blindly swallow whatever they're cued to swallow.
p13682
aVI'm a &lt;politcal party&gt; and I feel great because &lt;other politician&gt; is an &lt;embarassment&gt; while MY &lt;guy/gal&gt; is an &lt;embarassment&gt;.
p13683
aVHooray!
p13684
aVDemocracy!
p13685
aVFuckin' AWESOME!!!
p13686

aVI want to get as many people who support this foolishness on record right now, so that my grandkids know whose graves to piss on in 75 years.
p13687
aVRick Scott, James Inhoffe...
p13688
aVbecause that will make it *ALL* go away
p13689
aVDemocracy means mob rule.
p13690
aVTo the extent that the mob can be persuaded by the propaganda of the Koch brothers, democracy means rule by the Koch brothers through this persuasion.
p13691
aVYou want democracy?
p13692
aVBe careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it.
p13693
aVNotice how they CAN be turned off.
p13694
aVIt should be taken as an indication of guilt.
p13695
aVThe investigation should be done by the FBI, they should skip the grand jury and go directly to trial and their testimony should no longer be privileged.
p13696
aVedit: also, an officer with the camera turned off, obscured or sabotaged is automatically no longer on duty.
p13697
aV(these things need an indicator light) Interacting with the public pretending to still be on duty should be considered impersonating a police officer.
p13698
aVThey would also be personally liable for anything that happens.
p13699
aVMake the Camera interfere proof ..... it defeats the object otherwise.
p13700
aVClearly there is intention to deceive if the camera is turned off by the officer just before the shooting.
p13701
aVIf your worn camera is turned off and you perform ANY act on duty that requires a report filed about the incident, you should be suspended without pay.
p13702
aVBut really we just need a full shakedown of every large police force in America. 
p13703
aVApparently,  "some state legislatures" should be burned to the ground by their constituency. 
p13704
aVYeah, but they need the money to create all the jobs.

p13719
aVI would propose:\u000a\u000a1.
p13720
aVRemove all limits on the amount of money someone can spend on political speech and when they can spend it because the First Amendment exists specifically to protect this.
p13721
aV2.
p13722
aVRemove the ability to donate anonymously, requiring that all money spend on political campaigns much be traceable, because the First Amendment doesn't protect donor anonymity.
p13723
aVIf our free press doesn't use proposal 2 to compensate for the disadvantage of proposal 1 then our culture doesn't deserve to have good democratic institutions anyway and it's pointless to try.
p13724
aVThere is such a thing as not deserving freedom.
p13725
aVwell if this were to be used we would at least know the names of our lords and masters anyway.
p13726
aVi don't think unlimited money is really the answer in the face of high corruption.
p13727
aVkinda like giving an addict a never ending supply of smack, but he has to tell you when he's gonna use it.
p13728
aVprobably just going to make the situation worse.
p13729
aVi would say to remove money from politics entirely.
p13730
aVwhen freedom of speech is regulated by how much money you have, those without money quickly loose their ability to speak.
p13731
aV&gt; when freedom of speech is regulated by how much money you have\u000a\u000aThat much is inherent in the idea of freedom of speech and it sure beats freedom of speech being regulated by the same people as the regulation is being applied to.
p13732
aV(i.e.
p13733
aVCongress)
p13734
aVi'm not interested in letting congress regulate themselves.
p13735
aVthat's how we've come to the point we find ourselves.
p13736
aVwhat i'm speaking of is a constitutional amendment ratified by a convention of the states totally bypassing d.c. limiting campaign contributions to a 100 dollar maximum.
p13737
aVand taking away the notion that corporations are people and get to make political donations under freedom of speech.
p13738
aVpublic financing of all political campaigns.
p13739
aVyou shouldn't have to be a billionaire or be completely beholden to one to run for public office.
p13740
aVbut due to this notion of unlimited political spending what we have now is little more than legalized mass bribery of our political structure.
p13741
aVit will take more than just making people sign their names to walk back the current state of corruption.
p13742
aVthe problem with money being what allows you to have the freedom of speech is that it limits that freedom to just a handful of people.
p13743
aVwe dont have a democracy right now, we don't even have a democratic republic.
p13744
aVwe have a plutocracy.
p13745
aVplain and simple.
p13746
aVthere's another name for a government totally ran by corporate interests as well.
p13747
aVbut i'll leave that one for you to research.
p13748
aV&gt; what i'm speaking of is a constitutional amendment ratified by a convention of the states totally bypassing d.c. limiting campaign contributions to a 100 dollar maximum.
p13749
aVSuggesting that we put a dollar amount in the Constitution shows a fundamental lack of understanding of either what the Constitution is, what money is or both.
p13750
aVHaven't you ever heard of inflation?
p13751
aV&gt; and taking away the notion that corporations are people and get to make political donations under freedom of speech\u000a\u000aCorporation owners are people, and they ought to be able to order their corporation that they own to spend money on whatever because that's what ownership means.
p13752
aVThat's freedom.
p13753
aVFreedom includes the power to do stuff you don't like.
p13754
aVwell that's a plan that's currently in motion, passed in three states already.
p13755
aVwolf-pac.com for more info.
p13756
aVi'm sure we can work out something that outsmarts inflation.
p13757
aVcorporation owners are people.
p13758
aVcorporations are legal fictions that exist to make those who own them money.
p13759
aVcorporations are born in a lawyers office on paper.
p13760
aVnot from a mother's womb.
p13761
aVyou can not have mcdonald's over for supper.
p13762
aVthere are plenty of things that we do not allow the legal entities known as corporations to not do (less nowadays but still).
p13763
aVthe minute you can put a pair of handciffs on a corporation and place it under arrest then i may consider the notion that corporations are people.
p13764
aVit's stupid.
p13765
aV&gt; there are plenty of things that we do not allow the legal entities known as corporations to not do\u000a\u000aAnd why should broadcasting political speech be something a corporation isn't allowed to do?
p13766
aVAlso, your same argument would seem to suggest that corporations shouldn't have to pay taxes either.
p13767
aVWell, in a sense, corporations never pay taxes.
p13768
aVAll corporate taxes are really customer taxes, since they come out of prices.
p13769
aVbecause the result is not worth it.
p13770
aVwe don't have unlimited freedom of speech anyway.
p13771
aVshouting fire in a crowded theater, slander, perjury, etc.
p13772
aVde facto bribery of public officials should be in the same category.

aVhow can i start my own business when you, my established competition, can simply have your pocket congressman regulate me out of the market?

aVWhat possible reason did they have to demand to see his ID in the first place?
p13779
aV?
aVWow, I'm not going to link it because they don't deserve the traffic, but the story from the local paper starts out as such:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA man who died a few hours after being shot by a Dothan police officer outside the Dothan Animal Shelter on Tuesday had recently served time in jail for making threats to government employees and also had two women file protection orders against him earlier in the year.
p13780
aVTheir priorities are straight.
p13781
aVLibertarian click bait. 
p13782
aVMaybe resisting arrest isn't a good idea?
p13783
aVIt's in the past... Now, on to something in the present... Benghazi 
p13784
aVShe sounds like some dipshit you knew in high school. 
p13785
aVI'm utterly shocked at how blatant and obvious the Fox News propaganda machine has become.
p13786
aVEdit: I knew it was bad back in 2000, but they've taken it to a whole new level. 
p13787
aVGood Lord...
p13788
aVSame thing could be said for Wall St/white collar crime.
p13789
aVIt'll most assuredly continue as long as it goes unpunished.
p13790
aVThe whole bit about not being able to lock any of them up because the economy would crash is complete bullshit.
p13791
aVJust as is any excuse as to why the police can't be held accountable when their actions are obviously outside the bounds of their position - especially as it relates to murdering perps.
p13792
aV&gt;It turned out that conservatives who read the correction believed Bush's falsehood more strongly than did conservatives who never read the correction:\u000a\u000aSo, knowing that a claim isn't true made them believe it was?

aVIs this bizzaro America?

aVInsanity strikes again.

aVI've read many horror stories about working for Amazon including both warehouse workers and IT workers.
p13799
aVWhy?
p13800
aVOf all the major corporations (comcast, verizon, google, apple, etc.
p13801
aV) I feel like Amazon is one of the best.
p13802
aVWorkers at Amazon distribution centres are required to wear digital arm mounted terminals that monitor their every move.
p13803
aVThere are no agreed protocols about breaks and speed, and a culture of bullying and harassment is rife.
p13804
aVStaff are reprimanded just for speaking to one another or even pausing to catch their breath
p13805
aVHuh, I thought they would have given it to someone in Dubai, AUE, or China.
p13806
aVThis seems a bit idiotic to call it "Worlds Worst".
p13807
aVYeah, Amazon has serious issues but it is FAR from the worst.
p13808
aVMaybe name it "Americas Worst" or "Most Controlling CEO in America"..
p13809
aVYeah, but, but........  men kissing, and murdered placentas!
p13810
aV!
aVNo surprise here, Obama since day one was waged a war on whistle blowers. \u000a\u000a
p13811
aVSince he is a member of the protected ruling class, I don't expect he will serve any time.
p13812
aVThat said, I hope he at least has a very shitty few years fighting this and disappears from the public eye. 
p13813
aVHe was just featured last night on "Years of Living Dangerously" as one of the only Republicans who'll admit that Climate Change is real and manmade. 
p13814
aVToo bad he wants to throw people off of balconies when they ask him questions he doesn't want to answer.
p13815
aVNobody is perfect.
p13816
aVIf you focus on party affiliation as the only reason to vote people out of office, you ignore the fact that affiliations [can be changed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_switching_in_the_United_States#1990s): just look at the half-dozen senators and US Representatives listed as changing affiliation in 1995 (i.e.
p13817
aVafter the 1994 midterm elections [brought the Republicans to power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Revolution)).
p13818
aVIf the corrupt elements care only for power (and I personally believe they do), there is nothing stopping them from saying "I'm a democrat now!
p13819
aVFree healthcare for everybody, and a chicken in every pot!
p13820
aV"\u000a\u000aVote *all* incumbents out.
p13821
aVIt's the only way to be sure.
p13822
aVYou only really *need* to vote out the people who have records of badness.
p13823
aVFor example, I'm pretty happy with Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, the Oregon US senators, who I have voted for.\u000a
p13824
aVTrue enough, but if&amp;mdash;like the original article&amp;mdash;you make a blanket statement on whom to vote out, I'm far more comfortable saying "everybody" than relying on a discriminant (party affiliation) that can be changed.
p13825
aVI'm not trying to imply that they aren't both terrible ideas, just stating my personal preference.
p13826
aVCui bono.
p13827
aVWho benefits.

aVIf even a small part of the Antarctica ice sheet melts sea level will rise ten feet.

p13830
aVWithin not too many years we will get that rise.
p13831
aVWhen it does happen southern Florida is gone.
p13832
aVSo who benefits from pretending it isn't and won't happen?

aVRich people who have big investments in Florida that they want to dump.

aVSo, he wants to deregulate businesses and let them opt out of employee hand-washing requirements by regulating businesses and forcing them to post signs that they've opted out.
p13839
aVDo I understand correctly?
p13840
aVThe next obvious step is allowing them to opt-out of disclosing their opting-out.
p13841
aVI'd be fine with that as long as they were required to post a sign saying they opted out of showing a sign.
p13842
aVNo he used it as an anecdote.

aVThe National Review article is silly outside of the cult of personality suggestion, which is largely true.
p13851
aVWhat else do you call people circlejerking to defend the man asserting dismissal of *an entire discipline*?
p13852
aVHell, the other critics sound like they are largely correct as well.
p13853
aVThe press statement did little to dispel the accusations...
p13854
aV&gt;not primarily because they like science, but because they like the intellectual superiority they think liking Tyson signifies.
p13855
aVUh, y'mean the intellectual superiority he DOES signify?
p13856
aVWell, like anything that more intelligent people like, there are certainly people that 'like' it to appear more intelligent.

aVAs a conservative who lives in a largely conservative town and went to school at a very conservative college, this is the first that I am hearing that we don't like Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

p13867
aVNot after Cosmos.
p13868
aVOh, my bad, just got my weekly conservative instruction booklet and apparently you are right.

aVAfter Cosmos we *don't* like NDT.

aVSeriously though, generally people aren't nearly as bad as the generalizations about groups they belong to make them out to be.
p13874
aVDid you see Cosmos?

aVIt was his statements on the certainty of evolution, the age of the earth/universe and climate change that got things fired up.
p13876
aVYoung Earth creationists are not a majority in any circle
p13877
aVWhat they mean is it unleashes economic growth for the wealthy.
p13878
aVThe rest is us don't matter to the republicans. 
p13879
aVExactly.
p13880
aVIt's been a great time for them.
p13881
aVFuck everybody else. 
p13882
aVDo any of you have any fucking idea at all what you're talking about?
p13883
aVYou think it's Republicans who favor the rich?
p13884
aVThen why is income inequality higher than ever under Obama?
p13885
aVWhy are 32 of 35 of the congressional districts with the greatest income equality represented by Democrats?
p13886
aVGo to any area under the control of Democrats and you see it, super rich elites living like kings and everyone else living like peasants.
p13887
aVGo to Republican areas and you find the middle class.
p13888

aVhttp://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/09/03/238428/leonard-pitts-jr-if-gop-is-so.html\u000a\u000aHowever, I don't think it's adequate to just compare geographical regions and assume correlation to causation.
p13892
aVIt's more appropriate to examine the economic policies endorsed by each party, and understand how each policy effects everyone throughout an economy.
p13893
aVTax cuts on the rich really don't help anyone except the rich.
p13894
aVWho endorses that?
p13895
aVRich republicans.
p13896
aVAlso, not so rich republicans, because they've been tricked into believing that it helps everyone. 
p13897
aVAlso poor Republicans because they've been propagandized into the team mentality that if it's Democrat it's bad, wrong, and likely causes genetic defects.
p13898

p13900
aVad nauseum.
p13901
aVWoah bro.
p13902
aVFirst of all, nobody is saying that our current president is just the bee's knees.
p13903
aVIncome inequality is a trend that surpasses individual administrations.
p13904
aVAs for Republicans favoring the wealthy, it's a little hard to argue such a point when they admit to it themselves.
p13905
aVWhether I cite comments made in the last election or the perennially Republican concept of trickle-down economics, it's pretty clear that Republicans favor the "job creators" and the business owners because that is who they believe spur on economic growth.
p13906
aVNow, if you're really indignant that someone would say the GOP favors wealth, than I'd say you have a crisis of faith on your hands that has far more to do with your own ability to keep yourself abreast of facts than it does with what those damn commies are saying about your institutionalized Reagan-boner.
p13907
aVJust my 2c.

aVI think it's important to also consider who is running the Senate and the House during those times, since they are the ones who write the laws.

aV"littering his body with nearly a dozen bullets in broad daylight"\u000a\u000aCould this article be more sensationalistic if it tried?
p13915
aVThe use of the word "littering" as if the cops were simply discarding bullets into a refuse bin, that refuse bin being a person.
p13916
aVNearly a dozen?
p13917
aVIt was 6.
p13918
aVNearly implies just shy of.

aVTry half a dozen.

aVSheesh.
p13921
aV&gt; The spark that lit the flame of unrest occurred on a Saturday afternoon earlier this month when Ferguson police gunned down an innocent college-bound teenager by the name of Michael Brown, littering his body with nearly a dozen bullets in broad daylight.
p13922
aVThey also manage to say innocent and college bound furthering the heart string tweakage.
p13923
aVOf course were exceptional!
p13924

p13939
aVSoooo...
p13940
aVThere was an errant smoke grenade that just happened to land beneath a very obvious group of reporters?
p13941
aVAnd the cops were very sorry and didn't want looters to steal the recording equipment, so they made it less obvious by placing the lights face-down for them?
p13942
aVAnd the camera too because... well... hmmm... the camera was no longer obvious and a two party consent recording law kicked in?
p13943
aVI dunno.
p13944
aVI got nothing.
p13945
aVI wasn't certain I could hear any beanbag rounds described by the article.
p13946
aVThere is some clicking that could be firing in the distance, but nothing near the microphone.

aV McConnell spokespeople were quick to offer a correction.
p13951
aV"The congressman meant to say he supported 'stronger violence against women than Barack Obama'", said an anonymous voice from a phone  that only faintly sounded like my voice talking through a handkerchief.
p13952
aV"McConnel thought it was an argument about who could better attract women with the 'bad boy' image.
p13953
aVYou know, like cancel their insurance coverage for contracepton, or pay them less for work than for men, or just pinch them as they go down the halls of the capital".
p13954
aVThe anonymous but highly placed source went on to describe McConnel's *black leather jacket*, but of course the MSM edited that out.\u000a
p13955
aVApparently the primaries are over, or his Republican opponent would have been running that.
p13956
aVSeems a little low...

p14050
aVIs the reason because US banks make such huge amounts of money from drug money laundering, or just the fact that our politics are controlled by two static parties?

p14053
aVthose fucknuts don't do anything they're not paid to do.
p14054
aVour political system is controlled by the corporate interest that have owned our politicians for a while now.
p14055
aVWouldn't that suggest that some of the legal crop is being diverted to states where it is not legal or was Colorado just smoking 90% of the pot in the US?
p14056
aVLogically.
p14057
aVBut as ~22 states (maybe more by now) currently have MMJ, it's not just Colorado and Washington consuming all that legal weed.
p14058
aVAdditionally, it's the quality of marijuana cultivated in the states that's superior to what the cartels are producing, bricking, and smuggling - which is certainly another factor in their decreased market share.
p14059
aVAs more MMJ &amp; recreational use gets passed, I'm assuming there will be even more dank grown, which will just offset the margins even further against the cartels.  
p14060

aVThe cartels will simply switch to importing cocaine, heroin, or some other illegal drug to replace their lost marijuana revenue.

p14069
aVHe knows what's up.
p14070
aVFortunately,  \u201cthe legitimate redistribution of economic benefits\u201d does *not* include violent seizure of wealth via taxation.
p14071
aVEr...  what?
p14072
aVI feel like you're referencing something, but I'm not sure what.
p14073
aV...Wow that's a really cool username you've got there.
p14074
aVHe's referencing the Pope's speech.
p14075
aVThe Pope didn't say redistribution of wealth by government agents.
p14076
aVHe said the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits, meaning equal *opportunity*, not equal outcome.
p14077
aVAnd the "legitimate" portion means charitable giving.
p14078
aVBasically, the Pope said to be more charitable in our own financial decisions.
p14079
aVPretty much what Popes have been saying for years. 
p14080
aVTaxation is only necessary because people aren't inclined to part with their money- well-earned or not- for the good of their society as a whole.
p14081
aVAlso, I wasn't referring to that part of his comment.
p14082
aVThat bit about force and government, that seemed like a reference.
p14083
aVNot sure what to.
p14084
aVAlso also, didn't Jesus say that money should be TAKEN from the rich and given to the poor, not just that the rich should donate their money?
p14085
aVHonestly, I don't give a shit what Jesus did it didn't say.
p14086
aVIf he was real and gave moral commands, they were transcribed by fallible men and out into a book compiled with political ambitions in mind.
p14087
aVAnd who determines the "good of society"?
p14088
aVThat's always the question that I can't find a suitable answer to.
p14089
aVAnd the part about force and government is probably alluding to some manifestation of the Non-Aggression Principle. 
p14090
aV"The good of society" seems a tad self-evident...  but I would, do, and have defined it as "anything that demonstrably contributes to the health and happiness of humanity in the short- and long-term.
p14091
aV"  Note- this does not mean "humanity at the expense of non-humanity", because most life that is not human plays a direct or indirect role in maintaining an ideal quality of life for most if not all people.
p14092
aVDoes that definition include a provision that says you can't achieve the good of humanity by committing a wrong?
p14093
aVOr does the end completely justify the means?
p14094
aVLogically, yes.
p14095
aVI asked an either/or, and you said yes.
p14096
aVThere's nothing logical about that whatsoever. 
p14097
aVThe end justifies the means, or rather, the result justifies the means.
p14098
aVKilling one random person to save two, etc.
p14099
aVAnd that's where we disagree.
p14100
aVAnd where you and the Pope would disagree. 
p14101
aVOh, sorry.
p14102
aVI'll give a better answer when I've got more time.
p14103
aVTaxes are not "stealing" they are the cost of having a civil society.

aVThe Koch brothers -- David and Charles -- are the right-wing billionaire co-owners of Koch Industries.
p14122
aVIn an article in the August 30, 2010 issue of The New Yorker magazine, author Jane Mayer links the billionaire brothers David Koch and Charles Koch, owners of Koch Industries to tea party movement funding.
p14123
aVMayer writes,\u000a\u000aThe anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs.
p14124
aVBy giving money to \u201ceducate,\u201d fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement.
p14125
aVBruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank that the Kochs fund, said, \u201cThe problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it\u2019s been all chiefs and no Indians.
p14126
aVThere haven\u2019t been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it.
p14127
aVSo the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create a movement.\u201d With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, \u201ceveryone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out there\u2014people who can provide real ideological power.\u201d The Kochs, he said, are \u201ctrying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own policies.
p14128
aVReports indicate that the Tea Party Movement benefits from millions of dollars from conservative foundations that are derived from wealthy U.S. families and their business interests.
p14129
aVIt appears that money to organize and implement the Movement flows primarily through two conservative groups: Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks.
p14130
aVthe Sarah Scaife Foundation as having given a total of $2.96 million in funding to FreedomWorks.
p14131
aVThe Sarah Mellon Scaife Foundation is financed by the Mellon industrial, oil, and banking fortune.
p14132
aVThe Claude R. Lambe Foundation, also controlled by the Koch family, has donated more than $3 million to Americans for Prosperity.
p14133
aVThe Tea Party has also gotten substantial support in the form of promotion from Fox News Channel and its talk show hosts, including Glenn Beck.
p14134
aVKarl Frisch of Media Matters wrote that Fox News "frequently aired segments imploring its audience to get involved with tea-party protests across the country.
p14135
aV" Fox has also provided organizing information for the events on air and online.
p14136
aVWhile discussing the April 15 protests on his April 6 program, Glenn Beck suggested that viewers could "celebrate with Fox News" by either attending a protest or watching it on Fox News.
p14137
aVBeck stated that in addition to himself, hosts Neil Cavuto, Greta Van Susteren, and Sean Hannity would be "live" at different protests.
p14138
aVWhile Beck spoke, on-screen text labeled those protests as "FNC Tax Day Tea Parties.

p14140
aVNothing in this wall-of-text countered the evidence that I put forth that the tea party started as a ron paul fundraiser in 2007.
p14141
aVIn fact, i dont see how it relates at all.
p14142
aVThere is no debate to be had that the Kochs funded the latter tea party, the argument was on how it started, and how you lied about it.
p14143

aVThe reason they were raided was not, in fact, because they were throwing a "revolution-plotting party" as the title suggests, but rather because they sent a fake court summons to a county judge and a banker.
p14172
aVThe raid was for sending false court documents which were apparently legitimate-looking enough that an average person could confuse them for actual ones.

aVIf they "vanished" how do they know the whereabouts?
p14210
aVSounds like condoned theft, pretty much par for Ourpiehole's course.
p14211
aVMeanwhile, he's just going to waste more AZ taxpayer money on purchasing more overpowered weaponry (that will probably get "misappropriated," as well) and I'm sure he'll cost the taxpayers a few more million in lawsuits before his time is done.
p14212
aVThis guy can't leave AZ politics soon enough.
p14213
aVJust another fat old white guy being an asshole. 
p14214
aVGotta be the heat.
p14215
aVI wonder if he realizes how much he sounds like the leaders of the DPRK
p14216
aVWhat's the difference in Pearce being on the dole by accepting over $100,000.00 per year in taxpayer funded compensation and a poor person accepting public assistance?
p14217
aVYup...crazy people in charge of the government...not surprised. 
p14218
aV[deleted]
p14219
aVWhy not both? 
p14220
aVShhhhh the Liberatrians will hear you!
p14221
aVSterling paranoia there.

aVWhen they are that fearful of everything around them, it amazes me that they can even leave their houses.

aVI imagine she really believes that all immigrants are here to rape and pillage. 
p14224
aVSheesh!

aVThey are not Vikings.
p14226
aVThe idea that there are Islamic terrorist training camps in South America is a Republican thing.

aV[PoliticFact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-hezbollah-latin-america-poses-imm/) has a story.
p14228
aVThose St. Louis County cops are an embarrassment to police everywhere.
p14229
aVWhat they are doing has nothing to do with proper police procedure and everything to do with wannabe paramilitary overreaction.
p14230
aVDoesn't what they are doing come under Posse Comitatus?
p14231
aVThat military forces are not to handle internal policing.
p14232
aVIf that's not the definition of a military force I'm really confused.
p14233
aVThey are armed better than I was as a Marine in combat. 
p14234
aVPerfect way to tie both of Monday's rulings together into a protest. 
p14235
aVAm I missing the union tie in? 
p14236
aVMaybe the other one is last week.
p14237
aVI meant the abortion protest ruling.
p14238
aVAh,  Monday's other one was union free riders. 
p14239
aVThey need a special color for countries he has wanted to attack twice.
p14240
aVSince McCain dropped bombs on Vietnam and southeast Asia during the US war there after the US refused to hold elections because the Vietnamese would have voted in a communist into power, shouldn't that also be included?
p14241
aVBut the larger question is: How can such sociopaths be elected into office and repeatedly reelected into office?
p14242
aVIt's an oldie but goodie :).
p14243
aVNorth Carolina is so terrible...  Ugh....
p14244
aVIt wasn't always the case.
p14245
aVThings were pretty good before Art Pope financed Gov.
p14246
aVMcCrory and other Republicans that took over the state.
p14247
aVIt's an ALEC testing ground now.
p14248
aVSadly, it went to shit rather quickly.
p14249
aVNo, I know.
p14250
aVI live there.
p14251
aVI'd never be so rude as to insult a state I don't live in.
p14252
aV....Except North Korea.
p14253
aVYeah, my folks retired there.
p14254
aVIt's a shame.
p14255
aVSuch a beautiful state with a rich Appalachian culture.
p14256
aVPretty noticeable difference in the atmosphere of government in the past fifteen years they've lived there.
p14257
aVAll gutted for some short term profits for a select few &amp; at the expense of everyone else that actually lives there.
p14258
aV can't help but think that if someone followed the money here it would lead to bankers seeking to privatize drinking water.
p14259
aVMake no mistake, in most areas (unless you are catching &amp; drinking rain water) these fracking chemicals will eventually end up your drinking water.
p14260
aVThis is what happens when maintaining the status quo for business becomes more important than national security or humanity as a whole.
p14261
aVIt's reached a point where they are not just anti-science, but anti-survival. 
p14262
aVstrike another blow for ignorance!
p14263
aVThere are a couple of inter-working parts in the machinery of right-wing foolishness.
p14264
aVRight-wingers equate the government with 'giving money to no-good lazy minorities'.
p14265
aVTherefore, starve the government of revenue, and create tax cuts which give money back to hard-working (white) people.
p14266
aVMake brutal cuts to government -- destroy public education, food stamps, public libraries, police, fire departments, zoning departments, sewage treatment plants, who cares because I've got mine and fuck everybody else.
p14267
aVBut for some reason, it doesn't work.
p14268
aVThe economy crumbles because the government, which is supposed to maintain infrastructure and public institutions on which we all (including private business) depend, has been starved of revenue.
p14269
aVWhen there's a recession and businesses lay everyone off, there's no government to keep spending, keep the money flowing through the economy, and keep people employed.
p14270
aVBut the wingers really don't care enough about their country for the destruction of their country to even matter to them.
p14271
aVThey hate above all the citizens of their own country, the 'lazy, no-good' minorities.
p14272
aVSo they enthusiastically collaborate to destroy their own country's government, encouraged by other racist traitors such as the right-wing media (Beck, Limbaugh, Hannity, Drudge, Savage, Levin, etc).
p14273
aVThese traitors, of course, are only enriching themselves at the expense of the fools who listen to them and fervently believe in their stories.
p14274
aVRacism, hatred, and greed are the core of right-wing thinking.
p14275
aVBrownbackistan...
p14276
aVThis is the free market, GOP utopia the Republicans would love to inflict upon all of America were they given half a chance.
p14277
aVMost of the the anti-tax conservatives will just pick up and move to another state when Kansas hits rock bottom. 
p14278
aV"Bleed revenue"?
p14279
aVThey're not collecting it, which isn't the same thing.
p14280
aVAnd taxes aren't revenue or profit.
p14281
aVOnly profit-making enterprises generate revenue.
p14282
aVTaxes are only taxes.
p14283
aVAnd it's no surprise that they need to cut back since they collected less taxes.
p14284
aVPeople in Kansas (and in the rest of the U.S.) are free to pay extra taxes if they think state and local governments will spend the money better.
p14285
aVYou really love to eat the right-wing bullshit with a fork and knife, don't you?
p14286
aVYou confuse a discussion about the policy with the backing of the party.
p14287
aVAnd while there are many people that have drank deep of the GOP Koolaid, you sounds as if you drank the opposite flavor.
p14288
aVMost people in Washington are blatant opportunists who back whatever they need to back to get re-elected.
p14289
aVIt's ridiculous to assume "the economy will crumble" because of "lack of infrastructure".
p14290
aVDoes that sound like something the powerful corporate lobbyists want to have happen?
p14291
aVIt's about stealing the money for the rich.
p14292
aVIt's a lot easier to steal when it's in the hands of the politicians who got elected by the rich, regardless of their political affiliation.
p14293
aVAh, yes.
p14294
aV'The Dems and Reps are exactly the same' gambit.
p14295
aVThey are not exactly the same.
p14296
aVOne party gives health care to millions of Americans, saving many from disease and/or bankruptcy.
p14297
aVThe other party fights tooth and nail to take health care away from Americans.
p14298
aVOne party wants you to vote, the other party wants to keep you from voting.
p14299
aVOne party wants to make a treaty with Iran, the other wants to go to war with Iran.
p14300
aVThey are not the same, and your false belief that they are the same makes certain people very happy.
p14301
aVNo, I didn't post that.
p14302
aVBut if you would like to believe that Democrats operate out of the goodness of their hearts and not because health insurance lobbyists are making millions off the current system, you believe that.
p14303
aVAnd as far as Iran goes, the 47 dumbasses that signed the letter [aren't alone.
p14304
aV](http://nypost.com/2015/04/04/ny-democrats-speak-out-against-iran-nuke-deal/)\u000a\u000aAnd if you want to see how Democrats well third party candidates on a local level, feel free to run.
p14305
aVThey're fine with voting, as long as there's no other actual competition.
p14306
aVJust ask the Greens.
p14307
aVAh, the NY Post.
p14308
aVMy favorite go-to tabloid for nonsense and bullshit.
p14309
aVYou are deflecting and evading.
p14310
aVOne party wants to keep people from voting using Voter ID laws; the other wants people to vote. 
p14311
aVIf you're going to tell me what I think, then you're having a conversation with yourself.
p14312
aVIf it was a little boy that was raped, they probably would have no-knock raided a few houses and NEVER used the term *promiscuous*
p14313
aVNice to see a well run sensitivity training program.
p14314
aVObviously none of them are fathers, and I hope they never are. 
p14315
aVThis might be true, but if the sports franchise's arena, field, or stadium is rented out for concerts, it could add more cultural activities which enrich our lives. 
p14316
aVI really wonder why they are doubling down so hard on this.
p14317
aVThis is politically very stupid.
p14318
aVI guess the republican ideals of local government and states/citizens rights being prioritized over a strong federal government no longer apply.
p14319
aVWho would enforce such a federal warrant?
p14320
aVThe DEA/FBI?
p14321
aVPretty sure the mayor is guarded by the DC police and wouldn't recognize the warrant .
p14322
aVWould LOVE to see this played out in a court. 
p14323
aVThreatening an elected leader with jail for doing his job and obeying his constituents - I might be able to think of a better symbol for right-wing authoritarianism, but it won't be easy.
p14324
aVPlease, please call them on that bluff and lets hope it's not a bluff.
p14325
aVNothing would help change opinion more.
p14326
aVrepublicans really pushing that small government initiative i see!
p14327
aVI'd like to see this one go to the supreme court. 
p14328
aVWhat about smaller companies that don't have billions in profits but still need large full-time employee bases?
p14329
aVPrivate companies not backed by shareholders and whatnot?
p14330
aVSure it's great for Wal-Mart, but what happens when you get let go because the smaller company can't afford  50+ health plans?
p14331
aVThis is one concern I didn't see addressed.
p14332
aVDoes anyone have info on how that turned out?
p14333
aVObamacare has only been selectively and inconsistently enforced.
p14334
aVWho could know ahead of time what effect that might have?
p14335
aVPeople can honestly support nationalizing health care or some set of specific provisions or whatever.
p14336
aVBut really, no one can honestly support the Affordable Care Act as a whole because no one can have read it.
p14337
aVIt's deliberately obfuscated in the text to make it difficult to read and understand.
p14338
aVI don't think it even technically qualifies as a law, philosophically speaking, because one of the properties of a law (as opposed to a secret decree) is that laws have to be publicly readable, and this isn't.
p14339
aVCourse, many of our so-called "laws" these days wouldn't really qualify under that reasonable standard either.
p14340
aVI'm not saying Obamacare is alone in that.
p14341
aV"Free Market" in operation.
p14342
aVBig news here Laura: we all do. 
p14343
aVIngraham does not sound like a Native American name to me...
p14344
aVIf she had one, it'd be Shitting Bull.
p14345
aVHe's speaking as though it hasn't already happened...
p14346
aVI have to think that if we manage to vote against our own best interests, again, and the GOP takes the senate, that America will be hardly recognizable as a democracy in four years.
p14347
aVEspecially if the Democrats manage to lose the presidency in '16.
p14348
aVThat the Republican Congress and the conservative SCOTUS will become very cooperative with each other and solidify a true Oligarchy, if it isn't already.
p14349
aVObama is not even much of a moderate financially and is far too willing to give up in the face heavy opposition and lobbying.
p14350
aVIt would put him in the difficult position of being the only defense left.
p14351
aVOne of saddest things is that many of those people who are dependent on current social programs like SS are likely to be the swing vote that puts the GOP into a position to change or outright destroy the very programs that they depend on while the rest of the (non)voters sit on their hands. 
p14352
aVIF the GOP manages to take the Senate in 2014, my "hope" is that shit will get much much worse for the majority of working class Americans (trash the ACA, drastic SS and Medicare cuts, further austerity measures, further abortion restrictions, no minimum wage increase, continued or increased wars, and more tax breaks for the rich, etc.
p14353
aV) and they show up en masses in 2016 to actually vote in their own best interests.
p14354
aVStill, it will be a long and painful two years and it will leave much to be overturned and corrected.
p14355
aVBut honestly, Hillary waiting for her turn in 2016 isn't that appealing either.
p14356
aVOh god no.
p14357
aVHilary is the least appealing candidate I can think of.
p14358
aVShe is totally bought and happily I think.
p14359
aVOne of the things that scares me is what they will do to voting regs and regulatory agencies.
p14360
aVThey hold the purse strings to de-fund whomever they wish.
p14361
aVAlso they can pass appointments and judgeship's that would damage the country for decades to come.
p14362
aVThis is the true mischief that the Bush admin with a sympathetic Congress did: they appointed as many of their own people as they could and we still feel the results of that now.
p14363
aVA lot of the bad decisions that have been blamed on Obama are made by those politicized appointee.
p14364
aVWith an aligned Congress it really easy to push whomever they want into the regulatory and enforcement agencies, and they are hard to dislodge once in office. 
p14365
aVYeah, good points on funding of the regulatory agencies and appointments.
p14366
aVIt's going to get pretty ugly (much uglier).
p14367
aVIt's stunning how one of our two main parties essentially just represents the interests of a tiny handful of people.
p14368
aVright, but also consider that party representing interests of "a tiny handful of people" will be the majority in the Senate.
p14369
aVThat's not gerrymandering and deals for your hometown, that's the majority of people in a state voting for R vs D. \u000a\u000aGranted, it doesn't make their ideas more right or wrong, but they are certainly popular in lots of places.
p14370
aVThe fact that they can get people to vote against their own self-interest is pretty annoying.
p14371
aVAnd let's not forget the voter I.D.
p14372
aVlaws to prevent "fraud," the fact that election day is NOT a national holiday, it's in November, etc.
p14373
aVYeah, we really need to lose one famous person holiday and make election day a full-on federal holiday.
p14374
aVThat son of Washington state's richest banking family, Bill Gates, used his family connections to sell IBM a computer operating system that he literally did not possess.
p14375
aVGates then licensed one and then broke the license agreement when he was wealthy enough to afford the lawyers and court costs.
p14376
aVGates is now the richest person in the world...
p14377
aVSo the Kochs stole oil from Native Americans?
p14378
aVBig deal, didn't we steal the entire continent from them and break countless treaties with them?!
p14379
aVAll the other examples of corruption and corner-cutting by the Kochs are *routine* for businesses.
p14380
aVThe bottom line is that the wealth of the planet should be shared with all people.
p14381
aVThat's the fundamental principle we're ignoring.
p14382
aV&gt; "Behind every great fortune there is a great crime.
p14383
aV" -- Honore de Balzac (20 May 1799 - 18 August 1850).
p14384
aVI'm not sure if it's what they've done (You're right, not that unusual for big business) as the sanctimonious hypocrisy that surrounds it.
p14385
aVThey are so unflinchingly slimy at every turn.
p14386
aVI find them to be terrifying because they seem like they would love to fire up the gas ovens and fill them with anyone considered to be in their way.
p14387
aVThey have no humanity at all, not even, apparently, any grasp of what it is to be human.
p14388
aVCan you imagine what kind of a world it will be if they get what they want?  
p14389
aV&gt; Can you imagine what kind of a world it will be if they get what they want?
p14390
aVIMO it'd be little different from what Warren Buffett, Bill Gates or any other capitalist is proposing.
p14391
aVOur economic system is inherently unfair and unsustainable; we're ignoring that core fundamental principle noted above.
p14392
aV&gt; "Capitalism is the astounding belief that the most wickedest of men will do the most wickedest of things for the greatest good of everyone.
p14393
aV" -- Famous capitalist economist John Maynard Keynes.
p14394
aVNice quote from Keynes.
p14395
aVI like that one.
p14396
aVThat's always what has astounded me about Libertarians.
p14397
aVThat is the base assumption of their belief.
p14398
aVThat bad men will do good things just 'cuz.
p14399
aVMarket forces my ass.
p14400
aVWhich "free market" was that.
p14401
aVHas there ever been such a thing?  
p14402
aVThat's what happens when you prioritize tax cuts over roads and schools.
p14403
aVNeoliberal economics is basically throwing money out the window, after you do it you don't get the money back, but you still need it too survive.
p14404
aVThat's where the rest of us come in to save their asses.
p14405
aVThis is a major economic problem in pretty much all red states but almost no is talking about it.
p14406
aVThese states have only been GOP dominated for about 20 years and they are already falling apart.
p14407
aVInfrastructure?
p14408
aVPublic education?
p14409
aVEnergy?
p14410
aVHealth care?
p14411
aVThere is no reason to suspect these states will stop voting GOP anytime soon and little suggesting the GOP will change its economic policy.
p14412
aVThis is going to get much worse and continue for awhile.
p14413
aVThe one thing I would like to point out is that 60% of Alaska is owned by the Federal Government.
p14414
aVAt least a portion of the money spent in Alaska is to manage those Federal Lands.
p14415
aVOtherwise, mostly agree that most red states don't understand how dependent they are on the Federal Government.
p14416
aVNice, but the people of Pennsylvania should be demanding *full* *legalization* and an end to the drug war from our plutocratic, non-representative government.
p14417
aVWe need to learn from Portugal's 10+ year policy: Decriminalize *all* drugs.
p14418
aVPortugal has shown that this will gut drug-related crime and does not result in skyrocketing drug use (Portugal has the lowest rate of heroin addiction of all of Europe) like our drug warriors claim.
p14419
aVA majority of Americans want marijuana to be *legal.
p14420
aV*\u000a\u000aNew ideas and politicians/parties that represent common Americans (and not corporations, the status quo and the rich) are what's needed.
p14421
aVWe need to demand more.
p14422
aVEdit: Typos
p14423
aVWow, even more questions about jurisdiction?
p14424
aVWhat about state police?
p14425
aVWhat does the Governor think about this action?
p14426
aVYou're right, it's a confusing jurisdictional scenario.
p14427
aVMy prediction: The clock is ticking before our corrupt national government has its Supreme ~~Corp.~~ Court issue a ruling that strikes down Washington and Colorado's legalization laws and the federal government goes on a PR kick re-demonizing marijuana.
p14428
aVPhilly, the birthplace of American democracy.
p14429
aVGood for you.
p14430
aVNope.
p14431
aVWe just don't want to know about it.
p14432
aVWe don't want to know that freedom and equality take more than lip service, and just  because we say we are the most free country in the world doesn't make it so, and as long as we can get away with our tv's and our toys and our greedy greedy ways it's not going to change.  
p14433
aV&gt; We just don't want to know about it.
p14434
aVI call BS.
p14435
aVOf course we know what to do about it.
p14436
aVMuch of this involves rewriting Reagan's tax changes and the entire pro-corporate push that has been going on for the past few decades.
p14437
aVIt will mean reintroducing into the tax system the idea that "earned income" (wages, etc.
p14438
aV) should be taxed at a lower rate than "unearned income" (capital gains, dividends, interest, speculation income, etc.).
p14439
aVWe *know* what needs to be done.
p14440
aVThe problem is that, as Jimmy Carter stated, the US is no longer a "functioning democracy" -- we're a plutocracy or an oligarchy.
p14441
aVThe rich control *both* of the 2 political parties that control the US.
p14442
aVThus, people are powerless to stop the tyranny of the US government unless we start seeing mass protests and more uprisings, and start refusing to support the 2 corrupt parties that rule the US.
p14443
aVYou mean we have to get off our asses and put down our cell phones?
p14444
aVWe have to get out in the streets and do battle with the hyper-armed police forces that work for the Oligarchs?
p14445
aVLove to see it, but I'm not holding my breath. 
p14446
aVThe thing is, human nature dictates that most people think that they might one day be one of the people who wind up with a disproportionate share of wealth.
p14447
aVFor that reason they are okay with the rules as they are.
p14448
aVThe truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people will not become wealthy.
p14449
aVThe number of jobs available for humans to do is decreasing as technology develops.
p14450
aVThe only thing worse than building a fortune by taking advantage of your fellow human being is replacing your fellow human being with a robot or piece of software.
p14451
aVBut that is exactly what is happening and its rate of progress is growing exponentially.
p14452
aVThe only thing that is constant in the universe is change.
p14453
aVAnd the change that is going to have to come is the manner in which wealth is distributed.
p14454
aVI hope that this change comes in a peaceful manner.     \u000a\u000a

p14559
aVWe may find incremental increase in the usage of the postal service.
p14560
aVHowever, the net result is declining volume for USPS (and thus revenue), and, if we subscribe to a market-based idea, that means USPS should offer less service when compared to the past.
p14561

p14599
aVInstead, our corporate mass media will cover the election as a horse race -- endlessly talking about personality, charisma, amount of money gathered, etc., etc.
p14600
aVBut who knows, maybe the mass media would choose marijuana as one of the popular [wedge issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue#United_States) so they can pretend that there are significant differences between the two halves of the capitalist ruling duopoly that runs the country...\u000a\u000a&gt; "The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.

aVI mean, given the way many politicians bend in the breeze according to what opinion polls say is the prevailing political winds, it is rather refreshing to see a politician sticking with his 10th Amendment-violating and civil liberties-crushing views.
p14607
aVThat's doubly true of Christie and this issue given the fact that across the country a majority of Americans want marijuana legalized.
p14608
aVSo kudos to Christie for sticking to his views!

aVTed Cruz not only gets the climate science wrong, he got the history about Galileo wrong as well.
p14631
aVCruz said that contemporary \u201cglobal warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers.\u201d \u000a\u000a\u201cYou know it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier,\u201d he said.
p14632
aVIt was never "accepted scientific wisdom" that the Earth is flat.
p14633
aVBy the time that Galileo was born (1564) scientists, navigators and the educated class had known for almost two millennia that the Earth was in actuality a sphere.
p14634
aVIn fact, the geographer, mathematician and astronomer Eratosthenes of Cyrene (Who died in 194 BCE), knowing that the Earth was a sphere based on the work of earlier astronomers, calculated the actual size of the Earth to within a few percent, as well as calculating the tilt of the Earth's axis.
p14635
aVThis was over two centuries before Jesus was ever born.
p14636
aVAdditionally, Eratosthenes was well known to the Church throughout it's history and even Columbus frequently mentioned Eratosthenes in his journals and letters.
p14637
aVThe truth is that Galileo was eventually ~~excommunicated from~~ tried by the Church and imprisoned for the remainder of his life for his views on the Copernican System, as well as for mocking the reactionary Catholic dogmatics in his treatise on the subject, NOT because he challenged the concept of a "Flat Earth".
p14638
aVNot only is that claim factually wrong, it is simply ignorant.
p14639
aVThe reality is that Galileo relied on the best available scientific evidence, something that Cruz unilaterally rejects with regard to climate science.
p14640
aVAnd Cruz does so all because it is politically and philosophically inconvenient.
p14641
aVEdit: Galileo was in fact not excommunicated.
p14642

p14686
aVI don't know the direct jobs created by a project should be the metric considered.
p14687
aVI would imagine that it's more likely to create jobs indirectly through an increase in economic output.
p14688
aVIt might be helpful to think about the inverse situation: we could pay 50,000 people to dig holes in the ground and another 50,000 people to fill them in - 100,000 new jobs!
p14689
aVExcept, we've not increased economic output, so we've just devalued the dollar and hurt the economy (unless you subscribe to Keynsian economics, which would assert that the increase in demand would spur an increase in economic output).
p14690
aV50,000 holes in the ground don't have the potential to leak and enter one of the most important aquifers in the nation.
p14691
aVAll to simply fall back on oil dependency and extract some more profit for transnational corporations amidst an environmental crisis.
p14692
aVSenator Bernie Sanders says it best, imho:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u000a\u000a&gt;When people tell you that Keystone is a jobs program, they\u2019re not telling you the truth.
p14693
aVAccording to the State Department, it will create about 2,000 temporary construction jobs over a two-year period, and then about fifty permanent jobs.
p14694
aVIf you want a jobs program, let\u2019s rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
p14695
aVInvest a trillion dollars into doing that, and create 13 million jobs, not 2,000 jobs.
p14696
aV&gt;This oil, at least a significant part of this oil is going to be exported to Asia.
p14697
aVIn fact, there are at least three different studies, including one at Cornell, which suggest that because of the refinery infrastructure, domestic prices will actually go up.
p14698
aV**So here we are doing something which will exacerbate climate change, will create a minimal amount of jobs, will enrich the companies that own the oil fields and who do the refining, and at the same time, raise gas prices in the United States.
p14699
aVThis does not make a lot of sense to me.
p14700
aV**\u000a\u000aTL;DR There's a lot better things we could do for our country's future than build KXL or your silly example of digging and filling holes.\u000a

p14702
aVI don't know enough about the project or its potential to impact individual or environmental rights to say whether I support it.
p14703
aVThis article was largely focused on the purported lack of economic benefits, and the main argument was "it's only 50 jobs" - which I wanted people to consider from another angle.
p14704
aVBut I will say, in your example or alternate uses for the money -  what money?
p14705
aVIsn't this being built with private capital? 
p14706
aVThe economic potential of KXL is for a very few already rich people and a handful of jobs, big whoop.
p14707
aVSeriously, 50 jobs is so minuscule, it's not even worth taking into consideration.
p14708
aVAnd not buying your trickle down suggestion that it will "create jobs indirectly through an increase in economic output.
p14709
aV" Don't believe the hype.
p14710

p14713
aVSo would the gas users (mostly diesel).
p14714
aVThe environment will "pay," as well.
p14715
aVPerhaps most importantly, the taxpayers will be paying, as it would be [subsidized](http://priceofoil.org/2012/02/08/keystone-xl-benefits-from-taxpayer-subsidies/).
p14716
aVUS taxpayers paying so transnationals can make a bunch of money...\u000a\u000a&gt;The refineries that are linked to the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline as committed shippers will receive between $1 billion and $1.8 billion in tax breaks.
p14717
aVThey are paid specifically for investing in equipment to process the heavy sour oil the pipeline promises to deliver.
p14718
aV&gt;The largest of these refineries, Motiva, is half owned by Saudi Refining Inc., and will receive between $680 million and $1.1 billion in U.S. taxpayer support.
p14719
aV&gt;Keystone XL, like all oil industry projects, is enabled by substantial taxpayer subsidies.
p14720
aVThree of the refineries that are planning to process the pipeline\u2019s oil have invested in special equipment to handle the extra heavy tar sands oil.
p14721
aVAccording to our conservative estimates, the U.S. taxpayer is subsidizing these investments to the tune of $1.0-1.8 billion.
p14722
aVEdit: Unsure who compensates for invoking eminent domain to seize the land. 
p14723
aVYou had me at subsidies.
p14724
aVI'm firmly against corporate welfare. 
p14725
aVThe Republicans don't message well.
p14726
aVIt isn't all about jobs.

aVMore jobs will be brought back or created when the oil gets flowing to refineries.
p14728
aVAlso, it's about having and using our own oil supply and not being dependent, in any measure, on foreign oil.
p14729
aVWe could be the oil supplier for the world and rake in the dough to where taxes could go down for everyone. 
p14730
aVNews for ya, refined KXL oil is going to be shipped to Asia.
p14731
aVWe just get to let it leak as it crosses our country and enjoy the environmental impacts of increased refining of this sludge while transnationals profit.
p14732
aVIt will do nothing to increase our "oil independence.
p14733
aV" Especially since oil companies want the oil export embargo lifted, which means we'll stop paying the reduced rates we currently do and will be paying international rates for barrels.
p14734
aVThere' have been several studies that indicate that KXL will raise the price of gas in the US.
p14735
aVOne thing: none of the tar sands oil's going to the U.S. Too sulfurous.
p14736
aVIt's a lousy kind of oil.
p14737
aVSo that's all most likely going to China.
p14738
aVNot one drop of that'll be used here.
p14739
aVI rather expect the profits will not be used to lower your taxes either.
p14740
aVI have some grave doubts that the cheapest possible pipelines run the cheapest possible way will be exceedingly safe, especially since there's effectively no pipeline safety agency in this country.
p14741
aVThere *is*, but they have to ask permission to send strongly-worded letters.
p14742
aVThis'll end badly.

aV&gt;1 in 25 Americans was arrested\u000a\u000aI wonder if they're taking the n=total arrest and dividing it by population.
p14744
aVIf so, this is very misleading.  
p14745
aVIt will be very interesting to see people's opinions on this.
p14746
aVI would think that there will be a big scream of No!
p14747
aV....... but in actual fact it is the perfect way to fight Crime and solve many unsolved Crimes !
p14748
aV............  just saying !
p14749
aVIf you could guarantee that it would only be used to solve violent crime and no one else would ever get access, I would agree.
p14750
aVCan't make that guarantee and even if they did our law enforcement agencies have abused such trust in the past too many times to have any credibility.
p14751
aVLet me start by saying I'm just an OAP in England, and have NO interest in law enforcement.
p14752
aVFingerprints have helped solve many crimes.
p14753
aVI do believe that DNA identification would be a very big deterrent to all aspects of crime.
p14754
aVIt astounded me some years ago when a  30 year old unsolved murder was solved because a DUI driver had his DNA taken on his arrest......
p14755
aVThe driver was not the guilty person, his uncle was !
p14756
aVThat says a great deal about testing.
p14757
aVAlso this last week an American guy was released from 30 years in prison and proved innocent of a double murder by his DNA !
p14758
aVJust curious.... What are you afraid of?
p14759
aVSo what if someone has access to your DNA profile?
p14760
aVAnd are those fears worth letting some criminals free or keeping some innocent people in jail?
p14761
aVGenetic profiling and discrimination.
p14762
aVAnd yes, I think that potential (likely?
p14763
aV) horror is worse than not solving some crimes.
p14764
aVLaw enforcement are already using data to try to predict crime, turning innocent people into suspected criminals without them giving any direct cause for suspicion.
p14765
aVI can easily see a couple of more steps down this slippery slope leading to people getting things like extra surveillance of their lives, restrictions on where they can go, or even detention based on some supposed proclivity to types of criminal activity based on DNA.
p14766
aVAnd God help us if/when corporations get this data.
p14767
aV&gt; Law enforcement are already using data to try to predict crime, turning innocent people into suspected criminals without them giving any direct cause for suspicion.
p14768
aVWhat do you mean by this statement?

aVBullshit, the official government stat, which omits people who gave up looking for a job because they sent out applications from 2008 to 2014 and never got a job offer, might be lower than it was, but real unemployment is definitely higher than it was.
p14783
aVSomeone didn't read the article.
p14784
aVI did read the article, it said the official unemployment rate is the same, not lower than it was in 08, and other indicators of true unemployment are worse than they were in 08.
p14785
aVThat makes the statement mostly, if not entirely false, not mostly true.
p14786

aV&gt; They tried a non-violent revolution in the Ukraine\u000a\u000aI disagree, Ukraine is a bad example -- "they" didn't try it.
p14858
aVThe US government, directly and by stooge NGOs, funded Ukrainian dissidents and arranged a "colored revolution" -- just like our evil government has done to many countries, democratic and non-democratic alike.

p14886
aVIllinois cops are about as shady as they come. 
p14887
aVWhat's really crazy is that - typically - the culture has shifted along with the powerful in order to validate their way of living, and now this is considered a bar for success: to make one's living without having to work at all, or at least as little as humanly possible.
p14888
aVThat's always been true, yes, but in the past it was considered a kind of pipe dream; now that's what *everyone* is after.
p14889
aVThe elevation of parasitism has had terrible consequences for society, I think, and it creates a standard of living that only the prenatally, preternaturally wealthy can live up to without running up enormous debt, taking advantage of others or engaging in outright crime.
p14890
aVThe only beneficial argument that can be made for it is that the diarrhetic abuse of money it involves is good for local economies, in the unlikely event some of it lands there instead of in multinationals or back into the same coffers it came from.
p14891
aVBut what good has this mentality done for this country, or any other, that a true work ethic couldn't surpass? 
p14892
aVI totally agree with you about the setting of unrealistic goals for society.
p14893
aVIts been called "conspicuous consumption" (Thorstein Veblen - in his "[The Theory of the Leisure Class](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/833)" - free on the net and very much worth reading) or more recently, "Affluenza".
p14894
aVIt is extremely destructive carried to the level it is in America today.
p14895
aVBut that is not really the norm around the world.
p14896
aVThere's another issue which few are bringing up as we need to.
p14897
aVWe all need to wrap our heads around the implications of the fact that the raw numbers of people required to work to maintain society *at its current level*, is falling exponentially.
p14898
aVAnd we're being discouraged from making the necessary adjustments which we would need to do to keep employment high.
p14899
aV(We would need to stop trying to beat creativity out of people, and give everybody a much more complete education) Instead they are trying to slow down change.
p14900
aVWe need to increase the average skill level of everybody so that we're living in the 21st century and not the 20th.
p14901
aVBut, that will mean that new technologies replace others very rapidly.
p14902
aVWhich is happening anyway.
p14903
aVThats what's changing.
p14904
aVThe shift has been making business more and more profitable because the need for unskilled, semiskilled and even skilled workers - and therefore, business costs, are falling.
p14905
aVVirtual companies are now common where the workers are scattered around the globe.
p14906
aVWhat would you call it where somebody has created some new product or service and they have set up a company to manufacture it and sell it and automated the entire thing, from beginning to end?
p14907
aVSome companies exist just to make the products of thousands of other companies.
p14908
aVOther companies exist just to store, ship and deliver the products of thousands or even millions of small companies.
p14909
aVPreviously, those companies would have had a much higher cost of entry, because each had to maintain a building somewhere, and employ sales and warehouse staff, and a shipping department.
p14910
aVWhich is expensive.
p14911
aVNow they don't.
p14912
aVPeople are working smarter.
p14913
aVIn ten or fifteen years, the level of automation will be several times more than today.
p14914
aVLots more people will be unemployed because the volume and number of tasks which people are needed to do for pay will be far smaller than it is today.
p14915
aVIt will be much cheaper to do those tasks with some form of technology.
p14916
aVWill politicians still be saying then that they don't have a work ethic?
p14917
aVNo, that will be impossible, because barring some miracle of shifting national priorities to education and business incubation, most of society by far, will be unemployed or close to it.
p14918
aVWhere is the discussion about that that we need to be having?
p14919
aVMaintaining society at its current level is not conducive to game changing new technologies, and society will always need those who are willing to work if it's going anywhere other than the unhappy fate Rome met.
p14920
aVThere is a nihilism in believing that it doesn't matter that the goal of an entire culture is to either do nothing, or to live a dissipate, self-interested existence mostly consuming resources and benefiting from the growing portion of society who do actual and necessary labor for ever-dwindling return.
p14921
aVThe way you talk here, there's a utopian robot society right around the corner where indolence is no crime at all, and the need for real work is nearing extinction (and falling in value at the same time).
p14922
aVThat isn't, will never be true.
p14923
aV**edit**: The way societies get by with this mentality is by utilizing slave labor, and that's what's going on now: you seem to think I just don't understand things on your end of the economic spectrum, and maybe that's so, but this is what's going on on mine.
p14924
aVThere are companies and businesses all over the world -- all over the US -- that operate in an unsustainable and parasitic way by taking advantage of economic or political desperation to pay real workers next to nothing.
p14925
aVThat is the source of 'lower costs of labor' and ultimately the potential to amass fortunes so large that individual work can be foregone.
p14926
aVThe global economy has created an endless pool of cheap labor, and when the standard of living rises to the point where a true share of the benefits is expected by workers in one place, multinational companies simply resource their labor elsewhere.
p14927
aVThat is the big picture.
p14928
aVThat is the framework that supports these utopian ideals of a world where people can live a (forgive the term) cancerous existence by amassing and devouring resources without the consequences inherent to input/output.
p14929
aVIt takes a hundred men to hold one financial golden child out of the ordinary ups and downs of life, including the necessity of doing what one has to instead of what one wants to. 
p14930
aV&gt;The way you talk here, there's a utopian robot society right around the corner where indolence \u000a\u000aIndolence being wasting time?
p14931
aVNot doing anything constructive, or not doing work for money?
p14932
aVNot doing work for money will be common because to do work for money people will need to be better all the time.
p14933
aVLook at the sciences, where people in most of the sciences (with several notable exceptions) really have to be PhD level and have published to get a good "career" level job.
p14934
aV&gt;is no crime at all, and the need for real work is nearing extinction (and falling in value at the same time).
p14935
aVThat isn't, will never be true.
p14936
aVThe definition of "real work" is changing.
p14937
aVI do agree with you about the predatory and unhealthy nature of the forced overconsumption in society.
p14938
aVAlso, that shifting money around isn't working.
p14939
aVI think that a lot of elements of our society are really out of control in a bad way.
p14940
aVBut, the changes being brought by technology (freeing up a lot of time for other things) has the potential to be very good.
p14941
aVThe definition of real work is changing because of the ability of technology to now effortlessly do so much of what we considered to be real work yesterday.
p14942
aVYou know the legend of John Henry?
p14943
aV&gt;There are companies and businesses all over the world -- all over the US -- that operate in an unsustainable and parasitic way by taking advantage of economic or political desperation to pay real workers next to nothing.
p14944
aVI agree with you, thats really become a serious problem, well, its always been a serious problem, but as some of society's tolerance for it is ending, another part is saying "with supply being so high and demand falling, wages should be falling to zero".
p14945
aV&gt;That is the source of 'lower costs of labor' and ultimately the potential to amass fortunes so large that individual work can be foregone.
p14946
aVYes, in part thats true but there also is this other thing going on that I think is rapidly becoming the dominant cause of this race to the bottom on wages and working conditions and that is not such an easy moral call.
p14947
aVbecause the underlying cause of it- is good.
p14948
aVLots of prices should be falling that are not, because of special interests and corruption.
p14949
aVLow wages could be said to hold back the development and adoption of new technologies somewhat and higher wages to increase their rate of adoption, but in the long run, their effect on that is very small.
p14950
aVWe should have higher wages because societies that do have higher wages seem to be better prepared for thse changes.
p14951
aVI dont think wages are, or should be, as large a chunk of the costs of a business.
p14952
aVBusinesses should be trying to do whatever they do in the smartest way possible.
p14953
aVSmart isn't always more technology.
p14954
aVSometimes its smart not to use technology for some reason.
p14955
aVSlack has its uses.
p14956
aVEfficiency shouldn't be put on the pedestal it has been.
p14957
aVBut- anyway, bla bla bla..
p14958
aVThe main thing I need to say is that what's happening now is really quite new in its scale and its potential impact on how we do things.
p14959
aVIts telling us we need to be better members of society.
p14960
aVNo man is an island and no business should be predatory.
p14961
aVWe all have an interest in weathering these changes together.
p14962
aVThe shift is really the biggest challenge the human race has ever had to deal with and how we deal with it is the single most important question in the history of mankind.
p14963
aVI agree with most of what you say, but you have to be careful to understand this other thing is happening too.
p14964
aVIf you don't recognize it, you'll be unable to adjust to it the way you need to.
p14965

aVSo now what?
p14996
aVIs the city going to open a check printing kiosk for slavery reparations, on the current non slave holding taxpayers, out side of city hall.
p14997
aVIf so, put several check cashing places around it so those money pigs can rob them of their money.
p14998
aVThe FCC is clearly run by insufferably fetid buffoons.
p14999
aVWell yes, but the FCC doesn't create bills.
p15000
aV&gt; The bill, introduced late Wednesday by Representative Bob Latta, an Ohio Republican, would block the FCC from reclassifying broadband as a common-carrier telecom service 
p15001
aVIt almost appears that a second cable system might be being built here, at least it seems to be looking that way.
p15002
aVIt's getting more and more confusing. 
p15003
aVA couple questions here:\u000a\u000aWhy would any idiot anywhere lease anything for more than a lifetime to a company that has shown zero performance other than projections?
p15004
aVWith no consequences for poor performance even.
p15005
aVWhy would anyone think that a private for profit company would do a cheaper job better than a government?
p15006
aVWhen has that ever happened other than closely supervised companies like the post office which only runs at a loss because Congress won't let it alone, and it's still the best most comprehensive delivery service we have. \u000a\u000a
p15007
aVOh here is this crazy idea that you might or might not have heard but it's called competition.
p15008
aVYou see when there are several companies that deliver a similar type of product or service at the same price in order to get a better market share they need to do a few things but most often they a) find more efficient cost structures to lower the price or b) sell a product or service that has a better perceived value than the competition, regardless of the price.
p15009
aVA private company needs to make a profit to survive and if you took an accounting class you would know that it requires selling A LOT of that product or service and the only way they can do that is by becoming more efficient.
p15010
aVWhy is government less efficient than a for-profit entity?
p15011
aVSimply because the risk involved does not effect the government.
p15012
aVA private business would cease to exist if it made the wrong investment decision while the government would simply continue operating at a loss and the poor decision would be passed on us, the tax payers.
p15013
aVThe post office is not doing well because its failing to adapt its cost structure to the age of the Internet.
p15014
aVAll of those pensions that have been promised for the employees can no longer be paid for since the revenue has dropped.
p15015
aVThat's why companies like UPS have started to compete with the postal service in order to become more efficient in every aspect and believe me, they are now a case-study for how well they operate.
p15016
aVActually I think you're wrong in a couple places.
p15017
aVThis competition concept of which you speak needs to have corporations which actually compete, as opposed to devour the competition to monopolize and collude to fix pricing to what they need this week.
p15018
aVThere is no free market anymore, and it's not the government that made that happen.
p15019
aVWhat the government has done is secondary, and has come as a result of demands from the corporate hierarchy.
p15020
aVWe have been steadily moving away from orderly regulated capitalism since Reagan.
p15021
aVMost all of the changes in the law have been to free up companies from fears of monopoly charges and price fixing.
p15022
aVHow many case of either has the Justice Dept handled in the last decade?
p15023
aV&gt;Simply because the risk involved does not effect the government.
p15024
aVThe other side of that is innovation.
p15025
aVThe government is free to innovate to a degree that is simply not available to companies that have to answer to stockholders.
p15026
aVThe government is able to take a longer view in what they do because their funding isn't dependent on immediate profit rather than having to constantly cater to the demands for immediate profit.
p15027
aVWe wouldn't be doing what we are doing on what we're doing it on without government funded research.
p15028
aVOne of the main problems we have in the world today is the extremely short sighted orientation that most of the privately funded world is forced into by short term greed.
p15029
aVThe reason the government is so inefficient is more a matter of the demands to cater to the status quo rather than work for the future.
p15030
aVAs long as we have to subsidize industries that no longer need subsidies, and do projects and spend money on things that do nothing for the country or the people, as long a private business does everything is can to stop progress this is what we live with.
p15031
aVI think government is inefficient because we make it inefficient.  \u000a\u000a 
p15032
aVThere's not much competition in a monopoly.
p15033
aVNever ever trust a Liar
p15034
aVOur so called regulatory groups are a fucking joke.
p15035
aVIf an owner of a public utility attempts to shut down a facility every dime of tax payer money including all incentives, eminent domain costs, and any other tax break that facility has has ever received should be immediately due and payable to the government.
p15036
aVElizabeth Warren said what about this? 
p15037
aVUnsure of the point you're trying to make.
p15038
aVAre you generally asking what her comment was in regard to this type of behavior?
p15039
aVOr are you looking for a comment specifically about Brayton Point and Energy Capital Partners?
p15040
aVOr are you trying to make some sort of point with regard to her?
p15041
aV* Senator Warren talking about [Wall Street's manipulation of commodities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXpLIqDksDA) This is more so on the shell game they're playing with metals to artificially jack up prices, but definitely related.
p15042
aVIf that doesn't suit your question, give her a little time.
p15043
aVI'm confident she'll make a statement about it soon.
p15044
aVI only found a few stories relating to [Brayton Point Energy &amp; Capital Partners](http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=Brayton+Point+Energy+Capital+Partners) without much comment by anyone in DC, as of yet.
p15045
aVThank you - definitely the middle question - did she respond to them directly?
p15046
aVI am from Massachusetts but I live overseas so I only have sporadic news information - I love Warren I hope she is president soon! 
p15047
aVI haven't seen any clips of anyone in DC speaking about Brayton Point.
p15048
aVOnly a few articles in Boston paper websites for the most part.
p15049
aVBut I'm sure something is going to come out of it, especially when power rates in Mass go up this summer.
p15050
aVHmmm... not sure how many cotton-picking jobs are available to people in Las Vegas, Nevada.
p15051
aVCan someone please forward this story to the White House
p15052
aVThis woman is my hero
p15053
aVWhy do the Koch brothers hate Americans?
p15054
aVI wish they would put some sort of corporate logo on all their products so I would know what to boycott.
p15055
aVThis should get you started:\u000a\u000ahttp://www.boycottkochbrothers.com/
p15056
aVJust as an asterisk I would like to say that since the Clintons have only existed politically for one generation, they are a political *family* and not a political dynasty, whereas the Bushes have been in high elected office for four generations, more comparable to the Kennedys.
p15057
aVThat being said, I agree with your general sentiment.
p15058
aVThe Democrats, however, don't have a whole lot of nationally recognized names besides Hillary.
p15059
aVI don't think someone as far left as Warren or Sanders will get the nod.
p15060
aVJim Webb is really cool though!
p15061
aVBill Clinton is a very popular ex-president while George Bush is a very unpopular ex-president.
p15062
aVRemember that parties 2012 political conventions?
p15063
aVGeorge W. Bush, aware of his deep unpopularity, was too ashamed even to go.
p15064
aVWhereas Bill Clinton gave an incredible main speech of the first night that the whole country was talking about.
p15065
aVAnd your point is...............
p15066
aVThat being related to Bill Clinton is an asset and being related to George Bush is a liability.
p15067
aVWhat about a Rodham?
p15068
aVDems I'd like to see: MN gov.
p15069
aVMark Dayton, MA Senator Elizabeth Warren, VT Senator Bernie Sanders.
p15070
aVSounds good to me.
p15071
aVIf this ends up being Bush v Clinton again I'm going to puke.
p15072
aVWould it be crazy to suggest no Democrats or Republicans?
p15073
aVOr at least, none that meet the party mold?
p15074
aVYeah, let's rag on the people with families and let the loners waltz in and cash out via the polling booth.
p15075
aVThat has worked wonderfully in the Wall Street!
p15076
aVExcept it won't happen: the 1% write the laws in this country.
p15077
aVWork that stereotype Grandma.
p15078
aVThat's the disconnect that has always baffled me.
p15079
aVHow do the die hard "keep gummint outta my life" advocates reconcile that with all of the lifestyle legislation they push so hard?
p15080
aVIt's like someone split their brains down the middle and the right doesn't talk to the left.
p15081
aVAnd they don't even notice anymore how much they've lost. 
p15082
aVI think we should get the real perspective from someone who has both happen, where is that lawyer that Dick Cheney shot in the face? 
p15083
aVsetting off bombs are illegal, but they happen anyway.
p15084
aVguns are illegal in school zones, they happen to find their way onto school grounds anyway.
p15085
aVweed is illegal in most states, people still smoke it anyway.
p15086
aVlaws are bullshit, you cant stop a mass murderer with laws.
p15087
aVif they are determined to kill a bunch of people, it will happen one way or another.
p15088
aVjust because you ban a weapon, doesnt mean they wont find another way to kill people.
p15089
aVstupid liberals and their utopian ideals.
p15090
aVhave a fresh cup of reality for a chance
p15091
aVSpeaking of reality, contact with thereof, did you read the article?
p15092
aVBecause I find it hard to see how this comment connects to the article at *all.
p15093
aV* \u000a\u000aIt's as if you *guessed* what it must be about.
p15094
aVSo go back and read, for it is from pandagon and written by Amanda Marcotte who among other things quotes herself to nail down the essential point about how *some* conservatives DO whine when they are not the center of attention.
p15095
aV&gt; You will not be surprised to note that while Continetti works up a healthy mouth-froth over the fact that Mozilla pressured Brendan Eich to resign over his anti-gay activism, he doesn\u2019t castigate his fellow conservatives for hounding yours truly in the press for weeks back in 2007, when conservatives managed to make a national scandal over the fact that I had written something blasphemous about the Virgin Mary.
p15096
aV**(Specifically, \u201cWhat if Mary had taken Plan B after the Lord filled her with his hot, white, sticky Holy Spirit?\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019d have to justify your misogyny with another ancient mythology.\u201d See, it was funny!
p15097
aV)** Which is interesting, since his argument\u2014that opposition to shooting people in the head over blasphemy should naturally translate into opposition to criticizing people or even firing them over what they said\u2014much more closely applies to my case than Eich\u2019s.
p15098
aVAfter all, mine was strictly a speech issue, whereas Eich donated money.
p15099
aVAnd I, like the folks at Charlie Hebdo, was castigated for making fun of a deity that a lot of people take really seriously, whereas Eich was attacking real people.
p15100
aVIf you really want to draw lessons about not being mean to people who commit blasphemy, by god, isn\u2019t my case much stronger than Eich\u2019s?
p15101
aVI highlighted the parts I assume you will be outraged by.
p15102
aVBecause, you know, we seem to think alike and I am just helpful like that. 
p15103
aVSo, let me get this straight.
p15104
aVBecause making it harder for people to hurt each other won't stop people from hurting each other, we should continue to make it easy for people to hurt each other?
p15105
aVEven if we can see how making it harder for people to hurt each other has reduced the homicide rate elsewhere?
p15106
aVI really can't tell if your post is a Poe or not.
p15107
aVWow, it's like a magic incantation, a cop blocker, so to speak.
p15108
aVAlthough, it may be that the only ones we see are the ones where they let people go.
p15109
aVwtf is wrong with tattoos?
p15110
aVIgnorant bitch, judge people on their actions not their appearance. 
p15111
aVIgnorant bitch indeed!
p15112
aV! 
p15113
aVTattoo's and parking funny.
p15114
aVThat's a strangling right there!
p15115
aVSucks when "we the people" speak out against totalitarianism doesn't it?\u000a
p15116
aVTraffic light cams aren't totalitarianism.
p15117
aVThe problem with them, particularly when operated for profit, is that they don't allow the same loose enforcement that Americans have come to expect with traffic laws.
p15118
aVSo they are unpopular.
p15119
aVThe democracy angle is really secondary.
p15120
aVI absolutely agree that the plebiscite should be respected but courts are not supposed to be legislatures so the question is not what *should* the state constitution say but what it actually does. 
p15121
aVThe problem with them is that they increase the accident rate at the intersections at which they are installed.
p15122
aVI was unaware of this though the data I found from NJ doesn't seem conclusive.
p15123
aVIs there more?
p15124
aVMissourian here.
p15125
aVThis debate has been going on for awhile.
p15126
aVMy town installed red light cameras a few years ago and then was ordered to deactivate them for legal reasons (can't remember if it conflicted with local/state/federal laws).
p15127
aVIt will be interesting to see how this plays out since it's in the St Louis area.
p15128
aVPretty disgusting...
p15129
aVHope you got a fuckin lawyer!
p15130
aVThis shit needs to stop!
p15131
aVI can't find the video, what part of the page is it on?
p15132
aVOne incident does not a whole make.\u000a\u000a
p15133
aVOne incident is enough.
p15134
aVNope, not to blanket a whole it isn't.
p15135
aVIf you did something "vile" in your business, would it taint all of the people in your business?
p15136
aVNo, so it goes with police.
p15137
aVGrow up.
p15138
aVYour condescending statement did that.
p15139
aVI gave you a proportional response, but I see it went right over your head.
p15140
aVNext time you want to play a man's game at least put your daddy's shoes on.
p15141
aV.... His daddy's a Copper
p15142
aVOk, so how many then?
p15143
aVHow many times will they have to violate your rights before you say something? 
p15144
aVROFL!
p15145
aVTypical response.
p15146
aVI don't have to say how many, you do.
p15147
aVYou posted the "vile" post, not me.
p15148
aVNot all police officers are vile ...
p15149
aVIf you believe that, I feel so, so sorry for you. \u000a
p15150
aVI didn't say all officers are vile, I asked how many times will you let someone violate your rights before you say something.
p15151
aVI'm trying to have a serious conversation with you, it would be a lot easier if you got off your high horse. 
p15152
aVIt makes a HOLE.
p15153
aVIf the cop can't legally do the things he did in this video, then what is the point of even having DUI checkpoints?
p15154
aVWhat is so bad about opening your window and telling a cop your age?
p15155
aVCop needs to do his job and not waste time and tax payer money on stupid questions.
p15156
aVHe should have started with "did you drink today sir?
p15157
aV"\u000a\u000aNope.
p15158
aVHe went straight to waving his dick around.
p15159
aVBut he got caught with his dick in his hand on camera.
p15160
aVCan't have that shit going on anymore.
p15161
aVBetter response : pass your license and registration and insurance card through the very narrow window opening. 
p15162
aVThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of sobriety checkpoints in Michigan v. Sitz, even though the law generally forbids law enforcement officers from stopping drivers unless there is a suspicion that the drivers have violated the law.
p15163
aVThis guy is a sociopath.
p15164
aVHis credo that any criticism of any cop is an unwarranted criticism of all cops and that no one who gets police protection should ever speak against anyone on the force is terrifying.
p15165
aVHe IS what's wrong with law enforcement.
p15166
aVFree Kiriakou!
p15167
aVBridge-gate.
p15168
aVEbola-gate.
p15169
aVWhat next?
p15170
aVWow.
p15171
aVThat would be a huge landfill.
p15172
aVSo if I got this right, Rand is quoted saying that new media can help outstanding teachers reach more students but the article writer then schools him by pointing out thatreal life problem solving cant (apparently) be teached trough new media..
p15173
aVThis sub never seizes to suprise me
p15174
aVWell you certainly highlighted the problem in American education.
p15175
aVExcellent comment.
p15176
aVI hate to say it but I agree with Rand Paul on this one.
p15177
aVI don't think that there are many drawbacks to implementing many aspects of the Khan Academy approach.
p15178
aVAutomated lectures leaving the teacher free to work individual students, nobody is going to convince me that the traditional method will perform better.
p15179
aVSure, but if you think that is going to make some huge difference, it won't.
p15180
aVI gotta disagree with you on this one.
p15181
aVIt seems to me that often students get hung up on one aspect of a subject that they are learning that prevents learning the next one.
p15182
aVBeing able to get their questions asked should help a lot, I certainly remember teachers never having any time for this.
p15183
aVAs I said, probably no downside to this, but needs research to prove it, but the idea that this is going to make some huge change is silly.
p15184
aVIt's a lack of schooling that affects most libertarians...
p15185
aVWhat a analytical and educated comment!
p15186
aVWhat an analytical....etc...
p15187
aVSpelling: when u got nothing else!
p15188
aVTell me why circlejerk in an empty sub, whats the point
p15189
aVIt made my point quite well, don't you think? 
p15190
aVIs impartiality not cool anymore or something.. man I feel old
p15191
aVPretty sure people had opinions back in the day.
p15192
aVSome students are naturally born smarter than their piers (and teachers).
p15193
aVThis bureaucratic academia we see today is a dinosaur left over from the days of the industrial revolution where we needed to quickly make populations literate.
p15194
aVToday, IF you make it through a Ivy league university.
p15195
aVYou may be \u000arecruited for an alphabet soup agency, that's about it.
p15196
aVTo learn is to perceive reality on a day to day basis, reality is part physical and part imagined so everybody has a different perception of the fundamental truth.
p15197
aVTeachers are not aloud to teach any of this because it is a "Libertarian fantasy".\u000a
p15198
aVThe highest correlation of student success if the circumstances of their birth.
p15199
aVThat has been demonstrated time and time.
p15200
aVIt even made Morgan Freeman's "Through the Wormhole.
p15201
aV"  Born poor, the odds are you stay poor. 
p15202
aVExactly, The man with the worlds highest recorded IQ.. Is a bouncer at a bar
p15203
aVReagan polling so high is not unexpected but certainly shows his post-presidency sainthood.
p15204
aVHe was considered an intellectual lightweight, an actor for chrissakes, and a demented one at that by the end of his second term.
p15205
aVThis doesn't seem different than a popularity contest.
p15206
aVIf you disagree with someone, you aren't likely to find their decisions to be intelligent.
p15207
aVPartially, but not completely.
p15208
aVIt's unlikely, for instance, that GW Bush would come so low based only on popularity.
p15209
aVHe is actually more popular relative to several of the others.
p15210
aVAnd if you look at the partisan differences, Republicans are more charitable to Obama and Clinton than they would be on pure popularity. 
p15211
aVThat maps directly to the voters as well.
p15212
aVThis is a absolutely useless exercise.  
p15213
aVand they say arkansans are dumb...
p15214
aVMy minimum wage jobs are 1000x tougher than my not min wage jobs.
p15215
aVJesus, could this guy be more out of touch with reality.
p15216
aVEvery one of these assholes should be made to try and live on minimum wage for a week or two.
p15217
aVIt wouldn't take long. 
p15218
aVI never knew my Father.
p15219
aVI also survived puberty without slutting it up.
p15220
aVDear Lord, these images make me feel uncomfortable.
p15221
aVCringe so many Cringes
p15222
aVThere's an obvious sexual component to the way those fathers hold their daughters in these photos, as if they were lovers and not fathers with daughters.
p15223
aVI'd really like the photographer to speak to the question of how he arranged these portraits.
p15224
aVDid he ask the fathers to hold their daughters like this in order to obtain such creepy photos, or did the men do this on their own?  
p15225
aVEww.
p15226
aVEww is right.
p15227
aVOf course Christians are all experts on protecting virginity.
p15228
aVOh..that's not creepy at..wretch.. all.
p15229
aVCheney certainly puts a lot of effort into being a cruelly repulsive scumbag.
p15230
aV"Someone needs to tell her to take that up with her daddy Dick.
p15231
aV" Love it Heather!
p15232
aVReally?
p15233
aVThis is a satire site.
p15234
aVChris Christie is really an unconditionally repulsive maggot.
p15235
aVThis article is a satire it says so in fine print right beneath the source.
p15236
aVIn fact, Harry Reid said something very similar to this in 2008.
p15237
aVThe point of the satire is, would you be willing to call Harry Reid an unconditionally repulsive maggot too even though he's a liberal?
p15238
aV[source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/09/harry-reid-negro-comment-_n_417406.html)
p15239
aV&gt; would you be willing to call Harry Reid an unconditionally repulsive maggot too even though he's a liberal?
p15240
aVI believe I would.
p15241
aVThis seems fake.
p15242
aVThere are a couple of word for word versions of this floating around on different shady webpages, one references abc news as the source but I can't find it there.
p15243
aVIt would be news if he really said that.
p15244
aV&gt;After the incident became public\u000a\u000aWhat!
p15245
aV?
aVMakes me think, Christie seems to me to be a fat slightly greasy Italian with a dumb NJ accent. 
p15246
aVMost black people talk differently than most white people.
p15247
aVSo what?
p15248
aVWow!
p15249
aVThis guy must be racist for stating the obvious.
p15250
aVIf you want to hate Chris Christie then it should probably be because he's a fat wreck and corrupt as fuck.
p15251
aV&gt;Most black people talk differently than most white people.
p15252
aVHow people talk has nothing to do with their skin colour.
p15253
aVJust because the two can correlate does not mean they're in anyway related...
p15254
aVStereotypes exist *for a reason*.
p15255
aVWelcome to reality.
p15256
aVWell, the people belonging to the culture that created the culture that resulted in the stereotype should not negatively stereotype that culture.
p15257
aVYou are aware that the typical "black American" accent is a result of many generations of institutionalized subjugation and impoverishment, right?
p15258

aVI'm only 29 years old, but to me it seems this sort of precedent has never been taken before in US politics.

p15310
aVYou know what, I bet they do just that. 
p15311
aVIsn't that one of the many things they get paid to specifically ignore?
p15312
aVTurning their back on the mayor in a silent protest isn't out of control at all.
p15313
aVThey disagree with what he has said recently, but they are still showing up at work to do their job.
p15314
aVThey are still protecting people.
p15315
aVThey are still going into potentially dangerous places.
p15316
aVThey aren't walking off the job and refusing to do their job.
p15317
aVThey aren't sitting back as criminals take over the city.
p15318
aVThey aren't suddenly cracking down even harder on people.
p15319
aVIn fact, [NYPD cops didn't even fire on an 18-year-old who pointed a gun and pulled the trigger on them yesterday just hours after the execution.
p15320
aV](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/21/nypd-man-attempted-to-shoot-cop-but-gun-was-empty/) So I'd say they are far from out of control.

aVI would say their actions are no less professional than the mayor was when he made his comments about the protests and race.
p15322
aVI disagree with what my boss says at work sometimes, many of my coworkers do.

aVBut we don't turn our backs at the next meeting.
p15324
aVWe raise our concerns through communications via the regular hr channels and guess what, it works!
p15325
aVThese cops should have done the same.
p15326
aVBut they wanted a show.
p15327
aVIronically, cops don't think much of general citizens that give them the same treatment.
p15328
aVIn fact, some in their upper ranks feel that people protesting must be roughed up so that they shut up.
p15329
aVCops behaving that way is completely irrational and unprofessional.
p15330
aVLike 3-year old brats protesting mommy for saying no more candy.
p15331
aVLike everyone else, cops have two ears and one mouth, they should listen twice as much.
p15332
aVThey might actually learn something.
p15333
aVWhat these cops did is a dog and pony show for tv.
p15334
aVIt's just their latest expression of bullying.
p15335
aVThey did it back when wearing those stupid bands on their wrists in support of paranoid cold blooded murderer Darren Wilson, and here they are, a few instigators doing it again.
p15336
aVThey should be fired at once.
p15337
aVWe have enough gang problems on our streets, we don't need gangs in our police departments.
p15338
aVGood luck firing hundreds/thousands of union employees.
p15339
aVThe way you and I deal with issues in a small company environment is different than how unions (for better or worse) deal with things.
p15340
aVI just feel like it's tough to try to judge their reactions in all of this.
p15341
aVAs with any story, we don't know how much is completely accurate with the way the media reports any of this.
p15342
aVYou don't need to fire everyone.
p15343
aVJust the handful of instigators.
p15344
aVIt's really to the benefit of the police departments.
p15345
aVHopefully most cops don't want to make their jobs more dangerous and reciprocate the kind of treatment they expect the public gives them.
p15346
aVThe title of this submission is just childish.\u000a

aVGood comment on the differences between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to voting rights for the people of Kentucky.
p15362
aVHowever, it also seems that McConnel launched this tactic to distract Grimes as well as voters.
p15363
aVVoters should be angry at this tactic.
p15364
aVWhile Grimes needs to forcefully respond, as she has,  McConnell has in a sense set her agenda, rather than having her choose the topic of debate in the final days.
p15365
aVGiven that McConnel has done this before, there is no doubt that he had planned this for the final week.
p15366
aVHe seems to think so lowly of Kentucky voters that he has to cheat and intmidate in order to win

p15378
aVI would argue that while the Republicans are leading the charge to America's demise, they have taken the Democrats, kicking and screaming, a long way down the road with them.
p15379
aVWashington is certainly broken.
p15380
aVThat's for sure.

aVNothing new about Fox denying video evidence at all.
p15399
aVI think they figure that anyone who watches them is so interested in hearing what they want to hear that they also will deny reality and then call it a consensus.

p15422
aVThe problem is not to dismiss the idea of functional conservatism.

aVI know circlejerking around hating the koch's is all the rage around here, but there are real reasons to have a fee(now the size of which is debatable) for supplying power INTO the grid because as everyone should know the power grid is old and not built for houses to pump energy backwards.

p15455
aVThe question here to ask is "How could knowing the real numbers be bad?
p15456
aV"
aVNo that's not the question.
p15457
aVThe question is "Given the limited resources and their scope and charter is this the way they should be using those resources?
p15458
aV" If we gave them unlimited resources and tasked them with doing whatever they want then they could probably answer a lot of questions about social issues that have impact on health but nobody has given them either the resources or the charter to do so.
p15459
aVThey could also probably gather a lot of data on occupational hazards but that isn't their job either.
p15460
aVThey appear to think so.
p15461
aVAnd other forces who would undoubtedly be referred to as "vested interests" if they were trying to teach children or liked hugging trees wish laws to explicitly prevent such studies being done.

aVThe little dweeb banned me from r/politics.

p15486
aVHere's a rule.
p15487
aVIf you are one of the charter members of r/politics, who are the ones who put it on the map in the first place, no snot nosed little wannabes are allowed to ban you.
p15488
aVIn fact until you've been a redditor for at least 3 years, you are ineligible to be a moderator at r/politics.
p15489
aVI guess we spent the first 5 years here wasting our time so someone else can take credit for it.
p15490
aVNobody that was here when spez started the place has a clue of just who it was that put reddit where it is today. 
p15491
aVHe's probably the one who banned me too, but probably /u/hansjens47 reinstated me, he seems to be one of the good ones.
p15492
aVI used to be a lot more involved in /r/politics than I am now.
p15493
aVI don't like the idea of letting them have their way, but /r/altnews, /r/uspolitics, and /r/PoliticsBlacklist seem to have more of what I'm looking for.

aVI know that kind of ghettoization is what they wanted, but I don't have time to fight that fight.
p15495
aVObviously our form of government is failing us.
p15496
aVSo long as we aren't making generalizations.
p15497
aVIf you ask six different libertarians what libertarianism means they will all six probably say something along the lines of "Less government, less regulation, more decentralized power, no government monopoly on the use of force, all transactions should be voluntary.
p15498
aVForce should only be used as a response to force.
p15499
aV"\u000a\u000aWhen you ask them about where the line should be on specific policies you are likely to get six very different answers.
p15500

p15501
aVYeah, too bad Ayn Rand is so dead already.
p15502
aVRand Paul's policies on feeding her could have save us a lot of taxpayer money.
p15503
aVSimplifications and generalizations are great if you are running for office and you want to try and persuade the undecided with short, emotionally charged memes that no one has to think too deeply about.
p15504
aVThe reality of policies, legislation and the specific details therein often shatter the implications of those generalizations when examined closely.
p15505
aVThe problem is that we don't actually require this examination from the voter before they are allowed to decide who makes these decisions.
p15506
aVThe motivations for the politicians are, among other things, money and power.
p15507
aVRegardless of all other considerations these two incentives are ever-present in anyone running for office.
p15508
aVI would hazard to say that most of them, especially the newer ones, have genuine altruistic intentions.

aV&gt; None of the officers accused of assaulting Williams in that motel room on Nov. 19, 2011, were fired, according to Chris Robertson, a member of Williams&amp;#039; legal team: Officer J. Byrum, Officer J. Fogel, Officer Habersham, Officer K. Beckman and Sgt.

aVI agree.
p15549
aVI know when I was in high school it was much easier to get pot than beer.
p15550
aVSince 2000 (and arguably before), the GOP has led this country from one disaster to the next.
p15551
aVAnd yet the anti-Vaxers are clustered into the most liberal enclaves:\u000ahttp://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/22/vaccine-deniers-stick-together-and-now-theyre-ruining-things-for-everyone/
p15552
aV&gt; That liberals are least likely to believe in a link between vaccines and autism might be surprising given well-publicized reports about low childhood vaccination rates in wealthy, liberal enclaves in states such as California.
p15553
aVIt may be that anti-vaccination liberals are quite rare and that their existence is mostly anecdotal.
p15554
aVOr perhaps anti-vaccination liberals are widespread but are adept at masking their attitudes in surveys.
p15555
aV&gt; Although we cannot adjudicate between these possibilities, our findings do not suggest that anti-vaccination attitudes are concentrated on the left fringe.
p15556
aVInstead, anti-vaccination attitudes appear concentrated among conservatives and those who distrust government.\u000a
p15557
aVmorons are more likely to believe moronic shit
p15558
aVHopefully there will be a book by that name soon that includes this amongst the other Republican beliefs.
p15559
aVHey I have an idea.
p15560
aVYou should try to make vaccines a partisan issue by behaving like assholes so that you drive conservatives away from supporting vaccines out of a desire not to be associated with your scumbag behavior.
p15561
aVThat way, the anti-vaxxers will look more credible in comparison to you and less kids will get vaccinated.
p15562
aVAnd of course, every opportunity must be taken to insult people who disagree with you on unrelated issues.
p15563
aVAfter all, "the personal is political.
p15564
aV" Everything must be politicized.
p15565
aVLife is political.
p15566
aVDeal with it.
p15567
aV&gt; Life is political.
p15568
aVDeal with it.
p15569
aVSo you support (or at least are indifferent to) the opportunistic use of the vaccine controversy (which shouldn't be a controversy because vaccines in fact do work) to insult conservatives, even though insulting conservatives in this case may lead to less conservative people's kids getting vaccinated, which in turn may lead to an increased spread of disease?
p15570
aVIdeas have consequences.
p15571
aVHow is it an insult?
p15572
aVSeems like whenever the facts challenge the worldview of a conservative, it's taken as an insult.
p15573
aVYou'll probably take that as an insult too!
p15574
aVMaybe conservatives need to stop being so sensitive.
p15575
aV&gt; How is it an insult?
p15576
aVI know sometimes nuances drop off in text-based communication, so that could be what's happening here, but I must say that this question seems disingenuous, especially in the light of what you followed it up with.
p15577
aVI was right!
p15578

aVUp to a year of jail for *wearing a hoodie*...?

aVYou have got to be kidding me.
p15595
aVAnd we all thought going to jail for weed was ridiculous....
p15596
aVI wonder [how far](http://tightrope.cc/catalog/images/boysinthehood-bhood.gif) the ban extends...
p15597
aVLooks kind of bad if you only read the headline:\u000a\u000a&gt; the bill is intended \u201cto deter crime, making it unlawful to wear a mask, hood or covering during the commission of a crime or to intentionally conceal a person\u2019s identity in a public place.\u201d The reasoning behind the bill is to cut down the number of masked robberies and crimes.
p15598
aV&gt; There are similar laws already on the books in to other states around the country, including Florida, California, New York and Washington, DC, according to Oklahoma-based Channel 6.
p15599
aVHoodies are often not allowed at high schools and several banks including PNC and Provident.
p15600
aVCross Country Federal Savings Bank, meanwhile, bans both hoodies and sunglasses, but the prohibitions are rarely enforced.
p15601
aVWhile the article does make a valid point, the far larger issue of why poor people stay poor is that the entire political economy of capitalism and western "democracy" is unjust and forces poor people to be poor so that some can be very, very rich.

p15662
aVExactly.
p15663
aVVarious presidents have made clear and distinct deals with terrorists and kidnappers.
p15664
aVPerhaps some of the most famous deals (plural) were done by Reagan, who on 4 March 87 felt he had to issue the mangled statement of "I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages.
p15665
aVMy heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true -- but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.
p15666
aV"\u000a\u000aSometimes it makes perfect, logical sense to make such a deal.
p15667
aVOther times it's foolish.
p15668
aVTo adopt a "we *never* do X, Y or Z" attitude is as stupid as the many "no tolerance" rules we see permeating our society -- it's just a mindless move to stop communication and thought.
p15669
aVAnd yet in the upcoming mid-term election, Republicans are predicted to capture the majority in *both* houses of congress.
p15670
aVWhat's wrong with this picture?

aVGerrymandering, the fact that the Dems are historically bad at turnout in midterm years, and a lot of disillusioned young people.
p15672
aVSad, but true.

p15678
aVAt the risk of "talking out of school," a group which takes him quite seriously, [the tobacco industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC2xeT2yOg), recently incurred the ire of Human Rights Watch by [taking advantage of some particularly vulnerable citizens](http://www.hrw.org/node/125316) that the government should have been protecting ;).

p15691
aVThen the company that they owe money resorts to taking legal recourse to get their repayment... and they're the bad guys.
p15692
aVThe people that consumed beyond their capacity and cannot repay their debts; they're not the bad guys?

aVIn a society where companies manipulate people to overspend and make promises about repayment terms that aren't honored?
p15694
aVYes, yes they are the bad guys.
p15695
aVThere's plenty of guilt to go around, but constructing an industry that depends on people not repaying their debts is inherently immoral.
p15696
aVPlenty of companies advertise their products and attempt to persuade people to purchase them.
p15697
aVThat doesn't mean that the purchaser isn't responsible for their purchases.

aV&gt; So Florida Republicans will get to run two full elections using maps that were declared unconstitutional.
p15786
aVAnd, when the new maps take effect in 2016, they will make only minor changes to the existing gerrymander.

aVSo now what we need is a House Special Committee to investigate why the House panel wrongly concluded that there was no wrongdoing by the administration in regards to Benghazi.
p15816
aVThey just have to keep Benghazi in the headlines.
p15817
aVOtherwise they'll have to come up with some new justification for their poo-flinging for the next two years.

aVDo I hear Obama and Clinton chortling in the background?

aVSo far, sfgate.com is the only one sourcing this story.

aVOh heck, I could have sworn before I clicked on the article that the university was ASU (Arizona State).

aVLet's see here.
p15823
aVThe CIA and the NSA lied to Congress about spying on us.
p15824
aVAll of us.
p15825
aVThen they discover it really was all of us including them.

p15841
aVYep the math checks out...

p15843
aVWhat are you babbling about?
p15844
aVNobody said all or even most.
p15845
aVWhat is wrong with your reading comprehension?
p15846
aVHe didn't even say gun owner.
p15847
aVThere are plenty of people who own guns that are not "enthusiasts".
p15848
aVYou are twisting words around, I don't know why.
p15849
aVThe comment made above is absolutely correct.
p15850
aVIts a simple, clear and accurate assessment.
p15851
aVThey are gun enthusiasts as evidenced by their little club.
p15852
aVAnd joking murder upon the top elected US office is their version of "patriotism".
p15853
aVIf she was just joking around then so was the commenter above!
p15854
aVIts not like he said ALL gun nuts are low intelligence emotionally damaged sociopaths.
p15855
aVThat placing so much emphasis on weapons of death under any guise indicates psychological difficency.
p15856
aVNobody here said gun culture, anger and right wing hatred (especially towards this President) are deeply and historically intertwined.
p15857
aVOr that these utter morons are the lowest common denominator of society and highly susceptible to the most primitive forms of propaganda.
p15858
aVWhich is exactly why they wish murder upon him because the right wing propaganda machine (which they are the prime targets of) has gone into post civil war mode of crazy... Nobody said any of that stuff.
p15859
aVWhat is your problems?
p15860
aVI like what you did there.
p15861
aVBravo sir. 
p15862
aV[deleted]
p15863
aVInteresting point.
p15864
aVIf the leader of some black only organization had publicly made this same statement about a president, how would it sound?
p15865
aVNot patriotic... Would it be funny hahah?
p15866
aVThere is also the key difference that gun enthusiasts have never been second class citizens subjected to institutional and social discrimination.
p15867
aVSo yes the generalization would have been quite different.
p15868
aV[deleted]
p15869
aVIf I'm understanding your meaning properly - would you say this Facebook post is making gun owners look bad?
p15870
aV[deleted]
p15871
aVI think she makes right wing gun issue mothers look bad yes.
p15872
aVBut I was posing the question to you.
p15873
aVBecause it has been you that is feverently insisting she is a fringe of gun enthusiasts. 
p15874
aVSo, your massive issue with me saying\u000a\u000a&gt; Gun enthusiasts, showing their true "patriotism".
p15875
aVis because you would "feels better" if I had said\u000a\u000a&gt; Some gun enthusiasts, showing their true "patriotism".
p15876
aVIs that really what gets your panties all knotted up?
p15877
aVBecause it seems a pedantic difference to normal people.
p15878
aV&gt; Now go back to spinning records.
p15879
aVYeah, that is what I do.

aVI don't get the point of this comment. 
p15886
aVI don't get the point of this comment. 
p15887
aVSaying 'Gun enthusiasts, showing their true "patriotism"' to describe the actions of one individual gun owner is akin to saying 'blacks' when referring to the actions of one specific black person.
p15888
aVWell that's rediculous, they're two radically different groups of people.
p15889
aVFirst point being no 3 year old ever said "mom look a gun enthusiast!
p15890
aV" To her social dismay. 
p15891
aVIt doesn't matter what the group is, equating all members of a group with the actions of one is always wrong and unhelpful.
p15892
aVI agree with that, generalizations make poor arguments and are incorrect to begin with.
p15893
aVBut so is equating a race to a group of people who enjoy a hobby. 
p15894

aVThere was a time when many Americans joined the Klan.
p15926
aVThen we ridiculed them as ignorant fuck-wits, until their numbers dropped to the level of insignificant.
p15927
aVI hope we can do the same thing with gun ownership.
p15928
aVShame these morons so that the next generation wants nothing to do with guns.
p15929
aVWe didn't have to outlaw the klan, as we had a more powerful tool: ridicule.
p15930
aVAnd yes, I'm rigidly opposed to Klansmen. 
p15931
aV[deleted]
p15932
aVI see socializing the facts about gun owners - that they tend to be less educated, have lower IQs, and are more racist than normal humans - as beneficial to society. 
p15933
aV[deleted]
p15934
aVHow about the Klansmen who never hurt anyone?
p15935
aVGood to know you'd proudly jump to their defense, when people shun all klansmen.
p15936
aV[deleted]
p15937
aVYour claim is that smearing an entire group of people as ignorant is wrong, as some members of that group might not be ignorant.
p15938
aVThe exact same argument could be used against shaming all klansmen.
p15939
aVAs far as which group poses a greater threat to society, clearly it's the gun owners.

aV[deleted]
p15941
aVYou know what I find offensive?
p15942
aVWhen idiots shoot at me or near me.
p15943
aVI am terribly offended when that happens.
p15944
aVThe use of ridicule or shame is a perfectly valid method of changing society for the better.
p15945
aVWhether you are trying to reduce klan membership, homophobia, scientology or gun ownership, mocking the individuals who participate in such stupidity has a proven record of success.
p15946
aVThere is a reason we shame and ostracize: it works.
p15947
aV[deleted]
p15948
aVGun owners and Scientologists, only one of these groups actually threatens my life.
p15949
aVI've been shot at once.

aVI was offended by all 4 experiences. 
p15952

p15953
aV&gt; Do you think the typical American has been shot at or witnessed any homicides?
p15954
aVNo.
p15955
aVOnly 100,000 Americans get shot in any given year.
p15956
aVJust like your typical American doesn't acquire HIV, only about 50,000 do each year.
p15957
aVAnd yet we all work to reduce HIV.
p15958
aVHmm.
p15959
aVI saw a guy get shot in front of my Apt in Harlem in the 90s.
p15960
aVIn the early 2000s, I witnessed a guy getting shot in front of my Apt in the LES.
p15961
aVA couple years laters I witnessed a girl get shot in front of a nightclub in Detroit.
p15962
aVThe night I was shot at was in Harlem.
p15963
aVThere was a cat in heat on the fire escape a few feet from my head late one hot night in August.
p15964
aVOne of my idiot neighbors couldn't take the noise, and shot at the cat.
p15965
aVThat's what idiots with guns do.
p15966
aVThey shoot at things.
p15967
aV[deleted]
p15968
aVNo I wasn't hit.
p15969
aVSo, as I pointed out, we have twice the gun problem as we do an HIV problem.
p15970
aVMy suggestion is that we shame high-risk sex, so as to discourage it.
p15971
aVSimilarly, I intend to shame gun ownership, so as to discourage it.
p15972
aVAre you confused by that?
p15973
aV[deleted]
p15974

p15978

p15979
aVI helped re-invent that business for us last year.
p15980
aVBut we don't see plan participants as clients.
p15981
aVOur clients have UBS Financial Advisors.
p15982
aV&gt; That would mean that 0.03% of population gets shot at per year\u000a\u000aI was just contemplating this.
p15983
aVGiven that the average American lives to about 79, I think that means that over 2% of Americans get shot, at some point in their lifetime.
p15984
aVAs you've pointed out though, I'm just a DJ.
p15985

aVGun-related violence is most common in poor urban areas and frequently associated with [gang violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_violence), often involving male juveniles or young adult males.
p15990
aV&gt;While increased time has been given to mass shootings in the media, the frequency of these events has declined since the 1990s.
p15991
aVHand guns figured in the [Virginia Tech massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre), [Binghamton shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binghamton_shootings), [2009 Fort Hood shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Fort_Hood_shooting), [Oikos University shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oikos_University_shooting), and [2011 Tucson shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting).

aVAssailants with multiple weapons committed the [Aurora theater shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting), and the [Columbine High School massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre).
p15993
aV&gt;In 2009, according to the [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_on_Drugs_and_Crime), 67% of all homicides in the U.S. were conducted using a firearm.
p15994
aVTwo-thirds of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. are suicides.

p16049
aVA fair point.
p16050
aVThe idea that the federal government should be limited to those functions and powers enumerated in the constitution has been a central tenant of conservative thought at least since the time of Barry Goldwater.
p16051
aVThere is nothing crazy about it.
p16052
aVTo quote Goldwater:\u000a\u000aI have little interest in streamlining government or in making it more efficient, for I mean to reduce its size.
p16053
aVI do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom.
p16054
aVMy aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them.
p16055
aVIt is not to inaugurate new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution, or that have failed their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden.
p16056
aVI will not attempt to discover whether legislation is "needed" before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible.

aVYou make an absurd and obscene fetish of the constitution.
p16060
aVYou are conserving nothing - these ideas are far more radical than Marxism.
p16061
aVYou can believe anything you like but don't kid yourself that you and your ilk own some correct and pure interpretation of the constitution, and that you are actual conservatives of tradition.
p16062
aVThe world has never seen the likes of today's GOP - they are beyond reason and out of step with all of humanity.
p16063
aVHumanity - with its values of common social welfare and stewardship of the planet - these are the true conservatives.
p16064
aVJefferson would weep tears os shame to see the today's GOP acting in the name of the constitution - and that is simply a fact. 
p16065
aVAs soon as I see the word "ilk", I know an adhom can't be far behind.
p16066
aVAnd you didn't disappoint.
p16067
aVWell, shit.
p16068
aVWhy not just secede?
p16069
aVThis almost reads like that.
p16070
aVOh.Wait.
p16071
aVFederal dollars!
p16072
aV"You can just drop those at the border station over there, son.
p16073
aVWe don't allow your kind in our pristine Christian State.
p16074
aV" \u000a\u000aThe more of this kind of thing I read; the more I begin to see the positive side of secession.
p16075
aVGive 'em the south.
p16076
aVI don't think we'll miss them much. 
p16077
aVeat the rich
p16078
aVIn a perfect world people would realize that how we spend our dollars  is in fact a way of either maintaining a way of life that is unsustainable or is the beginning of better world.
p16079
aVIf we were able to score every dollar spent as to whether it takes us closer too, or further away, from the kind of world we need to live in, we could change everything!
p16080
aVThe plutocrats are running the show because we empower them by purchasing their products in spite of their attitudes toward us!
p16081
aVThis is a breach of Human Rights.
p16082
aVThis Police 'man' should be in Prison
p16083
aVIt doesn't help that you have "onion" in your username.
p16084
aVSaw the video, and it looks real enough.
p16085
aVStill, with a username like that, it makes one consider whether or not we're being trolled.
p16086
aVThe behavior in the video is absolutely inexcusable.
p16087
aVIt's real, I saw the news story on TV this weekend.
p16088
aVAfter arresting the woman the police wouldn't let her family see her for a week.
p16089
aVWhy don't you look at your own name?
p16090
aVshoe?
p16091
aVWhat is that?
p16092
aVSomething with a hole that you step into and step on (how weird is that?).
p16093
aVShoes are unnatural!
p16094
aVOnions, man they are real.
p16095
aVSurely you must already be aware of The Onion.
p16096
aVhttp://www.theonion.com/\u000a\u000aCommon, now.
p16097
aVThere's no faux news organization called The Shoe.
p16098
aVPeople are used to "onion" being synonymous with "bad made up news".
p16099
aVSure, and regulated markets killed socialism...
p16100
aVI would actually say capitalism killed free markets. 
p16101
aVSome might say the free markets and capitalism are the same thing.
p16102
aVThen again, the same some are probably the stupid some in the crowds.
p16103
aV&gt; The State Department found the pipeline would create 35 permanent jobs and 15 temporary jobs once it went into operation.
p16104
aVThe Republicans' "new math": 50 = 100,000
p16105
aV&gt;Republicans begin shift to the MORE Right !
p16106
aVI didn't think there was anymore right to the right of them left anymore.
p16107
aVPretty soon they'll be so far out in right field that they'll be out of the ballpark entirely.
p16108
aVGood riddance to them!
p16109
aVSadly the whole thing is an exercise of redefining what makes for ballpark dimensions and faux-normalizing the presumptive "center".   
p16110
aVUp-voted for your valor
p16111
aVThe fools, cantor lost because people despise washington and the way money controls it.
p16112
aVHis opponent ran as an anti insider and anti waste.
p16113
aVIt wasn't because he was more right or more left it was because he was seen as someone not in bed with the washington establishment and lobbyists.
p16114
aVits fine though please go more right and shrink your base further. 
p16115
aVIt's not that liberal and conservative are so similar, it's that mainstream Democrats are not liberal.
p16116
aV"The left" is unrepresented on the main stage.
p16117
aVMainstream Democrats?
p16118
aVMost democrats in the US are not as liberal as they think they are. 
p16119
aVRight.
p16120
aVBy "mainstream" I basically meant "most.
p16121
aV"
aVexcept there is no left.
p16122
aVTo be honest US foreign policy has very little voice or influence .
p16123
aVI say this with great respect for President Obama.
p16124
aVThe only thing that keeps 3 rd world countries in contact with US is hope of Aid.
p16125
aVThe random killing by drones and Netanyahu's influence over the middle east makes a nonsense of justice and lowers the respect others have for the once mighty USA
p16126
aVIt is simply Greed that spurs them on.
p16127
aVBlind Greed.
p16128
aVGood on you girls
p16129
aVWe talking about this American hero Oliver North?
p16130
aVhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLD2JyFAlE
p16131
aVSame guy, the convicted felon pardoned by Ronnie.
p16132
aVApparently John Boehner is not an economist.
p16133
aVUh oh... You know there's an important election coming up when Republicans suddenly remember that jobs matter to the peasants.
p16134
aVOh, alternet.
p16135
aVFox is stupid and bat shit insane, but alternet, that's balanced news media.
p16136
aVWhat next?
p16137
aVMoveon.org and thinkprogress?
p16138
aVWar on science?
p16139
aVYou mean liberal's crippling fear of GMO?
p16140
aVFox news doesn't even apologize for blatant false reporting of "News".
p16141
aVThey even go so far as to skew graphs to make them look more in their favour.
p16142
aVSometimes their percentages don't even add up.
p16143
aVFox News is nothing buy a far right propaganda machine. 
p16144
aVNo conservative's belief that everything is in God's hands and things will just work out by his special magic.
p16145
aVNow *that's* fucking stupid.
p16146
aV[And even the Pope isn't making that argument.
p16147
aV](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/05/21/3440075/pope-francis-if-we-destroy-creation-creation-will-destroy-us)
p16148
aVPertinent to this discussion how?
p16149
aVLeft as an exercise for the reader Johny GMO.
p16150
aVSeems disingenuous that for the nearly two hundred year period being discussed gun ownership was a given and so there wasn't anything *to discuss* until it wasn't.
p16151
aVI'm happy to let you in on what confuses a lot of contemporary American gun nuts.
p16152
aVThe founding fathers likely assumed that Americans had an individual right to possess firearms.
p16153
aVHowever, that doesn't mean that that was what the 2nd Amendment was about.
p16154
aVThey could believe that you have a right to possess firearms, and simultaneously acknowledge that it wasn't what was asserted in the 2nd Amendment.
p16155
aVIn other words, they may very well have assumed that White Adult American Males had a right to own 18th Century firearms.
p16156
aVHowever, even if true, that in no way is evidence that they were instituting via the 2nd amendment that all future Americans get to own any firearms that they wish to own.
p16157
aVPeople can enjoy firearms without being nuts.
p16158
aVWhatever the founding fathers intended doesn't really matter as long as people are free to own firearms - which they are.
p16159
aVHave a nice day!
p16160
aV&gt; People can enjoy firearms\u000a\u000aYep, people can enjoy being racists too.
p16161
aVLikely, we will never outlaw people from being racists or gun nuts, or for that matter, dumb shits.
p16162
aVHowever, we are also allowed to laugh at these ignorant, racist, dumb-shit gun nuts.
p16163
aVAnd this is what I tend to do on reddit: laugh at all the ignorant racist gun nuts here.
p16164
aVWant some cheese to go with your whine?
p16165
aVWhine?
p16166
aVLike I said, you are free to be a racist ignorant dumb-shit if you so choose.
p16167
aVI have no problem with that.
p16168
aVBe true to yourself.
p16169
aVBut realize I'll also be true to myself by laughing at your ignorance. 
p16170
aVTissue?
p16171
aVYes, you are a failure in comparison to someone like me.
p16172
aVI wish you all the tissues you can collect.
p16173
aVThat's it let it all out.
p16174
aVYou'll learn how to deal with your emotions when you grow up but for now it's OK to wallow in your misery.
p16175
aVOh, I'm rolling into 50, child.
p16176
aVHowever, I doubt there is an age I'll reach where I'll suddenly support gun violence.
p16177
aVOr racism.
p16178
aVOr stupidity. 
p16179
aVWell some people take longer to grow up than others.
p16180
aVGun ownership does not mean racism, low intelligence, or support for gun violence.
p16181
aVAs far as my being 'a failure compared to you' I'll let that statement speak for itself.
p16182
aV[Who owns guns?
p16183
aV](http://www.halfsigma.com/2007/04/dumb_white_peop.html)\u000a\u000a[Who opposes gun control?
p16184
aV](http://www.salon.com/2013/11/05/study_white_racism_linked_with_opposition_to_gun_control_partner/)\u000a\u000aFact: [Gun ownership rates are inversely correlated with educational attainment.
p16185
aV](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/in-gun-ownership-statistics-partisan-divide-is-sharp/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0) There is a reason for that.
p16186
aVThat's great but you are still an emotional infant.
p16187
aVI'm feel sorry for you Mr. 50.
p16188
aVBecause I understand that racism correlates with opposition to gun control?
p16189
aVThat hardly seems a reason to feel sorry for me.
p16190
aVOr is it because I'm better educated and more accomplished than most gun owners?
p16191
aVYou seem to think quite highly of yourself.
p16192
aVWould care to share what it is that you have accomplished that makes you feel this way?
p16193
aVEdit: yeah that's kind of what I thought
p16194
aVI'm not anonymous.
p16195
aVFeel free to look up my award-winning creative direction, 100K+ selling albums, or patent winning inventions.
p16196
aVHowever, simply acquiring a college degree made me more successful than your average racist gun nut. 
p16197
aVYou must have skipped the class on statistics where they discussed variance.
p16198
aVAre you an American?
p16199
aVAbsolutely. 
p16200
aVThe founding fathers had no problems with privately owned cannons and issued Letters of Marque so that privateers could use their privately owned warships to strike at British vessels.
p16201
aVThe author is ignorant and anyone who holds similar views is either also ignorant or similarly deluded.
p16202
aVMichael Waldman is president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.
p16203
aVYou have difficulty discerning "ignorance".
p16204
aVConsidering that he didn't cite any sources and his statements are belied by simple historical facts like [Letters of Marque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_marque) his presidency has little to do with his ignorance on this subject matter.
p16205
aVHe's making unsound statements that aren't based on fact.
p16206
aVIf you support them, you are not only similarly ignorant, but now that I've shown you that they are wrong, either stubbornly wrongheaded or blinded by confirmation bias.
p16207
aVEither way, you are still wrong ;)
p16208
aVWhat, exactly, do you find unfactual in the story?
p16209
aVIts history of NRA, court cases cited, et cetera, are all facts.
p16210
aVIts listings of political figures and their actions are all facts.
p16211
aVWhat is it, then, that find in the article to be invalid? 
p16212
aVHe lies through omission, whether deliberately or through ignorance you can be the judge.
p16213
aVClearly he hasn't read the relevant Federalist Papers, nor does he support his interpretation of the contradictions regarding quotes from Henry, or Jefferson.
p16214
aVHe doesn't seem to grasp the nature of the militia, or that the they are composed of the organized and unorganized militia groups.
p16215
aVHis article is merely a multipage collection of rants, half truths, lies and hand wringing.
p16216
aVHe cannot reconcile the facts that diametrically oppose his opinions, so he ignores them outright (see cannons, letters of marque, etc)\u000a\u000aMost disconcerting though is this collectivist interpretation of the 2nd amendment, which requires a tortuous amount of argumentation to have the reader believe that "the people" (found to be individuals in each and every other right in which they are mentioned) somehow mean the collective in the 2nd.
p16217
aVNice try.
p16218
aVBy all means though, read through the relevant Federalist papers.
p16219
aVCheck out [29](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) which contains\u000a\u000a&gt; What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government is impossible to be foreseen...The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution... Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.
p16220
aVand [46](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp) which includes\u000a\u000a&gt; Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.
p16221
aVNotwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
p16222
aVAnd it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes.
p16223
aVBut were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.
p16224
aVHell, here's a more complete breakdown - http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndpur.html\u000a\u000aIn short, the author is either ignorant or lying.
p16225
aVYou choose.
p16226
aVI have to agree with the comment below - you're not responding to the question, which was a request that you point out what was incorrect in the article.
p16227
aVYou stated the author made "unsound statements that aren't based on fact" - I asked you to stipulate - you haven't.
p16228
aVIn addition - you cite 29, which is not relevant.
p16229
aVThat pertained to national military vs. independent state military that had no national/federal oversight.
p16230
aVBack to the point - the story pertains to changes in formats/leadership of the NRA; history of judicial review to application of the 2nd (including change in NRA's interpretation of the 2nd); and misquotes and chopped quotes now used.
p16231
aVYou said the article was false on those (and/or other) statements - please defend your argument. \u000a\u000a
p16232
aV/u/mitchwells is a well known anti-gun troll so it's really not worth addressing him (see his other posts in this topic for context), but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
p16233
aVFirst, your objection with 29 is wrong simply because it provides context.
p16234
aVIt's ready evidence that the founders intended for private ownership of arms to not only be widespread but to be militarily effective.
p16235
aVThe Dick Act later clarifies the types of militia into organized &amp; unorganized but does not obviate the needs of the average citizen to be able to defend themselves.
p16236
aVSecond, with regards to the article in question; it's very title is a lie designed to frame the debate in dishonest terms.
p16237
aV&gt; How the NRA Rewrote the Second Amendment\u000aThe Founders never intended to create an unregulated individual right to a gun.
p16238
aVToday, millions believe they did.
p16239
aVThat's bullshit.
p16240
aVThe author hasn't provided any citations supporting his argument.
p16241
aVHe pretends that the Federalist papers don't exist to give context, or that journals or letters or other contemporary evidence is similarly missing.
p16242
aVHe buttresses this with selected factoids following the Miller decision and Burger's famous quote, but leaves out anything contradicting this.
p16243
aVFurthermore, he expects us to believe that "the people" mentioned in the 2nd are somehow different from "the people" mentioned elsewhere (and found to be individuals) which is hilariously wrong as well.
p16244
aVIn whole, his argument is entirely bankrupt.
p16245
aVNobody (other than an insignificant &amp; irrelevant minority) is campaigning for entirely unregulated firearms ownership, especially not the NRA.  
p16246
aV&gt; Nobody (other than an insignificant &amp; irrelevant minority) is campaigning for entirely unregulated firearms ownership, especially not the NRA.
p16247
aVActually, the NRA *is* campaigning for unregulated ownership - no type of background checks at all; promotes unlicensed sales; no registration\u000a - check out its lobby group site: http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/issues/background-checks.aspx \u000a\u000aAnd the claims in the article about the misquotes/chopped quotes are valid - and the claims about significant change in NRA stances, first in the '70s, then again in 21st century, are documented, too.
p16248
aVAs for the documentation - this isn't Politico's normal daily online edition.
p16249
aVThis is Politico magazine; magazine's don't print links/can't embed them in printed text, for the websites of magazines, text is just copied/pasted, so you won't find cites in these editions.
p16250
aVThe law cases referred to are well-known already, and can be quickly validated by anyone who wants to verify. 
p16251
aV&gt; Actually, the NRA is campaigning for unregulated ownership\u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]*\u000a\u000a&gt;no type of background checks at all; \u000a\u000aThat's a lie.
p16252
aV&gt; promotes unlicensed sales; \u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]*\u000a\u000a&gt; no registration\u000a\u000aWell *duh* - registration is nothing other than a revenue generation scheme.
p16253
aVIt's absolutely useless as a crime prevention tool and easily &amp; entirely circumvented.
p16254
aV&gt; check out its lobby group site: http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/issues/background-checks.aspx\u000a\u000aSo?
p16255
aVThat doesn't support your argument.
p16256
aV&gt; And the claims in the article about the misquotes/chopped quotes are valid - \u000a\u000aSure, and they are examples of lying through omission, as I already stated, and have nothing to do with the entirely false premise, as I already stated.
p16257
aV&gt; and the claims about significant change in NRA stances, first in the '70s, then again in 21st century, are documented, too.
p16258
aVSo?
p16259
aVDoesn't make his claim any less bankrupt.
p16260
aV&gt; As for the documentation - this isn't Politico's normal daily online edition.
p16261
aVThis is Politico magazine; magazine's don't print links/can't embed them in printed text, for the websites of magazines, text is just copied/pasted, so you won't find cites in these editions.
p16262
aVThe law cases referred to are well-known already, and can be quickly validated by anyone who wants to verify.
p16263
aVBy all means, verify them.
p16264
aVI notice you haven't done so.
p16265
aVNor have you supported his already demonstrably incorrect false premise that the NRA has rewritten the 2nd Amendment.
p16266
aVEDIT: Btw this article is basically promotion for his upcoming book, just released, that's a hitpiece on the the individual rights interpretation of the 2nd amendment.
p16267
aVExpect more rebuttals as the book is circulated.
p16268
aVNo lies on my part- and all your "Citation needed" requests were already met prior to, and with the link to NRA's lobby group - and on that particular page does the NRA challenge all needs for any type of regulation, including background check and licensing of sales (despite fact that 90% of the population supports background check and licensing of sales).
p16269
aV&gt;Sure, and they are examples of lying through omission, as I already stated\u000a\u000aOkay - so now you're admitting that the NRA and others using the chopped quotes/misquotes are lying?
p16270
aVGood!
p16271
aV&gt;By all means, verify them.
p16272
aVI have.
p16273
aVAs I noted, anyone can, and very quickly.
p16274
aVAll of the statements in this that you originally challenged are, in fact, legitimate and well-founded.
p16275
aVAnd that leads me to yet again ask you, as others on this thread have, to cite your claims that the statements are wrong (or "lies," as you say).
p16276
aVThat's how it works in court, debates, etc.
p16277
aV- if someone introduces a statement, and you challenge its validity, it is then YOUR responsibility to validate your challenge.
p16278
aVYou haven't.
p16279
aVNot once.
p16280
aVYou offered a couple of links from Federalist Papers, one of which is of no relevance to your argument (a chopped interpretation) and the second of which is irrelevant due to its date - that was before the Constitution was ratified and enacted, so how is it, then, of any relevance to the amendments of the Constitution?
p16281
aVAnd your third link is to a funky group that does a bad job of trying to hide its operator - even its host (Network Solutions, which normally allows as anon as possible registration) cites it for trying to clamp that info (your guncite is registered under the same name/address/phone of another site called Hip Hop Honeys - looks like an escort service).
p16282
aVAnd if you think all such registration weapons in the private market is invalid, then why aren't you bitching about automobiles?
p16283
aVDriver's licenses?
p16284
aVThat sure as hell affects a lot more people, right?
p16285
aVShoot - you need driving instruction, written test/driving test/eyesight test, must have insurance, must carry the license whenever operating a vehicle, must pay penalty for violating any rules about auto use and operation, must have vehicle inspected (in almost all states) for safety, the car must meet minimum safety standards, and you can lose the license if you violate enough terms.
p16286
aVSince that affects so many more people, why aren't you going after that?
p16287
aVALSO: Since all that beeg gubbamint junk on driving went into \u000aeffect about half a century ago, we now have over 4 times the number of vehicles on the road -- and less than half the number of fatal accidents. 
p16288
aV&gt; No lies on my part- and all your "Citation needed" requests were already met prior to, and with the link to NRA's lobby group - and on that particular page does the NRA challenge all needs for any type of regulation, including background check and licensing of sales (despite fact that 90% of the population supports background check and licensing of sales).
p16289
aVActually you haven't met any of the requests.
p16290
aVYou made a couple unsubstantiated statements about things and didn't provide a whit of evidence supporting them.
p16291
aVNote, a link to the NRA-ILA isn't evidence.
p16292
aVSo, let's reiterate:\u000a\u000a&gt; Actually, the NRA is campaigning for unregulated ownership\u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* as this is not true.
p16293
aV&gt;no type of background checks at all; \u000a\u000aThat's a lie.
p16294
aVStraight up, no quibbling there - this is a lie.
p16295
aV&gt; promotes unlicensed sales; \u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* because you really need to support this.
p16296
aVFeel free to answer those.
p16297
aVBe *specific* in your claims because thus far you've made a couple very large lies.
p16298
aV&gt; Okay - so now you're admitting that the NRA and others using the chopped quotes/misquotes are lying?
p16299
aVGood!
p16300
aVWrong.
p16301
aVI'm saying the author in the OP is lying.
p16302
aV&gt; I have.
p16303
aVAs I noted, anyone can, and very quickly.
p16304
aVAll of the statements in this that you originally challenged are, in fact, legitimate and well-founded.
p16305
aVAnd that leads me to yet again ask you, as others on this thread have, to cite your claims that the statements are wrong (or "lies," as you say).
p16306
aVThat's how it works in court, debates, etc.
p16307
aV- if someone introduces a statement, and you challenge its validity, it is then YOUR responsibility to validate your challenge.
p16308
aVYou haven't.
p16309
aVNot once.
p16310
aVNope.
p16311
aVYou've made a couple "nuh uh" responses and haven't provided anything actually backing up your statements.
p16312
aVOn the other hand, I provided direct citations from the Federalist papers and specifically mentioned Miller, all of which add up to my position that **the author has lied, repeatedly**.
p16313
aV&gt; You offered a couple of links from Federalist Papers, one of which is of no relevance to your argument (a chopped interpretation) \u000a\u000aWrong.
p16314
aVAgain it specifically mentions a need for the common citizen to be armed.
p16315
aV&gt; and the second of which is irrelevant due to its date - that was before the Constitution was ratified and enacted, so how is it, then, of any relevance to the amendments of the Constitution?
p16316
aVOh that's rich.
p16317
aVSo the original source material prior to the Constitution being written, detailing their *reasoning* behind why they'd write things the way they did, is not considered relevant?
p16318
aVThat's hilarious.
p16319
aV&gt; And your third link is to a funky group that does a bad job of trying to hide its operator - even its host (Network Solutions, which normally allows as anon as possible registration) cites it for trying to clamp that info (your guncite is registered under the same name/address/phone of another site called Hip Hop Honeys - looks like an escort service).
p16320
aVOh, the ad hominem argument.
p16321
aVHow droll.
p16322
aV&gt; And if you think all such registration weapons in the private market is invalid, then why aren't you bitching about automobiles?
p16323
aVDriver's licenses?
p16324
aVYou do understand that automobile registration is for revenue, right?
p16325
aVNot as a crime fighting measure, which is what the typical anti-gun proponent states is the purpose for gun registration.
p16326
aVFurthermore, you do understand that automobiles are fairly large items that are not easily concealed, and when they operate on a road they have plates which are clearly visible from distance?
p16327
aVJust checking because it seems that you've lost your cognitive abilities thus far.
p16328
aV&gt;  That sure as hell affects a lot more people, right?
p16329
aVShoot - you need driving instruction, written test/driving test/eyesight test, must have insurance, must carry the license whenever operating a vehicle, must pay penalty for violating any rules about auto use and operation, must have vehicle inspected (in almost all states) for safety, the car must meet minimum safety standards, and you can lose the license if you violate enough terms.
p16330
aVSince that affects so many more people, why aren't you going after that?
p16331
aVHaving fun with that strawman?
p16332
aVOr do I need to illustrate just how lax automobile regulations are compared to firearms?
p16333
aV&gt; Since all that beeg gubbamint junk on driving went into effect about half a century ago, we now have over 4 times the number of vehicles on the road -- and less than half the number of fatal accidents.
p16334
aVOk?
p16335
aVWe had [606 fatal firearms accidents in 2010](http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate10_us.html) in a nation with 300 million guns.
p16336
aVThere were 35,332 motor vehicle fatalities the same year, with far fewer cars.
p16337
aVFirearms accidents aren't a problem.
p16338
aVYou really suck at being a troll.
p16339
aVYou keep trying to spin this in circles, but you have not once provided any basis of your claims (that the article of this thread has invalid claims).
p16340
aVYou keep saying it, but keep diverting away to multiple tangents when asked for source.
p16341
aVNever addressing the same subject you yourself introduced.
p16342
aVYou keep saying the "author has lied repeatedly" ... **but have not provided any source that validates your claim.
p16343
aV**  You've provided ones to other statements  you made (and which are either invalid or of questionable source itself), but not one to your claims that the arguments in the article - i.e., NRA history, change of NRA stances and actions, legal history of relevance, etc.
p16344
aV- are invalid.
p16345
aVYou've had quite a loooong time to do so, too -- but haven't.
p16346
aVYou're also using tactics from "Trolling for Dummies" - when facing a fact you can't counter, you just try to insult the facts.
p16347
aVYou not only cite questionable source, but are now using ones that don't validate your claims at all (you probably listed the general link hoping I and others don't know how to use CDC's data base - you were wrong).
p16348
aVAs for that, the total firearms deaths in 2010 was 31,672 - a number that's been growing annually since 1981.
p16349
aVThe claim of 300 million guns is crap - only NRA says that, and it's already been criticized for a shitty attempt by NRA to count every weapon that may or may not have been in the US since 1776.
p16350
aVThe number is actually 170 million (scientific estimate limited by the lack of registration requirements today), a majority of which are shotguns and rifles, and that includes collectors/antiques that never get used except for display.
p16351
aVOld/defunct/dismantled/confiscated/destroyed doesn't count.
p16352
aVAs for ownership, 34.4% of US households.
p16353
aVNow for autos/licenses: 32,367 vehicle fatalities in 2013 - lowest in 62 years (consecutive decline), too.
p16354
aV254.4 million private-use vehicles used by 95 percent of all US households. 
p16355
aV&gt; You really suck at being a troll.
p16356
aVYou keep trying to spin this in circles, but you have not once provided any basis of your claims (that the article of this thread has invalid claims).
p16357
aVYou keep saying it, but keep diverting away to multiple tangents when asked for source.
p16358
aVNever addressing the same subject you yourself introduced.
p16359
aVOh, ok.  By all means, show some proof of the claims you made, specifically:\u000a\u000a&gt; Actually, the NRA is campaigning for unregulated ownership\u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* as this is not true.
p16360
aV&gt;no type of background checks at all; \u000a\u000aThat's a lie.
p16361
aVStraight up, no quibbling there - this is a lie.
p16362
aV&gt; promotes unlicensed sales; \u000a\u000a*[Citation needed]* because you really need to support this.
p16363
aV&gt; You keep saying the "author has lied repeatedly" ... but have not provided any source that validates your claim.
p16364
aVStrange, the very title of the article in question is that the NRA has rewritten the 2nd amendment.
p16365
aVHe's shown no support for this claim; in fact I can't remember a constitutional convention in my lifetime.
p16366
aVPerhaps you could show where the NRA has rewritten the 2nd Amendment?
p16367
aVOh, you *can't*?
p16368
aVWell don't worry, we have a term for that.
p16369
aVIt's called *lying*\u000a\u000a&gt; You're also using tactics from "Trolling for Dummies" - when facing a fact you can't counter, you just try to insult the facts.
p16370
aVWhat facts, precious?
p16371
aV&gt; You not only cite questionable source, but are now using ones that don't validate your claims at all (you probably listed the general link hoping I and others don't know how to use CDC's data base - you were wrong).
p16372
aVBy all means, contradict the CDC data showing 606 unintentional firearms deaths.
p16373
aVShow your work.
p16374
aV&gt; As for that, the total firearms deaths in 2010 was 31,672 - a number that's been growing annually since 1981.
p16375
aVOh so we're arriving to the next lie used by anti-gun trolls - shifting the goalposts.
p16376
aVOriginally you made the comparison of car accident fatalities halving, to which I showed data illustrating that firearms accidents are much lower.
p16377
aVNow you are equivocating and trying to include *homicides* and *suicides* which is unsurprising because deception is the favorite tool of anti-gun trolls.
p16378
aV&gt;  The claim of 300 million guns is crap - only NRA says that, and it's already been criticized for a shitty attempt by NRA to count every weapon that may or may not have been in the US since 1776.
p16379
aVThe number is actually 170 million (scientific estimate limited by the lack of registration requirements today), a majority of which are shotguns and rifles, and that includes collectors/antiques that never get used except for display.
p16380
aVYeah, I'm going to need a citation for your 170 million estimate.
p16381
aVThe [BATFE](http://www.atf.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf-files/052013-firearms-commerce-in-the-us-annual-update.pdf) reports otherwise, and even [Mayors Against Illegal Guns, antigun astroturf group that they are, agrees with this number.
p16382
aV](http://www.gunfaq.org/2013/03/how-many-guns-in-the-united-states/), but by all means, feel free to quibble.
p16383
aV&gt; As for ownership, 34.4% of US households.
p16384
aVIrrelevant.
p16385
aV&gt; Now for autos/licenses: 32,367 vehicle fatalities in 2013 - lowest in 62 years (consecutive decline), too.
p16386
aV254.4 million private-use vehicles used by 95 percent of all US households.
p16387
aVRight, we've already established that automobiles are much more dangerous than guns with regards to accidental deaths, to the tune of 50x incidents.  
p16388
aVYour first source lists "International Trade Commission" to be its source for the number - and "international" means....**worldwide.
p16389
aV** The others credit their sources to be either NRA or CRS (which itself cites NRA as source for most estimates).
p16390
aVYour claims of 606 firearm deaths is invalid --- your own source (which I know how to use, fumbduck) proves it.
p16391
aVNow you're trying to move all this into the same cycling loop, and by reintroducing the same bullshit - which has already been answered, despite your circle of denials - and still avoiding having to answer the original request for validating source.
p16392
aVNobody else is reading this thread, so the opportunity for you to sink your bullshit into someone stupid enough to believe it is long gone.
p16393
aVSo please stop wasting your time and just go fuck yourself (which medical studies say is the only opportunity for most handgun-loving enthusiasts - who are also dominantly racist and uneducated - to get laid). 
p16394
aV&gt; Your first source lists "International Trade Commission" to be its source for the number - and "international" means....worldwide.
p16395
aVThe others credit their sources to be either NRA or CRS (which itself cites NRA as source for most estimates).
p16396
aVYou do know that the BATFE is a government agency that regulates guns manufactured and imported into this country, right?
p16397
aVIf you want to dispute their numbers, source it up.
p16398
aV&gt; Your claims of 606 firearm deaths is invalid --- your own source (which I know how to use, fumbduck) proves it.
p16399
aVNope.
p16400
aVYou cited accidental deaths.
p16401
aVI provided impartial government numbers on accidental deaths.
p16402
aVIf you want to shift the goalposts that doesn't invalidate the point, that just makes you dishonest.
p16403
aV&gt; Now you're trying to move all this into the same cycling loop, and by reintroducing the same bullshit - which has already been answered, despite your circle of denials - and still avoiding having to answer the original request for validating source.
p16404
aVI notice you still haven't shown proof of your claims about unregulated  ownership, sales promotion, etc.
p16405
aVYour handwaving is pretty amusing, but you haven't supported your claim.
p16406
aVHow about you man up and just admit you were lying?
p16407
aVYou can't quote a single sentence from the article that is counter-factual, can you?
p16408
aVI'm interested in hearing your argument against something claimed in the article, rather than your argument against something you are pretending to be stated in the article.
p16409
aVYou do you realize Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning are not  journalists don't you?
p16410
aVA source law is designed to protect journalists.

aVA source law is not designed to protect them.

aVyeah, Russia's treatment of gays has sort of taken a backseat to their invasion of Ukraine.
p16413
aVI wonder why?
p16414
aVPretty high on the disinformation there...
p16415
aVBut if you have an axe to grind...?
p16416
aVI note that ThinkProgress has neglected to mention that the FedEx facility was a gun-free zone across the street from a police substation and the shooter blasted an unarmed guard on his way in. 
p16417
aVDownvoted.

aVIts literally the only place in town thats a gun free zone.

aVBefore the vote, the bill&amp;#039;s sponsor, Sen. Josh McKoon, joined the hearing to similarly argue against making an exception for nondiscrimination protections.
p16434
aV&gt; He claimed that the bill&amp;#039;s religious liberty protections would no longer be &amp;quot;Uniform&amp;quot; across the state, adding, &amp;quot;That amendment would completely undercut the purpose of the bill.&amp;quot; Rep.

aVbeing gay, straight, bi, anything else is a matter of who you *want* to have sex with, not who you *do* have sex with.
p16445
aVmany people have sex with people they do not want to have sex with.
p16446
aVYes, that would be Mr. Savage's point to Dr. Carson.
p16447
aVFor me being straight ( as I understand straight in the traditional sense being to be in search of an opposite gendered mate ) is based on my entire being being in a state of preparation for two things, mating for life with the mother of my child children , my entire being is and has been in a state of preparing for being a parent , I played as a youth to prepare me for how children behave , if society deems me an unfit parent because of how I played I will never have children but that is not up to me, that is up to the community I live in and work in.
p16448
aVI am a free lance head of house hold until I become a head of house hold and modern politics makes it difficult for me to be such a thing because as I understand it the work of Dan Savage and his peers were to bring society to this point where someone like me, would experience , well , my life.
p16449
aVI have not down voted you for your comment, but I think you are conflating multiple traits:\u000a\u000a* a desire to raise children is not merely a heterosexual trait -- gay partners have surrogate babies and adopt.
p16450
aVstraight partners choose not to have offspring.
p16451
aVNeither case makes them less gay or more straight.
p16452
aV* being of one gender (male?, but you never stated) does not make you the de facto *head of household* -- If anything, when you enter into a partnership with another person (of whatever gender), you give up your *ruling* status because you have another adult whose opinions are equally valid.
p16453
aVYou are never on a life track to be head of a household; that's something you work out with a willing partner.
p16454
aVIn either case, you don't experience less of your life, adopting or partnering simply changes your life.
p16455
aVThat is not what I took away from the point Dan Savage was trying to make.
p16456
aVedit: on re-reading, I think I mistook your example of playing as a child as a metaphor for learning how to be straight, but if you really meant that it was your best qualification for raising children, I'll point out that it's just crazy.
p16457
aVYou played as a child because you were a child; not as a qualification for raising them.
p16458
aVA woman is qualified to raise a boy child even if she never was a boy.
p16459
aVA parent should override their child's desire to eat every meal at Chuck E. Cheese even if that is the only place he or she wanted to eat as a kid.
p16460
aVA parent who was abused or molested by a parent is not disqualified from raising their own kids in the future.
p16461
aVI fail to see how community standards (good or bad) of your own childhood might disqualify you from raising your own kids.
p16462
aVAs either a metaphorical example or a separate point, it fails.
p16463
aVI would require training to engage in this conversation with you. 
p16464
aVYou've changed the wording in your original post so my first response has changed context.
p16465
aVIt'd help to reply to my comments rather than to change your original wording since that changes the meaning of what i've said.
p16466
aVBut I'll respond to additional points your new wording makes:\u000a\u000a* being straight is "to be in search of an opposite gendered mate" -- having an opposite gendered mate is ancillary to being gay or straight.
p16467
aVWe don't consider Freddie Mercury, Kenny Everett, Anthony Perkins, Oscar Wilde, or many others to be straight even though they were married to women and some produced offspring.
p16468
aV* being straight is in preparation for "mating for life with the mother of my [children]" -- How is that preparation?
p16469
aVYou do not become less straight if you divorce, have an affair with an opposite gendered partner, re-marry after death of your partner, fail to have kids, or become infertile.
p16470
aVThe length of your relationship, the number of children you raise, and where you like to grind your genitals are not necessarily related.
p16471
aV* "my entire being is and has been in a state of preparing for being a parent" -- Being a parent does not define the purpose or meaning of your life.
p16472
aVWe consider Beethoven, Isaac Newton, Ada Lovelace, the Wright Brothers, Jean Paul Sartre, and many others (to have been straight and) and to have made significant contributions through their lives despite not marrying or having offspring.
p16473
aVThere's also a fellow named Jesus who isn't noted for his parental contributions, but some would argue he led a meaningful life (whether or not he had kids).
p16474
aVYou don't have to be a parent, or even a *good* parent, to have meaning in your life.
p16475
aV* "I played as a youth to prepare me for how children behave" -- No, you played as a youth because you were a youth.
p16476
aVChildren we know to be biologically infertile do not get put into the workforce, nor are children with terminal illnesses executed.
p16477
aVAnd certainly your experiences as a child don't raise or disqualify you from parenthood.
p16478
aVBeating your Cabbage Patch doll does not mean you will beat your child.
p16479
aVYou are not disqualified from raising girls because you were a boy.
p16480
aVAll-A, honor-roll, students have not learned how to motivate or raise a child (on the honor-roll or not).
p16481
aVYes, your childhood may offer you some insight, but there's a huge amount to learn about child behavior that you'd be wise to learn as an adult.
p16482
aV* "If society deems me an unfit parent because of how I played, I will never have children [even if I want to since that is] up to the community I live and work in" -- No.
p16483
aVThere are really bad kids, juvenile delinquents, and criminals who grow up and have children of their own (some of them even turn out to be good folk).
p16484
aVSociety may shame or shun them, but no one needs to get a license to procreate.
p16485
aVThe sins of the fathers are not sins of the son.
p16486
aVYes, you can have offspring taken away from you, but that's due to your actions as an adult and are meant to protect the child; you could still inseminate and produce many off-spring.
p16487
aV* [Whether a single adult male or married, my life experience is defined as] "head of household" -- That's an old-fashioned misogynistic tradition.
p16488
aVToday, we recognize a wife as an equal partner in a marriage.
p16489
aVFor example, you *can* be convicted of raping your wife even if *you* wanted to have sex.
p16490
aVThat hasn't always been the case, but it's the way of doing things today.
p16491
aVSome partners do defer to all decisions being made by one person, but that's still an arrangement the two partners have come to agree on.
p16492
aVA workable marriage is about the adults having a way of working things out; it doesn't come just due to fiat of gender.
p16493
aVI am not heavily invested in this movement and because of such I do not know which notes to meet you at in corresponding with you about this topic on your , what appears to be , advanced level.
p16494
aVWonder if Hillary is going to boycott Netanyahu during his visit to Congress ?
p16495
aVSeems to be a generational thing.
p16496
aVWe've slowly become more distanced, opposed and polarized.
p16497
aVWouldn't it be nice to have a legitimate third option to represent those that aren't pulled to either side, to plug that democratic deficit? 
p16498
aVHow do you do that in a political system that effectively requires a two-party system?
p16499
aVUntil we can fix our electoral system to allow third parties to be viable I don't see what choice we have.
p16500
aVI don't want to live through another 2000.
p16501
aVopen and blatant racism should be swift end to a politicians career.
p16502
aVthere is no reason to tolerate this garbage when there are many who can fill this guy's shoes the very next day
p16503
aVYeah but then you'd have to apply it both ways. 
p16504
aVIm dont see a downside to that
p16505
aVIts good to see a politician working hard to improve the lives if those he serves. 
p16506
aVYeah, that's not gonna fly. 
p16507
aVWhy not.
p16508
aVKinda worked for Obama. 
p16509
aVObama was talking about persecuting those who did it.
p16510
aVHe was very vocal on the wisdom of the decisions to use force -- one aye, one nay.
p16511
aVNow, granted, I didn't read the article.
p16512
aVBut I'm willing to bet Jeb isn't talking about prosecutions; he's talking about the decisions to use force.
p16513
aVAnd if he wants to be president, he's gonna have to do better than that.  \u000a\u000a

aVSteinem's quote:\u000a\u000a&gt;When we think of violence against women, for instance, we understandably think mainly of other countries, where the degree of violence is much higher," Steinem is quoted as saying in an Oct. 1, 2014, Associated Press story.
p16576
aV"But what is also true is that if you added up all the women who have been murdered by their husbands or boyfriends since 9/11, and then you add up all the Americans who were killed by 9/11 or in Afghanistan and Iraq, more women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends.
p16577
aVOK, I know this is being nitpicky, and the point of Steinem's quote stands, but... notice how a general term for 'women' is used while she's specific about Americans having been killed by the 9/11 attacks and ensuring wars.
p16578
aVDoes she mean more women worldwide or more American women by partners than Americans from the attacks and war?
p16579
aVIt's ambiguous.

aVBe very careful allowing the executive branch to take power from the legislative, all those powers will still be there when another Republican is president.. Obama might be a great guy that would never misuse his power (imo, he is not) but these actions set a precedent for the Executive Branch.
p16618
aVFor Example, Obama unilaterally delaying the employer mandate means that the next President can do the same.

p16811
aVThey were holding her down.
p16812
aVShe was immobile, and *then* they let the dog come over and eat part of her leg.
p16813
aVYes, eat.
p16814
aVThe article has a picture of her wounds.
p16815
aVThere's a huge hole, about three inches in diameter, where the dog obviously tore a big chunk of muscle out of her leg, as well as several huge tears that the doctors already closed with stitches.
p16816
aVThere's so much fucked up here.
p16817
aVI can't even imagine any context in which three officers would need a dog to restrain an unarmed woman, let alone in the situation described here when she's ALREADY RESTRAINED AND ON THE FUCKING GROUND.

aVThis guy ran for governor of CT about 10 years ago, and lost. 
p16822
aVAbandon Democrats for Republicans or meaningless losing?
p16823
aVAgree that it's been a while since I've seen Democrat-supported  *sustainable* planning.
p16824
aVIt does seem to me that Republican representatives span a spectrum of political opinion that once covered both Democrats and Republicans--with core American values.
p16825
aVBut so often now, the values promoted by Democratic representatives do not represent thought rooted in the Constitution or thought that clearly demonstrates traditional American core values.  
p16826
aVWhat spectrum of political opinion are you talking about?
p16827
aVWhat are "American core values"?
p16828
aVwho defines that?
p16829
aV&gt;spectrum of political opinion\u000a\u000aDifferent representatives have different platforms/views on issues such as immigration, economic debt, and even health care.
p16830
aVI know this is obvious, but it is less obvious that the views represented by some republicans pretty much fit old school democrat positions.
p16831
aV&gt;American core values\u000a\u000aThe US Constitution and amendments express the core values.
p16832
aVThings like freedom of speech, the press and religion.
p16833
aVThings like a humanitarian view of individuals ('individual soul liberty') which also links to the phrase 'inalienable rights' and 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'.
p16834
aVLiberty is elastic so that 'my liberty ends where yours begins' and liberty recognizes responsibility as well as freedom.
p16835
aVI don't see Republicans having different opinions on immigration, MOST DEFINITELY not on healthcare.
p16836
aVIf you could provide examples I'd be much obliged.
p16837
aVRepublicans and Democrats have changed ideologies so many times throughout American history that the labels are almost meaningless.
p16838
aVI think your view on Republicans representing American core values is also relative.
p16839
aVFor instance, the sponsoring of anti-gay marriage legislation is completely against what Republicans (small government) and what our constitution are about.
p16840
aVBoth parties suck.
p16841
aVThis country has too many people to neatly fit into red or blue. 
p16842
aVThere are republicans supporting as well as opposing the Affordable Care Act.
p16843
aVThere are differing perspectives on immigration reform as well.
p16844
aVSome decrying amnesty altogether because of illegal status and others who take a softer approach to those immigrants who love American ideals but could not access US residency legally.
p16845
aVCheck out Jeb Bush.
p16846
aVI think the republican party is upholding the values that used to be esteemed by both Democrats and Republicans.
p16847
aVCurrent Democrat applications seem prone to 'over correct' in areas of social justice (extends into fiscal programs) to the point of limiting liberties.
p16848
aVSuch positions do not uphold American core values that protect these liberties\u000a\u000aAnti-gay marriage legislation is actually protecting the conscience' of people who define marriage the way it has always been defined.
p16849
aVThere is no reason for homosexuals to impose their interpretation on the standard.
p16850
aVJust as they use new words to identify their partners (SO rather than husband or wife), they could represent their household unit in other terms, they do not need to hijack the term *marriage.
p16851
aV*\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a
p16852
aVWell, when marriage guarantees you certain rights and gives you benefits, I'd call denying same sex partners the same rights and benefits outright discrimination.
p16853
aVThat is more than enough reason for same sex partners to want to marry each other.
p16854
aVHaving the government "protect the conscience" haha, I can't even finish that sentence, that is a ludicrous justification to enact a federal law to protect the religious definition of marriage.
p16855
aVA more Republican course of action would be to eliminate all tax credits married couples receive or enact legislation to give same sex couples the same benefits.
p16856
aVHiding behind the "sanctity of marriage", an practice that ends in divorce about 40% of the time in the US, is cowardly drivel.
p16857
aVYou can't just say there are Republicans that support this or that without providing facts\u000a\u000aHere are a couple of articles about democrats against the ACA:\u000a\u000ahttp://swampland.time.com/2013/11/15/meet-the-39-democrats-who-voted-with-the-house-on-obamacare/\u000a\u000ahttp://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-who-voted-against-obamacare-keep-your-plan-2013-11\u000a\u000aLikewise, there are some Dems against amnesty.
p16858
aVWhat values are the Republicans holding up, specifically?
p16859
aVIt seems to me that they are overly concerned with reproductive rights (limiting the liberties of women who are the ones who have to carry babies) continuing the war on drugs (limiting the liberty of what the individual chooses  to partake in, as opposed to the legal drugs of alcohol and tobacco) and NEITHER party has done a damn thing to get Americans working good jobs with good wages.
p16860
aVI just find that your hypothesis is flawed, or atleast seriously tinted with the glasses of your chosen ideology. \u000a\u000a
p16861
aVUsing the term 'civil union' could be considered.
p16862
aVBut even then you'd have to think about the difference between marriage and such a civil union:  one reason marriage is protected because of it's potential reproduction and intended place as a societal stabilizer.
p16863
aV(Unfortunately as you noted, marriages are declining in quality and quantity--I think we need to have self-reflection about why this is occurring, and recognize that *defining* marriage differently is *not* the answer, though valuing and protecting it may contribute to strengthening society).
p16864
aVOf course this would move the debate into a different ethical arena centered around whether or not government should tacitly support harmful practices--homosexual relationships proliferate STD's and HIV and result in higher instances of cancer.
p16865
aVAnd I think that debate is more appropriate then trying to suddenly force the word 'marriage' into a definition that is an outright affront to biblical texts (religious stances).
p16866
aVProtecting the conscience is the same thing as protecting freedom of religion, speech and press.
p16867
aVIt is allowing a person to believe what they believe without fear of repercussions.
p16868
aVRecent cases show an increasing tendency to force people to accept things they find objectionable.
p16869
aVUsing the word 'marriage' to define other civil unions which are not marriage is an example.
p16870
aVAnother area would be the reproductive rights which you brought up--there is a hierarchy of law in effect here:  should a women's right to her body be more important than saving a life?
p16871
aVThat is the question.
p16872
aVI think there are gray areas in cases of rape (where the woman did not chose the action that impregnated her) as well as when a mother's life is in danger.
p16873
aVBut generally, we should value saving lives more than keeping people comfortable.
p16874
aVDrugs is another thing.
p16875
aVI think the debate here should focus on resulting behaviors rather than on ingesting.
p16876
aVThis is where the rights of an individual can absolutely destroy another person/family.
p16877
aVPunishing those who behave irresponsibly is more the role of government than regulating individual liberty; however some drugs are obviously only destructive for recreational use.
p16878
aVYou can google the phrase 'Republicans support Obamacare' and get all sorts of discussion.
p16879
aVDiscussion on that has been rather prominent.
p16880
aVI haven't said that *all* Democrats oppose American values; I said there is a trend for limiting core American values through applications that affect those protections.
p16881
aVAnd I said that some republicans today are filling the gap in ideology.
p16882
aVThink about historical democrats and compare their platforms to the parties today--it's obvious.
p16883
aVMost of them would run as Republican.
p16884
aVI agree that creating jobs and developing a competent and committed  workforce are crucial to a strong, stable economy.
p16885
aVI have supported candidates who emphasize this.  
p16886
aV&gt; Using the term 'civil union' could be considered.
p16887
aVBut even then you'd have to think about the difference between marriage and such a civil union: one reason marriage is protected because of it's potential reproduction and intended place as a societal stabilizer.
p16888
aV(Unfortunately as you noted, marriages are declining in quality and quantity--I think we need to have self-reflection about why this is occurring, and recognize that defining marriage differently is not the answer, though valuing and protecting it may contribute to strengthening society).
p16889
aVYes but.....having children is not a prerequisite of to receiving these benefits.
p16890
aVSo what is the difference between a childless marriage and a same sex one?
p16891
aVThen again, encouraging same sex couples to adopt might help the vast amount of children without a family.
p16892
aVNo one is defining marriage differently, same sex couples simply want the same protections and benefits that straight ones do.
p16893
aVYou can't say that civil unions carry all the same benefits as marriage.
p16894
aVThats discrimination.
p16895
aVHomosexual relationships are not inferior to heterosexual relationships.
p16896
aVHomosexuality itself does not proliferate STDs.
p16897
aVIn fact, I think how Society has relegated them as inferior to male-female relationships is a large part why they are more prone to STDs.
p16898
aVGay men typically have more partners than straight ones.
p16899
aVIf we "normalized" homosexuality, its possible you'd see less promiscuity and more longer term relationships, and the rates of STDs between homo and heterosexuality will even out.
p16900
aVAs to it being an affront to religious texts...well, that is their problem.
p16901
aVNo one is forcing them to marry gay people, but gay people should enjoy the same protections with their long term partners that straight people do.
p16902
aVreproductive rights are about more than keeping people comfortable.
p16903
aVHaving a kid is a huge responsibility and a gigantic cost.
p16904
aVIt takes both sexes to make the unwise choice before they are prepared yet only one has to really bear the burden.
p16905
aVPerhaps if we had a better system of adoption that encouraged gay partners to adopt I'd be with you.
p16906
aVAlso, are you willing to pay out of your own pocket in taxes to support all these unwanted kids if we eliminated abortion?
p16907
aVAs to drugs.
p16908
aVAlcohol and cigarettes are legal, and they are among the worst poisons a person can ingest.
p16909
aVThey wreck your health and in the case of alcohol, can make a person aggressive and irrational.
p16910
aVEvery drug should enjoy the same status as alcohol and cigarettes.
p16911
aV&gt; I haven't said that all Democrats oppose American values; I said there is a trend for limiting core American values through applications that affect those protections.
p16912
aVAnd I said that some republicans today are filling the gap in ideology.
p16913
aVThink about historical democrats and compare their platforms to the parties today--it's obvious.
p16914
aVMost of them would run as Republican.
p16915
aVYes, and historical republicans would run as democrats.
p16916
aVThe parties have switched ideologies, thats just history.
p16917
aVI think what you define as core American values is extremely subjective and varies between Americans.
p16918
aVI am not less American than you, yet obviously we have a difference in opinion on what are our values, I don't think mine are lesser than yours. \u000a\u000a\u000a
p16919
aV&gt;If we "normalized" homosexuality, its possible you'd see less promiscuity and more longer term relationships, and the rates of STDs between homo and heterosexuality will even out.
p16920
aV...because heterosexual relationships are following this trend?
p16921
aVYou pointed out how marriage has become less popular as divorce rates have risen.
p16922
aVHow does your argument here follow that?
p16923
aVI think you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.
p16924
aVWe need a good long look at the societal decline of marriage.
p16925
aVCouples already receive some benefits based on number of dependents.
p16926
aV&gt;They wreck your health and in the case of alcohol, can make a person aggressive and irrational.
p16927
aVEvery drug should enjoy the same status as alcohol and cigarettes.
p16928
aVAnd you are again choosing a position that employs massive cognitive dissonance.
p16929
aVSales on alcohol and cigarettes are regulated and taxed, but you are claiming that decriminalizing drug use will lighten government interference.
p16930
aVYou also need to consider the necessary increase in spending within a criminal justice system with a glut of cases for irresponsible behavior from drug use--vehicular manslaughter domestic abuse...etc.
p16931
aVSo there is a place for determining valuable prohibitive legislation.
p16932
aVCore American values are tied to the documents that established the distinctive US style of government.
p16933
aVThe Constitution and amendments define that.
p16934
aVSure, we interpret; but that interpretation takes into account those defining values and *protects* them, not subjecting them to frivolous and casual applications that undermine them.
p16935
aV&gt; because heterosexual relationships are following this trend?
p16936
aVYou pointed out how marriage has become less popular as divorce rates have risen.
p16937
aVHow does your argument here follow that?
p16938
aVI think you are trying to have your cake and eat it too.
p16939
aVNo, im just pointing out that your main objection- STDs- is a product of a behavior conditioned by society, not any biological difference in same sex activitiy.
p16940
aV&gt; Sales on alcohol and cigarettes are regulated and taxed, but you are claiming that decriminalizing drug use will lighten government interference.
p16941
aVYou also need to consider the necessary increase in spending within a criminal justice system with a glut of cases for irresponsible behavior from drug use--vehicular manslaughter domestic abuse...etc.
p16942
aVSo there is a place for determining valuable prohibitive legislation.
p16943
aVWhat prevents us from regulating and taxing drug use?I've claimed no such thing, I am claiming that instead of making criminals we should make tax payers.
p16944
aVAs to your second point....lord almighty, do you not think that there is a glut of cases for possession and distribution of drugs?
p16945
aVArent we ALREADY spending money on vehicular manslaughter and domestic abuse stemming from drug abuse??
p16946
aVThere is no place for prohibitive legislation, you'd think we would've learned that when we tried alcohol prohibition, a massive failure.
p16947
aVUnless your argument is that a governments role is to police the morals of its citizens, something no conservative should be for.
p16948
aV&gt; Core American values are tied to the documents that established the distinctive US style of government.
p16949
aVThe Constitution and amendments define that.
p16950
aVSure, we interpret; but that interpretation takes into account those defining values and protects them, not subjecting them to frivolous and casual applications that undermine them.
p16951
aVWell, Id argue that interpretation is very subjective.
p16952
aVIm sure we have two very different interpretations of the freedom of religion clause for instance.
p16953
aVAnd Im sure the founding fathers would take both of our interpretations of the constitution and its amendments as ridiculous. 
p16954
aVThe negative health side effects of homosexuality are clear.
p16955
aVYou can deny them, but you are denying facts.
p16956
aV&gt;instead of making criminals we should make tax payers.
p16957
aVThe black market.
p16958
aVand tax evasion.
p16959
aVThere's no way around it.
p16960
aVLegislating taxes will not take care of root problems.
p16961
aVYes, there is already a backlog of cases.
p16962
aVBut more would not help.
p16963
aVThat's why we need to get to the root of the problem rather than slapping a band-aid law on it.
p16964
aVAs for 'policing morals,' you can't get around the necessary protective nature of government.
p16965
aVPunishing domestic abuse and vehicular manslaughter are examples of this.
p16966
aVIt is wrong to abuse the people in your care, even if you are unaware that you are doing it because you have made a choice to use drugs that limit your judgement.
p16967
aVIt is still wrong and it always will be.
p16968
aVThis is a moral.
p16969
aVIrresponsible behavior that takes a life is another serious moral issue.
p16970
aVThis goes along with the discussion on abortion.
p16971
aVThe debate can not be over the criminality of killing a human, it is over when human life actually begins.
p16972
aVThis is why there is very little support for late term abortion.
p16973
aVAnd why killing babies at birth is still tried as murder.
p16974
aVIt *is.
p16975
aV*  People who choose to have sex, know that pregnancy is a very plausible result.
p16976
aVIf they are making irresponsible choices, why should the law become complicit?
p16977
aVAll laws incorporate a degree of morality.
p16978
aVThink about it, even the fact that we punish those who break the laws shows that.
p16979
aVCivilization breaks down when the people who comprise it don't work together and hypocrisy and deceit go hand in hand with criminality.
p16980
aVYour interpretation of the freedom of religion clause does not take into account the entire text.
p16981
aVIt is constructed merely as a loophole seeking enterprise, and does not uphold the integrity of the document. 
p16982
aVThe "Progressive" left respects "progressive values" and not tradition.
p16983
aVFor all the talk about the "Moral Majority" putting so many of the religious voters in the Republican column in the 80s, many stuck with the Democrats.
p16984
aVAt this point the Democrats' base is openly hostile towards traditional religion.
p16985
aVPolitics is becoming their religion. 
p16986
aVWhat is "traditional religion"?
p16987
aVIt seems progressives are more supportive of freedom of ALL religions versus christian hegemony. 
p16988
aVThey tend to dislike Christianity and Judaism.
p16989
aVThey are more likely to be militantly opposed to free expression of religion than other groups. 
p16990
aVThat is utter poppycock since the grand majority of them ARE christian and jewish.
p16991
aVCan you provide examples of them being militantly opposed to free expression of religion? 
p16992
aVNot everyone who identifies as Christian or Jewish actually practices their religion or have strong/educated belief in God.
p16993
aVThose who attend service weekly, which helps to cull the herd a little bit, are far more likely to be conservatives.
p16994
aVYou must not have gone to college, at least any time recently.
p16995
aVThe college campus is the best example of this sort of thing.
p16996
aVKids in high schools schools are told they cannot pray, not even on their own time in a private group.
p16997
aVIf you don't see what is happening you aren't paying attention.
p16998
aV"A secular political party, in the traditional sense, has been neutral as between religions--at least insofar as the represent different versions of traditional morality.
p16999
aVA secularist political party is neutral as between religion and irreligion: It believes that moral issues \u2018have no place in politics,\u2019 and replaces such issues with the idea of \u2018fair and equal\u2019 treatment of all \u2018lifestyles,\u2019 all beliefs about what is permissible and what is not.
p17000
aVThis is accompanied by a powerful animus against the dominant traditional beliefs, especially religious beliefs.
p17001
aVThe American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association faithfully represent this ideology, which explains why they are comfortable banning the Ten Commandments from the classroom but don\u2019t mind feminist or homosexual art.
p17002
aV"\u000a\u000aOn the grassroots level, the *hatred* of those who stick to their Jewish or Christian moral values is off the charts.

p17008
aVIf you don't see what is happening you aren't paying attention.
p17009
aVSo what, you decide who is and isn't religious?
p17010
aVYou poll people at every church in the country about their political ideologies?
p17011
aVLord almighty, the amount of baseless assumptions you are making are incredible.
p17012
aVAs to college campuses and high schools...plainly put, religion has no place there.
p17013
aVLet the kids pray on their own time, why should they be allotted SCHOOL time for their worship?
p17014
aVThat makes no sense!
p17015
aVWho are you quoting in your second paragraph?
p17016
aVMoral issues do have a place in politics but morals as dictated by one particular religion do not.
p17017
aVI am comfortable with having the ten commandments anywhere, so long as they are next to say, Hindu and Buddhist texts, or do you think those are inferior?
p17018
aV&gt; On the grassroots level, the hatred of those who stick to their Jewish or Christian moral values is off the charts.
p17019
aVRidiculous assertion, you can't get elected to public office without being religious.
p17020
aVHow many self proclaimed atheists in Congress?
p17021
aV&gt;So what, you decide who is and isn't religious?
p17022
aVYou poll people at every church in the country about their political ideologies?
p17023
aVLord almighty, the amount of baseless assumptions you are making are incredible.
p17024
aVIf you say that you are a "Catholic" but do not attend mass, do not study the bible, etc then you are different type of "Catholic" than one who does attend mass, who does study the bible, and who is involved in the church/community.
p17025
aVBoth count just as much as "Catholic" in most polls.
p17026
aVBreaking things down by frequency of church attendance brings you closer to how *truly* religious people think.

aV&gt;As to college campuses and high schools...plainly put, religion has no place there.
p17028
aVLet the kids pray on their own time, why should they be allotted SCHOOL time for their worship?
p17029
aVThat makes no sense!
p17030
aVSo you're against allowing kids to pray on their own time with their friends while on school grounds.
p17031
aVThat's not only an unconstitutional view, it supports what I was saying above.
p17032
aVThat progressives despise religion.
p17033
aVA goal of progressives, fascists, Nazis, communists and other left-wing political movements has been to weaken and ultimately destroy the church so that it can be replaced by the State.
p17034
aV&gt;Who are you quoting in your second paragraph?
p17035
aVMoral issues do have a place in politics but morals as dictated by one particular religion do not.
p17036
aVI am comfortable with having the ten commandments anywhere, so long as they are next to say, Hindu and Buddhist texts, or do you think those are inferior?
p17037
aVIt was Irving Kristol.
p17038
aVIf 90% of the population identifies as Christian, 5% Jewish, and 5% atheist why should all religions be on display?
p17039
aVIt would be idiotic to put every religion imaginable on display.
p17040
aVMoral issues are matters of faith.
p17041
aVAlso, the first amendment protects the right to freely exercise one's religion.
p17042
aV&gt; Ridiculous assertion, you can't get elected to public office without being religious.
p17043
aVHow many self proclaimed atheists in Congress?
p17044
aVLOL.
p17045
aVYou're out of touch, my friend.
p17046
aVOn the left's grassroots level traditional religion is widely mocked.
p17047
aVMany nonbelievers in politics, mostly on the left, have sought out churches just to be able to say they're good Christians.
p17048
aVBarack Obama is one of them.
p17049
aVHe sought out a church after the people he was trying to work with told him that he should in order to be taken seriously.
p17050
aVThe church he chose to attend was an incredibly extreme one.
p17051
aVAnd perhaps ironically, many of the same "treat all religions" equal types were attacking Romney for his religious affiliation just 4 years after they were defending Obama's affiliation with a church that was, by any reasonable person's view, FAR worse than Romney's. 
p17052
aV&gt; If you say that you are a "Catholic" but do not attend mass, do not study the bible, etc then you are different type of "Catholic" than one who does attend mass, who does study the bible, and who is involved in the church/community.
p17053
aVBoth count just as much as "Catholic" in most polls.
p17054
aVBreaking things down by frequency of church attendance brings you closer to how truly religious people think.
p17055
aVWhat you are saying here is that you know for a fact how often Democratic reps go to church and how much they study the bible?
p17056
aVWhere are you getting these facts?
p17057
aVThen you go on to describe what you consider a "better" Christian.
p17058
aVIsn't that for God to decide?
p17059
aVCareful friend, you are getting dangerously close to pride, and thats a deadly sin, you know.
p17060
aV&gt; So you're against allowing kids to pray on their own time with their friends while on school grounds.
p17061
aVThat's not only an unconstitutional view, it supports what I was saying above.
p17062
aVThat progressives despise religion.
p17063
aVNo, I personally dislike religion because I think its hogwash but most college campuses go above and beyond in sponsoring religious, specifically christian groups on their campuses.
p17064
aVMost have a ministry and several student organizations devoted to Christians.
p17065
aVPlease point to the part of the constitution that says you should be allotted special time to pray in school?
p17066
aVThe supreme court has already maintained that religious freedom is not absolute, and while beliefs may be respected, *practices are not* So I think you are dead wrong on that end, friend.
p17067
aV&gt; A goal of progressives, fascists, Nazis, communists and other left-wing political movements has been to weaken and ultimately destroy the church so that it can be replaced by the State.
p17068
aVHAH!
p17069
aVWell, neat trick lumping progressives with Nazi's.
p17070
aVMy only answer to that is that the Church has no place in the State.
p17071
aVIf you want to talk about the Constitution and the amendments, its pretty clear that our forefathers intended for religious beliefs to be personal.
p17072
aV&gt; If 90% of the population identifies as Christian, 5% Jewish, and 5% atheist why should all religions be on display?
p17073
aVIt would be idiotic to put every religion imaginable on display.
p17074
aVWhy?
p17075
aVBecause yours is right and everyone elses is wrong?
p17076
aVI, as a minority, have no right to express my religion?
p17077
aV&gt; LOL.
p17078
aVYou're out of touch, my friend.
p17079
aVOn the left's grassroots level traditional religion is widely mocked.
p17080
aVGive us proof.
p17081
aVHow do you know so much about the lefts grassroots?
p17082
aVYou don't associate with them, so I assume all you know about them is what you read and watch on your biased news source of choice.
p17083
aV&gt;Many nonbelievers in politics, mostly on the left, have sought out churches just to be able to say they're good Christians\u000a\u000aAgain, I demand proof, not just words.
p17084
aVYour assumptions about Obama are just that.
p17085
aVRomney is a mormon, do you believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles?
p17086
aVIf not, how is it worse?
p17087
aVIsn't it...just the same?
p17088
aV&gt;What you are saying here is that you know for a fact how often Democratic reps go to church and how much they study the bible?
p17089
aVWhere are you getting these facts?
p17090
aVThen you go on to describe what you consider a "better" Christian.
p17091
aVIsn't that for God to decide?
p17092
aVCareful friend, you are getting dangerously close to pride, and thats a deadly sin, you know.
p17093
aVAll that I was doing there was explaining the obvious difference between a self-professed religious person who doesn't study or practice it at all, and one who does.
p17094
aV&gt;No, I personally dislike religion because I think its hogwash but most college campuses go above and beyond in sponsoring religious, specifically christian groups on their campuses.
p17095
aVThey go out of their way to sponsor and raise awareness for their pet movements, which get more attention.
p17096
aVChristian groups are sort of like the College Republicans in that they are just, well, disliked.
p17097
aV&gt;Most have a ministry and several student organizations devoted to Christians.
p17098
aVThey also have other religious clubs if there is enough interest.
p17099
aV&gt;Please point to the part of the constitution that says you should be allotted special time to pray in school?
p17100
aVIt's in the same part of the constitution that says you should be allowed to eat lunch while in school.
p17101
aVI was not talking about special time for praying at school.
p17102
aVI said ON THEIR OWN TIME.
p17103
aVOf course, there's nothing wrong with learning about religion or praying at school either.
p17104
aV&gt;HAH!
p17105
aVWell, neat trick lumping progressives with Nazi's.
p17106
aVThey drink from the same ideological well... \u000a\u000a&gt;My only answer to that is that the Church has no place in the State.
p17107
aVIndividuals do not lose their constitutionally protected rights whenever they enter a government entity.
p17108
aV&gt;If you want to talk about the Constitution and the amendments, its pretty clear that our forefathers intended for religious beliefs to be personal.
p17109
aVThe founding fathers did not intend for religious beliefs to be left in the home, never to be so much as espoused in the public sphere.
p17110
aVQuite the contrary.
p17111
aVThey viewed religion as an essential element of a free and moral society.
p17112
aV&gt;Why?
p17113
aVBecause yours is right and everyone elses is wrong?
p17114
aVI, as a minority, have no right to express my religion?
p17115
aVPutting a Christmas tree and a Menorah in the town green doesn't establish a religion.
p17116
aVIt celebrates the religious values of the majority, but it doesn't establish a religion.
p17117
aVMuslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Wiccans, Scientologists, etc are all free to practice their religion.
p17118
aV&gt;&gt;You're out of touch, my friend.
p17119
aVOn the left's grassroots level traditional religion is widely mocked.
p17120
aV&gt;Give us proof.
p17121
aVHow do you know so much about the lefts grassroots?
p17122
aVLOL.
p17123
aVThey even booed God at their convention!
p17124
aVI used to read the Democratic Underground, and they *hated* the religious.
p17125
aVLiberal heroes mock religion.
p17126
aVYou even dismissed all religion as "hogwash" in this very comment.
p17127
aV&gt;Again, I demand proof, not just words.
p17128
aVYour assumptions about Obama are just that.
p17129
aVThey aren't assumptions.
p17130
aVYou can verify what I said about Obama with his own words.
p17131
aVAny reasonable person who looks at Mormonism, as it exists today, and then looks at Black Liberation Theology and specifically at Obama's church will conclude that Obama's church was far worse.
p17132
aVWhat makes the criticism so ironic is that the people who attacked Romney's religion are the first to stand up and defend most other religions, such as Islam, from criticism -- even when that criticism comes from one of their own such as Bill Maher. 
p17133
aVNazism is fascism which has very little to do with progressives.
p17134
aVEven comparing it to socialism, Nazis denied the concept of class struggle, worker solidarity and defended private property.
p17135
aVIt probably has more in common with tea party conservatives than it does liberal progressives.
p17136
aVIt takes a willful misunderstanding of it to begin to compare it to progressives.
p17137
aVAgain, Religious practices are not protected by the constitution.
p17138
aVOh lord, The DNC did not "boo god" they booed the outcome of a procedural issue when the results of a floor vote where seemingly ignored.
p17139
aVLook at the video and you will hear no boos when god is discussed.
p17140
aVYou seem like a smart guy, too smart to believe nonsense propaganda.
p17141
aVI did dismiss religion as hogwash because that is my personal belief, I find it hard to believe that any one religion is more accurate than another, and it is very clear that there is a lot of plagiarism from earlier religions.
p17142
aVI do not think others should not be allowed to worship whatever they believe in, but I also do not think it should influence the state in any way.
p17143
aVThat is my PERSONAL belief. 
p17144
aVNazism and fascism are leftist.
p17145
aVThey dropped the class stuff and instead made them based on race and nationality, respectively.
p17146
aVNazis have A LOT in common with the progressives, as do the fascists.
p17147
aVThe progressives of yesteryear really did like Mussolini.
p17148
aVThe official Nazi party platform would undoubtedly be looked at as *left* wing by any reasonable modern-day American.
p17149
aV&gt;Again, Religious practices are not protected by the constitution.
p17150
aVYou are wrong.
p17151
aVThe first amendment explicitly protects the right to freely exercise one's religion.
p17152
aVThe left is most certainly an "anti-God" party.
p17153
aVCan you imagine if an *Evangelical* tried to run for president as a left winger today?
p17154
aVSince Carter lost the Democrats have become a party whose leaders are mostly "pretenders" when it comes to religion, while the Republican leaders are more likely to be true believers.
p17155
aVThis is somewhat of a "gut" thing, but it's sort of verifiable as well.
p17156
aVAnd of course neither is a universal thing. 
p17157
aVThe supreme court has stated that religious practices are not protected.
p17158
aVThat is why polygamy as practiced by mormons is a federal crime.
p17159
aVI am not wrong at all, you can claim that the supreme court is wrong but that is another argument.
p17160
aVFascism is far right.
p17161
aVYou'll be hard pressed to find a lot of progressive nationalists.
p17162
aVIf anything its a weird mixture.
p17163
aVAre you willing to concede that the DNC did not boo god as you erroneously claimed?
p17164
aVThank you for admitting its a gut thing because its absolute BS, and not verifiable at all unless you claim to know what lies in the hearts of men and women you don't personally know. 
p17165
aVReligious practices that are in conflict with long-standing law are where it gets complicated.
p17166
aVThe court also told some Native Americans that they cannot use peyote with a religious exception.
p17167
aVThe freedom to exercise one's religion really is protected by the first amendment.
p17168
aV&gt;Are you willing to concede that the DNC did not boo god as you erroneously claimed?
p17169
aVIt's not BS.
p17170
aVI'm sure some booed for the reason you gave, but I'm sure more booed because they did not approve of having "God" in their platform.
p17171
aVThey tried to put "God" in the right way but those in attendance shouted NO.
p17172
aV&gt;Thank you for admitting its a gut thing because its absolute BS, and not verifiable at all unless you claim to know what lies in the hearts of men and women you don't personally know.
p17173
aVYou can absolutely verify it with Obama.
p17174
aVThe reason he went looking for a church back in his agitator days is public info!
p17175
aVAs is the extreme nature of the church he chose.
p17176
aVWith Clinton, for me, it's more of a gut thing.
p17177
aVI know his wife and future presidential candidate was a member of some kooky group of methodists who had this far-left wing magazine she kept every copy of since she started receiving them.
p17178
aVBut they still do not strike me as "churchy" people.
p17179
aVRomney, Both Bushes, and Reagan strike me as genuinely "churchy".
p17180
aVMcCain does not.
p17181
aVJimmy Carter is the last really "churchy" Democrat to win the presidency, IMO.
p17182
aVIt's not absolute BS.
p17183
aVJust a small example.
p17184
aVThe compassion that George W Bush has for others is really amazing when contrasted with the lack thereof with Obama.
p17185
aV[Here](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/25/joseph-curl-christmastime-george-w-bush-was-santa-/) is one recent story that supports this view.
p17186
aV&gt;Fascism is far right.
p17187
aVYou'll be hard pressed to find a lot of progressive nationalists.
p17188
aVIf anything its a weird mixture.
p17189
aVTake out the nasty, mostly racial, stuff and the Nazi platform could be confused with the Democrats' platform.
p17190
aVThe progressive movement was, way back, pro-war, pro-eugenics, racist, aligned with some churches.
p17191
aVThey were ruthless towards those who did not go along with their new way of doing things.
p17192
aVThings changed quite a bit after WW2 exposed the Nazi atrocities, and things changed some more in the 1960s.
p17193
aVReagan got in trouble for pointing this out, but before WW2 some New Dealers were openly supportive of the Italian Fascists, and while there wasn't wide approval of the antisemitic component of the Nazis they were liked as well.
p17194
aVHitler himself publicly praised FDR and even wrote personal letters.
p17195
aVThe Nazis were absolutely left wing in the American sense of the term.
p17196
aVThe "Far Right" would be the kooky Libertarians that you see on reddit and out in the wild posting Ron Paul signs all over the place. 
p17197
aVI agree--parties are not divided clearly along religious demographics.
p17198
aVI actually didn't think to bring in religion specifically;but sure enough religious liberty does seem to be something that the current democrats see as negotiable.
p17199
aVThis is a huge cause for concern--it is a core American distinctive.
p17200
aVAnd if he does, hopefully John 'finds a way' to sue his ass into poverty. 
p17201
aVSadly, the money comes from taxpayer funds.

aVThere's a stunner.

aVBut I'm sure this story is now canon in right wing circles, along with how Obama is a Kenyan socialist muslim.
p17223
aVwhy would someone carry a prayer rug presumably from the middle east all the way to the texas border to just abandon it anyway?
p17224
aVa prayer rug.
p17225
aVa rug that you use in your religion to pray, that you carried half way across the world.
p17226
aVjust a silly premise in the first place.  
p17227
aVYeah, that'd be like abandoning the family bible because it got too heavy.
p17228
aVWhat an idiot. 
p17229
aVwell like abandoning the family bible on a whim after you packed the damn thing half way around the world.
p17230
aVof course you should remember that there is no such prayer rug anyway.
p17231
aVi'm just stating why it seems unlikely to find one in the first place.
p17232
aVOh I know it's something that never happened.

p17258
aV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism)" Well, that's not history, it's mythology - and it ties right into all sorts of associated magical thinking, like, [Manifest Destiny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny) and [Anglo-Israelism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Israelism).
p17259
aVAnd of course, it all boils down to justifying the use of power as the expression of the will of God.

p17283
aVForcing employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay an employee who is on leave is not "pro family".
p17284
aVeasing the burden of creating an actual family is about as pro family as i can conceive of something being.
p17285
aVi suppose tax cuts for the very very wealthy is what you call pro family?
p17286
aVcorporatist like you are all about letting big business suckle at the tit of big government but nobody else.
p17287
aV&gt;easing the burden of creating an actual family is about as pro family as i can conceive of something being.

aVExcept it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family.
p17289
aVThat's the job of the couple.
p17290
aVAlso, the government has no right, and should have no right, forcing employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay an employee who is not working.
p17291
aV&gt;i suppose tax cuts for the very very wealthy is what you call pro family?
p17292
aVThis isn't even about tax cuts.
p17293
aV&gt;corporatist like you are all about letting big business suckle at the tit of big government but nobody else.
p17294
aVHow amusing of you resorting to name calling.
p17295
aVAlso, employers/companies who don't pay for an employee who is on leave is not "letting big business suckle at the tit of big government".
p17296
aVok well no.
p17297
aVyou are wrong on virtually everything you said.
p17298
aV&gt;it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family\u000a\u000aso why do they give tax incentives to get married?
p17299
aVclearly they think families are a good thing to have to where we do give monetary rewards for starting families.

aV&gt;How amusing of you resorting to name calling.
p17305
aVAlso, employers/companies who don't pay for an employee who is on leave is not "letting big business suckle at the tit of big government".
p17306
aVi'm not name calling.
p17307
aVyou are clearly on the side of big business.
p17308
aVso labeling you a corporatist is not meant as a slight, only an identifier.
p17309
aVand do i really need to bring up subsidies that we pay to some of the largest profit making corporations in the world?
p17310
aVare you going to sit there and tell me that BP or Exxon simply could not exist without those ginormous paychecks from our government?
p17311
aVreally?
p17312
aVlook virtually every other civilized nation has some form of paid maternity leave.
p17313
aVwhy don't we?
p17314
aVgreed.
p17315
aVplain and simple.
p17316
aVgreed.
p17317
aV&gt; ok well no.
p17318
aVyou are wrong on virtually everything you said.
p17319
aVExcept I'm not.
p17320
aVOnly in your opinion that you think I am.
p17321
aV&gt;so why do they give tax incentives to get married?
p17322
aVclearly they think families are a good thing to have to where we do give monetary rewards for starting families.
p17323
aVYes they do, but the government shouldn't have such policies since it discriminates against single persons.
p17324
aV&gt;so strike those disability and worker's comp payments right?
p17325
aVThis is an entirely different subject due to the fact that it depends on if the employer/company is at fault on the claim.
p17326
aV&gt;i didn't say it was.
p17327
aVThen there was no point in mentioning it.
p17328
aV&gt;i'm not name calling.
p17329
aVyou are clearly on the side of big business.
p17330
aVso labeling you a corporatist is not meant as a slight, only an identifier.
p17331
aVExcept it is name calling.
p17332
aVYou're only calling me a 'corporatist' because I don't support *your opinion*.
p17333
aVAlso, someone who doesn't support using the force of government to force an employer/company to pay an employee who is on leave, does not make them a 'corporatist'.
p17334
aV&gt;and do i really need to bring up subsidies that we pay to some of the largest profit making corporations in the world?
p17335
aVare you going to sit there and tell me that BP or Exxon simply could not exist without those ginormous paychecks from our government?
p17336
aVreally?
p17337
aVActually you don't, because I'm against subsidies and welfare for any businesses.
p17338
aVThe government shouldn't be picking the winners or losers.
p17339
aVAre you the same?
p17340
aVOr are you just against subsidies for those kinds businesses, but yet support subsidies for businesses that you like?
p17341
aV&gt;look virtually every other civilized nation has some form of paid maternity leave.
p17342
aVSo what?
p17343
aV&gt;why don't we?
p17344
aVgreed.
p17345
aVplain and simple.
p17346
aVgreed.
p17347
aVIt is not "greed" that we don't force employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay an employee who is on leave/not working.
p17348
aVOnly in your bubble that you actually think it is.
p17349
aVso what is it that you think government should do?
p17350
aVyou sound like a libertarian.
p17351
aVwhich is cute on paper, but then in the real world is just another way to let corporations run amok.
p17352
aVi feel that there is a need for government.
p17353
aVif left to their own devises most people will pursue selfish goals to the detriment of society as a whole.
p17354
aVa lot of the problems in this country boils down to the fact that most of us think in terms of what's in it for me, not what is best for everyone.
p17355
aVeveryone else isn't my responsibility, i've only got to look out for number one etc etc.
p17356
aVwe've lost our sense of community.
p17357
aVand it's really kind of sad.
p17358
aVa good person would want to help a new family out. \u000a\u000a 
p17359
aV&gt;so what is it that you think government should do?
p17360
aVWell, they obviously should not be forcing employers/companies(or taxpayers) to have paid leave.
p17361
aV&gt;you sound like a libertarian.
p17362
aVwhich is cute on paper, but then in the real world is just another way to let corporations run amok.
p17363
aVIn your opinion you think would 'run amok'.
p17364
aV&gt;i feel that there is a need for government.
p17365
aVI do as well, but in a limited form.
p17366
aV&gt;if left to their own devises most people will pursue selfish goals to the detriment of society as a whole.
p17367
aVAnd not forcing employers/companies(or taxpayers) to have paid leave doesn't lead to the detriment of society.
p17368
aV&gt;a lot of the problems in this country boils down to the fact that most of us think in terms of what's in it for me, not what is best for everyone.
p17369
aVExcept the problems in this country are mostly caused by terrible policies from the government(debt, over regulation, crony capitalism, etc.
p17370
aV)\u000a\u000a&gt;a good person would want to help a new family out.
p17371
aVYeah I agree, but it's an entirely different subject when it comes to the government trying to force policies like that.
p17372
aV&gt; Except it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family.
p17373
aVThat's the job of the couple.
p17374
aVIsn't the government made up of people?
p17375
aVOr are politicians and bureaucrats now generated in big buckets like beer instead of being born?
p17376
aV&gt;Isn't the government made up of people?
p17377
aVTechnically yes, but that still doesn't change the fact that it's not the governments job to "ease the burden" of creating a family.
p17378
aVIt also doesn't change the fact of overall issue that the government has no right, and should have no right, to force employers/companies(or even taxpayers) to pay for an employee who is on leave/not working.
p17379
aVIf he ran for president young people and intelligent people might actually vote
p17380
aVConservatives know that they are by nature selfish.
p17381
aVThey fear that they will be exposed for who they are.  
p17382
aVHe's black.
p17383
aVThis is all bullshit.
p17384
aVI'm conservative but I like NDT.
p17385
aVI just bought Cosmos on BR.
p17386
aVIt is the fundies that don't like NDT.
p17387
aVIn other words, "I am only half-crazy!
p17388
aVI only deny some science!
p17389
aV"\u000a\u000aFurthermore, it is the moderate conservatives that allow the fundamental right-wing to exist and maintain power. \u000a\u000a
p17390
aVI like how conservative is synonymous with crazy in your head.
p17391
aVIt must be nice to be able pigeon hole everyone's realities in such nice little labels.
p17392
aVGuess that makes decisions easier if you don't have to actually think.
p17393
aVI use "crazy" as a catch-all for qualities like irrational fear of others and insecurity which lead to harmful social constructs such as hierarchies which then lead to disastrous social policies like anti-immigration and war. 
p17394
aVso hes saying reagan was horrible on the border?
p17395
aVi thought saint reagan could do no wrong?
p17396
aVAll bias aside, I saw this as extremely biased and lacking scriptural evidence saying Christians are to do these things.
p17397
aVNot saying they don't, but "Christians" are not always the best actually doing what the Bible says they should do 
p17398
aVThis wasn't quite what I was afraid it was going to be from the title.
p17399
aVEver since the Hobby Lobby "people can legally ignore/break laws due to religious belief" ruling I've been waiting for cases such as "But it is my religion to kill gays", or "But it is my religion to kill anyone not in my religion" or other similar arguments for breaking other laws.

aVThe sad thing is that the Obama administration *deserves* to be "driven out of office" -- for reasons other than Obama's birth certificate or many of the other issues this group objected to.

aVHow these secretive, war-loving torturers who function as tools of corporate power and who spy on every single American in the country -- and who defend the practices!
p17465
aV-- can remain in power is a sad testimony of just how passive the American people are and just how broken our entire political system is.
p17466
aVBy your logic, every American president should have been unfit for office since the 40s.
p17467
aVGet real.
p17468
aVVery true.
p17469
aVAnd yet we we somehow wonder why people like former president Carter says that the US is not a "functioning democracy" and why corporations and the rich control our political system to such an extent that academic studies report that the US is in reality an "oligarchy".
p17470
aVSo let's say we ignore those facts.
p17471
aVThe big question would be, is the direction the country is heading in getting better or getting worse?
p17472
aVAre political trends positive -- that we are becoming more democratic and representative of the American people?
p17473
aVOr is the trend in a negative direction with our political system becoming more plutocratic and oligarchic?
p17474
aVThat answer is crystal clear...
p17475
aV&gt; we somehow wonder\u000a\u000aNo.

aV&gt; You're problem is, you think that Obama is a king.
p17486
aVWhen did I say that?
p17487
aVHe's anything but.
p17488
aVObama is simply a figurehead for the factions and people that control the US government and economy, and which fund both halves of our ruling political duopoly.
p17489
aV&gt; He was elected democratically by a majority of voters, twice.
p17490
aVAfter the disastrous Bush presidency, Obama's first election definitely had some popular support, that's true.
p17491
aVI think a majority of Americans actually came out and voted that election.
p17492
aVBut Obama's campaign was a campaign of lies in a broken, plutocratic and non-representative political system.
p17493
aVEverything from Obama's promises of the most open government in history, his opposition to "signing statements", his positioning himself as a peace candidate, to his promise to back feds off from enforcing medical marijuana laws -- all have proven to be bald-faced lies.
p17494
aVObama's one sole claim to fame is that he ruled a single-payer health care system "off the table" and forced a right-wing-invented, pro-corporate health care system down the throats of the American people that forces people to pour profits into the pockets of the shareholders of private, for-profit health insurance corporations.
p17495
aVThose lies and that one program is not what the American people voted for, that's for sure.
p17496
aVIn his reelection, the majority of the American people sat at home and refused to vote because our political system is so broken that it's a waste of time.
p17497
aVThe electoral system is rigged to force a choice between Tweedledum and Tweedledee -- a choice between a pro-torture, war-loving right-of-center politician who oversees violations of the Constitution and the gutting of civil liberties, or one that is *even* *further* to the political right.
p17498
aVSo-called "third party" candidates are required to have huge sums of money to even get on the ballot, and then if they dare assume they can be on TV with the other 2 candidates they're simply arrested and are taken away in handcuffs.
p17499
aVIn such an unfair, broken political system, I would be leery of calling Obama's "reelection" some sort of sign that people approve of his policies.
p17500

aVIn case you are unaware, there are hundreds of lawmakers regulating what Obama can and can't do.
p17507
aVHe does not rule by decree like all you Obama haters think he does.
p17508
aVAnd when he himself suggest the use of executive orders, which are 100% legal, you call him a lawless president.
p17509
aVYou can't have it both ways.
p17510
aVYou can't even have it one way, and that is 100% your fault.

p17613
aVWhile I agree that Citizens United is a damaging blemish on our society, we should also recognize that we haven't done enough to reign in our politicians to clearly address the problem with legislation and/or a Constitutional Amendment.
p17614
aVIf we had legislators that led with clear vision, they could have addressed this problem in no uncertain terms that the SCOTUS could misinterpret. 
p17615

aVFTA:\u000a\u000a&gt; Why is there this sudden interest on the right in shining a light on the way that conservative leaders see their followers less as fellow travelers and more as marks?
p17619
aVPart of it is likely due to a major exposé of the same problem\u2014scam PACs\u2014run by Politico last month.
p17620
aV\u201cSince the tea party burst onto the political landscape in 2009, the conservative movement has been plagued by an explosion of PACs that critics say exist mostly to pad the pockets of the consultants who run them,\u201d Vogel wrote.
p17621
aVThat means, as Hawkins noted in his coverage, that money that might otherwise help sway elections is instead just spinning down the drain.
p17622
aV&gt; That means, as Hawkins noted in his coverage, that money that might otherwise help sway elections is instead just spinning down the drain.
p17623
aVMy guess would be that there has to be more to it than that.
p17624
aVBecause it has swayed elections, even so.
p17625
aVAnd I don't see the results as being all that good for the GOP.
p17626
aVAnd weren't the exploitative tendancies obvious years ago?
p17627
aVThis is not a new thing, this is not a new insight, it's been part of the conservative landscape since - well, since the eighties.
p17628
aVIt was possible to ignore during the Regan years, but it certainly should have been obvious even during Clinton's first term.
p17629
aVBut as Newt might well say, "it's not whether you win or lose, it's whether you beat the spread.
p17630
aV" And certainly Newt and the various suspects noted in the article have done very well by themselves, focusing on "Some of the people you can fool all of the time.
p17631
aV"\u000a\u000aI suppose a more precise question would be "*Why* is this a tipping point?
p17632
aV" Perhaps some are coming to realize that the GOP has simply become a SEO marketing firm relying entirely on clickbait.
p17633
aVIt has no serious intention, much less ability, to do anything intelligent with the power of elective office.
p17634
aVElections have consequences - we are told.
p17635
aVBut it's hard to believe, looking at the things that come across my screen, that all these obvious consequences were foreseen by those who should have.
p17636
aVIf they did, clearly they didn't give a crap.
p17637
aVMaybe it's a tipping point because there are some conservatives still out there that think that good governance *matters* and who realize that "Politics is the Art of the Possible.
p17638
aV" Perhaps they are as concerned as I am that if things continue as they are - making more and more discussions impossible - people will start seeing "Politics by other Means" to be the only rational alternative.
p17639
aVI would think that part of it would be that the GOP has become so dependent on cash and support flowing from the sort of people the huxters pray upon that they simply cannot bring up good candidates who could benefit from their lop-sided fundraising advantage.
p17640
aVThe short term tactical victories that could be bought this way are starting to look like long term strategic losses.
p17641
aVThey are  becoming more and more inextricably bound to values that appeal to a shrinking demographic largely confined to the Old South, and more and more, electing the sort of people you'd expect.
p17642
aVIt's not that they are racists that is the problem.
p17643
aVSad to say.
p17644
aVAt least, it's not the most significant problem.
p17645
aVPlenty of pretty good politicians have been racists.
p17646
aVThey just haven't been criminally stupid, willfully tone-deaf racists - and it's become clear that willingness to compromise is simply not something their electorate will tolerate.
p17647
aVWell, you just can't govern that way.
p17648
aVThere are many virtues and loathesome traits that one may have and still be a successful politician of any stripe but if you can't do any horse-trading, everyone goes home broke and hungry.
p17649
aVSo I think some figures within the party are starting to worry as much or more about the implications of winning elections as they are about losing.
p17650
aVThat could be my biases talking - but a lot of the problems I see now with the GOP are things that Barry Goldwater and Eisenhower warned about.
p17651
aVI hope this next election is a crushing defeat for the GOP.
p17652
aVI don't actually *expect* that, but I do hope.
p17653
aVRight now, the GOP is not permitting any intelligent policy to happen.
p17654
aVIt won't let democratic initiatives move forward and it can't craft intelligent and workable policies of it's own.
p17655
aVSo - people who can do that and speak authentically from an informed, literate intelligent and pragmatic Conservative perspective are going to need a way to do that.
p17656
aVBut the reality is, until the GOP goes away - they won't be able to do that.
p17657
aVOf course, this is great for the Democrats.
p17658
aVThey don't really need to win.
p17659
aVThey just need to allow the GOP to lose.
p17660
aVSure, this is *terrible* for the nation as a whole, but since it's also the *will* of many of the people that things are just as they are, well, they are more than willing to accept a legislative stalemate and use that as ammunition in a cultural war.
p17661
aVWhich, I may point out, is not going well for the Cultural Warriors of the Right.
p17662
aVAgain, every small advance tends to be a grave strategic victory.
p17663
aVIn my humble opinion which I sincerely hope dismiss out of hand.

aVNot Christian, not white male, not even a hate crime, just oops?
p17668
aVWhite American culture needs to take a hard look in the mirror and find out why it is so full of hate for everyone else in this country. 
p17669
aV&gt; Not Christian, not white male, not even a hate crime, just oops?
p17670
aVYeah, that's right.
p17671
aV/s\u000a\u000aJust think of this like some right-wing preacher ranting every Sunday about the evils of abortion, riling people up and exhorting them to take action.
p17672
aVAnd then when some nut shoots a doctor, the preacher says, "Oh no, that's not what I meant.
p17673
aV"\u000a\u000aThese types of crimes are inevitable given our propaganda systems' non-stop demonization of Muslims, rants about "Islamofascism" and the US' ongoing wars to control Middle East oil...
p17674
aVis it that simple though?
p17675
aVI mean is it just Fox "News", Rush Limbaugh and the more radical elements in conservative media egging this on?
p17676
aVPerhaps a dash of economic or social distress pushes people over the edge to resorting to violence.
p17677
aVI have to wonder if there is something more institutional that is responsible.
p17678
aVAll my white friends tell me about their one racist uncle or grandparent, is it time to start asking if they have guns?\u000a
p17679

aVFox is ranting about the atheist progressive who killed some people, and you assholes are ranting about how republicans are egging people on to do this shit and guns are evil.

aVI love Elizabeth Warren as much as the next liberal, but she's basically a sincere, initially naive cultural conservative Republican who deeply learned about one subject and then urgently adopted a liberal position on just that one thing, like a far-right Congressman whose daughter comes out as a lesbian and suddenly becomes a Log Cabin darling.
p17721
aVWarren studied the social safety net in hopes of proving people on public assistance were generally lazy parasites exploiting the system.
p17722
aVWhat she found is the american economy fails some people terribly.
p17723
aVShe went on to become something like an economic justice advocate, albeit just within the narrow band of her judicious study.
p17724
aVThere are plenty of positions I'd consider her for, but not President.
p17725
aVShe remains, for instance, a [defense hawk](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119965/elizabeth-warrens-foreign-policy-positions-are-mystery), though she has become cautious about admitting it lest she lose her support among liberal Democrats.
p17726
aVShe's fine with abolishing the estate tax.
p17727
aVSupport from [US conservatives](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/why-are-we-supposed-to-hate-elizabeth-warren/) (who really should be her natural base) will always be a lost cause because of the [hit job](https://www.google.com/search?q=fauxcahontas) on her by the banking industry.

aVI have to run, or [I'd look up other positions](https://www.google.com/search?q=elizabeth+warren+conservative+positions).

aVI believe (but don't have links handy) that she's a principled  deregulator who trusts business far more than sense dictates, and I would bet on "social" issues she's behind most of us.
p17730
aVShe is obviously highly intelligent and sincere* enough to change based on what she learns, but I would not presume in advance that she'll ever be the President we would want.
p17731
aV\u005c* Does "intelligent and sincere" sound patronizing?
p17732
aVI think the apparent lack of those traits in all our other political figures is the real reason people want Warren to be their President.
p17733
aVWhat the actual fuck is this lady talking about?
