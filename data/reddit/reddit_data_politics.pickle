S'I sent off my voter register off friday in the mail, will it arrive by tomorrow?'
p5
aS"I registered online on the 9th and haven't heard anything since."
p6
aS'I have to call them monday.'
p7
aS'They fucked up my registration.'
p8
aS'I am Canadian and Dutch, but they only have Dutch down as my nationality.'
p9
aS"I'm hoping they can fix it on Monday, so I can vote..."
p10
aS'Might want to contact your local council directly.'
p11
aS'They have voter registration department or some such who might be able to help.'
p12
aS'Yup, I am phoning them Monday morning.'
p13
aS'I called them on Friday, and they said they would fix it.'
p14
aS"But I don't trust them to actually do it...\n"
p15
aS"There is actually a later deadline to fix clerical errors (9pm on polling day itself), which may be worth mentioning as it's one that is often overlooked."
p16
aS'Yup, plus the offices are open late tomorrow.'
p17
aS'I think they said midnight!'
p18
aS'This is easily fixed.'
p19
aS'Maple syrup or pancakes?'
p20
aS'Yes, please.'
p21
aS"That's true, actually."
p22
aS'Being a Labour seems oddly free from stigma.'
p23
aS'It depends in which circles you mix.'
p24
aS"If I told my UKIP voting father in law that I was going to vote Labour he wouldn't let me at the dinner table."
p25
aS"At work it's a different thing all together."
p26
aS"I don't think that's true."
p27
aS"It's more that people won't *behave* negatively towards you if they think you are a Labour voter but you'll still be judged (and rightly so)."
p28
aS"In other words it's more to do with how civil members of other parties are towards you once they know your voting intentions with the anti-KIPpers being the least civil and the anti-Labourites being the most civil."
p29
aS"It's not just civility from other parties."
p30
aS'The article mentions how even people in their own parties have less pride in their own vote than Labour voters do. '
p31
aS'lol no.'
p32
aS'you get called a child rapist apologist by some of the locals in this sub.'
p33
aS"It's hardly representative of Reddit though, this sub, let alone the UK."
p34
aS'ROOOTHHHERAAAAMMMM'
p35
aS'Sadly, plain-spoken patriotism is more common on this sub than it is in the population at large.'
p36
aS"That's some twisted perspective."
p37
aS'haha, oh man...'
p38
aS'Of course only TRUE PATRIOTS\xe2\x84\xa2 vote UKIP and call everyone else peados.'
p39
aS"But call UKIPPERS racist and you'll be frothing at the mouth."
p40
aS'Full marks for sophistication. '
p41
aS'Remember: Way easier to say liberal/leftie things in public than right wing ones.'
p42
aS'Hence there\'s no "shame" in supporting Lab/Lib.'
p43
aS'Conservatives have to keep quiet because people accuse them of being Hitler quite regularly. '
p44
aS"What's the obsession with conflating liberal and leftie?"
p45
aS'I feel a bit of a dick because in your post it kind of works.'
p46
aS"But they are not at all the same thing most lefties are quite illiberal see labour's anti terror laws and the greens list of things they want to ban."
p47
aS'Equaly most liberals are not socialists see most lib dems and most liberals on the continent.'
p48
aS"There is an overlap in the social democrat area I guess you could call them liberal lefties but that's not how it's used."
p49
aS"Because the left have bastardised and decided to own 'liberalism'."
p50
aS'Orwell despised it.'
p51
aS'Benn despised it.'
p52
aS'Crow despised it.'
p53
aS'Honourable lefties like Nick Cohen, frank fields, john cruddas despise it too'
p54
aS'&gt; frank fields\n\nLINO: Labour in name only and lays on the floor.'
p55
aS'LINO?'
p56
aS'He is labour through and through.'
p57
aS'Juat because you are not a dogmatic progressive of the Blairite social wing doesnt mean you arent labour.'
p58
aS'It was they (smith, jenkins, wilson, kinnock et al) who hijacked that  once great party, not the other way round.'
p59
aS'He is of the blue labour wing.'
p60
aS'Economically paternalistic and statist ywt working class conservative values run through them like a stick of rock.'
p61
aS"If labour were run by these kinds of men, 70% of the working classes wouldn't abstain/vote for someone else."
p62
aS'If you look at the figures they got, mind you - 20% would be proud to tell people that they\'d voted Labour, which is the highest "proud" figure - that\'s still outweighed by the 33% who\'d be embarrassed by it.'
p63
aS"Most of that 33% is people who aren't Labour supporters saying they'd be embarrassed to say they were Labour supporters."
p64
aS'Amongst Labour voters it was 62% proud and 2% embarrassed.'
p65
aS'I think most kippers are more worried about getting abused or their house\\car vandalised rather then being embarrassed.'
p66
aS"Planned on putting up a UKIP poster you can request from the party this election but living in outer London in a labour seat probably isn't the best idea if I want to safeguard my families windows."
p67
aS"And this is why there's a 'shy UKIP' factor."
p68
aS"I'm fully expecting close to 20% of the vote share come polling day."
p69
aS'You can fully expect to be wrong then.'
p70
aS"There doesn't seem to have been a shy UKIP factor in last year's election so I don't see why there would be one this year."
p71
aS'I think this is wishful thinking on the part of Kipper fans.'
p72
aS'It actually looks like UKIP did worse than polls predicted: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(United_Kingdom)#Opinion_polls\n\n'
p73
aS'In all fairness, the EU elections might not show the shy anything factor because they have such low turnout.'
p74
aS"If you're going to vote for someone in the EU elections, you're in (roughly) the top third of the population for commitment to your party."
p75
aS"I'm not sure if you looked at the results, but most of the people who said they would be embarrassed to tell people they vote UKIP were not UKIP voters."
p76
aS'Actual UKIP voters were more likely to say they would be proud to talk about their political allegiance than Tory or Lib Dem voters.'
p77
aS'The polls are equally likely to be wrong in either direction - unless you have any actual evidence to suggest a bias, then this is just wishful thinking.'
p78
aS"Unless I'm mistaken, the first graph (the green graph) and the title are quite misleading and pretty much useless because it's all voters."
p79
aS"It's heavily affected by the overall polling of the party."
p80
aS'The second graph tells you about a shy factor.'
p81
aS'UKIP appears to have almost as little shy factor as Labour.\n'
p82
aS'Though we were told before the referendum that there was a large "Shy No", for the exact same reasons as this "Shy UKIP".'
p83
aS"And it didn't appear."
p84
aS"I'd wager that the polls a day before the election are going to be near enough spot on. "
p85
aS'As I recall, the polls immediately before the referendum had Yes ahead in some cases, and neck and neck in most.'
p86
aS"No then won by a margin of 10%, so it would appear there was in fact a 'shy no' effect."
p87
aS'In the week leading up to it, the No side had a lead of between 5 and 9%.'
p88
aS'So yeah, they were a little off, but only by 1-5%...'
p89
aS"5% of the overall vote would change UKIP's fortunes significantly"
p90
aS'But I believe they will be taking seats from both Labour and Tory almost equally.'
p91
aS'Is that right?'
p92
aS"I'm sure I seen it somewhere."
p93
aS"It won't have all that much effect on the government unless they get more than about 20 seats."
p94
aS"well that's up for debate, they certainly would be taking more votes from tories than labour, so UKIP vote jumping 33% in size would make a lot of marginal seats swing labour."
p95
aS'So yes they would have a significant affect on the government.'
p96
aS'One did.'
p97
aS'51%-49%.\n'
p98
aS'Leave it.'
p99
aS"They don't get it."
p100
aS"They don't seem to understand how it is completely different to his irrelevant referendum."
p101
aS'In that we had two sides opposing each other.'
p102
aS'In this we have 5/6/7+ sides.'
p103
aS'All opposing just this 1 which is significantly smaller than the others who are ganging up.'
p104
aS"It's basic playground mentality. "
p105
aS'Oh, I get it.'
p106
aS'if anything the campaign was clearly marked by a shy yes vote.'
p107
aS"As I recall the polls taken slightly before the referendum showed the no vote being slightly smaller than it was so its arguable a 'shy no' did exist.\n\n"
p108
aS'20% is a bit much.'
p109
aS"I'm expecting around 15%."
p110
aS"Though I suppose it won't matter too much because despite this, they're predicted to lose seats not gain them."
p111
aS'Reckless might lose his seat.'
p112
aS"And Nigel Farage looks like he won't win South Thanet, which means he might resign (as he said), in which case, I think support for UKIP will fall."
p113
aS'This may be the best UKIP does in a general election.'
p114
aS'Farage, Carswell, and Reckless will all win.'
p115
aS"I'd be willing to bet my house on it."
p116
aS"Aker will also win Thurrock and there's a very good chance they'll take Castle Point, Boston &amp; Skegness, and Great Grimsby."
p117
aS'RemindMe!'
p118
aS'3 weeks "what happened?'
p119
aS'"'
aS'Carswell nailed on to win.'
p120
aS'Farage is a massive toss-up.'
p121
aS'Reckless looks completely fucked.'
p122
aS"I'd be extremely surprised if he were returned."
p123
aS'Thurrock looks promising, the rest less so, but imaginable. '
p124
aS'Has there been any polling published for Rochester and Strood?'
p125
aS"Struggling to find anything that isn't referencing the figures for the byelection."
p126
aS"The reasoning behind the argument is that Reckless' lead over the Conservatives isn't strong enough to stop him losing his by-election bounce."
p127
aS'Take this with a pinch of salt, but I know a pollster and he says the consensus is pretty unanimous that Reckless is out.'
p128
aS"I'll ask him if Ashcroft has any fieldwork going on."
p129
aS'But yes, public polling seems not to have happened yet.'
p130
aS'Thanks for sharing what you can!'
p131
aS':)'
p132
aS"&gt;  they're predicted to lose seats not gain them."
p133
aS"&gt; \n&gt; And Nigel Farage looks like he won't win South Thanet\n\nHook, line and sinker."
p134
aS'The media spin really does work wonders.'
p135
aS"Umm it was a UKIP poll (confirmed by ComRes) that showed Nigel was behind... Perhaps it's not as clear cut, but if you think UKIP are definitely going to do really well this election, it looks like UKIP spin has worked wonders as well."
p136
aS"They were only behind after the weightings, and they didn't include Farage's name in the question, and they falsely implied the the MP who is stepping down was in the election."
p137
aS'http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/9331\n\n&gt;Most of the criticism of the poll last night (including some from UKIP themselves) was frankly complete nonsense.'
p138
aS'I can only assume a lot of it was sourced from \xe2\x80\x9cwhat some bloke on Twitter reckoned\xe2\x80\x9d.'
p139
aS'To sum up, the difference isn\xe2\x80\x99t because candidates weren\xe2\x80\x99t named \xe2\x80\x93 they were.'
p140
aS'It isn\xe2\x80\x99t because 2010 political or turnout weights were used \xe2\x80\x93 they weren\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p141
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because people who are unlikely to vote were included \xe2\x80\x93 they weren\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p142
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because ComRes reallocated people by 2010 vote \xe2\x80\x93 they don\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p143
aS'The idea that the question wording mentioning \xe2\x80\x9cyour local MP\xe2\x80\x9d favoured Laura Sandys seems somewhat stretched, given the question included candidate names and Laura Sandys wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one of those candidates.'
p144
aS'&gt;To look at the more substantive things people have asked though, the initial voting intention question in the poll found Nigel Farage ahead.'
p145
aS'What put him behind in the final figures was weighting by turnout and squeezing the don\xe2\x80\x99t knows.'
p146
aS'Neither of these are strange and unusual, they are ComRes\xe2\x80\x99s normal method and are perfectly justifiable. '
p147
aS'So they agree with two of my points, though they disagree with the extent of the effect it would cause.'
p148
aS'The third point was that Farage was named beforehand, but not in the question.'
p149
aS'The tables are [here](http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/South_Thanet_Constituency-Poll_Tables_March2015.pdf).'
p150
aS"They directly named all the candidates in the question, including Farage, which makes it clear that the local MP wasn't standing."
p151
aS"The only legitimate criticism is the turnout weighting, but almost all polls include some turnout weighting - it is ComRes' normal method - so the same criticism applies to every other poll you see."
p152
aS'Fair enough.'
p153
aS"However I still don't think they're going to do as well as 20% nationally."
p154
aS"They're polling 12% in the poll of polls."
p155
aS'Unless they get a massive surge in the last 2 weeks, that stigma factor is not going to be 8%...'
p156
aS"I didn't argue they would."
p157
aS"I think they'll get around 15/16%."
p158
aS"I think they'll get 6/7 seats, though on a good day, they could get double digits."
p159
aS'Farage will talk about how PR screwed UKIP, and that they still outperformed expectations.'
p160
aS'&gt; Farage will talk about how PR screwed UKIP\n\nLots of parties have tried talking about this in the past, including the Lib Dems, UKIP, and the Greens.'
p161
aS'It turns out that nobody cares, because very few people pore through election results in enough detail to see the problem, very few people know enough about political theory to understand any alternative voting systems or how they differ from the current one, and it *sounds* like a pathetic excuse from a sore loser.'
p162
aS'&gt; this does not mean that UKIP may perform better on May 7th than the polls suggest \xe2\x80\x93 most of the people who tell us voting UKIP is embarrassing never have or will vote UKIP'
p163
aS'I don\'t think you could put "shy" and "UKIP" together.'
p164
aS"Anyone voting UKIP is telling everyone they're voting UKIP."
p165
aS"&gt;Anyone voting UKIP is telling everyone they're voting UKIP."
p166
aS'What are you basing this on?'
p167
aS"I'm not telling *anyone."
p168
aS'*'
aS'Nonsense.'
p169
aS"I don't like being called a racist xenophobe and that's exactly what you get if you out yourself as a UKIP supporter to the wrong person."
p170
aS'&gt; wrong person.'
p171
aS'Most people?'
p172
aS'Lol.'
p173
aS"You couldn't be more wrong."
p174
aS'Emily Thornberry retweeted this.'
p175
aS'The primary driving force keeping the Labour party alive is this, guilt, and not wanting to be "shamed" for supporting a non-cuddly, insufficiently progressive, intolerant, undiverse, monocultural political party.'
p176
aS'The force is so strong it actually made the Conservative party change tack and appoint a Blairite and fully adhere to the social justice agenda to win over the BBC and liberal middle classes.'
p177
aS"This will be the main reason UKIP don't win a bunch of seats, voters are so fearful of the BBC and assorted liberal elitists pointing at them and laugh for being so backwards and intolerant."
p178
aS'*Shaming* their opponents into submission is how the modern left operate.'
p179
aS"Don't know whether you realised this but voting takes place in a private booth where no one can see your choice. "
p180
aS'&gt; The force is so strong it actually made the Conservative party change tack and appoint a Blairite and fully adhere to the social justice agenda to win over the BBC and liberal middle classes\n\nOr perhaps it was because the centre-ground had changed?'
p181
aS'Just throwing it out there.'
p182
aS"I'm pretty sure the Tories had to change tack because they were out of power for *13* years. "
p183
aS'I did a blind test recently on policies and got 80% UKIP.'
p184
aS'Its a shame they attract the neo Nazi type because they drag them down in the public eye despite UKIP having very reasonable, well thought out policies. '
p185
aS'I always thought it was embarrassing not to vote UKIP.'
p186
aS'Voting for the three parties responsible for the calamitous decline of the UK, illegal wars, ripping off the taxpayer, rampant child abuse and 1.5 trillion of debt.'
p187
aS'Jimmy Saville and Lord Janner salute your voting choices \n\n'
p188
aS'Ah the pedophile references once again without fail.'
p189
aS'Truly remarkable.'
p190
aS'you do realise UKIP are mostly ex tories?'
p191
aS"I'm so proud of the fact I put it in my username!"
p192
aS'Gross.'
p193
aS'Redditor for an hour, says it all really.'
p194
aS'Obvious troll is obvious. '
p195
aS'For the middle classes maybe.'
p196
aS'The rest of us feel no such shame!'
p197
aS"But then, i do not come from a background which despises critical thinking and insists on 'thinking correctly'!"
p198
aS"I also find it hilarious that voting labour isn't embarrassin."
p199
aS"Labour have done very well haven't they."
p200
aS'Its what happens when the opposition (tories) are so wet and weak they have conceded all territory, and when labour have been so successful in planting yes men in the charities and NGOs they began to fund.'
p201
aS'Hey ho.'
p202
aS'Its unsustainable, so silver linings n all dat.'
p203
aS"It's getting rapidly quite interesting."
p204
aS"For instance, if NIreland has no seats change, and ElectrionForecast's predictions hold perfectly accurate, we actually get the uncomfortable state of 323 being formed from Labour, SNP, Plaid, Green, and SDLP."
p205
aS'That totals exactly 323.'
p206
aS'If anything, this will be quite a chaotic post-election season.'
p207
aS'I cant imagine the chaos a 5 party confidence agreement in the British system would bring'
p208
aS"The SDLP are already allied with Labour whilst the SNP, Plaid and the Greens have said they'll work together at Westminster."
p209
aS"It's not as disjointed as it first seems."
p210
aS"Bennett said she's opposed to any coalitions."
p211
aS'The Greens would deal with legislation on a case by case basis.'
p212
aS'And although the SNP, Plaid and the Greens seem quite chummy, there are big differences between the SNP and Labour.'
p213
aS'Its still would be possibly  the most  disjointed government this  nation has ever had though...'
p214
aS'Sounds amazing.'
p215
aS'No one will form a majority government.'
p216
aS'Will be a coalition.'
p217
aS'SNP + Labour will be it I think.'
p218
aS"I don't see there being a coalition."
p219
aS'My money is on a (probably short-lived) minority government.'
p220
aS"You don't see Labour going with SNP?"
p221
aS'I can see Labour in a confidence and supply agreement with the SNP, but not a full-on coalition.'
p222
aS"They disagree on too many fundamental issues to work in a coalition, but they're aligned enough in opposition to the tories that the SNP would back Labour in a motion of no confidence."
p223
aS'I can see Lab/Lib (305 seats total) going into minority, with SNP in a Confidence and Supply.'
p224
aS'However, that is all they will need.'
p225
aS'The SNP will provide more than enough votes to keep the minority stable. '
p226
aS"That's what I think will happen tbh."
p227
aS'Distressing as that is for a UKIPer.'
p228
aS'Not to mention the SNP would run a real risk of imploding Clegg-style if they went into formal coalition.'
p229
aS"They'd never get through legislation that was seen as unfairly favouring Scotland or some of their more anti-establishment policies like nuclear disarmament."
p230
aS'Nobody expected massive influence from the Liberal Democrats and all it took was one policy not getting through to sink them, the SNP will go in with massive expectations of influence and as soon as one or two of their key policies fail to go through confidence in them will plummet.'
p231
aS"The higher you're standing the harder the ground feels if you fall."
p232
aS"I might fundamentally disagree with the SNP on just about everything they stand for but they're definitely not idiots, and going into coalition would be an idiotic move."
p233
aS"It's far more likely they'll prop up Labour informally and make demands in return."
p234
aS"They might still sink if they fail to deliver but it's less likely than if they go into coalition."
p235
aS"I agree, it'll be an interesting election and no mistake."
p236
aS"It's hard to find any truly workable outcome - best case scenario for the electorate is to call another election really, although even then the outcome is likely to be similar."
p237
aS'Never before has STV been more necessary...'
p238
aS"I know, first past the post is a fantastic system if you're a non-partisan democracy like the Falkland Islands or have a small number of parties as we did before 2010 but in any other case it's extremely flawed."
p239
aS'Though it is nice to have local areas get the candidate they want rather than have a less appropriate representative because of party politics.'
p240
aS"While I broadly support the Conservatives I'd happily have the Liberal Democrat candidate in my constituency represent me because her local policies are brilliant."
p241
aS"Under a PR system I'd have to vote purely along party lines rather than local ones."
p242
aS'The Green candidate suggested a system while you vote for a local *and* a party representative to get around this but it sounded awfully complicated and messy.'
p243
aS"EDIT: I'm a twat and misread your comment."
p244
aS'Thought you were on about something else, not STV.'
p245
aS"I'll let my comment stand though as a testament to my stupidity."
p246
aS"Well I'd be just as happy with AV, since STV requires multiple seats per constituency and that seems a bit messy."
p247
aS'I think the Greens advocate a hybrid system where the party seats are allocated proportionally but then you have a FPTP system for local candidates which would be fine but as you say, needlessly complicated.'
p248
aS"On the other hand if we adopted electronic voting it'd be a lot smoother."
p249
aS'What would your preferred system be?'
p250
aS"To be honest I haven't studied them all in enough detail to have found one I like above all of them."
p251
aS"I think STV would be a reasonable choice as it's been proven in other countries and seems to be fairer. "
p252
aS"Labour joining with the SNP would be suicidal I can't see them doing it."
p253
aS'They would alienate their remaining Scottish voters and if the SNP managed to wangle extra goodies for Scotland there would be outrage in England.'
p254
aS'I reckon Ed is hoping the Lib vote holds up so they have enough to go LibLab'
p255
aS'The Lib Dems are going to get mauled.'
p256
aS"Ed's gonna have some tough decisions come May, Sturgeon and the SNP have little to lose and a lot to gain from a Lab-SNP agreement."
p257
aS"Doesn't an incumbent PM get first dibs on forming a government though?"
p258
aS"Cameron could form a minority government and then as long as he could stave off a no confidence vote with help from the lib dems, UKIP and the DUP he'd remain as PM."
p259
aS'That said my own prediction is still a Labour minority with SNP confidence and supply.'
p260
aS"But if Tory, DUP, Lib Dems and UKIP didn't equal 323 the others could still pass through a vote of no confidence, minority governments only work when them + their supporters have an overall majority in the Chamber."
p261
aS'Yes, it really depends after the election what happens.'
p262
aS'If Labour and LibDems can form a coalition then Cameron is out.'
p263
aS'If Labour require the SNP and have already ruled out a coalition...\n\nTwo things will happen at the same time, I presume.'
p264
aS'Cameron will ask who is not against him - in other words who will vote against him in a confidence vote.'
p265
aS'Meanwhile Milliband will ask the same question.'
p266
aS'That seems to favour Milliband more than Cameron.'
p267
aS"It's likely I think that the SNP will say that they will at least initially agree to confidence, and negotiation on supply."
p268
aS"However I don't know what happens if neither the tories nor the labour can form a confidence government - does Cameron play chicken with parliament as a minority government and dare the other parties to withdraw confidence?"
p269
aS'Labour and the Conservatives form a coalition, quickly devolve the majority of government in Scotland to the SNP.'
p270
aS'Then hold another election later this year, excluding Scotland.'
p271
aS'Whoever wins most seats forms a coalition with the Lib Dems.'
p272
aS"Everyone's happy..."
p273
aS"Labour and SNP will form a coalition, Miliband just can't publicly accept it or Scottish Labour has no chance. "
p274
aS"I doubt it, the SNP's whole thing is how Westminster are so bad Scotland needs to leave the UK."
p275
aS'That argument collapses if you are Westminster yourself.'
p276
aS"If that was true then they wouldn't run for Westminster in the first place."
p277
aS"A no confidence vote also forces another election though, so it's arguably still a sensible thing for Cameron to do."
p278
aS"Even if he's forced out by no confidence, we simply go to the polls again hoping for a more decisive result. "
p279
aS'I thought that if the government lost a confidence vote, the other parties could try to form a government before another election was called?'
p280
aS'I believe this was changed with the fixed-term parliaments act in 2011, although I may be wrong.'
p281
aS'This was brought in under the fixed term parliament act, other parties now have two weeks to try and form a government. '
p282
aS'In that case, I stand corrected.'
p283
aS"Not sure it's in the Lib Dems interest to help them in that case."
p284
aS'Probably better for them to get a coalition with Labour or support a minority Labour government.'
p285
aS"Don't think they would be up for working with UKIP. "
p286
aS"Crucially, they wouldn't be working with UKIP."
p287
aS'It would be a simple of case of saying "we\'d rather Cameron stayed as PM than hold another GE".'
p288
aS"Obviously a proper coalition including the lib dems and UKIP isn't going to happen, I'm just suggesting that both of them may prefer Cameron to Milliband or holding another election."
p289
aS"Don't see it happening, I think UKIP would demand a referendum and Lib Dems would not support it."
p290
aS'If the Conservatives need both Lib Dems and UKIP then Labour have won. '
p291
aS"It wouldn't be an actual *deal* though - nobody would be demanding anything."
p292
aS'UKIP prefer the tories to Labour, particularly where the budget is concerned, and the lib dems seem somewhere between the two so it could go either of 2 ways.'
p293
aS"Even if Cameron gets ousted by a no confidence vote, that doesn't make Milliband PM - it forces another election, so in many respects Cameron can't lose."
p294
aS"I just don't think Cameron would be able to form a government in the first place if he required UKIP and Lib Dem support to pass any legislation."
p295
aS'UKIP have stated that a referendum is the minimum (and pretty much the only thing) they would want to support the Conservatives.'
p296
aS'So if that happens Labour are more likely to be able to form a coalition/minority government which would include the SNP and/or Lib Dems. '
p297
aS'Yeah, as I said at the start the most likely outcome is still a Labour minority with SNP confidence and supply (possibly in coalition with lib dems).'
p298
aS"Yeah, but my original point was that your theory of a possible Conservative minority government with support from Lib Dems and UKIP is something I can't see happening. "
p299
aS"&gt; Doesn't an incumbent PM get first dibs on forming a government though?"
p300
aS'No.'
p301
aS"If Miliband can cobble together enough votes to pass the appropriate bills he doesn't have to wait for Cameron."
p302
aS'I can tell you from *inside* the Lib Dems, that the party will NOT prop up the Tories again, a lot more Libs now are on the SD (left) side of the party, and want to see us in with Labour.'
p303
aS'See, everyone forgets that Nick and his team cannot just sign into a coalition without the say-so of the Executive in an Extraordinary meeting which will include all voting members from across the UK.'
p304
aS'They will almost certainly vote against a Tory coalition, and ask that Nick negotiate with Ed and co. '
p305
aS"It wouldn't be a coalition though, it'd just be not voting to get rid of Cameron."
p306
aS'The Tories better not bring up the "we had more votes" card in the event; it would be sheer hypocrisy, but I expect they will. '
p307
aS'More votes is more legitamacy'
p308
aS'Quite true, and I agree; but evidently the Conservatives do not, as they opposed efforts to form a more proportional voting system. '
p309
aS"I think many conservatives have opposed PR for sound reasons in the past but the fracturing of the left and right wing votes into multiple parties (the end of the 'big tent' Labour movement in particular) means the advantages of the system are now less obvious."
p310
aS"This may come into focus if the next government is a left-wing rainbow coalition ruling a country that is actually more inclined towards the moderate right and where polls would show that 'BlueKip' would be the largest grouping in a PR system (though as a moderate conservative I hate the idea of being allied to UKIP).\n"
p311
aS'The title seems to suggest that this is somehow wrong.'
p312
aS'It will solve the problem of the split left wing vote'
p313
aS"I'd be easy with either a Lab/Lib or a Con/Lib coalition, but the prospect of Milliband in no10 being puppeted by the SNP is horrifying. \n\n"
p314
aS"What makes you think the SNP would 'sock puppet' Miliband?"
p315
aS"Was Cameron Nick Clegg's bitch?"
p316
aS'The SNP actually have a pretty weak hand, they either support Labour, or they let the Conservatives in.'
p317
aS'If the SNP are responsible for a Conservative government then their supporters will desert them in droves.'
p318
aS"Scotland have already been promised what amounts to 'home rule', all they can really argue for is full fiscal autonomy, and if they get this the rest of the UK arguably comes out better."
p319

p328
aS'They could easily do another election.'
p329
aS'In fact the Scottish electorate are getting hooked on them, its the new Buckfast for the masses. '
p330
aS'but to what effect?'
p331
aS"they'll win their seats again and either the conservatives will take a ton of seats of labour or labour will win enough to sideline them."
p332
aS'&gt;but to what effect?'
p333
aS"This is the SNP, who's goal is independence for Scotland."
p334
aS'There is a school of thought that says when the SNP shows Westminster politics to be dysfunctional, it cannot harm the SNP.'
p335
aS'Labour might be well advised to think about that. '
p336
aS'&gt;There is a school of thought that says when the SNP shows Westminster politics to be dysfunctional, it cannot harm the SNP.'
p337
aS"Or more like people who would normally vote SNP for Holyrood and Labour for Westminster are trying their hand at SNP for Westminster and if they mess it up, then that probably won't happen again."
p338
aS"If Labour gets wiped out, it's the SNP who have everything to lose."
p339
aS'Well Labour kind of fucked up really badly during the independence campaign from a Scotland point of view.'
p340

p341

p352
aS"The SNP support Scotland seceding from the UK, I'm aware Scottish nationalism (or English and Welsh nationalism for that matter) doesn't necessarily have to involve breaking up the UK but the SNP are pretty explicit about their aims."
p353
aS'They want independence, so yes.'
p354
aS'Would independence be such an issue if Westminster politics was more left wing, at least in line with much of the working class?'
p355
aS"I'm not so sure. "
p356
aS"Surely it doesn't matter though?"
p357
aS'Not everyone wants an independent Scotland.'
p358
aS'If Westminster politics became more in line with the SNP and the working classes of the UK in general, both economically and socially, I think the independence question could be forgotten for a long time.'
p359
aS'The SNP are quite socially liberal and the working classes of England are less so.'
p360
aS'A lot of opposition to immigration particularly from the developing world and poorer parts of Europe comes from the working class, which is in direct contradiction to the socialist idea of class being more important than culture.'
p361

p390

p391

aS'I thought it was 326?'
p394
aS"I've heard from quite high up in politics (via a  very reliable third party) that the way they think it will pan out is: the Tories will win the most seats but not a majority."
p395
aS'They will be asked to form a govt.'
p396
aS'but then there will be a vote of no confidence and Labour will form an alliance with the SNP with the SNP pulling the strings.'
p397
aS"We'll see."
p398
aS'Is this legal?'
p399
aS'Surely a failed confidence vote means there would have to be a new election unless Milliband goes to the palace saying he has a formal agreement with the SNP to give him enough seats to form a government (which both parties have ruled out)?'
p400
aS'Gonna be some interesting days after May 7th\n'
p401
aS'Feels like this is starting to become the general consensus that Miliband will be PM.'

p409
aS'Another politician refusing to tackle an issue head on.'
p410

p657
aS"&gt;**FLAWED NARRATIVE**\n\n&gt;The conventional account of Libya's conflict and NATO's intervention is misleading in several key aspects."
p658
aS"First, contrary to Western media reports, **Qaddafi did not initiate Libya's violence by targeting peaceful protesters**."
p659
aS'The United Nations and Amnesty International have documented that in all four Libyan cities initially consumed by civil conflict in mid-February 2011\xe2\x80\x94Benghazi, Al Bayda, Tripoli, and Misurata\xe2\x80\x94**violence was actually initiated by the protesters**.'
p660
aS'The government responded to the rebels militarily but **never intentionally targeted civilians or resorted to "indiscriminate" force**, as Western media claimed.'
p661
aS'Early press accounts exaggerated the death toll by a factor of ten, citing "more than 2,000 deaths" in Benghazi during the initial days of the uprising, whereas Human Rights Watch (HRW) later documented only 233 deaths across all of Libya in that period.'
p662
aS'&gt;Further evidence that **Qaddafi avoided targeting civilians** comes from the Libyan city that was most consumed by the early fighting, Misurata.'
p663
aS"HRW reports that of the 949 people wounded there in the rebellion's initial seven weeks, only 30 were women or children, meaning that Qaddafi's forces focused narrowly on combatants."
p664
aS"During that same period, only 257 people were killed among the city's populationof 400,000\xe2\x80\x94a fraction less than 0.0006\xe2\x80\x94providing additional proof that the government avoided using force indiscriminately."
p665
aS'Moreover, **Qaddafi did not perpetrate a "bloodbath" in any of the cities that his forces recaptured from rebels prior to NATO intervention**\xe2\x80\x94including Ajdabiya, Bani Walid, Brega, Ras Lanuf, Zawiya, and much of Misurata\xe2\x80\x94so there was virtually no risk of such an outcome if he had been permitted to recapture the last rebel stronghold of Benghazi.'
p666
aS"&gt;The conventional wisdom is also wrong in asserting that NATO's main goal in Libya was to protect civilians."
p667
aS"Evidence reveals that **NATO's primary aim was to overthrow Qaddafi's regime, even at the expense of increasing the harm to Libyans**."
p668
aS"NATO attacked Libyan forces indiscriminately, including some in retreat and others in Qaddafi's hometown of Sirte, where they posed no threat to civilians."
p669
aS'Moreover, **NATO continued to aid the rebels even when they repeatedly rejected government cease-fire offers that could have ended the violence and spared civilians**.'
p670
aS'Such military assistance included weapons, training, and covert deployment of hundreds of troops from Qatar, eventually enabling the rebels to capture and summarily execute Qaddafi and seize power in October 2011.\n\nhttp://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/23387/lessons_from_libya.html'

p677
aS'Had the revolt been crushed straightaway, the implications for the Arab Spring would have been serious, but not necessarily more damaging than events in Bahrain, Yemen or Syria; Arab public opinion, long used to the idea that Libya was a place apart, was insulated against the exemplary effect of events there.'

p802
aS'Regardless, I think that, rather there being no idea of how to handle a post-leader Libya, what happened was that the West rather tried something more - strong support for the NTC in terms of diplomacy, financing, and experts to try and help them help themselves.'
p803
aS"Boots on the ground didn't work in Afghanistan or Iraq (although the argument is frequently made that Afghanistan alone might've been doable if there wasn't also the sideshow in Iraq), and the whole process of 'regime change', and the methods surrounding trying to carry it out, are pretty new so it's only natural that other methods would be tried."

p914
aS'You need to read comment chains before you reply.'
p915
aS"The above poster was arguing that the unions represent their members when it comes to political activities, and I was pointing out that that's not true because they still campaign on behalf of, fund, and affiliate themselves with the Labour Party, which most members don't associate themselves with at the ballot box, and therefore the unions are not representing their members in this respect."
p916
aS'They also fund organisations like HNH and UAF, who harass and intimidate a party that 1 in 10 of their members vote for.'
p917
aS'So they can opt out of the political levy and donate to the political party of their choice, instead.'

p922
aS'But rich individuals are completely different and only think of the best interests of the country, right?'
p923
aS"No they don't, but nor do unions so I dislike the myth just because unions are compromised of lots of people they are always looking out for their interests "
p924
aS'Well, a fair number on the doner list are new money (within a generation or so), so presumably have marshalled resources to provide goods or services that people want.'
p925
aS'I\'m not sure that "representing" a bunch of people (many of whom were bullied into) your union makes unions all the more democratically righteous than people who run businesses that lots of people find useful and give money to without compulsion. '

p927
aS'Some of them do.'

p929
aS'In order to dedicate the same amount of time they would have to take time off work, which would cost them far more in terms of salary than their Labour supporting union counterpart, yet at best they would only be as effective.'
p930
aS'Instead they stay at work, earn the money they would have earned in the hours canvassing, and donate that money to the party.'
p931
aS'They get more money, the party gets to hire consultants and other people who will provide more benefit than a couple of hours of canvassing would have.'

p948
aS"This is the antithesis of how a democracy should work\n\nThey're not buying votes at the ballot box and the rest of your arguments should be directed at people who are swayed by financially-funded campaigns."
p949
aS"You're in effect also calling all Conservative voters brainwashed."
p950
aS"Why you're talking about the US I have no idea."
p951
aS" I referenced the US because its common knowledge that money buys power there and the same principle holds for all other 'democracies' with private funding of elections."
p952
aS'I am calling Conservatives brainwashed yes, I also say that despite that they also hold opinions one might describe as socialist.'
p953
aS'These are the people who swallow whole the propaganda they are fed with their daily news and entertainment and believe the conservatives represent their opinions yet opinion polls show most should be voting something like the Green party.'
p954
aS'Your definition of what a real democracy is would also apply to lots of other things.'
p955
aS'Being a member of a party, canvassing, being involved in politics in any way, all of this takes time, money and effort that is not equal.'
p956
aS"As a result, the people who tend to get involved with lots of politics are those with spare time or who don't earn that much."
p957
aS"If a single mother who is a farmer has to work all of the time and can't get involved in politics and you wanted to ensure a real democracy, wouldnt the only way to make her equal to a student politics activist be to ban all political activity?"
p958
aS'How else could she have the exact same say?'
p959
aS'You think unemployed student campaigners who might come into contact with a couple of hundred people a year can really compete with million pound donations which could reach millions of people through advertising?'
p960
aS"What you're effectively saying is that the donation cap to political parties should be set to the average disposable income of a graduate?"
p961
aS"I'd be fine with that, but only a step on the way to public funding of political parties to take money out of politics."
p962
aS'Political donations are only a small part of the propaganda constantly fed to people.'
p963
aS'Entire biased newspapers read by millions, TV stations people watch every night?'
p964
aS'Establishment propaganda is so insipid it passes for rational opinion to alot of ppl.'

aS"Now watch out for those terrorists, and support austerity, here's a picture of the royal baby.\n\n"
p966
aS'It is the principle of the thing.'
p967
aS'It is no more fair to restrict how much someone can donate to a party than it would be to limit how much they can campaign.'
p968
aS'Both are unfair restrictions on how much an individual can involve themselves in politics.'
p969
aS'Telling someone they cannot protest or canvass would be seen as outrageous, yet an individual wanting to donate the equivalent amount of money is seen as acceptable.'
p970
aS'Why should the fact ones labour is valued more than the other mean they have less of a right to involve themselves in politics?'
p971
aS'You are effectively just punishing the rich for being better at politics.'
p972
aS"I personally don't care about efficacy."
p973
aS'But if there are going to be restrictions they should apply to everyone equally, as it should be tied to the number of hours that an individual can donate, not arbitrary limits on money.'
p974
aS"It's incredible you think that the ability to corrupt democracy is a 'principle' to be protected."
p975
aS'Are you being satirical?'
p976
aS"Your idea on the limits doesn't really work, if the person who works stopped working to campaign, they would no longer be earning so their current wage is irrelevant."
p977
aS"You'd better start looking at the wage of people who deliver leaflets, ie minimum wage."
p978
aS'&gt;You are effectively just punishing the rich for being better at politics.'
p979
aS"This is just such a ridiculous argument I don't know where to start, money does not equal political skill."
p980
aS'Currently its the other way round, the rich are punishing everyone else by buying policy, which is pretty much the definition of corruption.'
p981
aS"I reject the idea that it is corruption to donate money in a democracy, but under your definition I'm merely pointing out you want to ban the riches corruption while ignoring everyone else's efforts to influence elections to a greater extent than everyone else."
p982
aS'This is illegitimate in my eyes as it merely unfairly benefits one form of influence over another.'
p983
aS"Why isn't all political activity outside of voting corruption under your definition, and equally deserving of being restricted?"
p984
aS"I never said it was corrupt to donate money in a democracy, I specifically said I'd be fine with limits up to yearly minimum wage/graduate wage."
p985
aS"I think I've made it abundantly clear that it's corrupt when the money you donate disproportionately influences politics relative to everyone elses influence."
p986
aS'Surely you can see that something like this has to be the foundation of any democratic society?'
p987
aS"And I've made it abundantly clear that I believe someone protesting, campaiging, volunteering, and doing everything else involved in politics disproportionately influences politics relative to everyone elses influence, and so is as illegiitate as donating money."
p988
aS'Can you not see the inconsistency?'
p989
aS'Tell me, which campaigner maintains their own political party?'
p990
aS'Which volunteer has as much inlfuence as if they owned most of the national newspapers?'
p991
aS'They are disproportionately influencial in politics relative to every one elses influence, and so in so far as donating money and campaiging are illegitimate and counter to your principle of democracy, they are as well.'
p992
aS'That is still irrelevant to the principle of it.'
p993
aS'A donor attempts to change the result of an election by donating money.'
p994
aS'A campaigner attempts to change the result of an election by donating time and effort.'
p995
aS'Why is one acceptable and the other not according to your definition, when there are individuals who are unable to do either?\n\n'
p996
aS'Because money is far more powerful than campaigning and is disproportionately held in the hands of a few.'
p997
aS"And would you stop giving this example of a normal person who works donating money, that's not what were talking about and I've said that's not an issue for me."
p998
aS"We're talking about the millionairs and billionaires who buy the system, you're just avoiding conceding the point."

aS"Also keep in mind that for a very long time 'the establishment' was that other guy."
p2011
aS'The press, the UK government, big corporations were all circling round and calling the SNP crazy.'
p2012
aS'That inevitably has an effect.'
p2013
aS"Some people say the effect it had was to create a *cult* and *made the insanity worse*, I don't know.."
p2014
aS"I think that's a bit much."
p2015
aS'Some folks response is a downvote, some folks response is *"fuck off little englander"*, some folks call them an idiot back.'

aS'----\n\nI think that actually UKIP supporters must feel quite similar.'
p2018
aS'How often is it implied or just directly said that UKIP are racist.'
p2019
aS'It thoroughly sucks to genuinely and thoughtfully arrive at an opinion only to have it dismissed and your sanity questions.'
p2020
aS'Thank you, that was a very well written post.'
p2021
aS"From an English perspective the rhetoric of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon (pretty much the only two SNP representatives we're regularly exposed to) sounds very much like a rejection of us because all we hear of the SNP is their constitutional policies."
p2022
aS"Quite a few English people take this perceived rejection quite personally, especially when there's already (rightly or wrongly) a sense of unfair preferential treatment when Scotland receives significantly more funding per head than England."
p2023
aS'I suppose the opposition to the SNP in England could well seem strange for somebody who regularly hears about their other policies.'
p2024
aS"For what it's worth there's very, very little anti-Scottish sentiment in England."
p2025
aS'What England is strongly against is Scotland enacting policy that receives funding from English taxpayers but benefits Scotland alone.'
p2026
aS"It's assumed that policies like giving Scottish and EU residents free tuition but excluding the English and Welsh are funded at least in part by England and Wales which is seen as grossly unfair."
p2027
aS"This is why I'm in favour of giving each of the Home Nations full control over their finances, it prevents situations like this."
p2028
aS'Federalism with devo-max all round would be nice as well.'
p2029
aS"&gt; Quite a few English people take this perceived rejection quite personally\n\nThey probably shouldn't?"
p2030
aS"The idea that the referendum was fuelled by anti-English sentiment was frequently wheeled out by the media during the referendum but /u/Orsenfelt's description is far more accurate."
p2031
aS'The point of politics is to improve society, and the questions people asked were "Is Westminster improving Scottish society?'
p2032
aS'Is participating in the UK still in Scotland\'s best interests?".'
p2033
aS'None of that implies any notion of superiority, or anti-anyone feeling.'
p2034
aS"Something that became clear during the referendum was that large parts of Scotland perceived Scotland's place within the UK quite differently to many in the media (and perhaps many in England)."
p2035
aS"Those two views are that the UK is a voluntary union that Scotland participates in while it's beneficial to Scotland (in the way the UK does the EU), the other is that Scotland is somehow an integral part of the UK in the way that London is."
p2036
aS"If you believe that the union is just a part of Scotland's history then it seems quite natural to think of Scotland leaving that union if it no longer seems necessary."
p2037
aS'If you believe that Scotland is somehow integral to the UK then you might feel differently.'
p2038
aS'&gt; What England is strongly against is Scotland enacting policy that receives funding from English taxpayers but benefits Scotland alone.'
p2039
aS"Most of Scotland's funding is met by Scottish taxpayers."
p2040
aS'The whole point of devolution is that different countries within the union may end up with different policies.'
p2041
aS"&gt; It's assumed that policies like giving Scottish and EU residents free tuition but excluding the English and Welsh are funded at least in part by England and Wales which is seen as grossly unfair."
p2042
aS"Scotland's tuition fees are based on residency, not nationality."
p2043
aS"Wherever you're from in the UK, if you've lived in Scotland for the last three years then you qualify."

p2045
aS'Federalism with devo-max all round would be nice as well.'
p2046
aS'This would be a very popular option in Scotland as well.'
p2047
aS"Support for devo-max has always polled significantly higher than support for independence, which (IMO) is the primary reason it wasn't on the ballot."
p2048
aS"&gt; Scotland's tuition fees are based on residency, not nationality."
p2049
aS"Wherever you're from in the UK, if you've lived in Scotland for the last three years then you qualify."
p2050
aS"While technically true, it's also true that residents of the rest of the UK are the only people in the EU who don't have to pay."
p2051
aS"It's hard to not casually *perceive* that as being an England/Wales exclusion, even if that isn't strictly speaking what it is!"
p2052

p2054
aS"As part of the UK, Scotland isn't allowed to treat students applying from other EU members differently from those in Scotland."
p2055
aS'As part of devolution, Scotland is allowed to treat students applying from elsewhere within the UK differently.'
p2056
aS'You can argue that perhaps Scotland should give free tuition to students from elsewhere in the UK, but perhaps a better argument would be that the rest of the UK should give those students free tuition too?'
p2057
aS"That they chose not to isn't really Scotland's fault, other than through Scottish Labour's shameful use of their Scottish MPs (SNP and Scottish Lib Dem MPs voted against fees in England, and the SNP are now saying they would support Labour in lowering fees in England)."
p2058
aS'Given that the barrier in moving from rUK to Scotland to study is substantially lower than the barrier in moving countries to study then making Scottish higher education free to students throughout the UK would almost certainly disadvantage Scottish students.'
p2059
aS'rUK is approximately x10 larger by population so, if you assume that an equivalent %ge of the population decides to go into higher education, Scottish Universities could very easily be faced with the prospect of applicants from Scotland suddenly becoming 1/10th of their intake.'
p2060
aS'That makes no odds to the University, as the fees are still covered by the Scottish Government, but it makes quite a difference to the Scottish Government as most of those students will then return home after graduating rather than staying in Scotland.'
p2061
aS"If those students live in Scotland already then they're more likely to stay here."
p2062
aS"That's true regardless of where they're born, which is why it's prior residence - not place of birth - that qualifies you."
p2063
aS'OP was complaining about "funding from English taxpayers [that] benefits Scotland".'
p2064
aS"Given that most of Scotland's revenue is generated by tax raised from Scotland the situation he's arguing for would lead to Scottish taxpayers subsidising England."
p2065
aS'Scotland would pay for the higher eduction, England would reap the benefits.'
p2066
aS"That's what I said."
p2067
aS'More or less.\n\n'
p2068
aS"We're not that right wing these days. "
p2069
aS"I know, I'd say we're fairly balanced."
p2070
aS'I suppose having a userbase that overlaps with both /r/unitedkingdom and /pol/ helps with that.'
p2071
aS'I think it proves that poll that said 51% of SNP supporters find an attack on the party is a personal attack on them.'
p2072
aS'Its just pure patriotism in my mind.'
p2073
aS"I'm not sure if that's the case, I consider myself an English patriot as well as a British one but I'd never see an attack on English nationalism as a personal insult (I'll be the first to admit English nationalism is full of idiots, racists and hooligans)."
p2074
aS"There's nothing fundamentally different in the nationhood of England and Scotland (they are both nations in their own right despite their different constitutional status) so I don't think patriotism adequately explains it. "
p2075
aS"It's the manner in which these attacks are delivered."
p2076
aS'If you say to a Labour supporter "I think Ed\'s policies are terrible" they wont take it personally.'
p2077
aS'Hopefully an expansion of that opinion will follow, with some informed debate.'
p2078
aS'If you say to a Labour supporter "Those Labour folk, they\'re all just Welsh-hating nutters, no clue about politics, just following a cult.'
p2079
aS'" then it will be perceived as a personal insult.'
p2080
aS'Those are the majority kind of comments I see attacking the SNP both in the UKPolitics and Scotland subreddits.'
p2081
aS"If someone wants to debate policy, fine, come have some fun; but if they start with a sweeping general characterisation of an entire support base as fringe lunatics, naive children and starry eyed idiots, then they're not engaging in a mature conversation on policy, and it's insulting."
p2082
aS'Cybernats.'
p2083
aS'Definitely. '
p2084
aS'What explanation do you have for the hostility towards critics of the SNP in this subreddit?'
p2085
aS"The SNP has a remarkably effective online presence with it's supporters."
p2086
aS'&gt; What explanation do you have for the hostility towards critics of the SNP in this subreddit?'
p2087
aS'What explanation do you have for the hostility towards the SNP or their supporters in this subreddit?'
p2088
aS"Do a quick search for 'snp' in this sub and you'll quickly turn up comments like:\n\n* The SNP aren't [trying to do what's best], they are actively seeking to end the country."
p2089
aS'* Anti-English bigotry is the anvil to the hammer of Scottish nationalism.'
p2090
aS"* I've already explained this, jock."
p2091
aS'* I think the SNP quite openly hates the English.'
p2092
aS'* Just goes to show that the SNP is kind of like a quasi-religious cult for many of its supporters.'
p2093
aS'* The Scottish having a victim complex isnt really news to me.'
p2094
aS"* It's the SNP's tacit support for thuggery and intimidation."
p2095
aS'* [Scotland is] a glorified town council.'
p2096
aS"* I'm anti-Scottish because they are fucking humourless."
p2097
aS"* the crazies in the SNP (of which there are plenty)\n* the SNP hate the English and always have\n* Pretty much every encounter I've had with a scottish nationalist has led me to believe that Scottish nationalism is defined by anti-English sentiment."
p2098
aS"* Their raison d'etre is the destruction of my country!"
p2099
aS"* Salmond has always tried to whip up hatred of Scotland amongst English people\n* [The SNP are] saying 'fuck you' to England\n* Thus proving the scotch are untrustworthy\n* The SNP are toxic in that they only look out for one part of the UK\n* The SNP are toxic to other parties, since they openly don't care about what is best for the UK."
p2100
aS'Some of this is arguably fed by the media.'
p2101
aS"For the last two years there's been an unremitting [tsunami of bollocks](https://archive.today/cpsbN) regarding Scotland's prospects if it voted yes, or the consequences of it voting no but deciding to vote for someone other than Labour."
p2102
aS"I think what you're seeing is simply people's lazy stereotypes being challenged."
p2103
aS'Calling someone a "jock", claiming Scots have a victim complex, or making blatantly incorrect statements about how Scotland is funded or governed is - surprisingly enough - going to attract replies.'
p2104
aS'The "hostility" towards the comments I\'ve quoted above are also largely in the form of downvotes.'
p2105
aS'You can find plenty of similar behaviour on any topic, where people downvote purely based on what the person is saying (about the SNP, UKIP, Labour, the Lib Dems, or any other party).'
p2106
aS"The most offensive thing that's regularly written is the word 'cunt'."
p2107
aS"That's basically punctuation in Glasgow."
p2108
aS"To be honest, I haven't really noticed."
p2109
aS'Can you link to the comments you find so hostile?'
p2110
aS"I haven't been that active here recently but I'll be happy to PM you any examples I see when I come across them."
p2111
aS'I will share an interesting anecdote related to this discussion though.'
p2112
aS'I stayed up late on the night of the referendum to see the results as soon as they came out.'
p2113
aS'Sad I know, not being Scottish myself.'
p2114
aS"I was following the thread on /int/ (I find 4chan is a better platform for discussing things as they happen, Reddit's layout isn't as useful for this) and remarkably the second the result looked like it was in favour of the Union there was a flurry of posting trying to discredit the referendum result."
p2115
aS'There were pictures of ballots which had apparently been miscounted, some of them blatantly photoshopped.'
p2116
aS'At first I put this down to 4chan being 4chan but I found the same thing happening elsewhere.'
p2117
aS'There is definitely a element within the nationalist movement which is morally challenged and resorts to underhand methods.'
p2118
aS'Yup, for sure.'
p2119
aS'Over at /r/Scotland, we had a large number of conspiracy theories posted too, so much so that we banned them.'
p2120
aS'We only took the rule against them out of the sidebar recently...'
p2121
aS'There were some curious photos coming out of the polling stations, that some people thought proved a fix, though they were easily explained away.'
p2122
aS"I don't remember seeing any that were blatantly photoshopped, though."
p2123
aS"Anyway, there are very few people at /r/Scotland (that hotbed of Cybernats and Crazy Nationalists) who don't think the result was more or less correct."
p2124
aS'And anyway, I don\'t see how posting conspiracy theories is "morally challenged".'
p2125
aS'It may be crazy, but no more than any other conspiracy theory.'
p2126
aS'And to be fair, judging by some of the stuff which has come out *since* the referendum (such as the Scotland Office leaking a possibly doctored note about a private meeting between Sturgeon and the French Ambassador, *during* the election period), some of those conspiracy theories start to look a little less crazy.'
p2127
aS'Still crazy, but slightly less so.'
p2128
aS"Still, I don't see how that's morally challenged, or resorting to underhand methods..."
p2129
aS'Perhaps then we have a different position on what counts as morally challenged (which is fine of course, philosophy would be a boring field if we all agreed!'
p2130
aS") but I'd argue posting things as though they were fact without qualifying that they are opinion or anecdotes is immoral behaviour, or at least undesirable to reasoned discussion."
p2131
aS"I'd also consider leaking the note if it is indeed doctored immoral as well."
p2132
aS"In my opinion politics should be conducted completely transparently unless national security is gravely at risk and using doctored notes, photoshopped ballots and the like is not transparent, it's underhand."
p2133
aS"I'm not going to claim the Unionist movement is free of underhand tactics either but that movement isn't the one we're discussing."
p2134
aS'No, for sure.'
p2135
aS'But like I said, of all the conspiracy theories I saw posted, none of them looked photoshopped.'
p2136
aS"They almost all had easily-refutable theories attached to them, but I don't think being wrong is morally challenged: I don't think any of them were intentionally made to deceive."
p2137
aS'And like my post above says.'
p2138
aS'Passions were high, higher than you could possibly imagine, in the days around the referendum.'
p2139
aS"Remember that this wasn't a normal election; some people have been waiting their entire lives for that vote, and when it didn't go their way, they looked for reasons to explain it."
p2140
aS'The vast majority of those people who clung to crazy theories have since accepted defeat, and for the most part, very graciously.'
p2141
aS'Rather more graciously than some of the "winners" have accepted victory, but that\'s for another argument. '
p2142
aS'Right, and now my serious answer.'
p2143
aS'Firstly, Scotland at the moment is politically charged.'
p2144
aS"You might not realise it south of the border, but I've never lived anywhere where politics are discussed so frequently, so openly."
p2145
aS"It's calmed down a bit since the referendum, obviously, but it's still quite common to hear people talking politics on the bus, in the pub, with strangers on the train, &amp;c &amp;c. In all my years living in England, I never saw anything like it, even in the run-up to elections."
p2146
aS'Secondly, people think this election may actually *change* things.'
p2147
aS'Imagine if UKIP were polling at 52%, if they were heading to take a majority.'
p2148
aS'The excitement from some quarters would be palpable.'
p2149
aS"It's similar up here."
p2150
aS'People who have always voted for the same old parties, knowing full well they were all the same anyway, are suddenly voting for a party they actually *believe* in.'
p2151
aS"And that party is polling higher than it's ever polled, and some seat predictions have it winning not just most but damned near all the seats north of the border."
p2152
aS'So again, this adds to the excitement.'
p2153
aS'Thirdly, the Scots are cunts.'
p2154
aS'Now, I love them, but they speak their minds.'
p2155
aS"I've found, in the UK, the further north you get, the more people are happy to say what they mean, and not mince their words."
p2156
aS'Bournemouth, they were quite reserved, London, a little less so.'
p2157
aS'The Midlands, you knew when someone was upset with you.'
p2158
aS'Yorkshire, they tell you *exactly* what they think.'
p2159
aS'Well, Scotland is even further north, and the rule seems to continue.'
p2160
aS"So when they get in an argument, they aren't going to hold back out of politeness."
p2161
aS'Combine all three of these: Lots of politics, a new-found excitement about a political movement, and generally being cunts, and you have the perfect recipe for what some people might think is "shocking hostility".'
p2162
aS'Also, some people are just arseholes.'
p2163
aS"But SNP supporters certainly don't have a monopoly on that particular trait. "
p2164
aS'&gt; Secondly, people think this election may actually change things.'
p2165
aS'Imagine if UKIP were polling at 52%, if they were heading to take a majority.'
p2166
aS'The excitement from some quarters would be palpable.'
p2167
aS"It's similar up here."
p2168
aS'People who have always voted for the same old parties, knowing full well they were all the same anyway, are suddenly voting for a party they actually believe in.'
p2169
aS"And that party is polling higher than it's ever polled, and some seat predictions have it winning not just most but damned near all the seats north of the border."
p2170
aS'So again, this adds to the excitement.'
p2171
aS"I worry a little about how people may then feel if the SNP end up on the sidelines - and honestly, they may as well be; they've already indicated they'll do nothing with the Tories."
p2172
aS"So assuming we don't end up in a scenario where another Tory/Lib Dem administration is possible, and assuming that Labour (either on their own or with the Lib Dems too) can't form a majority - if Labour form a minority administration, as long as they can outvote the Tories plus UKIP and possibly the likes of the DUP - how much trouble are the SNP really likely to be?"
p2173
aS"It'd hardly be in their interests to bring down a Labour government (again); they could hardly expect to win more seats in a second election, would have to spend a bunch of cash on running a second election campaign that they can probably find better uses for - and would have to vote along with the hated Tories to do so!"
p2174
aS'I think the SNP are in as near of a no-lose situation as a political party can be.'
p2175
aS"There's of course always the chance they get the best outcome for the SNP and then through their own actions throw it all away."
p2176
aS"This is partly why I'm so sure they're going to be *very* careful not to piss off the English if they get the projected seats/position."
p2177
aS"They know too damn well that England can decide an election on its own, there's nothing to gain in helping it decide Tory."
p2178
aS'Outside of that though there is no bad scenario.'
p2179
aS"If they're involved it proves Scotland can, if it votes SNP, have a voice that isn't just whipped Labour seats."
p2180
aS"If they're *not* involved with a Labour government it proves that no matter what Scotland does it's just sidelined."
p2181
aS"If they're not involved and it's a Tory government well it's just another example of barely anyone voting Tory and it happening anyway.\n"
p2182
aS"Just to offer a couple of alternative viewpoints to those last points:\n\n* I think it's already fairly clear we're not going to see a Lab/SNP coalition - and there has to be an argument that an MP in the governing party (see: Gordon Brown) will potentially have more influence than an MP in a party external-but-vaguely-supportive to the government."
p2183
aS"* If they're *not* involved it proves that you can successfully sideline yourself by voting for a minor party (as the residents of Shetland and the Orkneys did for a very long time while power alternated between Labour and the Tories, as they kept electing Liberal MPs)."
p2184
aS"But, yeah, it'd be damn hard to be in SNP HQ and have anything other than a huge shit-eating grin these days I think."
p2185
aS"Even the absolute worst predictions see them picking up a ton of seats, in places they've never come close to winning (at Westminster) before; I live in Edinburgh South West, for example, where they came fourth last time and are considered in with a pretty good shot at winning it now."
p2186
aS"&gt; If they're not involved it proves that you can successfully sideline yourself by voting for a minor party (as the residents of Shetland and the Orkneys did for a very long time while power alternated between Labour and the Tories, as they kept electing Liberal MPs)."
p2187
aS"*Maybe* but we tried aligning with parties we didn't like just because they were big for quite some time."
p2188
aS"Now we're here."
p2189
aS'Most SNP supporters seem incapable of separating criticism of their party to their country.'
p2190
aS'They assume if you dislike SNP then you must hate Scotland.'
p2191
aS"SNP are a nationalist party and their supporters are nationalists, that is the reason they get so edgy over criticisms for their party and why they try and push the notion that only true Scots vote SNP and anyone who votes otherwise are just 'lapdogs' to westminster."
p2192
aS"You'll see them relentlessly bully and try to shame any Scot who doesn't want to go independent all the time, it's quite sad really."
p2193
aS'Third reply.'
p2194
aS'Bad form.'
p2195
aS'I know.'
p2196
aS'Sorry.'
p2197
aS"&gt;Every time somebody posts something about the SNP that isn't praising them or their policies it is quickly downvoted\n\nCan I just point out that my post about Sturgeon having the highest approval in the latest debate is currently sitting at 57% upvoted?"

p2240
aS'No. '
p2241
aS'Fair enough.'
p2242
aS'I just figured what with it having fuck-all to do with the topic at hand...'
p2243
aS'But never mind, carry on. '
p2244
aS'It had everything to do with the SNP and Scotland.'
p2245
aS'A thread that would attract these SNP people in which I can state my position.'
p2246
aS'Such a twat. '
p2247
aS'this is still the wrong thread for it.'
p2248
aS"There's plenty of other places SNP supporters will read your opinion."
p2249
aS"Cameron's totally given up even pretending to tell the truth."
p2250
aS"&gt; DC: Well, I'm happy that we're fighting the strongest and most positive campaign\n\nAnd it's quite amusing to watch him trying to salvage the anti-SNP argument."
p2251
aS"He's just spent two weeks warning everyone that Labour will have to go into coalition with the SNP, and that Trident would be at risk."
p2252
aS"Now Miliband's ruled out making a concession on Trident, and has pointed out that Labour could rely on Tory votes to push Trident's renewal through, Cameron's had to pivot to claiming that it would be dangerous for a government to rely on votes cast by SNP MPs because the SNP is a nationalist party."
p2253
aS'Which makes you wonder.'
p2254
aS"Because if Cameron thinks Scottish MPs not from a national party shouldn't be allowed to join a coalition, shouldn't be allowed to prop up a government on a vote-by-vote basis, and shouldn't be allowed to vote on England-only matters, what does he think they're there for?"
p2255
aS'Cameron can\'t even give a straight answer to the question "What\'s your favourite sport?'
p2256
aS'"'
aS'Can you blame him?'
p2257
aS'It was completely irrelevant to the topic of the interview and only damages him if he confirms it.'
p2258
aS"Do you not think it damages him if he is seen as some sort of robotic politician who avoids any question which doesn't benefit him?"
p2259
aS"We're really in dire straits if this beige politics is being defended, the prime minister terrified of making any statement without first running it past a focus group. "
p2260
aS'If he ducks questions that are actually in the course of what he came to discuss then yeah, it should be perceived negatively.'
p2261
aS"But why can't he answer a completely causal question just because it doesn't revolve around politics?"
p2262
aS"The Tories have been banging on about what a limp dick Miliband is but the leader won't even try to appear human."
p2263
aS"It's utter hypocrisy for them to tell people not to vote Labour because of the man and then pretend this isn't stuff relevant. "
p2264
aS"The BBC is meant to be impartial, yet Marr wasn't asking Cable and Sturgeon irrelevant questions designed to typecast them as something unpalatable to the electorate."
p2265
aS"It can indeed be argued that the Tories brought it on themselves with their mud-slinging, and there's merit to that, but I am also not overly critical of him for declining to stride into an obvious trap."
p2266
aS'No, by dragging personality into the election they have made these questions entirely relevant.'
p2267
aS"They're meant to be impartial, that doesn't mean they have to be uniform."
p2268
aS"If the Tories raise issues they should have them turned on themselves, that's impartiality."
p2269
aS'If someone asked you in an interview or in a bar if you liked any sports would you reply, "it\'s a trap!"?'
p2270
aS"No, you'd look insane."
p2271
aS'Would you instead evade the question?'
p2272
aS'No, you would stupid.'
p2273
aS"It's a totally normal thing to ask a person."
p2274
aS'So why are trying to justify this kind of delusional paranoia from politicians? '
p2275
aS"Because this isn't a bar or an interview, it's national television during the run up to a general election."
p2276
aS"Don't get me wrong, I dislike politicians being slippery, but in this particular instance I can see fairly clearly why he avoided answering."
p2277
aS"According to Marr, Cameron told the 'Countryside Alliance' magazine that hunting was his favourite sport."
p2278
aS"Asking him about something he's voluntarily released into the public domain is hardly a trap."
p2279
aS'Hilarious'
p2280
aS"I'm not a tory voter, and usually like Marr, but fuck me that was annoying: \n\nCable: Casual conversation, light grilling."
p2281
aS'Sturgen: may as well have been a party political broadcast, soft ball after soft ball.'
p2282
aS'Anytime she looked like she was floundering marr moved on.'
p2283
aS'Cameron: constant interruptions and attempted traps. \n\n\n'
p2284
aS"The reason I think Cameron was interrupted more than the other two is that Tory MPs just don't seem to be able to give straight answers, it's incredibly frustrating to watch."
p2285
aS'Marr asked Sturgeon what the SNP would do in the event of a hung parliament, she answered they would not do a deal with the Tories and thinks all the anti-Tory parties should unite to keep Cameron out.'
p2286
aS'When Cable was asked, he said the Lib Dems stand in the centre ground and would be willing to do a deal with either of the big parties.'
p2287
aS'When Cameron was asked, he bashed the prospect of deal between Labour and SNP, refused to say whether the Tories would deal with UKIP and kept saying the Tories were trying to get a majority, which all of the polls are showing is pretty unlikely.'
p2288
aS"Ye but she is in a situation where she can make promises without the chance she's going to have to follow through."
p2289
aS'Cable should have been asked if the libdems would be part of any coalition that included UKIP'
p2290
aS'[Nick Clegg has already ruled out a coalition with UKIP](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-leader-nick-clegg-rules-out-ever-joining-nigel-farage-in-coalition-government-with-ukip-9985942.html).'
p2291
aS"It just won't work."
p2292
aS"ah i wasn't aware of that - thanks"
p2293
aS'Yer but if Cameron does not answer the questions he is asked then that is on him, the public will judge him for dodging questions appropriately.'
p2294
aS"But if Cameron politely changes subject because he doesn't want to answer a personal question then it is pretty rude to keep asking it."
p2295
aS'Rude?'
p2296
aS'Marr was doing his job.'
p2297
aS'Politicians should be punished for being slippery.'
p2298
aS'It is a bit of a cheeky question though.'
p2299
aS'It\'s like asking a company whose profits are down one month "will you rule out redundancies if this continues?"..'
p2300
aS'it achieves nothing and serves only to put a cat amongst the pigeons. '
p2301
aS"Companies don't have a democratic mandate though."
p2302
aS"That's a fair point, I suppose - but would you apply that across the board?"
p2303
aS'Is it cheeky to press Miliband on whether he would form a minority government with the support of the SNP?'
p2304
aS'Yep'
p2305
aS'the difference is that the Tory possibilities are known quantities:\n\nTory-Lib dem we have experience of\n\n\nTory-UKIP = referendum on the EU which is already Tory policy.'
p2306
aS'whereas\n\nLabour-SNP = serious possibility of messy chaos, produced by people who are openly hostile to the continued existence of Westminster as it stands, and seek special treatment for one region.\n\n'
p2307
aS'Due to media training, modern politicians have learnt clever ways of avoiding questions whilst making it appear they are answering them, which may go over the heads of some of the viewers.'
p2308
aS"For that reason, repeating a question over and over again is a common technique political interviewers use to expose a politician and I think it's pretty effective."
p2309
aS"[Check out Marr's interview with Osborne last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VbZ_khbkFs) or [the infamous Jeremy Paxman interview with Michael Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KHMO14KuJk)."
p2310
aS'Yeah, he even said something like: "you didn\'t treat your other guests like this"\n\nWhich definitely slowed Marr down a bit.'
p2311
aS'Which is why I quite enjoy Andrew Neil, who seems to employ the same technique for every guest.'
p2312
aS'Andrew Neil is a great interviewer, is well prepared and knows his stuff.'
p2313
aS'Marr is a raving leftie'
p2314
aS'"Andrew Neil is a great interviewer" Said no one ever.'
p2315
aS"Well I did for a start, and there's plenty of people that like him for knowing enough about the topic at hand to not allow politicians to get away with bullshit."
p2316
aS'But he does on a regular basis.'
p2317
aS"I think recently, Andrew Neil has been trying a tad too hard, perhaps in an attempt to fill Paxo's shoes."
p2318
aS'Andrew Neil does try to get answers but I\'ve noticed that sometimes, in his rush to pin an answer down, he interrupts the answer so that instead of a full answer with context, we get half an answer and then a "we\'ve run out of time".'
p2319
aS'Also - Daily Politics Editor - If there is no time to talk about your bloody Daily Politics Mug, then so be it.'
p2320
aS"I'd rather listen to the interviews that watch a fluff segment about the Daily Politics mug. "
p2321
aS'Funnily enough I was thinking earlier that he has become more aggressive since Paxman left.'
p2322
aS"It's great that he's able to do that, and at times it's needed, but other times I do wish he'd give his interviewee just a little more time."
p2323
aS'Although Dimbleby is far worse for this, he drives me crazy.'
p2324
aS'Surely the current PM and would-be next PM should be held to a higher standard than the leaders of minor parties that would have a junior role in any coalition, and most of whose manifesto proposals will never see the light of day again?'
p2325
aS"He's right isn't he?"
p2326
aS"Wasn't it part of his Big Society schtick?"
p2327
aS'I\'ve mentioned this a few times, I honestly think that conservatives are confused because food banks are exactly the kind of thing that fits into "the big society" idea.'
p2328
aS'Or, more accurately, the massive rise in the number of foodbanks in the UK since 2009....'
p2329
aS"I remember some years ago under Blair's government there was a problem with my pay that meant I completely ran out of money with a fortnight until payday."
p2330
aS'What I did was spend the next two weeks eating dry cereal and whatever else was left in the cupboards.'
p2331
aS'At one point I recall making a dough out of flour and water and eating home made plain tortillas for dinner.'
p2332
aS'I literally had pennies to my name and the cupboards were bare.'
p2333
aS'If I had known back then that such a thing as a food bank existed I would almost certainly have used it.'
p2334
aS"As I recall from being in a similar position under Blair's government, what you were *meant* to do was apply for a crisis loan from the social fund, which would cover limited expenses such as food till your issue got sorted."
p2335
aS'These were pretty much done away with under the last administration, switching the burden to organisations like food banks.'
p2336
aS'Apparantly you weren\'t sufficiently informed, but there was infrastructure there to help you, rather than the current "sod it, let\'s hope the charities pick it up" approach.'
p2337
aS'One of the things IDS also did was devolve the crisis payments service to councils but prevented them from being ring fenced.'
p2338
aS'Cue cash starved councils pissing it up the wall in record time. '
p2339
aS'&gt;there was infrastructure there to help you\n\nNot always.'
p2340
aS'They were apparently allowed to refuse you the crisis loan if you had already had one. '
p2341
aS'I was aware of them, the processing time was about a week, then they sent you a cheque which took another week to clear.'
p2342
aS'I elected not to bother.'
p2343
aS"Edit\n\nI have no need to lie, I thought people would find my experience relevant and I'm only repeating what I was told."
p2344
aS"It was 10 years ago mind you so who knows, maybe my memory isn't perfect, anyway, thanks for being pricks about it."
p2345
aS"that's not true on either count."
p2346
aS'You got a gyro which, if you were early enough, you could pick up and cash on the same day.'
p2347
aS'A **crisis** loan would get you cash in two weeks time, is what you are claiming.'
p2348
aS'It would never have taken you more than 2 days (actually far less than that) to get the cash in your hand from a crisis loan.'
p2349
aS'Why have you tried to pretend otherwise?'
p2350
aS"They didn't exist back then for the most part - the main reason why there is such a boom in Food Bank usage is that they are newly setup"
p2351
aS'Home made stuff tastes awesome though.'
p2352
aS'I almost starved to death until I found my local soup kitchens. '
p2353
aS'Cameron has a point.'
p2354
aS'There was a taxi driver in Hull on the local news a few years ago using a foodbank.'
p2355
aS"He had a fulltime job, lived in a council house got over \xc2\xa310,000 in tax credits but was using food banks because he had credit card and loan debts he was paying off which meant he couldn't afford to buy food."
p2356
aS"Had he not known about food banks he'd have done what he should've been doing all along which was buy food first and not pay the credit and loans."
p2357
aS"That cunt did not need to be using foodbanks, they're not meant for people like him."
p2358
aS'They are for people who do not get enough money to buy food no matter how they prioritise their spending, not for people who get sufficient but choose to spend it elsewhere.'
p2359
aS"Wait, he's saying that better advertising had made more food banks open?!"
p2360
aS'Unbelievable...'
p2361
aS"I don't see why Cameron gets the blame for the rise in food banks."
p2362
aS"We just came out of the worst recession since the war and we're still feeling it's impact, well, food shortage has always been a problem during recessions, look at the great depression and rationing during WW2 (of course WW2 had other implications)."
p2363
aS'So, why is he getting blamed?'
p2364
aS"I don't see how any other politician or anybody could have done better, at least he's advertised them to make them known to people, that seems like a good thing to me better than anything."
p2365
aS"It's better than ignoring food banks and letting people scrap along in life, just to avoid bad PR when it comes to food banks."
p2366
aS'The benefit sanctions system was significantly ramped up after the Blair commissioned Freud report concluded the need for it.'
p2367
aS'The Tories saw this report and went further, it is sanctions and delays in social security that has lead to food insecurity.'
p2368
aS'are you being serious right now?'
p2369
aS"you don't see how cameron, the prime minister of one of the richest nations in the world and who has just found billions for various pre election promises, the guy who sits at the top and runs the country shouldnt be held accountable for his people going hungry?\n\n"
p2370
aS"The fact we're one of the richest nations in the world is exactly why we can give food away for free."
p2371
aS'In a poor country these people would be left to starve to death.'
p2372
aS'And no, not always.'
p2373
aS"If there was a drought there is nothing the PM could do to prevent it, so I don't see why that is any different in a recession in the global economy."
p2374
aS"&gt;The fact we're one of the richest nations in the world is exactly why we can give food away for free\n\ncharities give food away for free."
p2375
aS"In a rich country arguably one of the most basic functions of government is to ensure it's citizens have access to the basics needed to live."
p2376
aS'cutting off the ability to buy food is abhorrent.'
p2377
aS'we are lucky charities have stepped in and helped out.'
p2378
aS"&gt;If there was a drought there is nothing the PM could do to prevent it, so I don't see why that is any different in a recession in the global economy."
p2379
aS'a draught is caused by natural circumstances.'
p2380
aS'a recession isnt.'
p2381
aS'Plus you can only argue the PM could not prevent hunger if he is not able to enact law or legislation to counter that which he is more than able to do.'
p2382
aS'It\'s a bit difficult to say "the government couldnt prevent hunger" when they can give away billions to bail out the very people who caused the problem, do nothing to prosecute or punish said people or institutions or indeed now turn round and make promises worth billions just to get back into office.'
p2383
aS"the money is clearly there to help people eat, the will isn't."
p2384
aS'That in any other country would be called aborrhent.'
p2385
aS'But thats the populace paying for it, not the state.'
p2386
aS"There's no food shortage."
p2387
aS"There's a money shortage."
p2388
aS"Things like WW2 rationing was because there literally wasn't enough food in the shop, not because people couldn't afford to buy the massive stacks of food in the shop."
p2389
aS"There isn't even a money shortage, there's more than enough to go round, we're one of the richest countries in the world, we have a distribution problem."
p2390
aS'The austerity measures that targeted the poorest people, the rise in zero hours contracts, the immunity of bankers, which caused the financial crisis who received over trillion pound bailout and billions more in quantitative easing had nothing to do with the rise of food banks in the uk(one of the richest nations in the world) and cameron?'
p2391
aS'Zero hours, bankers, austerity, trillion pound bailout and food banks all in the same sentence.'
p2392
aS'You could get a job at the guardian.'
p2393
aS'No.'
p2394
aS'Most of those things happened when Labour were in power.'
p2395
aS"Austerity is a maybe as that's an opinion rather than fact, and zero hours contracts got unemployed into work so they won't need food banks."
p2396
aS"Labour haven't been in power for 5 years."
p2397
aS'If they can just pull the "But it was Labour" card for everything then what\'s the point in this Tory government?'
p2398
aS"If all they're doing is sitting on their hands and watching the disaster that Labour apparently created unfold then why are they there?"
p2399
aS"The only point I made was that OP's reasons for it being the Conservatives fault were shit."
p2400
aS'Whether it is their fault or not is a different debate.'
p2401
aS"I wonder if we'll see a massive Labour offensive in Scotland over the next few weeks, both to try and claw back seats and to make it look as though they're prepared to stand up to the SNP."
p2402
aS'Yes, they might up their campaign by claiming that a vote for the SNP is actually TWO votes for the Tories. '
p2403
aS'They may try.'
p2404
aS"But everything they've tried so far has backfired. "
p2405
aS"Already started with Kezia Dugdale today saying that they'll make their queens speech to form a Labour government and if the other parties don't support it, they'll be responsible for allowing in a Tory Government."
p2406
aS'Which is basically holding a gun to the electorates head.'
p2407
aS'Absolutely disgusting.'
p2408
aS'Democracy in action people.'
p2409
aS"Wouldn't the Tories then have to put a Queen's speech forward, which would also get voted down?  "
p2410
aS'I think the implication is that it would cause another election and the thinking is that people would vote for different parties.'
p2411
aS"Well if that prospect worries Labour then I'd suggest to them that they get it into their heads that they might be better compromising somewhere.\n\n"
p2412
aS"The only two parties that they could form a coalition with are the tories who they wouldn't ever do, and the SNP who would impose unworkable conditions."
p2413
aS'All labour can really do is form a minority government and try the best they can to govern knowing that at any time a vote of no confidence can be called.'
p2414
aS"The only party in westminster who could hold their heads up high would be labour because they didn't bring down the government."
p2415
aS'Labour have ruled out a coalition with the SNP (not the Tories mind you).'
p2416
aS'Labour can modify policy in order to pass policy with SNP support without a formal coalition.'
p2417
aS'I fail to see how sticking to the policies that put you in a position of putting forward a minority backed policies is anything to be holding your head up about.'
p2418
aS'edit: being an incompetent political party in government also brings a government down. '
p2419
aS'By not forming a coalition, Labour can seek support for individual parties from various sources.'
p2420
aS'Some they can get SNP support, some Lib Dem, and a few will get moderate Tories.'
p2421
aS'Labour can seek support...well, lets hope that they find some, they may have to modify some policies to find any. '
p2422
aS'The SNP have effectively ruled out a coalition in advance by drawing up red lines.'
p2423
aS'Coalition politics in the UK is immature and the more a political party is willing to negotiate the more marketable it is as far as a coalition goes.'
p2424
aS"I appreciate that it does seem to be a barnstorming vote winner to declare all the things you won't do, but that's what I mean about immaturity."
p2425
aS'Imagine you\'re conducting a job interview and you ask the candidate to name a fault and they say "I don\'t work well with idiots".'
p2426
aS"You're not going to be impressed."
p2427
aS'A labour/tory coalition would be suicide for both I expect.'
p2428
aS"If the labour can't form a coalition, or even a less formal agreement with the SNP then they have a duty to try to govern as a minority government."
p2429
aS"It's up to the other parties to decide if the allow that to continue, or not."
p2430
aS'A vote of no confidence brings down the government and there may or may not be blame attached with that.'
p2431
aS"One thing it will do is allow all of the parties the chance to explain what they will and won't do in a coalition and that gives them the opportunity to erase those red lines."
p2432
aS'I think it must be particularly annoying for the SNP if they now face the prospect of possibly a massive, massive, massive landslide in Scotland and the ability to do absolutely nothing with it.'
p2433
aS"In fact if they don't bring down the government they may face a backlash."
p2434
aS'If you think about it reasonably the labour are in a position to offer the SNP the chance to influence policy for the good of Scotland and the rest of the UK.'
p2435
aS"It's up to the SNP to get into a position where they can do that."
p2436
aS'Or not.'
p2437
aS'I said in 2010 that the LibDems had a duty to form a coalition if it was at all possible.'
p2438
aS'The SNP seem to have already made that impossible and that was their doing and nobody elses.'
p2439
aS'Edit : I have only been talking about the SNP.'
p2440
aS"I'm no fan of labour and they've been aggressive, dismissive and inept."
p2441
aS"They've blustered and tried to blag it and convinced nobody in Scotland."
p2442
aS"In England they seem to be doing much better - or perhaps it's just the media persona that the right wing press created about Milliband falling apart."
p2443

p2444
aS'Whereas Labour have ACTUALLY ruled one out.'

aS'&gt; A vote of no confidence brings down the government\n\nIndeed it does.'
p2446
aS'Not backing Labour policy to the hilt when you dont agree with it is not a vote of no confidence though, is it?'

p2448
aS"&gt;If you think about it reasonably the labour are in a position to offer the SNP the chance to influence policy for the good of Scotland and the rest of the UK\n\nWhich is what the SNP are saying aren't they?"

aS'Put forward reasonable policies and you have SNP support,  go full Tory on us, that policy is going nowhere if we they have any say in it.'
p2450
aS'Remember its not the SNP that have ruled out a formal agreement, if that means Labour having to worry about every piece of legislation passing...good. \n\n'
p2451
aS'Ah come off it.'
p2452
aS'By making a red line about trident the SNP ruled it out already.'
p2453
aS'Of course it is. '
p2454
aS'of course you are.'
p2455
aS'Not every comment on here is sarcastic.'
p2456
aS'I knew that. '

p2459
aS'The SNP will have a choice.'

aS'The SNP will have to either passively let labour govern or bring down the government.'
p2463
aS"The LibDems won't be large enough to form a coalition so sadly they will be irrelevant."
p2464
aS'Because it shows that labour would cut off their nose to spite their face.'
p2465
aS"I don't understand."
p2466
aS'What do you want labour to do?'
p2467
aS'Edit : Do you want the labour to make a deal with the SNP?'
p2468
aS"This is the SNP who have already decided that they'll be able to dictate policy to the labour?"

aS"Labour would need to either push cuts through with tory votes, or wrap everything together and say to the SNP that it's this or nothing."
p2483
aS"I don't see where the SNP have much power here."
p2484
aS'It means that the left wing stuff will actually get done.'

p2486
aS'All good news for the SNP. '
p2487
aS"I don't understand this argument."
p2488
aS'If Labour has the most seats it can form a minority government, and if a no-confidence motion ever comes up *dare* the SNP to vote against it.'
p2489
aS"If the SNP really wants to 'keep the Tories out', as many of its supporters believe, then it would be forced to support the Labour government."
p2490
aS'If the SNP opposed the Labour government, and voted in support of the no-confidence motion, many of its voters would feel betrayed and abandon the SNP in the ensuing General Election.'
p2491
aS"So Sturgeon doesn't really 'have Ed by the short and curlies'."
p2492
aS'She has precisely one politically-viable choice, which is to support a Labour government.'
p2493
aS'We do want to keep the Tories out.'
p2494
aS'That we have to support every Labour motion or bill is not true though.'
p2495

p2496
aS'If a no-confidence vote comes up, we not not even vote on it.'
p2497
aS'I dont see us voting against it unless something extreme happens.'
p2498
aS'How popular would the SNP be if a Labour government lost a no-confidence vote, and was replaced by a Tory government in the General Election thus triggered, just because the SNP abstained?'
p2499
aS'If that happened I doubt it will be because of us.'
p2500
aS'We dont want the Tories just as much as the Labour party.'
p2501
aS'I seriously dont think this will happen though, if it does, I cant see it ending well for us.'
p2502
aS'It seems to me that the SNP will be in the unenviable position of either...\n\n* Bringing down a labour government and having a high possibility of causing a tory one\n* Teaming up with their main competitors in Scotland, the labour and backtracking on their no trident thing\n* Sitting back powerless and passive and letting the labour run a minority government and wasting the massive landslide that the SNP look set to achieve\n\n'

aS"Being seen to be uncooperative wouldn't do the SNP any favours."
p2506
aS"A solid chunk of the SNP's support is from historical Labour voters who want it to drag Westminster leftwards."
p2507
aS'That would evaporate if the SNP began to seem like more of a hindrance to a left-wing UK government than a help.'
p2508
aS'That argument only works if Labour shows that it is willing to move to the left, a situation many of those voting SNP would be happy to see but no not believe Labour would do if granted a majority.  '
p2509
aS'Ban on zero-hours contracts, freeze for energy bills, one-year rail-price freeze, reduction in tuition fees, no more non-dom status, new national childcare service, 50p top-rate of income tax, cap for health service profits, increased paternity leave, 200,000 new homes a year by 2020 (sceptical), no more bedroom tax.'

p2511
aS"'Hell yes'."
p2512
aS"Most of it isn't left wing, it's just anti-free market"
p2513
aS'In the UK, that is left wing.'
p2514
aS'not really, left wing would be raising taxes, more public spending, re-nationalisation of certain industries, opposing PFI in the NHS.'
p2515
aS"What Labour is suggesting is interfering in the private market, which isn't the same as creating a stronger state, which is more left wing."
p2516
aS"Left-wing and right-wing aren't one-dimensional."
p2517
aS"There's more than one way to be 'left-wing'."
p2518
aS'In the UK, the right-wing traditionally emphasises trusting the market, and the left-wing emphasises occasional government intervention when it can benefit society.'
p2519
aS"you're right about being the ideologies not being one dimensional."
p2520
aS'My point was that Labour are still far more New Labour than Old Labour, and that they have not returned to the traditional left wing.'
p2521
aS'People forget that Blair introduced a NMW and a windfall tax (and no one is arguing that he was a "leftie"); Miliband\'s Labour is a continuation of this legacy and not a departure to the left wing.'
p2522
aS"Miliband's Labour is significantly more left-wing than Blair's was."
p2523
aS"[This](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/the-making-of-ed-miliband) is an interesting article about the post-2010 rebirth of the Labour party, if you're interested."
p2524
aS"He's not 'Old Labour', but somewhere in between."
p2525
aS"Miliband himself may be more radical than his Party, but I haven't seen any significant policy evidence to suggest that the party as a whole is returning to its traditional values."
p2526
aS"I also don't think Miliband has the clout within his shadow Cabinet to get these more left wing ideas of his through, esp."
p2527
aS'Balls, Reeves and Umunna.'
p2528
aS"I'm confident Labour could count on SNP support for all that. "
p2529
aS'Yes, so am I, which is pretty much my point.'
p2530
aS"That's why I don't quite understand the argument made in the cartoon, which is that Labour will need to make backroom concessions to the SNP every time they want any policies passed."
p2531
aS'There is a big difference between **any** policies and just those in the list you gave. \n\n\n'
p2532
aS'Sure, but those are their manifesto commitments, give or take.'
p2533
aS'As long as those are delivered everything else is a bonus, and Labour can face the electorate with dignity next time around.'
p2534
aS'There is much more to the day to day running of a Government than passing a few manifesto promises. '
p2535
aS"If you subtract from the sum total of everything a government does its manifesto promises, plus its budgets, plus the Queen's speeches, you aren't left with much for the SNP to demand ransom over..."
p2536
aS'Were the situation so simple there would be no need for the Commons at all.'
p2537
aS'Furthermore there are issues which have an inherent Scottish aspect like devolution and certain aspects of Trident.'
p2538
aS'In practice a Government would find it difficult to go against a majority of Scottish MPs on such matters. '
p2539
aS"I hate Andrew Neil's interview technique the more I see of it."
p2540
aS"He starts off with a provocative question - asked more as an interlocutor than an interviewer - which is filled with unarticulated presuppositions about the absurdity of his subject's position, and he then exploits his position as the interviewer to repeat the question over and over as though no answer has been given - even when, as in the case of this interview, his subject has given him a coherent answer with valid appeals to psephological evidence."
p2541
aS'It really is quite scummy.'
p2542
aS"It works very well when the subject is genuinely evasive or ill-prepared - Michael Howard's famous Paxman interview is a good example, as is the Natalie Bennett car crash - but it's just juvenile in all other circumstances."
p2543
aS"Even the Natalie Bennett interview was one where he simply wouldn't accept her answer - she didn't know, she said it in her first answer."

aS'Populism for the sake of populism is bad, in other words when a party announces a policy they know will be popular but ultimately inefficacious/inefficient/counter-productive etc it is bad politics.'
p2583
aS"The term 'populism' carries such connotations."
p2584
aS"The example du jour is the Conservatives' right to buy policy, which allows residents who live in social houses to buy their home at a discount rate after a certain number of years."
p2585
aS'It is a popular policy insofar as a lot of council house tenants like the idea of being able to buy their homes at some point, but ultimately it decreases the stock of social housing and actually increases homelessness.'
p2586
aS"Ultimately pandering to the electorate isn't always the best idea (but of course it wins votes), when in actuality, the unpopular choice is sometimes the right choice."

aS'Personally I shudder any time a Labour politician brings up the fact they voted down intervention in Syria, when you consider the plight of those people having chemical weapons turned upon them and being slaughtered en masse.'
p2595
aS"But in light of the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, it's understandable and the flip side of the coin is I thought it took Cameron real conviction to propose intervention (I plan to vote Labour btw, before it sounds like I'm canvassing)."
p2596
aS'But ultimately policy and public opinion are reciprocal to a large extent - the will of the people has to be obeyed, especially around election time!'
p2597
aS'I think the media has a lot to answer for in that regard - pushing issues like immigration to the fro and manipulating what people think for ultimately negative reasons. '

aS'In my view that extends to roughly the drivers of those lorries.'
p2646
aS"I think the NHS is probably big enough to require its own dedicated freight setup but around that kind of gap from the actual healthcare is where I'd start to allow 'privatisation'. "
p2647

p2648
aS'Or the bed pans?'

p2651
aS"I don't think it's *that* arbitrary."

aS"Its hard to argue needles, syringes, MRI machines aren't all directly related and yet all of those things are and have been provided privately forever."

p2673
aS"I find it a bit weird that you are arguing that logistics is specific to the NHS while drugs, syringes and MRI scanners aren't."
p2674
aS'My point is that privatisation is and always has had a role to play in the NHS and that therefore drawing the line as to how much you have is rather arbitrary.'
p2675
aS'Its far better to assess each product or service needed on a case by case basis in light of the options available to you, both private or public.'

p2700
aS'I think the NHS should be state run, and that free (at the point of use) healthcare is lovely.'
p2701
aS'If NHS were run entirely by private companies but still free at the point of use, would we still think of it as the NHS?'

aS'It would still meet its initial objective; the difference supposedly is only in how the money is paid.'

aS"But I suspect introducing private provision (it's already started, I know) will only make the service more expensive."
p2704
aS'Service providers will want their cut.'
p2705
aS"It's a neat way to make money if you have shares in those companies."
p2706
aS'A profit motive supposedly leads to efficiency, but in practice it usually means lower-costs _and_  a lower-quality service, not a more efficient one.'

p2708
aS'Service providers will want their cut.... A profit motive supposedly leads to efficiency, but in practice it usually means lower-costs and a lower-quality service, not a more efficient one.'
p2709
aS"I suspect the profit motive would mean it wouldn't become more expensive but that service and care provision would deteriorate."
p2710
aS"That said, private care provision does seem to be massively better in terms of service than the NHS but that's arguably because with a free alternative it's the only way to get people to pay for the privilege."
p2711
aS'Still, it does raise the question of whether service levels would go down or up.'
p2712
aS'Yup.'
p2713
aS'Both.'
p2714
aS'Just out of curiosity, do you feel that one is more important than the other?'
p2715

p2716
aS"But I think they're both pretty crucial. "
p2717
aS'Both.'
p2718
aS'As soon as you privatise you begin losing money to share holders etc.'
p2719
aS'Privatisation does have a role in the NHS but it should always be a smallest one. '
p2720
aS'You pay out dividends on profits but this is offset against the business performing more efficiently with a profit motive.'
p2721
aS"I'd prefer to see a system whereby privatisation is enabled wherever it will improve service provision rather than keeping privatisation limited for the sake of it, especially as it could be trialled to ensure it was cost-effective and didn't harm care provision."
p2722
aS'My view is that healthcare free at the point of access should be axiomatic, and I believe that this gets harder to guarantee the more you privatise (with enough services privatised, all it takes is for a single government to have a change in policy and you end up with a two-tier system that is very difficult to reverse).'
p2723
aS'The only hypotheses in favour of privatisation are those suggesting that privatisation leads to higher quality service provision, or that privatisation can lead to the same quality of service provision at reduced cost - and neither has been proven.'
p2724
aS"Indeed, I think the prioritisation of profit over care is a risk, all too readily dismissed by privatisation's proponents."
p2725
aS'Another problem with privatisation is simply that as only the profitable parts get privatised, proponents are essentially arguing in favour of extracting money from the system that -  if public service provision is well managed - could be invested elsewhere.'
p2726
aS"I admit to having an ideological bent against converting public taxes to private profits *unless* there's an incontrovertible reason for doing so."
p2727
aS"My point is simply that in the majority of cases there's absolutely no reason that the NHS can't *potentially* provide those same levels of service as a private company - especially for things like cleaning and estates and building management."
p2728
aS'If it is the case that some services fundamentally cannot be delivered under public ownership as well (by some metric) as they can privately - then my position is that this needs to be comprehensively proven before taking privatisation forward.'
p2729
aS"Even then, in the first instance, I'd certainly be looking at the cost-benefit over the long term of taking that private company into public ownership."
p2730
aS"If there's profit to be made by privatising, it suggests to me that it means that the service can be delivered more cheaply while remaining in public hands, and the profit/saving then becomes available for reinvestment rather than extracted from the system."
p2731
aS'The NHS is monolithic enough that I\'m not convinced there will be many "economies of scale" cases for privatisation as there might be if you were a smaller service provider looking to outsource some operations.'
p2732
aS"If its cheaper to get as business to do the exact same service, I'm all for privatisation as long as it remains free to use."
p2733
aS'Problem I usually have is the privatised service usually is worse, or ends up being more expensive later.'
p2734
aS"But that's a problem of holding the companies to account, noir privatisation in of itself."
p2735
aS'Both.'

aS"By and large we can't make private sector provision of public services work in the UK. "
p2737

p2738
aS"Just because it's free now that doesn't mean that more costs won't be introduced years down the line with increased privatisation."
p2739
aS"Besides, there's no clear evidence private provision is able to effectively tackle the issues the NHS faces."
p2740
aS"There's already a social gradient in this country (found by the Whitehall Study)."
p2741
aS"Do we really want to risk exacerbating that just because we can't find some extra funding for an institution that is regularly ranked as one of the top - if not the top - healthcare providers in the world?\n\n"
p2742
aS"I think we need to seriously think about what we're going to do with our health service."
p2743
aS"With our ageing population and lackluster improvements to productivity within the NHS it's becoming unaffordable for the government to fund on its own."
p2744
aS'I think we need to think of ways to charge people as they use it.'
p2745
aS'For basic things like charging for drugs, basic treatment or a set charge for every time you visit your GP or A&amp;E (nothing ridiculously expensive, of course) this would make people think twice before they visit their GPs or go to A&amp;E. This would be the first step of many that we need to make to make a health service for the 21st century.'
p2746
aS'But, politicians would never say that.'
p2747
aS"Privatisation of the NHS is simply an example of the NHS becoming too expensive for the government, they're having to sell parts of it off."
p2748
aS"&gt; For basic things like charging for drugs, basic treatment or a set charge for every time you visit your GP or A&amp;E (nothing ridiculously expensive, of course) this would make people think twice before they visit their GPs or go to A&amp;E.\n\nThere's two problems in doing that though."
p2749
aS'Firstly its quite often the case that running charging systems for stuff costs just as much to run as it makes.'
p2750
aS"The other and more important though is that if you dissuade people from going to the 'front end' services you end up turning fairly minor and cheap problems to solve into chronic expensive problems to solve."
p2751
aS"In Scotland we've been trialling heading the other direction."
p2752
aS'I know in the Highlands the social care departments of councils have been merged with NHS departments so they can get money/services/treatment to people who need it in their own home before it gets to even the GP stage never mind the hospital bed stage.'
p2753
aS'They also do it on the back end, the same merging of departments lets them get people *out* of hospital quicker by allowing for more treatment to be done at their home.'
p2754
aS"I think it's an interesting take on it as healthcare becomes a bigger issue with an ageing population."
p2755
aS"Rather than building 'tall' and churning through raw demand why not build healthcare wide, integrate it into more of our lives and reduce the raw overall demand."

aS'I have to say, it makes a lot of sense to me but it seems unlikely that the electorate would feel the same. '

aS"Then they have swallowed the blue pill completely and  believe the guff they've been fed."

aS'Nobody batted an eyelid and it passed with little comment.'
p3451
aS'So what is the current inflation rate after \xc2\xa3350 billion of quantitative easing?'
p3452
aS'It hardly set the economy on fire.'
p3453
aS'I am not proposing those sort of quantities either.'
p3454
aS'Simply the amounts that would keep the health service, essential services and benefits from having to take further cuts which the nation, and particularly those disadvantaged can ill afford.'

p3459
aS'Aside from food price wars, 0% inflation is largely attributable to the recent oil price collapse.'
p3460
aS"Oil prices will eventually stabilise; at what level is anyone's guess, but in my view this will almost certainly higher than they are now."
p3461
aS"The effective tax cut for consumers as a result of the oil shock should be very welcome in a time of stagnant wage growth and help stimulate consumer spending, contrary to the view that deflation (though we're not quite there yet) delays spending."
p3462
aS"We've already seen these effects in the most recent data: consumer confidence, consumer spending, retail sales, and disposable income are all increasing."
p3463
aS"Given the sizeable contribution consumer spending has to developed economies' GDP, we should see relatively higher growth in output for the UK (and the world)."
p3464
aS'Yeah, I agree that the current levels of inflation are largely as a result of the oil shock and that the resulting extra consumer spending should come as a boon to the UK economy.'
p3465
aS'There is, however, still an increased incentive to save and an additional real cost on lending.'
p3466
aS"I don't think these factors outweigh the positives but they are likely to slow down any growth."
p3467
aS'The market also agrees with you, in that implied inflation looks to be around target in the next 2-5 years (ie disinflation is expected to be temporary).'
p3468
aS'I would say the cost of lending is only very temporary.'
p3469
aS'More generally with rates so low - below GDP growth and (hopefully soon) inflation, borrowing will be heavily subsidised.'
p3470

p3472
aS"They didn't pull that out of thin air."
p3473
aS'We had to borrow that money.'
p3474
aS'Hence the large increase in National debt alongside the loss of tax receipts from the recession. '

aS"Okay, but let's think about what happens when you have a Monetary Increase using the IS LM FE model assuming we are in equilibrium."
p3479
aS'First it will shift the LM curve out, lowering real interest rate, which will increase Aggregate demand for goods.'
p3480
aS'Firms will then produce extra output beyond Full Employment.'
p3481
aS'because we will be producing beyond FE the firms will raise prices, restoring equilibrium but raising the price level.'
p3482
aS'Most likely this would not be great for the poor.'
p3483
aS"That doesn't hold true when interest rates are at zero and there's still an output gap - see [the second graph in this column](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/is-lmentary/)."
p3484
aS"The whole problem is that the economy is (was in 2009) not at full employment, otherwise we wouldn't be bothering with monetary stimulus."

p3494
aS'Except were not at full employment and interest rates are at a record low, so not really seeing your point even if you did have more than a theoretic model to base your opinion on. '
p3495
aS'you are surprisingly close to full employment at 5.5% unemployed, because you have to make room for frictional unemployment.'
p3496
aS'And yes, I am using a theoretical model but if you just want to go back to just random attempts with no actual reasoning behind it to fix the economy, you go for that man.'
p3497
aS'The only down side of this is that inflation goes up.'

aS'However, this is something that should definitely be happening at the moment as inflation is so low.'

p3501
aS"I know the it's a rhetorical statement, but to answer it accurately, you can have all those things if you have more people in employment."
p3502
aS'Meaningful employment though.'
p3503
aS"Most people's frustrations are that most of the employment gained in the past few years is in low paid work; which has meant a rise in GDP due to cheap labour."

p3915
aS"I did, all it says about his inconsistency is that he says that he wouldn't ban alcohol because it'd be impossible, which is correct, but in an ideal situation he would."
p3916
aS"Then it simply goes on to say 'would he ban horse-riding' which misses Hitchens' point about mental health effects of drugs and how the taking of drugs can cause direct harm to others because it makes people do things that they otherwise wouldn't."
p3917
aS'Then it just goes on to call him names.'
p3918

aS"Of course, it wouldn't do anything to stop people using alcohol, and would cause far more problems than it could ever possibly solve but so?"
p3926
aS"He is an advocate for drug prohibition, which doesn't stop people from using drugs and causes more problems than it could ever possibly solve."
p3927
aS"Just because banning alcohol would be as disastrous as banning other drugs he wouldn't do it yet he'd continue to be in favour of the current prohibition?"
p3928
aS"That's a bit odd in my opinion, and not very consistent at all."
p3929
aS"Although, to be fair, that maybe isn't him being inconsistent just him being incredibly ill-informed / just plain wrong."

aS'He denies that withdrawal from alcohol is a serious medical problem.'
p3953
aS'He likens it to a hangover, rather than something that can actually kill you.'
p3954
aS'&gt; It is also interesting to see how much of the literature surrounding alcohol \xe2\x80\x98withdrawal\xe2\x80\x99 involves the prescription of drugs (including worrying substances such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines,\n\nBenzodiazepins are prescribed for alcohol withdrawal precisely because alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures that will kill you.'
p3955
aS"PH thinks it is worrying that drugs are prescribed to stop people dying from alcohol withdrawal because he doesn't appear to believe in it, despite the clear and undisputed medical evidence."

aS'If your body is physically dependent on alcohol then you are an alcoholic.'

p3961
aS"If he was talking about cocaine addiction or even tobacco addiction he might have a point (or at least a valid argument) but he isn't."
p3962
aS'He is talking about a drug that definitely is physically addictive, that you definitely can become dependent on, and that can kill you if you were just to stop cold turkey while being physically dependent.'
p3963
aS'You will not find a single sane medical professional who denies that alcohol can cause physical dependence.'
p3964
aS"I struggle to believe that PH doesn't know this."

aS'You know you can E-mail him these points?'
p3967
aS'He often replies.'
p3968
aS"I might do actually, because I've got him snookered on the alcohol dependency thing."
p3969
aS'The rest I guess is open for debate but that particular point absolutely is not.'
p3970

aS"1 - The moral argument that just simply taking drugs at all is inherently bad and 2 - If it wasn't for the illegality everyone would be lying on the couch smacked up to the eyeballs."
p3990
aS"It is worth arguing those two points with someone who hasn't really thought about it and is just repeating some ill-informed guff that they've picked up somewhere."
p3991
aS"The difference is he's standing up in front of a room full of people saying this."
p3992
aS"He's thought about, he means what he's saying and he's convinced that he's correct."
p3993
aS"There's no point even listening to anything else he has to say because I completely disagree with those two fundamental points that are the basis for his whole opinion on this subject."

p4000

p4021
aS'Ok. A sensible drug user takes precautions to make it as safe as possible, they undertake training of sorts (by learning about the possible dangers of what they are intending to take and how to minimise them) and they learn how to do it well.'

aS"If I had been rock climbing as regularly for as many years I don't know if I could say the same."

p4035
aS'That is a bare faced lie.'
p4036
aS'I realise that he doesn\'t mean officially, he\'ll be claiming that it\'s just that we\'re so "soft on drugs" (actually he didn\'t even go on to say that, he made it sound as though drugs are actually decriminalised in the UK) but he must know he is talking utter mince.'
p4037
aS"If he doesn't then he really doesn't know anything and shouldn't be on that stage."
p4038
aS'His arguments are often disingenuous.'
p4039
aS"He responds to the cop saying the illegality of drugs isn't helping society but stating that the government probably haven't seriously enforced the laws against cannabis in 30 years (quite possibly true) so drugs (now he's talking all drugs, not just cannabis) aren't really illegal, the deterrence isn't really there, but the cop is clearly not talking specifically cannabis (he's obviously talking hard drugs) at any point."

p4052
aS"Worrying because I can see that if you don't know otherwise you might have no reason to question what he is saying."
p4053
aS'No reason to look into a couple of his statements, or analyse them a little bit, and realise that he is utterly dishonest.'
p4054
aS"It started off as just me and him being at opposite ends of a moral argument to realising that he can't even truly believe that he's correct or he wouldn't be so dishonest in his arguments."

p4416

aS'But there actual impact is relatively small and if its anything like Irish Travellers in the 80s-90s they will slowly disappear.'

p4432
aS"&gt; why are we so desperate to import beggars when people like the above posters' wife is left out just because she's Indian?"
p4433
aS'We are not, the roma beggars are a cost that comes with free movement, just like to stop beggars from India it comes with the cost of people who may be restricted that may meet the requirements.'

aS'The EU free movement shows through its economics benefit that it has been a huge success.'

aS'And support a system of making sure those pay into the system who take out (even though EU migrants tend to pay into the system).'

p4550
aS"They're going to need housing, access to medical services, schools."
p4551
aS'Here in the UK we need to build a city the size of Nottingham every single year to cope with the net migration.'
p4552
aS"And that doesn't just mean houses but it means shops, schools, GP surgeries, dentists, hospitals etc etc etc."
p4553
aS'They use gas and electricity so we need to increase capacity to supply that.'
p4554
aS"Yes they may pay more in than they take out but that isn't going to cover the initial cost of \xc2\xa3billions a year that needs to be spent to provide these services."
p4555
aS"And because of how cover budgeting for infrastructure is planned in this country, based on the 10 year census, we've not been building a city every year and the impact is being felt already in increased waiting times at GP surgeries, the inability for people to find places at school for their kids."
p4556
aS'There is nothing of substance in what she said to address.'
p4557
aS'Basically all she said was "muh immigrants are good, vote for me, look at how morally superior I am".'
p4558
aS"Ok, let's adress what she's saying: which boils down to 'immigrants good, UKIP bad' She makes no substantive points at all beyond saying the equivalent of 'there aren't too many people on this boat, the boat just hasn't been built big enough', which does little to address that it's still sinking."

p4560
aS"She's not used to people demanding substance to what she's saying."

p4991
aS'If you pay close attention to Sturgeon, Salmond, and SNP literature and rhetoric generally, you\'ll notice that "English" very rarely appears in their language, and never appears in a negative context (English usually appears in the semi-Martian usage they have when speaking to English people directly "We come to you in peace as friends".'

p5112
aS'The point is that "chink" is already a loaded term with a *racial* basis, by going out and telling people that jock is offensive and that it should be challenged etc you are trying to elevate it to that point.'

aS'If someone says "the SNP openly hate the English", then when asked for evidence comes up with nothing but "they have a secret code", I tend to think they\'re a bit challenged.'

aS'I said "I think the SNP quite openly hates the English, but they have to be careful in how they express it".'
p5385
aS'Providing evidence of the SNP hating the English and providing a theory proposing how they avoid scrutiny on this might be a bit of an challenge for the average Scottish nationalist to take in, to be fair.'

aS"I'm not the one making any claims."
p5390
aS"I already pointed out that you haven't actually proven that there's *been* any significant rise in anti-English sentiment so how about we start there?"

aS'The closest it could be called is xenophobia.'
p5433
aS"I'm not saying it's right but it certainly isn't racism."
p5434
aS"OK, you're technically correct, but racism is commonly used as a blanket term to mean discrimination against religion, race, nationality, and others."
p5435
aS'Yes, wrongly.'
p5436
aS"It's why we are seeing racism used as an excuse to stifle debate in many instances."
p5437
aS"I don't agree with everything Ukip say for instance, but nothing they have said officially is racist and branding it so only alienates a group who feel their voices are not being listened to. "

p5450
aS'Look at the anti-SNP comments in this thread, almost none are positive at the moment.'
p5451
aS'Why are you adopting such a victim complex?\n'
p5452
aS"With the SNP, it generally isn't just the party they're criticising, it's Scotland as a whole."
p5453
aS'See the Daily Mail article today, and there was a Telegraph one a few months ago.'
p5454
aS'Also there were those cartoons in the Sun.'
p5455
aS"They're basically using Scottish stereotypes to attack the SNP, so sometimes it is kind of insulting. "
p5456
aS"I assume the UKIP figure is high because criticisms of the party usually take the form 'UKIP is a party of racists and only idiots vote for them'."
p5457
aS'Yeah.'
p5458
aS'It could be that people supporting some parties are touchier than others, or that criticisms of some parties are more personal than others, or both.'
p5459
aS'I reckon, people who support other parties don\'t often get forced to explain themselves as much as Kippers do, and like you say add in all the "you must be racist if you support UKIP" and so it becomes a personal attack, so of course they end up defending UKIP because it means they have to defend themselves.'
p5460
aS"It's almost a meta-joke that anyone who has said anything against the SNP in this thread is heavily downvoted. "
p5461
aS'You know its probably just Scottish passion, thirty years ago the labour column would prbably be the same height as SNP is now.'
p5462
aS'Maybe because SNP, UKIP and Green are all parties which represent a more specific world view?'
p5463
aS'As in people are more likely to see themselves reflected in these parties than the centrist LibLabCon, who borrow policies from one another on the daily and struggle to maintain independent political narratives.'
p5464
aS'Perhaps this proves how populist the marginal parties are.'
p5465
aS'Perhaps it proves how out of touch the centrist position has become.'
p5466
aS'Perhaps this graph is just more /r/ukpolitics clickbait.'
p5467
aS"I think it could be the way in which more 'radical' parties are criticized overall."
p5468
aS'Because the Tories and Labour are never criticised ever.'
p5469
aS"That's not true either, the Tories and Labour do get criticized, they are the two largest parties after all."
p5470
aS'You fucking idiot.'
p5471
aS"Because I addressed your pointless snarky comment in a way you didn't like?"
p5472
aS'Stay mad.'
p5473
aS'ITT: SNP voters taking attacks on their party like personal insults.'
p5474
aS"Essence of Nationalism I'm afraid, as for the Greens, they'd get offended either way."
p5475
aS'Probably more to do with the context of attacks than the perception.'
p5476
aS'Attacks on the SNP tend to actually be attacks on Scotland too.'
p5477
aS"For example, just today the Daily Mail published an article entitled: **Scotland has lost its marbles - and we'll ALL pay the price**\n\nAttacks on the SNP also tend to come with a stereotypical and lazy imagery."
p5478
aS'For example, Nicola Sturgeon sitting on a wrecking ball wearing a tartan bra in The Sun.'
p5479
aS'So, when the SNP is criticised, it actually tends to be a collective personal insult too!'
p5480
aS'&gt;Attacks on the SNP tend to actually be attacks on Scotland too.'
p5481
aS'This is a myth common to all nationalist parties, - that they are the political embodiment of the nation and that therefore, criticism of them is either criticism of the nation or treason.'
p5482
aS"When people attack the SNP using stereotypical embodiments of that nation, then it's not just an attack on the SNP."
p5483
aS'And you feel qualified to speak on behalf of that entire nation... how?'
p5484
aS'Through your membership and support of the SNP?'
p5485
aS"Then you've proven my point."
p5486
aS'If you\'re not speaking on behalf of the entire nation, how on Earth can you then say "it\'s not just an attack on the SNP"?\n'
p5487
aS"Probably because the article he quoted had 'Scotland' in the title instead of 'SNP Supporters'?"
p5488
aS'I feel a little embarrassed pointing this out to you, but "*SNP supporters have lost their marbles*" is not news.'
p5489
aS'That the SNP has lots of support in Scotland *is* news, and everyone who can read English and who does not have an agenda in nursing a grievance understands from that headline that it does not mean every single Scot in Scotland has lost his or her marbles.'
p5490
aS'If you\'re still struggling - is it still "attacks on Scotland" when Scottish writers such as Deerin [employ the same usage](http://www.capx.co/scotland-has-gone-mad/) of "Scotland" to mean "Scottish politics" - or is it treason?'
p5491
aS'Just pointing out his initial premise is clearly accurate unless you apply some form of condition to the statement yourself as the reader.'
p5492
aS'Essence of Nationalism, except Plaid is behind Labour, the Greens, UKIP, and more or less tied with the Tories.'
p5493
aS"Plaid don't have anywhere near as strong a nationalist voice as UKIP or the SNP though."
p5494
aS"UKIP's leader wants the Barnett formula to be revisited and have a view on immigration more in line with the greens."
p5495
aS"The SNP's views were made pretty clear in the run up to the referendum."
p5496
aS'I think this is probably correct; the SNP has come to be seen as a one-issue party both inside the organisation and out (unfortunately), and therefore any attack on the party attacks a personal belief in independence.'
p5497
aS'Eh?'
p5498
aS"The people inside the SNP think they're also a one-issue party?"
p5499
aS'You realise they have been running the Scottish Government for 8 years?'
p5500
aS'They have a lot more than one issue.'
p5501
aS"I can see why you'd say others see them as a one-issue party, but the SNP themselves know better."
p5502
aS"You're right, I phrased that poorly: what I mean is that presumably when an SNP member is criticised by someone outside the party, the criticism is implicitly of Scottish independence (as the flagship SNP issue)."
p5503
aS"Members therefore defend their allegiance with a primary focus on independence (despite the SNP's admirable broad policy goals/achievements)."
p5504
aS'But I may well be wrong!'
p5505
aS'Fair play, I can see why members of the SNP take insults a lot more personally, but I also think the SNP are attacks a lot more often and more vigorously than other parties.'
p5506
aS"The press are so against the SNP in Scotland and we've just came out of a 2 year period where the SNP were being constantly criticised and attacked in the press."
p5507
aS"I think it'll calm down a bit eventually."
p5508
aS'Not surprising that a national party is the one that gets the most offended, nationalism is so dangerous.'
p5509
aS'I support Tory and not once have I ever got upset at somebody criticism, why would I?'
p5510
aS'Criticism is valuable, and I tend to criticize them myself anyway.'
p5511
aS'Just goes to show that the SNP is kind of like a quasi-religious cult for many of its supporters.'
p5512
aS"I've certainly experienced this in the /r/Scotland sub."
p5513
aS'If I criticise the SNP then they take it personally and have a go at me personally. '
p5514
aS'Be fair Halk - you were never one to shy away from personal abuse in /r/scotland.'
p5515
aS'Instigated it more often than not, as I recall.'
p5516
aS'Swearing is frankly irrelevant.\n\n'
p5517
aS"...I didn't say anything about swearing."
p5518
aS'R/scotland may as well be r/snap.'
p5519
aS'Look at what they did for April fools...'
p5520
aS"The Scottish having a victim complex isnt really news to me, but it's good to see the data."
p5521
aS'Not every Scottish person is a member of the SNP.'
p5522
aS"However, perhaps it's such wild sweeping statements of ignorance and condescension that lead to such results."
p5523
aS'So I kinda fibbed the stats in the title \xe2\x80\xa6 390 of them have passed.'
p5524
aS'But that\xe2\x80\x99s still over 400 hustings events in the next few weeks!'
p5525
aS'You should get out to them and make sure your candidates don\xe2\x80\x99t get away with this kind of nonsense :-P\n\nSeriously, we are an open site listings independent hustings events around the country.'
p5526
aS'We want to encourage voters to get out and question their candidates before making up their mind.'
p5527
aS'We are cited by people like Citizens Advice Bureau, MIND for better mental health, The Campaign against the Arms trade, MacMillian Cancer Support, Concern, Democratic Dashboard and The Power Of The Cross.'
p5528
aS'We have served over 100,000 pageviews to people wanting to meet their candidates at events, with support from prominent politicians in several different parties.'
p5529
aS'Anyone can make an account and add events - pls help others and add any you know about that aren\xe2\x80\x99t listed!'
p5530
aS'Any questions, comments on good/bad hustings you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to, or thoughts on how they should be run, just ask here \xe2\x80\xa6.'
p5531
aS'None in my area.'
p5532
aS'Damn safe seats!'
p5533
aS"You could tell all the other candidates that Commision guidelines only cover *inviting* candidates, they don't have to accept ... so the rest could have a hustings and empty chair the sitting MP :-)"
p5534
aS"I'm in a marginal and there's none in my area so far."
p5535
aS"Now that's strange."
p5536
aS"What's your seat, if you don't mind me asking?"
p5537
aS"I haven't looked beyond the website you linked though, so I could be wrong."
p5538
aS'If you do find any in your seat, please add them to the site for others!'
p5539
aS"http://meetyournextmp.com/event/new It's quite hard to find details of some hustings which are only advertised in a few places and this is something we are trying to change."
p5540
aS'It should be easy to find local events to go to.'
p5541
aS"I don't know how the country is meant to have a referendum on something our own goverment doesn't think we should have the facts about it."
p5542
aS'Does not surprise me, the Conservatives and UKIP will do nothing but hide the truth from the British people so they will blindly make choice to leave the EU.'
p5543
aS'They know Nationalism cannot stand up the real economic arguments of the benefits of the EU so they either hide information or create myths.'
p5544
aS'The reason they want to rush the referendum as soon as possible is because if allow a real debate to happen people will see through the myths and vote overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. '
p5545
aS"Accusing people of trying to hide the truth when your own party leader blatantly lied to the electorate in the EU debate with Farage saying that an EU army was a 'dangerous fantasy'?"
p5546
aS'Tsk tsk.'
p5547
aS'Farage went head to head with Clegg on the issue of the EU and annihilated him twice.'
p5548
aS"It wasn't even close."
p5549
aS'Even a third of Lib Dem supporters thought Farage won.'
p5550

p5553
aS"That's what they say about you as well. "
p5554
aS"&gt; blatantly lied to the electorate in the EU debate with Farage saying that an EU army was a 'dangerous fantasy'?"
p5555
aS'Tsk tsk.'
p5556
aS'Because there is no real plan to have a EU army.'
p5557
aS'Its been a idea bashed around, but that is it, no one has put forward any real proposal.'
p5558
aS'Ukip should understand that with the whole Farage health insurance scheme, its a idea that he had not policy.'

aS"It wasn't even close."
p5561
aS'Even a third of Lib Dem supporters thought Farage won.'
p5562
aS'Source?'
p5563
aS'On the Lib Dem supporters.'
p5564
aS'Also Clegg is toxic, but since that debate we have seen sources that EU support is at its highest since 1992.'
p5565
aS'&gt; he out crowd have the stronger arguments; the in crowd have to lie and make their arguments up, \n\nOh like how if we leave the EU we can have a FTA with EU, which the EU saids is unlikely, and how we have no say, yet I posted up the other day how you can directly get in contact with the EC.'
p5566
aS'The Economic arguments are real.'
p5567
aS'Its the out who make up a fantasy just like the SNP did with there independence campaign.'
p5568
aS'&gt; like the 3million jobs argument that even the person who made the claim in the first place came out and said he was wrong.'
p5569
aS'It may not be as high as 3 million, but jobs will be lost and business will be lost, this is what this cover up is trying to hide.'
p5570
aS'The fact that a UK out of the EU would be come weaker to attract business. '
p5571
aS"I really don't understand how the out crowd have the stronger arguments."
p5572
aS'They seem the more short-sighted arguments but certainly not stronger.'
p5573
aS'Whilst no one knows for certain what would happen if we left the EU, it seems more likely than not that we would be worse off (and likely particularly worse off initially).'
p5574
aS'I keep hearing Norway, Iceland and Switzerland being examples of "the better option" but this argument seems to forget that these countries all follow a large set of EU legislation without having any say.'
p5575
aS'So what actually is the winning argument for being out?'
p5576
aS"Anyone pro european who even utters the words '3 million jobs' loses any credibility as a rational person who wants a truthful debate."
p5577
aS"If we have the referendum and Cameron every says those words he'll be an awful person in my mind.  "
p5578
aS"&gt;They know Nationalism cannot stand up the real economic arguments of the benefits of the EU\n\nLol, you're quite right that nationalism can't stand up to the economic arguments."
p5579
aS"European nationalism can't stand up the economic argument that we're better off out."
p5580
aS'Just ask Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.'
p5581
aS'Or alternatively ask Greece, Spain and Italy.'
p5582
aS'Only a blind european nationalist would deny reality.  '
p5583
aS"&gt;  you're quite right that nationalism can't stand up to the economic arguments."
p5584
aS'Ok So you agree.'
p5585
aS'&gt; European nationalism \n\nThere is no such thing, the EU is not constructed in a nation state way.'
p5586
aS'The EU is a Union of nation states.'
p5587
aS"&gt;  an't stand up the economic argument that we're better off out."
p5588
aS"and at what point are we better when we can't attract business and companies here decide to leave, and people become unemployed?"
p5589
aS'&gt; Just ask Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.'
p5590
aS'Norway - Oil Rich Dubai style country \n\nSwitzerland -de-regulated banks, follows Schengen and many EU laws despite having no say on them\n\nIceland- Small economy based around fishing in a constitutional crises.'
p5591
aS'&gt; Or alternatively ask Greece, Spain and Italy.'
p5592
aS'Or why not, Lithuania who just got status as a modern developed nation, Estonia whos economy is growing, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Slovenia, Croatia  etc.'
p5593
aS'Countries that are doing very well in the EU. \n\n\n'
p5594
aS"You do realise that Norway and Iceland have to abide by a large set off EU regulations, which they have no say on, don't you?"
p5595
aS'They also still have free movement of people, whilst making contributions to the EU each year...\n\nAlso, Switzerland set most of their legislation in line with the EU, so that they can better maintain their free trade agreement.'
p5596
aS'However, this agreement does not cover financial services.'
p5597
aS"Given our largest export by far is financial services, it's unlikely we'd agree to such a deal."
p5598
aS"It's also unlikely that the EU would agree to another Swiss-style agreement anyway, as it's largely been seen as an irritation."
p5599
aS'In 2009 the Swiss government even said that not being in the EU put them at a disadvantage and that it had cost jobs and tax generation.'
p5600
aS'Yeah.'
p5601
aS'Because the Tory leadership is *so* anti EU'
p5602
aS'&gt; The 200 people in the room were overwhelmingly anti-Ukip.'
p5603
aS'The electorate are overwhelmingly anti-Ukip.'
p5604
aS'The more and more he bangs on about this the less and less I respect him.'
p5605
aS"Though admittedly I'm not the type of person he's trying to convince to vote for him."
p5606
aS'Not necessarilly, if they hold 12-15% of the vote.'
p5607
aS"That's still around 9/10 people who disagree with them and won't vote for them."
p5608
aS'Farage is just childish trying to make this a thing.'
p5609
aS"That isn't entirely true."
p5610
aS"I don't believe that voting for one party means you actively disagree with the others."
p5611
aS"It usually doesn't but if I remember right UKIP do top the polls for that kind of active dislike."
p5612
aS"Of course, I probably wont vote for Tory now after they've announced some more of their policies but I don't actively disagree with them."
p5613
aS'But I still would roll my eyes and think Cameron was a prick if he started mouthing off about some conspiracy by the BBC to be bias against him because he lost the crowd in a debate.'
p5614
aS"It just makes Farage come across as a cry-baby, who moans about bias or conspiracy every time something doesn't go his way."
p5615
aS"The only way to have an equal representation in a debate like that would have been to have an equal representation of each political party, whilst having an equal spread of parties across the left/right spectrum - which just wasn't going to be possible."
p5616
aS"As with Farage's outburst, I think it may have been calculated."
p5617

aS'If labour and the SNP join up then labour votes will drop significantly and will probably result in a tory victory'
p5635
aS'So do you think Labour, depending on the arithmetic, may be more receptive to the idea after the election?'
p5636
aS'If the arithmetic works out, a deal will absolutely be struck.'
p5637
aS'There can be no doubt about it.'
p5638
aS"It'll be looser than a formal coalition, but Labour would take the reigns in a minority administration."
p5639
aS"It's well within the SNPs interests for Labour to say they'll work with them, because that will leave voters certain that they can vote SNP and end up with no Tories."
p5640
aS"It's well within Labour's interests for Labour to not say that they'll work with the SNP because they are competing against them for 50 odd seats and the only way for them to get votes back from the SNP is to make it seem like voting SNP could result in a Tory government."
p5641
aS'Come the result of the election, if it is a hung parliament (which seems relatively likely) then Labour will do whatever they can to get power (including working with the SNP), no matter what they said in the lead up to the election.'
p5642
aS"I think that's a perfect summary."
p5643
aS"There's no advantage to Labour admitting they'll work with the SNP in advance of the election, anywhere in the UK."
p5644
aS'In Scotland it gives people a reason not to vote Labour, elsewhere, it might give people a reason to vote Tory. '
p5645
aS'True, although much more conciliatory noises coming from Angela Eagle on the news this evening.'
p5646
aS"I think Labour are starting to think that as unpopular as working with the SNP might be it'll be worse for them if they appear to do an about turn on it immediately after the election. "
p5647
aS'If Scotland returns SNP MPs in anything like the number the polls are suggesting Labour ignoring that fact and refusing to work with them would be totally counter productive.'
p5648
aS'It would make Westminster and Labour look even more remote and disinterested in Scotland and likely just cement SNP dominance.  '
p5649
aS"The key difference being that Labour has a responsibility to the entire British electorate whereas the SNP can't lose a single vote outside of Scotland."
p5650
aS'People in England are rightly concerned that the SNP will use their kingmaker position to barter a deal that disproportionately favours Scotland.'
p5651
aS"That's a fair point I guess but if the Union makes inherent political sense then surely there is a sizeable overlap between Scottish and English interests?"
p5652
aS"I really don't see how treating the SNP as pariahs helps the Unionist cause given that it alienates what looks likely to be a large section of the Scottish electorate. "
p5653
aS'England is 90% of the population of the UK.'
p5654
aS"A lot of people do not want what happens to 56 million decided by a party representing just 1/10th of that therefore Labour saying they'd cosy up to the SNP before the election would damage them massively in England."
p5655
aS'I wonder whether if the LDs will hit 10% by election day. '
p5656
aS"They've not made any 'loud' election pledges this time round compared to 2010."
p5657
aS'Is that not very nearly a Conservative majority?'
p5658
aS"2010 tories got 36.1% so it's not really that close."
p5659
aS'Tories probably need nearer 38% to get a majority, whereas Labour can do it probably with 35%.'
p5660
aS'The Tories actually got 36.9% in the context of polling.'
p5661
aS'Many sources will give the UK share of the vote, but all opinion polling is GB only (i.e.'
p5662
aS'no Northern Ireland).'
p5663
aS"So for a like-for-like comparison, you need to make sure it's the GB vote shares:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2010_United_Kingdom_general_election#2010\n\nDepending on how other parties do (Lib Dems, UKIP) the Tories need a 7-10% lead."
p5664
aS"In 2005 Labour got a majority with 36.2%, but now with the Scotland factor they'd probably need more."
p5665
aS'Why would they not need the same percentage to get a majority?'
p5666
aS'Unless you mean numbers to form a minority government?'
p5667
aS'They need different percentages due to the distribution of votes - Labour have more votes in smaller (in electorate terms) city seats, and win more seats with smaller majorities; Tories win larger rural seats, and with some vast majorities too -&gt; wasted Tory votes.'
p5668
aS"Interestingly, while that is completely true it isn't actually the only reason for the discrepancy."
p5669
aS'This article sums it up well enough: http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/labours-electoral-advantage-isnt-mainly-due-boundaries\n\nLong story short-  \n0: Boundaries/seat population (what you said)  \n1: Turnout in Labour seats is on average lower than in Tory ones  \n2: Labour get fewer "wasted votes" under FPTP (by winning more narrow victories and less landslide safe seats)  \n3: Anti-Tory tactical voting\n'
p5670
aS'Basically there is a fairly significant bias in the electoral system for Labour, most labour constituencies are smaller in population than the tory seats, so that means that it takes fewer votes as a proportion of the electorate to elect a Labour MP than a tory one, which means they can get to a majority with a smaller proportion of the vote.'
p5671
aS'Remember that we have a constituency-based system, not a national proportional system.'
p5672
aS"That's why UKIP will likely only get 3-4 MPs max and the SNP will get lots seats due to their concentrated voters."
p5673
aS"Like SNP, Labour tends to have strongholds (London, the North, Scotland until this year) and thus doesn't need as big of a uniform national swing to get a majority, whereas the Tories tend to have less concentrated votes and thus need a bigger swing to get a majority."
p5674
aS'If that sounds undemocratic, you might be a LibDem...'
p5675
aS'2 hours later another poll says labour lead\n\nLatest YouGov poll (17 - 18 Apr):\nLAB - 36% (+2)\nCON - 33% (-1)\nUKIP - 13% (-1)\nLDEM - 9% (-1)\nGRN - 5% (-)\n\nAlmost as if you shouldnt take just one poll as face value for the state of the election'
p5676
aS'Do nation level polls really matter though?'
p5677
aS'UKIPs been solidly polling above 10%, yet they wont get ~65 seats.'
p5678

p5869
aS"The difference is, as I'm sure you would want me to point out, that back then the economy was booming whereas now it's kind of flopping around limply."
p5870
aS'Even so, to call our deficit crippling is not true either.'
p5871
aS'If we look back to the price shocks of the early to mid seventies [when things got so bad we had to be bailed out by the IMF we can see that the deficit was below the level that it is now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt#/media/File:UK_National_Debt.svg), so the correlation between deficit and health of the economy is as ~~as loose as your Mum~~ not very strong at all.'

p5875
aS"If you observe the [first graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt#/media/File:UK_GDP.png) you'll see that our current deficit isn't particularly high."
p5876
aS'1822 is when it was at its peak.'
p5877
aS"So 1822 doesn't have any specific relation to our current situation it's just one of two data points I have picked to demonstrate the correlation or lack thereof between national deficit and the general health of the economy."
p5878
aS"You can't in any way compare the economies of 1822 and 2015 though, it's a meaningless comparison. "
p5879
aS'When do comparisons start being meaningful?'
p5880
aS'*soon*.'
p5881
aS"Look this isn't like I am comparing two different civilisations thousands of years apart here, my second data point is from the 1970's."

aS"Are they balls like old labour, they're more like the angry drunk in the back of a pub."
p5887
aS"Many mining towns [edit: near to my hometown] were particularly racist, mind you- oddly so, the well unionised industrial town I grew up in was pretty ok with foriegners, but the local mining towns you wouldn't see a foriegner outside the Chinese."

p5895
aS"I'm not necessarily saying all inhabitants of mining towns were racist, but that there were more stronger racists in such places."
p5896
aS"To be honest, the miners weren't really well thought of if they came into town, generally they were expected to get drunk and violent."
p5897
aS'&gt;You have no idea what you are talking about.'
p5898
aS'Yeah, i kinda do, I grew up in an industrial town neighbouring mining towns, and now i live in an ex-mining town.'
p5899
aS'Mate my dad and all the other ex miners are some of the nicest and most tolerant people you will ever meet.'
p5900
aS"OK so they read the sun and can't spell that well, doesn't mean they are bad people."
p5901
aS"I'm only speaking for the area i was brought up in, it might have been better elsewhere, but the mining bits are still pretty rough these days."
p5902
aS'Maybe just a local thing, I guess.'
p5903
aS"&gt;OK so they read the sun and can't spell that well, doesn't mean they are bad people."
p5904
aS'This is true, neither of those make you bad people - maybe it was just that the only miners who you saw in town were the arseholes, got a bad rep kind of thing.'
p5905
aS"To be fair, my town had a lot of asians and Caribbean folks, but you'd never see immigrants stay over in the mining towns, even the taxi drivers and corner shops were white people. "

p5909
aS'I want political reform + direct democracy.'
p5910
aS"UKIP's toned down the direct democracy aspect which has turned me into an undecided voter."
p5911
aS"UKIP has far more chance of winning in my area, so should I vote UKIP because of that, or vote Greens because they want the reform I want (even though I'm not economically lefty, but in other aspects of Green policy I agree with them)?"
p5912
aS"Can someone tell me who to vote for because I'm clueless at the moment."

p5918
aS'Someone cannot tell you who to vote for.'
p5919
aS'What I can tell you is that either of those parties will likely have MPs when parliament finally sits.'
p5920
aS"And I would hope that the MPs for both those parties would point out that any system that can only form a stable government if a majority of voters elect Labour or Conservative candidates isn't a democracy in any real sense at all."
p5921
aS"I wouldn't group the Lib Dems in with the other smaller parties, they've come out and said they'll basically go into coalition with who's ever in power."
p5922
aS'&gt; There will likely not be again so momentous an election in your lifetime, or least ways not for decades.'
p5923
aS"Nah there will probably be a new one a few months after this because nobody's going to be able to form a majority."
p5924
aS'And that, in itself, will be a clear message that things have to change.'

p6139
aS"Then you'd know that both parties are to blame, and actually, the best way to prove you aren't racist is not to be racist, it's isn't letting man-children who physically intimidate pensioners get away with being a bully."

aS"That isn't violence."
p6177
aS'This is typical of the childish overreaction that typifies too much political discourse nowadays. '

p6193
aS'Sorry, but there is evidence that certain group ARE attacking UKIP (Generally extreme left hippy liberal twats, groups like UAF), and whether or not you agree with their politics, ignoring that this is happening is simple tribalism.'

aS'Charlie Hebdo never harassed children at a pub, so the comparison is moot.'

p6201
aS'However, recent events have had me reconsider my stance - the recent Tory ideas to enforce treatment on those with mental health problems.'
p6202
aS"Many people with mental health problems know that some things don't work for them, whether its CBT, certain types of medication etc, and call me cynical, but I can see this being used to tell people 'You're going on an anti depressant that you already know makes you feel worse, but because it's cheap we can report that we're treating more cases than ever', and of course sanction those who refuse to comply."
p6203
aS"Also, 'decline a treatment' - I wonder if that will include people who just fail to stick to a treatment, such as those with mental health problems, people with weight problems who can't stick to a doctor's given diet plan, etc?"

p6213
aS'This principle applies to medical treatment.'

aS'While someone over 18 has the legal right to confirm consent or not, someone with mental illnesses would probably fall short of the capacity.'
p6215
aS'MCA defines mental capacity, if capacity is lacking and the tests for it.'
p6216
aS'The legislation further allows treated to be provided on consent of another.'
p6217
aS'**This does not include the state**.'
p6218
aS'Moreover threats to withdraw benefits impairs anyone the freedom to make informed consent.'
p6219
aS'While those on benefits should do everything possible to get into work, this goes beyond the realm of reasonable.'
p6220
aS"&gt; Consent is required for one person to touch another\n\nNo it isn't."
p6221
aS"There are plenty of cases where it isn't such as in law enforcement, the restraint of prisoners etc."
p6222
aS'Which are either excluded by statute or ordered by the courts.'
p6223
aS'This is a perfectly logical.'
p6224
aS'If you are long term unemployed due to having some malady, then supporting that person is justified.'
p6225
aS'However if said person is entirely unwilling to gain treatment for such issues, can we really justify supporting someone unwilling to give even the smallest amount of effort required?'
p6226
aS'In principle you have a valid point.'
p6227
aS'People who are in a position to work, by way of treating an illness, should be encouraged to do so.'
p6228
aS'But to withdraw the right to provide consent or not, denying a fundamental legal right, is it worth it?'
p6229
aS"But they aren't."
p6230
aS'You can still refuse, you just no longer get the full benefits entitlement.'
p6231
aS'The principle should be free from consequence though.'
p6232
aS'Conditioning consent, because of your circumstances, is creating a two-tier system of rights i.e.'
p6233
aS'If you work you are free to provide consent or not, with no financial consequences but if you are on benefits you have no choice but to accept a treatment that might not even work, has proven to do little in the past or is a lazy treatment.'
p6234
aS'However benefits are not a right.'
p6235
aS'They are a privilege, gained by paying into the system with economic benefit.'
p6236
aS'If we start classing removal of privileges as rights, then that messes a LOT of stuff up.'
p6237
aS'For instance I have a legal right to go around calling people "niggercrackers" under free speech.'
p6238
aS'However if I do this at work, this will have financial consequences once I get fired.'
p6239
aS'Conflating privileges with rights is a very dangerous route to take.'
p6240
aS'And while lazy treatments might be an issue, in reality this is something that should be solved separately: There is already a burden of trust for the doctor to do what is the best medical course of action.'
p6241
aS"Considering the breadth of the NHS, it's not like it's difficult to get a free separate opinion: Simply go to another GP for treatment if you truly believe that this is a wrong course of action."
p6242
aS"If two GP's are saying the same thing, then more than likely it's the correct action."
p6243
aS'&gt; However benefits are not a right.'
p6244
aS'They are a privilege,\n\nI agree.'
p6245
aS'&gt;If we start classing removal of privileges as rights, then that messes a LOT of stuff up\n\nThis was not the suggestion.'
p6246
aS'The point was using a privileged (benefits) to impair legal rights (consent to medical treatment) is dangerous if not illegal.'
p6247
aS'&gt;For instance I have a legal right to go around calling people "niggercrackers" under free speech.'
p6248
aS'However if I do this at work, this will have financial consequences once I get fired.'
p6249
aS'Few would consider free speech to include being offensive, and people would generally consider "niggercracker" an offensive term.'
p6250
aS"However the general argument I think you're making is exercising your freedom of speech can get you fired, thus losing your privilege."
p6251
aS'Legally this is probably not the case but it depends on what you were saying to begin with.'
p6252
aS'Legal rights should outweigh privilege, with room for exceptions if anyone can cite any.'
p6253
aS'&gt;Conflating privileges with rights is a very dangerous route to take.'
p6254
aS'So to is creating two-tiers of rights.'
p6255
aS"That is, while you work you have legal rights (to give consent or not) and when you don't you lose those rights."
p6256
aS"&gt;And while lazy treatments might be an issue...If two GP's are saying the same thing, then more than likely it's the correct action."
p6257
aS'Fair point.'
p6258
aS"I don't have a problem with this - people still absolutely have a choice (no one is going to hold a patient down and force them to have treatment)."
p6259
aS"It's just that the choice now potentially comes with a consequence, as with most things in life."
p6260
aS'If someone is off work, unable to work, then it is fair that they should be able to claim benefits.'
p6261
aS'However, if a treatment exists for their condition that could get them back to work, is it fair for them to say "nah mate, I don\'t want to go back to work, I much prefer benefits"?'
p6262
aS"Of course, the reality is that lots of people, especially with mental health issues, won't fit into this model, but the stereotype that voters will think of is the man lying on his sofa claiming to have a bad back, spending the benefits on Sky TV and fags."
p6263

p6269
aS'My father in law was in hospital earlier this year, I asked his nurse what his condition was and neither she nor I could understand the other.'
p6270
aS"I've had enough conversations with people who have had similar experiences to draw the conclusion this was not an isolated incident."
p6271
aS"I'm sure she fulfilled the basic requirements regarding spoken English but I think the problem here is that the requirement is not high enough."

aS'I say that because I only see right wing people calling for grammar schools.'

p6508
aS'They were abolished during a period of Labour government from 1966-70 in which progressive and egalitarian reforms were being passed quite enthusiastically by Parliament, Labour having been given a substantial majority in the 66 election.'
p6509
aS"The argument given by Wilson at the time was that comprehensivisation would make 'every school a Grammar school'."
p6510
aS'Instead what it did was transform a state system which was putting more students into Oxbridge than today and beginning to put independent schools out of business into what we have today, where comprehensives much more resemble the old secondary moderns rather than Grammars and where selection is now almost exclusively by money and not ability.'
p6511
aS'Comprehensives were and are popular with the left because in theory they put everyone on an equal footing.'
p6512
aS"However, in practice they only lead to 'elite' comprehensives in rich catchment areas which therefore still select by wealth and make private school the only viable option for parents who can afford it."
p6513
aS'I suspect people on the right are also more open to the idea of not having all children on an equal footing, putting cleverer children in better faculties.'
p6514
aS'I believe grammars are the best way for providing opportunities for poor children to escape their backgrounds and enter the professions and the academy and that they would be an aid to social mobility.'
p6515
aS'I was fortunate enough to gain a scholarship to a good private school, but if grammars were still around many more capable children whose parents could not even afford the reduced fees that mine had to pay could still have a similar quality of education.'
p6516
aS"There's a few of things of that that make me uneasy, but the two things I want to address is, what about secondary modern?"
p6517
aS'I understand the were abolished because of crap secondary moderns not giving people who did well on the 11+ a proper equal education.'
p6518
aS"Also don't grammar schools make the catchments zone a more desirable place to live, which drive up house prices so in the end only rich kids go."
p6519
aS"Then you couple that with the crap secondary moderns and poorer families not able to pay for 11+ after school training then doesn't it just further result in class segregation, prevents social mobility and also dooms poor kids to continue being poor (at the risk of sounding extreme)."
p6520
aS'Well, a Grammar school that only took the top 33% of students would necessarily have a catchment area 3x the size of the equivalent comprehensive, which means that the effect on house prices is necessarily much smaller, especially as the system being advocated would have every child in the catchment area of at least one Grammar school.'
p6521
aS"As to tutoring, this is a difficult one to avoid, but it won't prevent really bright poor kids from getting into the grammars, whereas they are effectively excluded from the best comprehensives because their parents simply can't afford to live in the right place."
p6522
aS'what about those from poorer backgrounds on the very edges of catchment, in rural areas this could be practically impossible to get to school'
p6523
aS"They'd still be in catchment."
p6524
aS"There'd need to be a reinstatement of free school buses for those living over 3 miles away, but that's about it."
p6525
aS"As someone who went to a Grammar school less than 2 years ago (Trafford/Manchester) your concerns are correct in that it's mainly made up of middle class students."
p6526
aS"However, that's not to say it was completely like that, there was a large amount of lower/working class that also attended. "
p6527
aS'An equal amount?'
p6528
aS'Hmm, there were no really rich people.'
p6529
aS"A lot of just 'average' people then i'd say 25% working class and 30% upper-middle class."
p6530
aS'Rest would just be the UK average.'
p6531
aS'Grammar schools will never be truly equal.'
p6532
aS'Middle class parents have more time and money to put into their kids doing well.'
p6533
aS'And less social problems.'
p6534
aS'But surely a chance (albeit a lower one than average) for kids with poorer families beats no chance at all.'
p6535
aS'*Also I went to two grammar schools (Kent).'
p6536
aS'The former was not too far off even.'
p6537
aS'The second was hugely skewed to middle class, but was also far more rural so in part that was just a geographic thing.'
p6538
aS'A fully national system would go a long way to reducing the middle class bias.'
p6539
aS"There wouldn't be enough middle class people if, say, 30% of state students were put into Grammars."
p6540
aS"I'm quite left leaning, and I am strongly in favour of grammar schools."
p6541
aS"It's the same principle as putting kids into sets at school, but a level up."
p6542
aS'It allows teachers to create lesson plans that are catered to their students and pushes the students without being too difficult, partially alleviating the worry of children being left behind or potential being untapped.'
p6543
aS'Without the minimum wage companies would be shipping in immigrants to work at \xc2\xa31.50 an hour, which really would force out British labour.'
p6544
aS'If we could do that it would change the face of manufacturing in the UK, creating a boom that would be the envy of the world.'
p6545
aS'Realistically though if we abolished the minimum wage companies would need to compete for labour and so wages at the lwoer end of the spectrum would be dragged up by the inertia of no longer having an effective wage ceiling.'
p6546
aS"This wouldn't be bad for the UK either but wouldn't be anything like as Earth-shatteringly positive as making the UK the manufacturing powerhouse of the developed world."
p6547
aS'&gt; Realistically though if we abolished the minimum wage companies would need to compete for labour and so wages at the lwoer end of the spectrum would be dragged up by the inertia of no longer having an effective wage ceiling.'

aS'"We\'ll pay you 50p an hour but we\'ll let you have time off to go sign on on Thursday" was often heard in my town in the late 80\'s.'
p6550
aS'So what?'
p6551
aS"His biggest complaint of immigrants is that they force down wages, but yet he doesn't want to increase minimum wage."
p6552
aS'Which is it nigel?'
p6553
aS'the theory is... stopping the influx of immigrants would stop wages being forced down... Increasing the minimum wage has the consequence of putting people out of work.'
p6554
aS'most endangered would be those currently on 0 hours contract, which we theoretically want to protect. '
p6555
aS'I think that he wants an increased minimum wage and controlled migration. '
p6556
aS'I think he has no interest in raising the minimum wage. '
p6557
aS"But he'll be stopping the immigrants so it won't matter, right Nige?"
p6558
aS"I don't think you understand how democracy works in the UK."
p6559
aS"He's right."
p6560
aS'Again.'
p6561
aS'Improving this country would just attract more parasites anyway.'
p6562
aS"I say we demolish all the hospitals and burn down the schools, just so the foreigners won't want to come here."
p6563
aS'Pointless statement, anything that makes the country a better place to live in would encourage migrants.'
p6564
aS'Well, Nige has implied one solution: make the UK the worst shithole in Europe and nobody will want to come here.'
p6565
aS"And that seems consistent with UKIP's other anti-worker, pro-corporate policies."
p6566
aS"But if UKIP are in charge of minimum wage in this hypothetical scenario, surely they'll be in charge of stopping the migrant workers?"
p6567
aS"I think that even the most fervent UKIP supporter has accepted that they ain't gonna get into downing street."
p6568
aS'I know that, I was just talking about the logic of this hypothetical scenario Farage talked about.'
p6569
aS"It didn't add up."
p6570
aS"He's not talking in the sense that he's in charge of the minimum wage, he's talking in the sense that everyone is offering a higher minimum wage and that will encourage people to come here. "
p6571
aS'Well he is technically right, but a useless argument.'
p6572
aS'We want to improve the minimum wage for the British, right?'
p6573
aS"So it is useless pointing it out if he isn't actually against it."

aS"I don't like Nigel Farage, but I can see why some people do."
p6876
aS"Here he is, gatecrashing debates he's not even invited to to try and get in and openly accepting any offer for debate or interview."
p6877
aS'Meanwhile, David Cameron, the incumbent Prime Minister is avoiding any real debate like the plague and refusing to stand on the same stage as Ed Milliband.'
p6878
aS"He expects others to vote for policies he won't defend himself."
p6879
aS"He's a coward."
p6880
aS"If I was a Conservative, I'd be voting UKIP."
p6881
aS'No question.'
p6882
aS'David Cameron was trying to get himself onto any debate that would have him, when he was in opposition too.'
p6883
aS"Now he's less keen, as was Gordon Brown."
p6884
aS'Are you at least open to the possibility that Nigel could turn coat in a similar fashion, in a hypothetical situation where he became Prime Minister?'
p6885
aS"He's not just less keen."
p6886
aS'He\xe2\x80\x99s ruined these debates for everyone because he believes he would do so unbelievably badly that not turning up is better for his electoral prospects.'
p6887
aS'He turned what should have been a direct head-to-head into a couple of pissy interviews and Q&amp;A\xe2\x80\x99s, then he insisted they have 7 party leaders at the next debate so he could hide in the noise.'
p6888
aS'He even had the gall to claim victory afterwards.'
p6889
aS'Then he refuses to turn up altogether for the final debate and claims he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t invited and is too \xe2\x80\x9cpolite\xe2\x80\x9d to try and get in.'
p6890
aS'He outright fucking lied.'
p6891
aS'Now we have an upcoming Question Time that surprise, surprise suddenly and strangely has adopted the separate interview/Q&amp;A format for this one episode with the PM.'
p6892
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely indefensible cowardice.'
p6893
aS'Not to mention this is exactly the sort of behaviour David Cameron has heavily criticised in the past.'
p6894
aS'Definitely though, it could even be likely that Nigel Farage would do the same after a term in office.'
p6895
aS'Regardless though, I will praise anyone with a good \xe2\x80\x9cbring it on!\xe2\x80\x9d attitude to debates.'
p6896
aS'It shows you believe in your ideals and are willing to put them under any scrutiny because you\xe2\x80\x99re confidant they can withstand it.'
p6897
aS'I think David Cameron believes himself and his plan to have failed and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for him to be local dog catcher for this.'
p6898
aS"&gt;  He\xe2\x80\x99s ruined these debates for everyone because he believes he would do so unbelievably badly \n\nHe did okay last election and held his own in the 2 this time, I see no justification for believing that he would of done 'unbelievably badly'."
p6899
aS'Then why is he so admant about not being on the same stage as Ed Miliband?'
p6900
aS"I mean, I don't see Ed Miliband as a particularly scary opponent to debate."
p6901
aS"He's not exactly known for his blinding oratory skills or anything."
p6902
aS"Why won't he allow himself to be directly compared with him in a head-to-head?"
p6903
aS"It's because he thinks he would not only lose, but lose so badly that it's better he take the hit of looking like a coward."
p6904
aS"Make no mistake, he's made a calculated political decision about this."
p6905
aS'Ofcoruse he has.'
p6906
aS"I'll admit, this is sort of a pet issue of mine."
p6907
aS'But I stand by it.'
p6908
aS"If you're too scared to put your ideas to proper scrutiny then you mustn't have any beleif in them yourself."
p6909
aS'Because when you have a debate the news is filled with cheap sound bites for days on end.'
p6910
aS'That is not healthy for a democracy - policies should be given the limelight, not just whether someone stared at a camera in a creepy way or sweated whilst on stage.   '
p6911
aS'Bullshit.'
p6912
aS'Fair and open debate is an integral part of our demoocracy.'
p6913
aS"It's meant to be a market place of ideas."
p6914
aS"It's also a fantastic opportunity for us to see how the candidates operate themselves and see a bit of what makes them tick."
p6915
aS"It's a vital part of the process, no matter how much the media may try to spin it."
p6916
aS"If you don't beleive me, just ask David Cameron 5 years ago."
p6917
aS"&gt; It's meant to be a market place of ideas."
p6918
aS"But it isn't."
p6919
aS'It is just a game of who can get their soundbite into the news.  '
p6920
aS"Well, the fact that millions of people watch them in full not only as they're on but afterwards using online sources I would say there's a lot more to it than that."
p6921
aS"I mean, a new soundbite doesn't men much when you watched it yourself."
p6922
aS"It's a very lazy and defeatist argument you're posing."
p6923
aS'"Yeah, well it\'s not perfect so just don\'t do it,"\n\nThe electorate have a responsibility to educate themselves about who they should vote for and debates are a great tool to that end.'
p6924
aS'because gordon brown bodly took on a debate and look where that got him. '
p6925
aS"That's what sometimes happens in a debate."
p6926
aS'You lose.'
p6927
aS"It's not my fucking problem if David Cameron loses a debate."
p6928
aS"It is however my problem if he refuses to turn up and I don't get to see him defend his policies."
p6929
aS'So biggest game of chicken?'
p6930
aS'prove you have balls and get smashed in debate and lose election?'
p6931
aS'or risk skipping and maybe have chance of winning?'
p6932
aS'I wonder what he would chose '
p6933
aS'Look at what those debates did for Nick Clegg.'
p6934
aS"There's a possible upside for politicians who enter them."
p6935
aS'The trouble is, you need to ave the best policies, arguments and skills to do so.'
p6936
aS'Why should we shield cowards from that test by letting them off with running scared from defending their own ideas.'
p6937
aS"Would you vote for a policy that I asked you to when I wouldn't defend it from direct scrutiny?"
p6938
aS'Of course not.'
p6939
aS'But you know what?'
p6940
aS'At least Gordon Brown stepped into the ring and fucking tried.'
p6941
aS'At least he beleived in his policies enough to do that.'
p6942
aS"I'll never forgive David Cameron for being so pathetic."
p6943
aS"you honestly don't see that cameron has way more to lose?"
p6944
aS'he has the track record, miliband can just claim wild policies and beat cameron as he has no evidence of himself in government, the opposition gains way more than the defendant '
p6945
aS'Putting aside the fact that Ed Milliband has been in government before.'
p6946
aS'.'
aS'.'
aS'Yeah, incumbents have it tougher.'
p6947
aS'Not my problem.'
p6948
aS'What are we meant to just let off incumbents from having to defend not only their record but also their future polcies from direct scrutiny and comparison?'
p6949
aS'Absolutely not.'
p6950
aS"Also, don't forget that Ed Miliband has his record as leader of the opposition."
p6951
aS'Did he oppose a policy that later went on to be a great success?'
p6952
aS'Then call him on that failure.'
p6953
aS"Did he suggest stupid alternatives to the PM's ideas?"
p6954
aS'Then bring them up.'
p6955
aS"None of what your bringing up is the electorates problem, they're David Cameron's problems and we have no responsibility to fix them for him."
p6956
aS"It's part of the price of getting to be the most powerful man in the fucking country."
p6957
aS'Pretty small price to pay really.'
p6958
aS'Also, he was perfectly fine with having the advantage when Gordon Brown was the incumbent.'
p6959
aS"So if that's his reasoning then he's a hypocrite as well."
p6960
aS"He doesn't want to take the risk of messing up on stage. "
p6961
aS"That is one of the reasons I'm acusing him of being a coward."
p6962
aS"He's ok with everyone els taking that risk, so it's not like he has some principle against debates for that reason."
p6963
aS'&gt; then he insisted they have 7 party leaders at the next debate so he could hide in the noise.'
p6964
aS'False - he said that if UKIP were coming then that the Greens probably should as well - it was the broadcasters that made it a 7-way fudge'
p6965
aS"Don't nitpick at his weakest point and address everything he said."
p6966
aS'David Cameron is a coward. '
p6967
aS'UKIP has major party status in England *and* Wales.'
p6968
aS'They poll higher than Plaid in Wales.'
p6969
aS'Why is this only airing in England?'
p6970
aS'It sounds like the Scottish and Welsh programmes are on at the same time, in the same slot.'
p6971
aS"Leanne Wood's program should be put on right after Farage's in Wales."
p6972
aS'UKIP polled almost double what Plaid did last May.'
p6973
aS'That depends on available programming slots though.'
p6974
aS"If there's only space in the schedule for one programme, it'll be the relevant regional party taking them up."
p6975
aS'Plaid will probably get the same number of seats as UKIP manage overall.'
p6976
aS"It isn't the BBC's job to skew these programs towards what they guess the election outcome will be."
p6977
aS"It's their job to represent the parties fairly based on opinion polling and levels of support at recent elections."
p6978
aS'Why polling and recent elections?'
p6979
aS"Because they're a better indication of support than seats from an unrepresentitive and broken electoral system that wastes millions of people's votes."
p6980
aS"As much as I hate FPTP, it's not really the BBC's place to determine that it is unfair and plan election coverage accordingly."
p6981
aS'Deciding how to allocate coverage to parties and candidates is a genuinely difficult problem, and no matter what decision they make, somebody is going to be left feeling aggrieved.'
p6982
aS'In any case:\n\n&gt; [The programme will also be shown later in the evening on BBC One in Wales.'
p6983
aS'All the programmes will also be broadcast on the BBC News Channel and on BBC Parliament.'
p6984
aS"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/statements/electiondebates170415)\n\nAnd UKIP aren't even seriously campaigning in Wales or Scotland, are they?"
p6985
aS'Given UKIP are the second most popular party in Wales, I would imagine they would be'
p6986
aS"And they're polling at around 1% in Scotland."
p6987
aS'I dont really see your point.'
p6988
aS"&gt; And UKIP aren't even seriously campaigning in Wales or Scotland, are they?"
p6989
aS"I'm saying they aren't, in Scotland.\n"
p6990
aS'I mean, it would make sense if i addressed Scotland, but i was specifically mentioning Wales...'
p6991
aS'Yup.'
p6992
aS'Replying to a guy who said Wales and Scotland.'
p6993
aS'You addressed Wales, I addressed Scotland.'
p6994
aS"It's fine."
p6995
aS'Move on.'
p6996
aS'Plaid stands in considerably fewer constituencies and is still set to get roughly the same number of seats as UKIP and at the end of they day it is seats that matter.'
p6997
aS'UKIP supporters can delude themselves that it is really the party that does what come second in a bunch of places that wins the election, but it is not true.'
p6998
aS'Unless UKIP manage to turn it round quickly then they are facing political irrelevance.'
p6999
aS'The SNP already have them on the run, as it stands UKIP will be down at 7th or 8th position this election.  '
p7000
aS'&gt; at the end of they day it is seats that matter\n\nSeats matter in the legislature.'
p7001
aS'They are not an accurate measure of public support though, which is what representation during an election campaign needs to measure.'
p7002
aS'Why you fail to understand this distinction is beyond me.'
p7003
aS"You are picking measures of public support that \n\na) ignore the local aspects of politics\n\nand \n\nb) don't count for anything in the actual election\n\nUKIP have managed to get into the debates."
p7004
aS'They are having their PPBs.'
p7005
aS'Really, they have been very fortunate in the public exposure they have got.'
p7006
aS'They have absolutely no valid reason to complain.'
p7007
aS'It is just another instance of UKIP portraying themselves as the victim.'
p7008
aS'It is overdone and boring at this point. '
p7009
aS"&gt; a) ignore the local aspects of politics\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; and\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; b) don't count for anything in the actual election\n\nNo."
p7010
aS"I'm talking specifically about levels of support in the relevant area: Wales."
p7011
aS'All votes count and UKIP is predicted to get more of them.'
p7012
aS"How that ends up in terms of seats is for the election to decide and for gamblers to bet on, it isn't for the broadcasters to pre-judge."
p7013
aS'&gt; All votes count and UKIP is predicted to get more of them.'
p7014
aS"How that ends up in terms of seats is for the election to decide and for gamblers to bet on, it isn't for the broadcasters to pre-judge."
p7015
aS'Why is it appropriate for broadcasters to pre-judge vote shares but not seat shares?'
p7016
aS'This is special pleading.'
p7017
aS"They aren't pre-judging anything."
p7018
aS'Recent electoral history shows that UKIP is more popular than Plaid in Wales.'
p7019
aS'Plaid won far more votes and seats than UKIP in Wales in the most recent Westminster, Assembly, and local elections.'
p7020
aS'As far as I can see, the only Welsh election in which UKIP have ever beaten Plaid was the 2014 European Parliament election.'
p7021
aS"You aren't asking for fairness here: you are asking for everything to be interpreted in the light most favourable to UKIP."
p7022
aS"Anyway, it looks like Farage's Q&amp;A is going to get the same amount of screen time in Wales as Wood's is, so I don't know what you are even complaining about."
p7023
aS'Wales is not a single homogeneous block.'
p7024
aS'Plaid currently have more Welsh seats than UKIP.'
p7025
aS'The Farage interview is getting aired.'
p7026
aS"I really don't see what more it is that you are wanting. "
p7027
aS'&gt; Wales is not a single homogeneous block.'
p7028
aS'For the purposes of broadcasting it is.'
p7029
aS'But not in terms of levels of public support.'
p7030
aS"This isn't going anywhere."
p7031
aS"I'm out. "
p7032
aS'Well, with the red button, catch up services and so on, those who want to can watch. '
p7033
aS'I wish people would shut up and listen.'
p7034
aS"People are literally telling UKIP officials what their policies are and come out with rubbish such as you don't care about the working class."
p7035
aS'Shut up and listen.'
p7036
aS'edit: Let me be clear.'
p7037
aS'Political program.'
p7038
aS"Listeners don't love your voice like you do presenters."
p7039
aS"They also don't tune in to listen to some halfwit rabble on and interrupt the person they want to listen to. "
p7040
aS'Had this argument with my mate down the pub last night.'
p7041
aS'Like talking to a wall, he had no interest in what UKIP policies actually were.'
p7042
aS"He literally said the only issue his vote will hinge on is 'benefits', and so he'll be voting Labour."
p7043
aS"He's a university student."
p7044
aS"Sounds like he picked the wrong degree and doesn't expect to get a good job."
p7045
aS"It's one thing to get into 20-30k worth of debt over a degree."
p7046
aS"It's another to take art... "
p7047
aS'What, might I ask, does he study?'
p7048

aS'Psychology'
p7050
aS'Thanks.'
p7051
aS'DAE HUMANITIES SUCK?'
p7052
aS'AMIRITE?'
p7053
aS'!'
aS"Not really, I've just noticed that arts and humanities tend to vote more to the left (probably because they are more concerned with individuals, with intentions and with moralism, but that's just baseless speculation) while hard sciences tend to the right (being more concerned with results and statistics)."
p7054
aS"I guess I'd sum it up that arts and humanities tend to want their politicians to do what's right, while sciences want them to do what's best."
p7055
aS'I do physics and I reckon that the net politics in my class is left of centre. '
p7056
aS'Hard sciences tend to be to the right?'
p7057
aS'Jeez...how many scientists do you know?'
p7058
aS'Quite a few.'
p7059
aS'I am one.'
p7060
aS'I know some right-wing scientists but the majority seem to be liberal softie types.'
p7061
aS'At least they are the ones making noises about their politics.'
p7062
aS'When I say right, I mean economically.'
p7063
aS"There's a reasonably strong libertarian streak from what I've observed."
p7064
aS'I\'ve never met a scientist with a "strong libertarian streak".'
p7065
aS"They've mostly either been left wing or centrist. "
p7066
aS'Can you not just accept the anecdote forms a valid basis for a generalization of scientists?  '
p7067
aS'Libertarian scientist right here. '
p7068
aS'Humanities tend to teach things like empathy and free thought.'
p7069
aS'Such concepts are opposed by the authoritarian UKIP group-think collective on this subreddit. '
p7070
aS'No they are absolutely not.'
p7071
aS'UKIP is a libertarian party.'
p7072
aS'With the measure of control that UKIP demands over society I really struggle to understand how anyone could describe them as libertarian. '
p7073
aS'just keep telling yourself that mate'
p7074
aS"They're more libertarian than they are authoritarian, that's for sure."
p7075
aS'I disagree.'
p7076
aS"But even if that were true, it certainly doesn't make them libertarians."
p7077
aS'I disagree, as a Libertarian likely voting UKIP.'
p7078
aS"They really aren't libertarian... "
p7079
aS'Where have you noticed this?'
p7080
aS'Discussions on reddit?'
p7081
aS"No, mostly discussions with other students on my course and coworkers (chemistry) The only large scale thing I can point to is Imperial's student union being way to the right of average for student unions (Imperial having no arts or humanities students)"
p7082
aS'Did he touch a nerve?'
p7083
aS"If it helps I'm STEM and also tired of that particular circlejerk."
p7084
aS"And I'm not STEM but I still find it amusing how it winds some people up so much."
p7085
aS'When you get it a lot I imagine it must be grating.'
p7086
aS'Nope, I studied STEM.'
p7087
aS'I just think its astonishingly narrow minded and ignorant to assume that what someone has studied dictates which way they lean politically.'
p7088
aS"There is also this sinister conspiracy theory that seems to float around on the internet that people who don't study STEM are somehow brainwashed into becoming left wing.\n"
p7089
aS'&gt; to assume that what someone has studied dictates which way they lean politically\n\nWhat if they studied economics?'
p7090
aS'What difference does that make?'
p7091
aS'Studying self-interest leads individuals to act in a more self-interested manner.'
p7092
aS"It's not too much of a leap to say that this could be a deciding factor in how ones' political opinions are ultimately formed."
p7093
aS'http://node101.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Frank,Gilo,Regan.93.pdf'
p7094
aS'Are you saying that people who are right wing are more selfish and less empathetic?'
p7095
aS"You shouldn't conflate self-interest with selfishness or lack of empathy."
p7096
aS'So whats the significance of self-interested behaviour to political ideology?'
p7097
aS'Because it would inform how one might think of incentive structures and what role the state should have in shaping them.'
p7098
aS'How?'
p7099
aS"You'd be more likely to oppose policies like taxing the bankers the bonuses to 90% because you personally believe that individuals respond to incentives."
p7100
aS'Sounds like an oxygen thief. '
p7101
aS'Maybe UKIP want to see it metered with every breath requiring forms signed in triplicate but oxygen is still free atm.'
p7102
aS'That sounds like a green party policy'
p7103
aS'Greens are left wing and liberal, the antipode to UKIP. '
p7104
aS'Ukip are free market, you can buy oxygen at the going rate like everyone else.'
p7105
aS'Shut up and listen is possibly the worst thing the electorate should ever do.'
p7106
aS'I completely disagree.'
p7107
aS'&gt; Shut up and listen is possibly the worst thing the electorate should ever do\n\nWhy?'
p7108
aS'The massive amount of misinformation and ignorance regarding certain parties is ridiculous and if people would stop and listen to what party officials have to say then they would learn about the parties.'
p7109
aS"Let's take UKIP for example."
p7110
aS"They have many hecklers at speeches and debates and on Question Time, usually shouting something stupid and misinformed like, 'You want to kick out immigrants!"
p7111
aS"'\n\nIn reality UKIP's policy is not to 'kick people out' nor 'put them on a boat' but rather to reduce net migration numbers to below 50,000."
p7112
aS'If people shut up and listened then they would learn these facts and begin to understand each party and each of their policies.'
p7113
aS'If they do not shut up and listen like you would suggest is the better thing to do then the electorate would not only be misinformed and ignorant, but they would spread this misinformation throughout the nation.'
p7114
aS'I find it hilariously annoying as a ukip supporter that the only party that tells the consistent truth is the one that people insist is lying.'
p7115
aS'Politics seems to have turned into another religion where logic goes entirely out of the window.'
p7116
aS"I'd say completely misrepresenting a party is up there with that. "
p7117
aS'Why?'
p7118
aS'You have to listen to what the politicians are proposing before you have enough ammunition to question / argue / call them out on their bullshit. '
p7119
aS'&gt; I wish people would shut up and listen.'
p7120
aS'Haha, brilliant...'
p7121
aS"I do hope people aren't rude to him this time."
p7122
aS"He's a delicate flower... "
p7123
aS'I hope UKIP get to pick the audience this time.'
p7124
aS'Last time they were no where near sycophantic enough. '
p7125
aS'They were plenty of sycophants on the other side though eh?'
p7126
aS"Yes, let's see them together, give them enough rope..."
p7127
aS"I'd say incredibly brave to call out the entire audience."
p7128
aS"Can't imagine any of the others daring to stand by their principles like that."
p7129
aS'To everyone but his supporters, he just looked childish. '
p7130
aS'DemonEggy - the official spokesperson for "everyone else".'
p7131
aS'Well I agree with DemonEggy and I would not give the Greens or Labour any credence if they moaned about it either.'
p7132
aS'Like with the Sky questioning.'
p7133
aS'I wonder the last time you saw a labour mp in a difficult situation with a hand picked BBC right wing audience.'
p7134
aS'Hand-picked to be right-wing or hand-picked for some other purpose?'
p7135
aS"I'm not sure of the question so let's say 'either'"
p7136
aS'No anyway.'
p7137
aS'Yes I have seen Labour in front of hostile TV audiences.'
p7138
aS'But they did not look hand picked.'
p7139
aS'Your point was that the audience for this debate was hand picked to be mainly left wing, and the BBC had some influence in that picking, right?'
p7140
aS"The audience should be picked according to the party's popularity."
p7141
aS"In this case, UKIP got more than it's fair share of the audience. "
p7142
aS"Wow, that's *two* people now!"
p7143
aS"We're almost at everyone else now."
p7144
aS'Brave?'
p7145

p7148
aS'If he were ever to gain any power then he will have to deal with disgruntled reactions far better than that.'
p7149
aS"Whether he was right or wrong, he didn't actually know at all and it is a poor trait of a politician to always blame a conspiracy for his perceived failings."
p7150
aS'&gt; What principles was he standing by?'
p7151
aS'Fairness and neutrality in publicly-funded political broadcasting?'
p7152
aS"OK fair enough, I didn't think of that as being one of his principles but obviously it is something we should all expect from the BBC."
p7153
aS"I still can't see him standing by his principles if the audience were overwhelmingly UKIP supporters, but I could be wrong."
p7154
aS'So the BBC handed over selection to a neutral organisation.'
p7155
aS'There is your neutrality.'
p7156
aS'Fairness would be...well..what is fairness?'
p7157
aS'Conservative and UKIP supporter audience numbers were outweighed by others, which is what you would expect.'
p7158
aS'I am not going to say the exact numbers were right, but a majority of non-tory and non-UKIP supporters is fair.'
p7159
aS'But the audience should have stayed quiet anyway.'
p7160
aS'Fairness would be silence throughout the programme.'
p7161
aS"It's entirely possible that those who hold left-wing views are more likely to applaud."
p7162
aS'&gt; a majority of non-tory and non-UKIP supporters is fair\n\nHow do you figure, when they represent 50% of the vote?'
p7163
aS'Has there ever been a debate where the audience is entirely silent? '
p7164
aS"That's how they do it in America."
p7165
aS'Why are you so opposed to fairness and neutrality?'
p7166
aS'How would you feel if the situation were reversed?'
p7167
aS'The audience in the Scottish debate was pretty hostile to Sturgeon at times.'
p7168
aS'And they were a LOT louder throughout.'
p7169
aS"But we didn't moan about it for days afterwards."
p7170
aS"And I don't remember anyone complaining when Farage got applause in the other debate... "
p7171
aS'Exactly.'
p7172
aS'The others managed to corner Sturgeon on the referendum question, and the audience were booing her so much louder than Farage was getting (especially before he attacked them).'
p7173
aS"But she didn't throw a strop and call them a hand-picked unionist audience, she just kept on debating like a grown up."
p7174
aS'(I hated during the referendum campaign how much some yes voters were going on about BBC bias, I think it made us look almost as stupid as the UKIP supporters on here look.'
p7175
aS')'
aS'yup, agreed with all of that.'
p7176
aS'Maybe because this is a UK-wide board and Scotland is 8% of the population, so most probably never even saw it.'
p7177
aS'But that was wrong too.'
p7178
aS'Farage got one applause in the last debate, but the biggest cheer was from Wood\'s "you should be ashamed of yourself" cheap shot.'
p7179
aS'I believe that ITV instructed the audience to keep quiet thoughout.'
p7180
aS'I mean the UK leaders debate with Farage.'
p7181
aS'He got applause.'
p7182
aS"I don't remember anyone saying then that they shouldn't clap. "
p7183
aS'&gt;Why are you so opposed to fairness and neutrality?'
p7184
aS'Why are you so opposed to freedom of speech?'
p7185
aS'The UKIP attempts trying to silence dissent are rather disturbing. '
p7186
aS"I'm advocating a blanket ban, it would be fair and equal."
p7187
aS"It's nothing to do with free speech, this is a closed event being broadcast to and paid by supporters of all parties."
p7188
aS"You wouldn't let people heckle or scream or stand up and shout like that woman in the ITV debate."
p7189
aS'It is absolutely a matter of freedom of speech.'
p7190
aS"And we are not talking about heckling or screaming, what happened is that Nigel Farage complained to the audience that he felt he wasn't being shown sufficient adulation."
p7191
aS'Now we have demands for silence in debates, for additional UKIP supporters to be bused in?'
p7192
aS'This is one of the many reasons you can never trust the authoritarian right. \n\n'
p7193
aS"Do you not realise that it wouldn't matter if the crowd was 100% UKIP if silence were demanded?"
p7194
aS"&gt; what happened is that Nigel Farage complained to the audience that he felt he wasn't being shown sufficient adulation\n\nWell, he wasn't: the views he expressed on the programme were not represented by the noise made by the audience in comparison to polling after the debate."
p7195
aS"You can denigrate the point by calling it adulation, but it's still true."
p7196
aS'What is the point of having an audience if UKIP mandates dictate that they must be silent at all times?'
p7197
aS'&gt;silence were demanded\n\nYou must see that this is an attack on freedom of speech. '
p7198
aS"For the opening and closing applause and to help the participants to feel as if they're talking to a crowd."
p7199
aS"America does this, and it's really not an outlandish concept."
p7200
aS'&gt; You must see that this is an attack on freedom of speech.'
p7201
aS'Why do you think that those who shout the loudest deserve to be heard the most?'
p7202
aS"This is a closed broadcasting event which is viewed by the entire public, it's not circle time."
p7203
aS"Because they don't represent 50% of the vote."
p7204
aS'15+33=48'
p7205
aS'OK. 48 &lt; 50\n\nBut the other point is that, having allowed the audience to make noise, Nigel was going to come worst off because he is a bit like Marmite.'
p7206
aS'Some love him and some hate him, with not so much inbetween.'
p7207
aS'So his detractors make a lot of noise, relatively.'
p7208
aS'Which is why they should have really kept quiet.'
p7209
aS'It was not meant to be a popularity contest.\n\n'
p7210
aS"Back to school, I heard they don't actually teach maths any more."
p7211
aS'Actually they are doing simultaneous equations *in primary school* these days.'
p7212
aS'Interesting that he turned out to be right.'
p7213
aS'Hmmm I guess "right" is very subjective but having around 14% (of decided voters) UKIP supporters in the audience wasn\'t far off current polling figures.'
p7214
aS'Aye, but the Tories and Labour were massively under-represented while the Lib Dems, Greens, SNP and Plaid were massively over-represented.'
p7215
aS'Overall the audience was left leaning in comparison to current polling figures. '
p7216
aS"Yeah, I can see how you could read it that way and I agree that Greens and Lib Dems were particularly over-represented, but I think it's a stretch to say Farage was right. "
p7217
aS'Lib Dems are the centre though.'
p7218
aS'I know, but even counting up right wing parties (UKIP, Tories), centre parties (Lib Dems) and left wing parties (Lab, Green, SNP, PC), the centre and left were both over-represented while the right were under represented.'
p7219
aS"The 160 decided voters were as follows: \n\nConservative: 36 \n\nLabour: 36\n\nLib Dem: 29\n\nUkip: 22\n\nSNP: 15 \n\nGreen: 15 \n\nPlaid: 7 \n\nThat's 58 right, 29 centre and 73 left."
p7220
aS"If they were representative of voting intention, going by the current BBC poll of polls, it would have been: \n\nConservative: 54 \n\nLabour: 54 \n\nLib Dem: 13\n\nUKIP: 22 \n\nGreen: 10 \n\nSNP/PC (Can't find UK-wide voting percentage): 7 (Probably 5 SNP, 2 PC)\n\nThat would be 76 right, 13 centre, 71 left."
p7221
aS"I'd also argue that Lib-Dem voters, going by those I've spoken to,  tend to sway slightly to the left while the party itself more centrist."
p7222
aS'This would mean it was even more left-biased. '
p7223
aS'On the issues where Farage is most likely to be booed, Lib Dems are left wing.'
p7224
aS"The majority of the BBC audience were right-leaning, so Farage wasn't correct, as much as Kippers would like to believe."
p7225
aS'No, the majority were left leaning.'
p7226
aS'For every five Labour supporters there were five Conservatives, four Lib Dems, three UKIP, two SNP, two PC, and one Green.'
p7227
aS'This means there were ten left wingers and four liberals to every eight right wingers, whereas polls show that UKIP and the Conservatives together are actually about 45 to 50% of the national vote. '
p7228
aS"I'd like to see which out of those parties you would consider to be left wing."
p7229
aS"It's not the parties that are important; it's their supporters."
p7230
aS'The supporters of the Greens, SNP, PC and Labour are left wing.'
p7231
aS'The supporters of the Liberal Democrats are more right wing, but are also liberal and disagree with UKIP on the EU and immigration which are the two issues that got the largest reactions from the audience.'
p7232
aS"If I were to rank them from left to right I'd do it the same way as most other people: Greens, PC, SNP, Labour, Lib Dems, Conservatives, UKIP, with the Lib Dems being the centre."
p7233
aS'Nah m8.'
p7234
aS'Brave, stupid and wrong.'
p7235
aS'Exactly the qualities we should look for in the political elite. '
p7236
aS'That makes no sense.'
p7237
aS"He's been deemed the most hated man in Britain and gets verbally assaulted at most of his public events."
p7238
aS"If Farage is anything he's the bravest leader running."
p7239
aS'So brave. '
p7240
aS'Strong stuff there.'
p7241
aS'Indeed. '
p7242
aS'So loco of you.'
p7243
aS"It is amusing when politicians who have clearly only even engaged with their own core supporters suddenly come face to face with the general public and discover that most of them don't actually share the same warped worldview as them. "
p7244
aS'Majority of people agree with him about immigration and on his stance on health tourists. '
p7245
aS'How much does health tourism actually cost?'
p7246
aS'And how much would it cost to put practical measures in place to stop it without impacting the vast majority of genuine patents?'
p7247
aS'So go look it up.'
p7248
aS'I have done.'
p7249
aS'The figures for actual "health tourism" come in somewhere between [\xc2\xa312M/year and \xc2\xa3300M/year](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/oct/22/health-tourists-costing-nhs-2bn), depending on whose figures you look at.'
p7250
aS'Figures of \xc2\xa31.3-1.9B keep floating around, but as the linked article points out, that\'s almost entirely made up of people who aren\'t "health tourists".'
p7251
aS"That's the cost of treating all foreign nationals, regardless of why they are currently in the country - e.g."
p7252
aS'it includes a large number of people who are here working and paying taxes in exactly the same way as a British citizen.'
p7253
aS'Now, onto the second part - how do you suggest that we tackle the actual health tourists?'
p7254
aS"And how do we do it in a way that costs less than the problem we're trying to tackle and without affecting genuine patients?"
p7255
aS"I've actually spoken to people involved in trying to implement one of these systems and it failed miserably."
p7256
aS'Force all migrants to get health insurance. '
p7257
aS'How would you enforce that when someone turns up at A&amp;E needing treatment?'
p7258
aS"That's an option, but at that point I doubt the majority of the public would agree with it."
p7259
aS"So what's it say that a majority of people agree with a couple of his policies, but the vast majority still won't vote for him? "
p7260
aS"That political correctness and public fear of saying anything about ethnic minorities which isn't positive should you be branded racist has gone too far. "
p7261
aS"But I'm always being told UKIP's stance on immigration is nothing to do with ethnic minorities."
p7262
aS"It's true, but when the left say the opposite enough times, people start to think it might be the case."
p7263
aS"They're unrelated concepts m'lady!"
p7264
aS"That's not the point, the point is that on a number of issues, most of the of the 'general public' do share his 'warped worldview'."
p7265
aS"Welcome to FPTP where people often don't vote for who they actually want in order to keep the least bad person out."
p7266
aS'This is why we need electoral reform as soon as possible. '
p7267
aS'Yup, I agree with you there.'
p7268
aS"Not quite the only reason, because you know as well as I do PR wouldn't shoot UKIP's support up."
p7269
aS"The thing is we don't vote for one issue we vote for the package and though people agree with Farage on immigration, his historically right, libertarian position (although admittedly he is becoming far more centrist, whether ideologically or for votes) puts lots of people off. "
p7270
aS"&gt;Not quite the only reason, because you know as well as I do PR wouldn't shoot UKIP's support up."
p7271
aS"It would shoot thier [representation up massively](https://britdemocracy.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/2015pic.jpg?w=788&amp;h=533) and once they had more representation and people knew their vote would actually get them elected I'd expect far more people to vote for them."
p7272
aS'You are right about not voting based on one issue and that is another failing of our political system but I really think the main issue holding UKIP back is people voting for the lesser of two evils.'
p7273
aS"If UKIP doesn't implode at any point I think you'll see a tipping point possibly next election where people think UKIP's base is strong enough they can actually vote for them and they'll get elected. "
p7274
aS"Unless they are concerned about immigration, but don't like UKIP 's way of banging on about it? "
p7275
aS'A majority of people disagree with you.'
p7276
aS"A majority share Farage's 'warped worldview'."
p7277
aS"Then why aren't UKIP winning a majority? "
p7278
aS'UKIP have made huge gains this election.'
p7279
aS'Perhaps the most successful rise of a party in British history.'
p7280
aS"These things don't happen overnight."
p7281
aS"You appear to be in the wrong comment chain, we're talking about opinion on issues, not winning elections."
p7282
aS'People vote for hundreds of different reasons.'
p7283
aS"Mainly though it's the electoral system- polling has shown that they'd jump to 31% if people thought they could win."
p7284
aS'http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/25/nearly-third-of-voters-prepared-to-support-ukip'
p7285
aS"Might as well ask why everybody isn't voting TUSC or Green when the majority want railways renationalised."
p7286
aS"40% of the nation doesn't vote, remember this?"
p7287
aS'oh dear.'
p7288
aS'You just described Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband, David Cameron and the fruitbat'
p7289
aS'True enough. '
p7290
aS'Read the little purple book \xe2\x80\x98WHY VOTE UKIP 2015\xe2\x80\x99, that details our increasingly damaging relationship with the ailing European Union, and how that affects nearly every political issue currently facing this country.'
p7291
aS'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a sample;\n\xe2\x80\x98The EU is a staggeringly expensive club.'
p7292
aS'It costs us \xc2\xa355m every day to stay in, yet it wastes billions on staffing costs, huge glitzy buildings, vanity projects, foreign junkets for MEPs, advertising, and moving the whole of the parliament to Strasbourg once a month, among other profligacies such as the 140 \xe2\x80\x98embassies\xe2\x80\x99 it has set up in non-EU countries (44 diplomats in Barbados alone).\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x98The EU controls immigration, business and employment, financial services, fishing, farming, law and order, energy and trade.'
p7293
aS'So, whatever the precise figure is regarding how much British legislature is controlled by the EU, you can be sure it is too much.'
p7294
aS'Our voting power within the EU is also getting weaker and weaker.'
p7295
aS'Those who say if we left the EU we would be isolated and lose our influence are being ridiculous; we have very little influence anyway.'
p7296
aS'Since 1996, the UK has voted \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 to a proposal 55 times at the Council of Ministers-where national ministers from each EU country meet to actually decide the EU\xe2\x80\x99s line on major issues- yet every single time the measure has gone on to become British law anyway.\xe2\x80\x99\nThis book details in painful, sleep ruining detail how the EU has damaged our fishing industry, our agriculture, our rights under our legal system, our small and medium sized businesses, our energy policy and costs, our clinical trials, our foreign trade, our patient care within the NHS, and so much else.'

aS"It's not as if it's a case of melting together literally every aspect of every culture."

aS'The point I am getting at is that if principles are sufficiently justified by the fact that they are accepted by a society, the principles of something like FGM are as defensible or sound as those of civilized life.'

aS'&gt;If principles are sufficiently justified by the fact that they are accepted by a society, the principles of something like FGM are as defensible or sound as those of civilized life.'
p7432
aS"FGM is considered civilised by the countries that practice it, our society by and large does not accept nor would it defend FGM, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here."

aS'&gt;And, since the ideal our society is admittedly changing, nothing except dull and stale habit could prevent us from placidly accepting a change in the direction of FGM.'
p7434
aS'This is just flat out wrong.'
p7435
aS'Society is always changing, but a lot more than stale habit can stop us accepting FGM.'
p7436
aS"I'd like to think we oppose FGM based on a little more than dull and stale habit."

aS'and we have taken steps to punish those who perform it.'
p7447
aS'How does an isolationist attitude help fight FGM?'
p7448
aS'Name a single successful prosecution for FGM. '
p7449
aS"I don't know about prosecution, but according to [this](https://www.gov.uk/female-genital-mutilation) it does carry a prison sentence."
p7450
aS'Both the [NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/female-genital-mutilation/Pages/Introduction.aspx) and the [Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/295056/HMG_FGM_Declaration.pdf) itself are very much against FGM.'
p7451
aS'Could they be doing more?'
p7452
aS"Probably, but it seems to me that the solution isn't to stop a certain type of people coming over."
p7453
aS'So FGM continues and not a single prosecution.'
p7454
aS'Does that not strike you as strange. '
p7455
aS'It does seem a little odd, what are you suggesting is the reason for this.'
p7456
aS"My pretty lazy research says that around 20000 are at risk of fgm in the UK every year, but because of the nature of the crime it's difficult to get evidence."
p7457
aS"I'm just pointing out that there has not been a single successful prosecution for FGM."
p7458
aS'Ever.'

p7464
aS"Can you provide evidence of someone who's been caught committing FGM, but hasn't been prosecuted?"
p7465
aS"The laws themselves are evidence that steps have been taken, I see no evidence of someone mutilating their daughters and being 'free to go,' rather it seems that people have mutilated their daughters and haven't been caught."
p7466
aS'Your question makes no sense to me.'
p7467
aS'Regardless, like I said, not a single successful prosecution, ever, in the UK for FGM.'
p7468
aS'Not one.  '
p7469
aS'For a prosecution to take place, people have to either be caught or accused and evidence be found against them.'
p7470
aS'Can you provide me with evidence of someone in the UK being caught breaking the law on FGM and not being prosecuted?'
p7471
aS'The stats we have on FGM in the UK are educated estimations.'
p7472
aS"You're acting as if the government has captured people mutilating genitals and is letting them go free, when I see no evidence of any such capture. "
p7473
aS'How is it not the solution to stop people who practice barbaric acts like that coming over?'
p7474
aS'Let me give you an example, say that there is a religion or culture that promotes random murder.'
p7475
aS"The premise you are advocating for is that the solution to stopping murders isn't to stop shipping murderers over to the UK but to have them come into our country and then prosecute (or not in the case of FGM) them once they are caught. "
p7476
aS"Murder is against international law, so if we were letting in actual murderers, then we'd arrest them and probably indict them back to their country or put them through our justice system."
p7477
aS"If on the other hand they simply believe murder to be a good thing, then we'd probably put them through psychiatry."
p7478
aS'Desire to randomly kill often leads to this end.'
p7479
aS"We can't really prosecute people for things they're only thinking about, I'm not willing to advocate thought crime."
p7480
aS"In regards to people who practice FGM, you're not only assuming that every person from these countries supports FGM, but by equating them to murderers (as opposed to 'murder supporters') you're assuming that they're all guilty of commiting FGM, neither of which are true."
p7481
aS"Sometimes FGM is enforced by the community itself, so even when immigrant families have mutilated female members, there's simply no guarantee that any member of the family sanctioned or wanted it, for all you know some of these people are trying to escape this sort of barbarism."
p7482

aS'I wrote up the following a few months ago, and you might find it helpful:\n\n**Conservatives**\n\nThe Conservative Party historically believe in a small state and low taxes.'
p8290
aS"Since Margaret Thatcher's introduction of neoliberalism to the United Kingdom in 1979, the Conservatives have strongly felt that individuals should strive to innovate and be successful, and those that do work hard and do innovate should be rewarded and should be allowed to reap the fruits of their labour."
p8291
aS'For Margaret Thatcher, this meant cutting the top rate of tax, moving from an industrial Britain to a more service-based Britain, privatising various industries (energy, for example), and generally shrinking the state.'
p8292
aS'When David Cameron became the leader of the Conservative Party, he sought to detoxify the Conservative Party.'
p8293
aS'This meant that he would try to be more socially progressive, for example, through his support for the legalisation of gay marriage.'
p8294
aS"He and George Osborne, his chancellor, however, were still Thatcher's children and believed in free-market ideals, such as lower tax rates for top earners."
p8295
aS"This is reflected in his/Osborne's lowering of the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p."
p8296
aS'He and his Party still believe that the state should be smaller, and hence he has significantly cut public spending in the name of austerity (tough measures for tough times).'
p8297
aS'**Labour**\n\nThe Labour Party were traditionally the party of the Labourers, hence the name.'
p8298
aS'Affiliated with the various Unions, Labour tried to get a better deal for working class people, partially by nationalising industry and ensuring that the poorest people had access to the services they need.'
p8299
aS'For example, after the 1945 election, Aneurin Bevan, the health minister in the Attlee government, founded the National Health Service, a free health service for every citizen of the United Kingdom.'
p8300
aS'Moving along, the Party promoted socialist and/or socially democratic values.'
p8301
aS'The fact that until Tony Blair came in, they were, in my opinion, the absolute most left-wing they could have been without becoming a fringe party, meant that they did not have a shot at power because they did not manage to deal with the shrinking working class and growing middle class.'
p8302
aS'When Blair got in, however, things changed.'
p8303
aS'New Labour was born.'
p8304
aS"It's primary aim was to gain middle-class support in a changing Britain, and it was hugely successful."
p8305
aS'By adopting more economically right-wing policies, and moving towards the centre-ground socially, the Labour Party appealed to the masses again, and won the 1997 election in a landslide victory.'
p8306
aS"If we fast-forward to today, Ed Miliband has replaced Blair and Brown (After the disaster that was the Iraq War, and Brown's PR disaster that was the 2008 financial crisis), and has taken Labour back to a more left-wing position, which was once called One Nation Labour, but that hasn't been used in the press so much recently."
p8307
aS'Miliband has adopted some more genuinely left-wing positions, such as opposing the war in Syria (old-Labour style left wing pacifism and minimal foreign intervention), freezing (or placing a cap on, rather) energy prices for 20 months after he gets into power putting the top rate of tax back up to 50p.'
p8308
aS'While he will still pursue an austerity agenda, it will be a lot more mild than that of the Conservative Party.'
p8309
aS'**Lib-Dems**\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are both socially and economically liberal.'
p8310
aS"They, and especially Danny Alexander, are strong believers in balancing the books, and that was the basis for the coalition they formed with the Tories, however, they are a lot more socially liberal than the Conservatives, even with Cameron's attempts to bring the Tories into the 21st Century."
p8311
aS'On the one hand, they have actually introduced a lot of policy by being in the Coalition government, for example, the idea of raising the personal allowance (the amount you can keep tax-free) to over \xc2\xa310,000 was their idea.'
p8312
aS'However, I think that the general public opinion is that they have betrayed the British public by going into a coalition with the Conservatives and by, importantly for students, renegading on their pledge not to raise tuition fees.'
p8313
aS'**UKIP**\n\nThe United Kingdom Independence Party is a right-wing party.'
p8314
aS"It's not centre-right, like the Tories, it's proper right wing (at least in my opinion it is)."
p8315
aS'Whilst some might think that this would mean it appealed to the rich, it is also in favour with a lot of working class people who feel threatened by mass immigration.'
p8316
aS"Their flagship policy is to leave the European Union, and while they say that this is primarily because of a democratic deficit in the EU ('we want our sovereignty back!"
p8317
aS"', etc), in my opinion, the main reason is because they know that the only way to stop the free movement of peoples from the EU, especially Eastern Europe, is the leave the Union altogether."
p8318
aS"UKIP have a lot of, let's say, eccentric individuals amongst their ranks."
p8319
aS'People that stand out are Godfrey Bloom, who famously referred to women as sluts (although, in fairness, he was using the old-fashioned way of using the word, to mean messy/disorganised), the member who said that the cause of the floods was the legalisation of gay marriage, and many members who want to privatise the National Health Service.'
p8320
aS'**Greens**\n\nThe Green Party is a left-wing party.'
p8321
aS'They believe in social justice, the welfare state, and environmentalism.'
p8322
aS'The name The Green Party tells you that one of their priorities is the environment, and they are big into cutting fossil fuels, using renewable energy sources, etc.'
p8323
aS'One criticism has been that they are anti-science, for example, their alleged support for homeopathy.'
p8324
aS'Another is that they are against nuclear power, which is apparently a fairly cheap energy source that does not burn fossil fuels.'
p8325
aS"Another criticism is that they cannot fund everything they promise, for example, their Citizen's Income would apparently cost in excess of the current welfare budget as a whole."
p8326

p8333
aS'Makes you realise how short-sighted politics is really.'

p8341
aS"It's not necessarily too little, but I think it's just too late."
p8342
aS'The policies they are coming out with now make little difference.'
p8343
aS'They have proven themselves to be liars in the Indy ref during which they got involved with the Tories in ridiculing almost half of the population and lying to the other half.'
p8344
aS"When your policies during a campaign consist mainly of smearing the opposition and calling people idiots with a monumental media smear campaign rather than giving people a reason to believe in you for legitimate plans and forward thinking I don't think it can be surprising when you don't get votes in."
p8345
aS"A political party that doesn't believe in its own policies enough to rely on them over deceit and badmouthing opponents will not go far in Scotland."
p8346
aS'The SNP put forward a genuine belief in what they want.'

aS'They show passion for their plans rather than ridiculing the opposition most of the time.'

p8349
aS"I think that would be a terrible shame, at least in Alexander's case, as he's a very good Labour politician and MP."
p8350
aS"I sincerely hope his constituents aren't doing that just to put two fingers up to us English as that would be very short-sighted, and have genuinely considered Scottish Labour and the SNP's policies on their own merits, as well as the result of such votes on the makeup of the next parliament and who will form the next government."

p8352
aS'It sounds pretty self important to suggest that.'

p8489
aS'Wren-Lewis has written elsewhere that helicopter money is basically quantitative easing where (a) the central bank promises to never sell off the bonds it buys, so the government will definitely not have to pay interest on them and (b) the money created has to be used for fiscal stimulus and cannot be saved by the government.'
p8490
aS'Quantitative Easing has by and large been implemented by printing money and then buying bonds and other financial assets from banks.'

aS"That's very different from what happens when money is actually printed, and the differences are key."
p8506
aS'There are two differences: the first is that [prices are sticky and do not immediately adjust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity), which means that printing money causes output and employment to increase in the short run.'

p8508
aS'(Also, think of a simple supply and demand diagram - if demand increases and the price is fixed, all of the impact will be to increase output.'

aS'Debts also stay the same in nominal terms.'

aS"Printing money wouldn't stimulate an economy if it immediately increased all wages, prices, debts and savings by the same amount, but that's not what happens in real life."
p8513
aS'Given enough time, all prices will rise and output will be unchanged - money is neutral in the long run - but unemployment and recessions are short-run phenomena that can basically be cured by printing money.'
p8514
aS'And short-run here could be years or even more than a decade.'
p8515
aS"The aim of 'stimulus' is to create demand where there is none."

aS'Money is printed and spent.'

aS"The sector of the economy that is 'stimulated' diverts resources from elsewhere in the economy."
p8518
aS'If prices are not effected then manufacturers will not increase production in response to price signals.'

aS'Accordingly employment will not increase.'

aS'It takes what already exists and redistributes it.'
p8525
aS'It redistributes it away from ordinary people and to rich bankers and the state.\n'
p8526
aS'Stimulative policies work by bringing resources that are not in use into use.'
p8527
aS'Such resources include the additional millions of people who are unemployed in the recession, and corresponding capital.'
p8528
aS'They do not have to divert resources that are in use from some other part of the economy because not all resources are always in use, which happens because prices do not necessarily fall to clear all markets since they are sticky.'

aS'This is how it is possible for printing money to increase output.'
p8530
aS'Firms can increase output even if prices are sticky, in response to increasing demand.'

aS'That is the entire point of printing it.'

aS'If more people are employed to produce a product in response to government stimulus they will still need to be  fired when the stimulus ends.'

p8544
aS"If there were no such thing as unemployment then I wouldn't support stimulus."
p8545
aS'The central bank sets *one* price (the rate at which it lends to banks), and with QE tries to influence a few more.'

aS"I'm sceptical of ABCT for a few reasons: first because it is rejected by most professional economists, which is to a limited extent evidence against it; second because of Friedman's work on the plucking model,  where he found no correlation between the size of a boom and the size of the following bust, but a large correlation between the size of the bust and the following boom, which seems contrary to what ABCT would predict since a bust is caused by malinvestment in the preceding boom (it should predict bigger boom = more malinvestment = bigger bust, which doesn't happen); and third because of Bryan Caplan's convincing essay [Why I Am Not An Austrian Economist]( http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm).

p8563
aS"So again, why do we suddenly have money spewing from all directions when it's time to bribe the electorate, except one direction of course, that of welfare, where all the ideology driven cuts happened?"
p8564
aS"The Tories are trying to buy votes and putting money into welfare isn't going to do that for them."
p8565
aS"That said, welfare did (and still does) need reform and until every single person in the UK will be sufficiently better off in work than out of it - which isn't going to happen until the cost-of-living crisis is tackled - there will be more pain to come."
p8566
aS"What I can't get my head around is why, when people on low incomes look at those on welfare and ask why they're allowed to just about exist on it, why they demand welfare is lessened rather than demand their own circumstances are improved?"
p8567
aS'Why are we more obsessed with others than our own needs?'
p8568
aS"Even a minimum wage raise will do almost nothing for most low income people, as it'll be clawed back from the in work benefits - it's still a good thing as it's saves money while only costing those who are profiting from the work."
p8569
aS"&gt; when people on low incomes look at those on welfare and ask why they're allowed to just about exist on it, why they demand welfare is lessened rather than demand their own circumstances are improved?"

aS'Reasonably small constituencies and local representation is quite valuable to the functioning of democracy in a country that is quite politically diverse.'

aS'Your final point that "the Greens support [PR] because they know it would win then [sic] more seats, not because they believe it would make the country better" isn\'t a good argument against its implementation, as the only reason Labour and the Conservatives don\'t support PR is because it would *lose* them seats.'
p8672
aS"Interestingly, in bringing up this point, you've unwittingly given one of the key reasons why we need PR in this country: The motivations of political parties as independent bodies are the key determinants of government policy, rather than what's best for the people of this country."

p8823
aS'I know.'

aS'Basically?'

p8835
aS"In addition Israel would now suddenly have a problem where it now has to deal with double the population and it isn't a population of rich Jewish people immigrating in but poor Palestinians who were deprived of opportunities till now with the ensuing problems of terrorism, crime and general anger."

p8847
aS'What country is that?'
p8848
aS'The West Bank-which was part of Jordan'
p8849
aS'So this tangent is about "Israel wanting to expel the Palestinians" and then you say Israel is "occupying another country".'
p8850
aS'When asked which country you\'re referring to you say the West Bank which was "part of Jordan".'
p8851
aS"I've got this correct?"
p8852
aS'Are you actually saying this with a straight face or does your view of world history begin sometime in the 1960s?'
p8853
aS'No idea what you are saying-the West Bank was part of Jordan, which Israel invaded in 1967.'
p8854
aS'So yes then.'
p8855
aS'Your period of world history starts in the 60s.'

p8871
aS"In order for Palestinee to be free, Israel would have to fork out a sizeable amount of money for damages and force it's own settlers off Palestinian Land."
p8872
aS"Something no democratic government will do because it's a loss of votes and may require the Israeli army to force Israelis to comply sincee many settlers in the West Bank are among the more fanatical Jews."
p8873
aS'Or it can accept Palestinians as citizens and as equals which means Israel ceases to be a Jewish state.'
p8874
aS"It's effectively screwed itself over and it's two choices are both terrible. "
p8875

aS'Did I say that?'
p8887
aS'What I said was that *they* were the ones who caused him to flee by strategically occupying government buildings and storming the Parliament, not Euromaiden, and it was to *them* that members of Parliament began pledging allegiance.'

p9014
aS'How do you propose they do this?'
p9015
aS'They are already effectively under siege and more popular than ever because Hamas exploit the grievances the Palestinians have with the state of Israel.'

p9039
aS"You may disagree that Israel's actions warrant diplomatic or economic sanctions, and I respect that, but the original comment alluded to the idea that *should* Israel cross a red line, such action would amount to unwarranted collective punishment of the Israeli people, which I think is a nonsense argument."
p9040

p9082
aS"Surely the question is not whether it is right to economically sanction a country (because it is, depending on the situation), it is whether Israel's circumstances warrant the sanctioning?"

p9084
aS"The question is *if* we really don't agree with what Israel (or any country."

aS'*Mere affiliation of Israeli cultural workers to an Israeli cultural institution is therefore not grounds for applying the boycott*.'
p9131
aS"Obviously even this kind of cultural boycott is still controversial and people with otherwise similar political views on the topic can find themselves on either side - but it's not the simple rejection of anything cultural that is Israel-associated or Israeli-produced."

p9176

aS'They keep creeping into Palestine and the only reason their not under more sanctions is because of a combination of US support and fear of the antisemitism card being played.'
p9178
aS'If you disagree with their actions what other options do you have?'
p9179
aS'So, just to give a quick potted history of our relationship with Israel; we promised the territory of Palestine to both sides during the First World War, stood idly by while Jews got lynched and attacked in the 1920s, did pretty much nothing as the region descended into civil war, stopped Jews fleeing the holocaust from entering Israel, turned away boats of holocaust survivors literally coming from the camps after the war, abandoned the territory after training the Egyptian and Jordanian troops, convinced them to fight a war in 1956 then abandoned them as soon as it got slightly difficult for us, promised to ensure that a waterway remain free and open to them, did absolutely nothing when that waterway was blocked and armies massed on Israels border in 1967.'
p9180
aS'Our history of interaction with Israel has largely consisted of us standing idly by while people kill them or try to kill them while making promises to help ensure their security and then not doing any of that the second some trouble hits.'
p9181
aS"You can kinda understand why they don't give a single iota of a shit what we think about the situation or circumstances, and why they might interpret us launching a boycott as further evidence we hate them."
p9182
aS'How about we sit this one out and let the rest of the world handle it.'
p9183
aS'You talk about Israel not giving a shit about our opinion of the situation, why would they care if a boycott makes them think we hate them?'
p9184
aS"They're contradictory statements."
p9185
aS"I agree that it's dumb for the state to boycott Israel due to historic reasons, though on a personal level we should be able to and not just be called anti Semites."
p9186
aS'They care up until the point of actually impacting their policy towards the Palestinians.'
p9187
aS'It alienates people, harms trade, weakens any influence we might have over them, and stops us from having stronger ties.'
p9188
aS"Furthermore, it reinforces the anti-peace argument in Israeli politics (Israel is under threat, the other nations don't care about us and would throw us under the bus for a small bit of oil money, vote Benny)."
p9189
aS"As to your latter point; there are lots of people who aren't anti-semites who want to boycott Israel, but there are quite a few anti-Semites who do, and they often are some of the most vocal and public figures. "
p9190
aS"Mostly because if we don't interfere there is a non insignificant chance that its going to cause Palestine an an entity to cease to exist and with most of the population not integrated into Israel."
p9191
aS'We screwed up in the past substantially, and there is no way out of it unless both sides take a step back, getting that to happen requires us to condemn them when they work away from that goal and support them when they move towards it. '
p9192
aS"Firstly, Israel doesn't want to integrate more non-Jews that it has to; it is aware of the demographics and considering it lets its arabs vote and they want it to remain a Jewish state."
p9193
aS"Secondly, Palestine doesn't exist because it doesn't have a functioning government that recognises Israel and isn't an advocate of terrorism."
p9194
aS'That is the roadblock to a settlement at the moment.'
p9195
aS"Telling them to change their position isn't going to convince them of anything."

aS'They have seen the rise of ISIS and the election of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and they are quite understandably a bit spooked.'
p9199
aS'That is a perfectly reasonable reaction to longstanding stability going tits up.'
p9200
aS"Poking them with a stick and telling them to change isn't going to make them feel safer, it is going to make them feel more scared."
p9201
aS'More scared Israel is a less willing to have peace Israel.'
p9202
aS'Fourtly, why the fuck would they want our support or care about our criticism?'
p9203
aS'We have failed them entirely in the past.'
p9204
aS'The British electorate and state has shown itself to be more than willing to ignore Jews getting murdered when it is against our strategic interest to do nothing.'

p9225
aS"I understand why its happening, but I just don't see how its ever going to stop unless Israel just remains passive and takes the hits for an indefinite amount of time."

aS'Its only their genocide that counts - because isreal is a racist country.'
p9237

p9239
aS'And why is this our problem?'
p9240
aS'How does the existence or nonexistence of a Palestinian, or even an Israeli state affect us?'
p9241
aS"You could say the same from the Palestinian perspective - it was their country we promised to the Jews, since then we've sat idly by while they've been slaughtered and driven from their homes and made refugees."
p9242
aS'&gt; How about we sit this one out and let the rest of the world handle it.'
p9243
aS"We shouldn't ignore apartheid, we should try and help the situation."
p9244
aS'Like you say we are responsible for the creation of Israel we should play a role in coming to a solution to the conflict we sparked.'
p9245
aS'But I agree we should start from a neutral position, which is why ending the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and stopping selling arms to Israel is a good idea.'
p9246
aS"The cultural boycott I'm not so sure about, I'm not familiar with the details of the policy but I think boycotting Israel should be down individual choice as far as possible so I don't know why there needs to be a party policy on it."

aS'Specifically on the Israel and arms front, bad idea.'
p9248
aS'Not only do we sell Israel arms but we also have joint training in how to use certain technologies and techniques.'
p9249
aS'They are on the cutting edge of drone and security technology, and this is a positive and helpful relationship for us going forwards if we want to kill fewer people and work more effectively (Buckingham Palace, Heathrow and most modern security system use Israeli Technology).'
p9250
aS'Plus, money is nice, jobs are good, exports help our economy and a safer and more secure Israel is a happy Israel, while a scared, insecure and worried Israel kills more Palestinians and elects more crazies.'
p9251
aS'As to Palestine, wanting to help does not mean our actions would help or that our intervention is needed.'
p9252
aS'They have the Arab League and half of europe supporting them, and they are up against Israel and America.'

p9570
aS'We were told over and over again that there would be a "shy No vote" in the Scottish referendum, because people were ashamed to be voting No, that they thought they would be bullied, &amp;c &amp;c, exactly the same reasons I hear for Shy UKIP.'

aS'But at the end of the day, the polls were almost bang on, this shy No vote never materialised...'

aS'if it was mailed out where are all the non marked versions.'
p9626
aS'No idea.'
p9627
aS'Maybe it was taken from his hacked computer.'
p9628
aS'Or maybe it was written by someone else.'
p9629
aS"My point is that it's very unlikely that it was BOTH written by someone else, AND hacked from his computer, which is what he is saying."
p9630
aS'Because many rank Ed below Gordon Brown.'
p9631
aS'You might rank Ed below Brown, but Brown went in to 2010 as the architect of the British recession.'

aS'"trotting out old economic myths like they were fact".'

aS'There is neoclassical but that has nothing to do with neo-liberalism.'
p9661
aS"The green party attitude towards economics is similar to climate change deniers stance on climate science: it is wrong / an  evil conspiracy because it doesn't fit their political stance."
p9662
aS'Additionally the article author seems to believe Austrian economics is the leading branch of economics when in reality its pretty much a joke at this point.'
p9663
aS'I\'m using "neo-liberal economics" as the commonly used reference to international economic order since the 1980\'s and the domestic deregulation/denationalization of trade and industry.'
p9664
aS"My point was more that the author is calling out the faults of the accepted western modern consensus on economic policy, whatever you want to call it, without making a case for the Green's economic policy."
p9665
aS'Which is a shame, because there could have been scope in this article to actually make an argument for it instead of joining in the "bash everyone else" rhetoric that is so pervasive in British politics.'
p9666
aS"It's the same reason why I criticize Natalie Bennett in general."
p9667
aS'The Green\'s do genuinely have a fundamentally different approach to politics and economics, but they keep framing their arguments in the same old "we don\'t like austerity" wording.'
p9668
aS"Great, you don't like austerity, but please actually make a solid case for the alternative at the same time."

p9670
aS"I think even the Green party itself struggles to make the case compellingly enough, though I agree with you that it's unfortunately not a good reflection of some of the theories they are based on."
p9671
aS"Still, it's much easier to bash others as a way to inflate their vision and gain power without really having to put forward a coherent argument of your own. "

p9755
aS"It's not about the level of writing."

p9764
aS"We're perhaps into ideological differences here but our economy needs rich people, it's all very well to dream of redistributing the wealth to the poor like some sort of socialist Robin Hood but people are all too quick to forget that it's these evil rich folk who pay proportionately far more tax than anyone else.

p9786
aS'Last time around, they grossly underestimated capital requirements etc.'
p9787
aS'etc.'
p9788
aS'This is part of the problem with regulators in general -- they apply rules and standards to everyone, which if they get it wrong means that everyone fails.'

aS'I prefer presumed innocence of both parties until evidence is produced.'
p9832
aS'The green policy specifically says that even if the accident is caused by the pedestrian the liability lies with the driver if the pedestrian fits a certain category (elderly, child, disabled, etc...). '
p9833
aS'Do you have any idea how many pedestrians are killed every year by cars?'
p9834
aS'This is the bit from the manifesto:\n\n&gt; Change the culture of road justice and civil compensation with a road danger reduction approach.'
p9835
aS'A greater duty of care should be expected of drivers in reducing injury and intimidation of vulnerable road users.'
p9836
aS'Motor vehicle drivers should be presumed liable for injuries to pedestrians and cyclists.'
p9837
aS'If the casualty has contributed to the collision, compensation may be reduced, but not when the victim is a child, elderly (70+) or impaired.'
p9838
aS"More information on stricter liability:\n\nhttp://www.roadpeace.org/change/fair_compensation/stricter_liability/\n\nHolland has had this for years, and their society hasn't collapsed...\n\nChanging liability makes sense."
p9839
aS'The UK is a country in which the car is king.'
p9840
aS'Anything that changes that in favour of pedestrians and cyclists is a good step.'
p9841
aS'Holland is a much smaller society, so much easier and nimbler when rolling out changes to liability regimes.'
p9842
aS"My suspicion with only a modest background in legal topics is that altering the driver's liability in this way (i.e."
p9843
aS"in favour of strict liability) would have a significant impact on the insurance market, which under the current system, pedestrian's are not obliged to purchase whereas drivers are. "
p9844
aS"Holland's size has nothing to do with this."
p9845
aS'Besides, Germany has something similar. '
p9846
aS'Of course it does.'
p9847
aS'It might not be everything though.'
p9848
aS'For Germany it could work because people are better at following rules, I dunno.'
p9849
aS'Different ethics and so on.'
p9850
aS"I'm not saying it would be a bad idea, only that these are relevant issues to consider."
p9851
aS'See also this [link](https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/strict-liability-in-the-netherlands/) for more balance. '
p9852
aS'What makes you think my argument needed an article I totally agree with for balance?'
p9853
aS"I was mostly including it to elaborate on my own points for your benefit,  points you seemed to be distorting in the face of the other redditor's arguments against yours."
p9854
aS'E.g.'
p9855
aS'in the first paragraph:\n\n&gt; It is a myth that is really only believed outside the Netherlands: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is strict liability in the Netherlands, drivers are more cautious around cyclists, and that leads to more cycling\xe2\x80\x9d some even take this a step further adding \xe2\x80\x9cand because \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99 don\xe2\x80\x99t have strict liability, we\xe2\x80\x99ll never have such levels of cycling.\xe2\x80\x9d'

aS'There are a number of reasons why cycling is safer in other countries.'
p9857
aS'The way the law treats collisions between motorised vehicles and other road users is a big factor.'
p9858
aS"Simply changing liability wouldn't magically turn Birmingham into Utrecht."
p9859
aS'I never said it would.'
p9860
aS'Some people in this thread are just making out that presumed liability would destroy the British legal system, when theres no evidence that it would.'
p9861
aS'There is however evidence that it would stop hundreds of motorists a year from getting away with killing and maiming cyclists and pedestrians.'
p9862
aS'The fact is that the law and infrastructure in this country is very much suited to protecting the interests of motorists over everyone else that uses public roads.'
p9863
aS'That should change.'
p9864
aS'It is changing.'
p9865
aS'The trouble is that people are too easily influenced by the accidents that occur and therefore get into a sort of frenzy over how nothing is changing and people are dying.'
p9866
aS'Saying that " the law and infrastructure in this country is very much suited to **protecting the interests of motorists over everyone else** that uses public roads" is a rather exaggerated claim.'
p9867
aS'I think people who are implying that changing the liability will ruin the legal system are making the corresponding exaggerated claims to those your post(s) also imply.'
p9868
aS'They are right to point out the perceived injustice of placing a heavier liability on motorists when cyclists etc.'
p9869
aS'are still a minority.'
p9870
aS'Again this *is* changing (in some towns/cities/distrcits) but when it comes to these attitudes you have to account for the fact that cycling is a far less regulated activity than motoring.'
p9871
aS"You don't need a licence, insurance and so on to ride a bike."
p9872
aS'There is some sense in complaining that adding more regulation to an activity where sometimes matters are out of the hands of drivers.'
p9873
aS'Consider as well how different cities across the UK are geographically, demographically, and in terms of infrastructure costs/development opportunities (etc.'
p9874
aS'etc.'
p9875
aS'), and how this relates between countries as well as within them. '
p9876
aS'&gt;  Saying that " the law and infrastructure in this country is very much suited to protecting the interests of motorists over everyone else that uses public roads" is a rather exaggerated claim.'
p9877
aS'Why do you think this is exaggerated?'
p9878
aS'Sorry, I must sound like a stuck record, but its ridiculously easy to get away with killing someone with your car because of carelessness.'
p9879
aS'The attitude to cyclists deaths in this country is at best "Accidents happen" and at worst its victim blaming.'
p9880
aS'To be honest, motorists wanting cycling to be licensed, and to have compulsory insurance is just crazy.'
p9881
aS'It solves no problems other than the number of cyclists on the road... And it just shows the attitude of motorists in this country which is "don\'t worry, the insurance will sort that out".'
p9882
aS'A minor accident for a car that results in a broken wingmirror, or scratched pain, or a smashed window, can result in the death of a pedestrian or cyclist.'
p9883
aS'How about we focus on making the conditions safer rather than reducing personal financial risk?'
p9884
aS'Cycling in this country *is* getting better.'
p9885
aS"I've been cycling in London for 10 years, and conditions have improved substantially in that time."
p9886
aS'And that is mostly down to space being reserved for cyclists on roads, and due to the sheer number of cyclists there are now.'
p9887
aS'Motorists just have to be more aware of their surroundings now than they used to.'
p9888
aS"They can't just bumble around safe in the knowledge that if they do hit something, they're protected by their cage."
p9889
aS'Now theres just more risk of them severely injuring someone.'
p9890
aS'And that change in risk perception and an increased duty of care makes the roads safer.'
p9891
aS'Liability law would contribute to that.'
p9892
aS"No worries, it's simply a matter of evidence."
p9893
aS"It is no easier to 'get away with killing' a cyclist with your car out of carelessness than it is to find someone guilty of manslaughter by negligence."
p9894
aS"Actually, it's surprisingly easy *in law* to find someone guilty of ordinary manslaughter (i.e."
p9895
aS'not by negligence) whereas the burden for involuntary manslaughter (i.e.'
p9896
aS"by 'gross negligence' in the jargon) is correspondingly, and appropriately, high."
p9897
aS'This is what is *legally* but in terms of evidence and what is *provable* in a certain circumstance is a separate issue.'
p9898
aS"So what you're saying is that because there are more cyclists, they are at greater statistical risk?"
p9899
aS'If this is the line of reasoning then perhaps it does make sense to place some more requirements on cyclists, like a sort of road awareness training or that they need a minimum amount of protective gear/lighting etc.'
p9900
aS'I don\'t think everyone is as callous when it comes to driving that they say to themselves "It\'s OK if I hurt someone because I have insurance.'
p9901
aS'" I\'m also not aware of people arguing for cycling to be licensed or insured (probably be more costly and overly onerous to the cyclist) but it a valid feature of the debate worth exploring.'
p9902
aS'Making things safer is, I think, always an important priority.'
p9903
aS"The trouble is that 'personal financial risk' and 'liability' are interchangeable terms."
p9904
aS"But really 'increasing the duty of care' is quite impractical because it wouldn't do much that isn't already done by the common law of tort (i.e negligence)."
p9905
aS"And it wouldn't necessarily make roads safer."
p9906
aS"It might also prove redundant as driverless cars are phased in, but this is a longer term consideration riddled with it's own 'fault' and notions of 'responsibility' complexities for the law. \n\n"
p9907
aS"&gt; So what you're saying is that because there are more cyclists, they are at greater statistical risk?"
p9908
aS"Nope, I'm saying the opposite of that."
p9909
aS'Deaths per 100k (or whatever the measurement is) have been going down.'
p9910
aS'Though the absolute number has obviously gone up because numbers have gone up substantially.'
p9911
aS'And personally, I think it *feels* safer than it used to be.'
p9912
aS'Drivers take notice of cyclists in London more than they used to.'
p9913
aS'You get given more space when they overtake etc... Its my theory that the more amateur cyclists there are around, the more of a duty of care motorists feel they need to have on the roads.'
p9914
aS'Its also really important that government acts in a way which makes it clear that cyclists have just as much right to be on the roads as cars.'
p9915
aS'Proper cycling infrastructure and projects like London Cyclehire help with that.'
p9916
aS"In the mid 00's it was pretty common in London for cars to *intentionally* pass too close, or to just yell random abuse (you don't pay road tax!"
p9917
aS"you don't have insurance!"
p9918
aS'get on the pavement!).'
p9919
aS'This still happens, but its much rarer.'
p9920
aS'And thats mainly because specifically during rush hour, cyclists have reached a critical mass.'
p9921
aS'So when stopped at a red light, there will be a dozen cyclists rather than just a couple.'
p9922
aS'This makes it harder for frustrated motorists to "punish" those who they don\'t feel belong on the road.'
p9923
aS"Your knowledge of the law is clearly much better than mine, so I accept what you're saying, and can't argue with it."
p9924
aS'However, I think the outcome of RTA cases that involve cycling deaths speak for themselves.'
p9925
aS'Similarly, having witness to accidents and involved with two myself, I know some of what the attitude of the Police and Magistrates are to cyclists.'
p9926
aS"I know I've felt much safer in countries where cyclists are seen as equal or privileged road users along with pedestrians."
p9927
aS"Liability changes won't fix this, and might be a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, but I think dismissing the idea as being crazy (as some in this thread have made out) is wrong."
p9928
aS'The shift in attitude makes sense considering the changes happening and as you say motorists now accept (or at least are far more open to the idea) that the road is not just for them.'
p9929
aS'I understand your concern and interest with regards the police in these cases.'
p9930
aS'But you must also understand that yours, or those cases where it seems unfair, are not the only ones they deal with.'
p9931
aS"Some will try to take advantage of the 'he said, she said' situations that are all too common."
p9932
aS'Again this goes back to a matter of proof.'
p9933
aS'They have to remain sceptical to the claims of both parties, including cyclists.'
p9934
aS"It's kind of what [lawyers are for."
p9935
aS'](http://www.clearanswers.co.uk/road-accidents/cycle-accident-claim-news.htm)\n\nThis is why presumptions for stricter liability can be problematic.'
p9936
aS'This is also why those with interests that may not align completely with yours are by no means wrong in being critical of the idea. '
p9937
aS'&gt; This is also why those with interests that may not align completely with yours are by no means wrong in being critical of the idea.'
p9938
aS"Well I wouldn't be for implementing stricter liability blindly."
p9939
aS'I mean part of the reason why cycling is risky and why a motorist is more likely to be in an accident with a cyclist is because of the infrastructure.'
p9940
aS'There are many roads that encourage fast driving, or carelessness (loads of warning signs, roads wider than they need to be, white lines everywhere that remove responsibility for alertness from the driver).'
p9941
aS"And while it may be legal for cyclists to ride on them, they're just not suited to vehicles that move at between 10-25 mph."
p9942
aS"I'm thinking of urban, multi lane gyratories that are the only way for a cyclist to go from A to B. \n\nI think a lot more needs to be done before it would be sensible to change liability."
p9943
aS'But the idea shouldn\'t be dismissed as being "another mental green policy". '
p9944
aS'Ugh, sorry but the partisanship gets rather tiring.'
p9945
aS'Makes the political process/discourse irrational:\n\n&gt; white lines everywhere that remove responsibility for alertness from the driver.'
p9946
aS'I get what you mean but this is ridiculously abstract.'
p9947
aS"There's only so much you can design the system to work so that every single interest group is adequately, in their own subjective views, satisfied."
p9948
aS"This is quite clearly, to me, even when I'm not taking sides, the problem people have with the Green party -- many of their policies have this air of student-grade idealism about them, characterised by the mentality that if only we could design and make sure everything worked better then it simply would work better."

aS'" isn\'t enough. '
p9951

p9993
aS'Most cyclists are drivers.'

p9995
aS"It's quite a simple concept if you follow the thread of the conversation and the comments you were making with others... not everyone is as keen as you are on cycling as a means of transport -- that's the point at the most general level."
p9996
aS'But another thing you might wish to consider is the temporal dimension.'
p9997
aS"It doesn't take much imagination to realise that over time too many cyclists could equally put off other people cycling... Not just that, but changes in technology, or social attitudes... the list could be long, so it's quite silly to point to one increase now and then to simply repeat the build it and they will come clich\xc3\xa9, as if that's all there is to it."

p10041
aS'1.'

aS'Presumable liability fundamentally means that one should have to prove their innocence (an abhorrent concept).'
p10043
aS"In situations where two different people have different accounts (the cyclist or pedestrian who don't wish to admit they did something wrong) this puts he entire burden on the driver."
p10044
aS'2.'
p10045

aS"If a person misjudges the speed of a car (that isn't breaking the speed limit) and steps out and gets clipped by a wing mirror in the eyes of the Green Party the driver has to prove they weren't doing anything wrong (practically impossible) but even if they do if the person who stepped into their vehicle is elderly then they still have to give them compensation."

aS'Madness.\n'
p10048

aS"If someone has intolerably poor written communication or basic numeracy skills, spending some time as an unpaid intern isn't likely to be the solution; people who we can't do anything with will be weeded out by the interview process whether their CV is stuffed full of internships or not."
p11769
aS"When we hire someone, we always include a probation period on the contract; essentially a period of time where we can let them go with minimal fuss if things aren't working out; if the person can't manage a basic (potentially minimum wage) standard of work, it should become amply apparent during that time."

p12268
aS"Attempting to resolve the supply-and-demand housing issue by increasing the supply (which requires investment we don't have), rather than actually accepting that the demand is exceptionally high (and will remain so) is ludicrous."

p12271
aS'It\'s also astounding that the other politicians get away with suggesting that the only reason that issue is being discussed is because of the "Right wing rhetoric of UKIP", as opposed to the failure of successive governments to deal with this particular issue.'
p12272
aS"People seem to forget that UKIP's immigration quota is similar to the kind of numbers Cameron was promising to reduce net migration to."
p12273
aS'The difference is Cameron failed in that pledge because we cannot limit immigration from within the EU.'
p12274
aS'UKIP are promising the same type of reduction but also the means to achieve it, which for some reaosn makes them the "nasty party".'

aS'I think immigration could be cut.'
p12278
aS'No one has ever called me a racist, or that I blame everything on immigrants.'
p12279

p12280
aS'You can talk about immigration, literally every party leader in these debates has talked at length on immigration.'
p12281

aS'&gt;Farage is being accused of blaming everything on immigrants, as to a lorra lorra people that is exactly what it seems he is doing.'
p12284
aS'I said this earlier:\n\nHe spoke about immigration in relation to both housing and the NHS.'
p12285
aS"It's a relevant issue when the topic is how do we afford to build more homes and how do we continue to fund our NHS whilst protecting it from PRIVATIZASHUN."
p12286
aS"He has never suggested it's the sole reason for all our problems but he is the only person willing to significantly reduce immigration, and believes that this reduction could have a positive effect on these issues."
p12287
aS'You expect him to advocate a reduction in immigration but then accuse him of launching "tirades" when he gives reasons as to why we should do this.'
p12288
aS'I would like to remain in the EU, although enact stiffer policies on benefits, length of time allowed in country if unemployed etc.'
p12289
aS"I'm not privy to the exact labour needs and predicted labour needs of this country but I would try to enact a new immigration that tried to as accurately as possible cater for demand (obviously harder to do whilst remaining in the EU but I think that it is important) and this would probably see a drop in overall immigration."
p12290
aS"The problem is he sometimes is suggesting that it is the sole reason especially in these debates (which I understand is often the case of time, but it's telling that he often only focusses on the issue of immigration, it's clear that it's his focus), and if not the sole reason he usually mentions it first (Traffic jams, HIV immigrants etc)."
p12291
aS"I'm fine with talking about immigration, indeed Farage talking about immigration isn't in of itself bad, I just think the vision he's trying put forward where so much of the countries problems could be fixed through immigration is a bit charlatan."
p12292
aS"This probably stems from the fact that whilst I recognise too much immigration to be a problem, I don't think the current state of immigration contributes to this countries problems as much as Farage suggests. "

p12297
aS'Do you know that out of all the immigrants we have ever taken from any country, a total of 18,000 are actually Doctors.'
p12298
aS'Yes, as long as there are more immigrants who aren\'t doctors than there are immigrants who *are* doctors, the "stopping immigration would destroy our NHS" argument is complete nonsense, and immigration actually hurts the NHS by increasing demand.'
p12299
aS"Our families are all immigrants, it's the rate that is the issues."
p12300
aS'Lies.'
p12301
aS"Immigration doesn't increase the population, doesn't cause pressure on the NHS or schools, doesn't mean new houses need to be built ..."

aS'People living longer.'
p12305
aS'You know the main issue putting strain in the NHS?'
p12306
aS'Elderly people bed blocking.'

aS'OR we can politicise the NHS, make it a political football and forget about the real issues. '

aS"Why can't immigration and an ageing population both be 'real issues'?"
p12309
aS'My view is that immigration is a good thing for the UK.'
p12310
aS'Particular healthcare - many areas would close if non-indigenous peoples were barred from entry and work.'
p12311
aS'So the big issue, the elderly, is completely overshadowed by this non-issue.  '
p12312
aS'Speaking as an immigrant, how would an Australian style points based system bar necessary workers in sectors like the NHS from living, working and eventually gaining citizenship in the UK?'
p12313
aS"It wouldn't. "
p12314
aS'&gt;My view is that immigration is a good thing for the UK\n\nImmigration is only good if the immigrants are trained professionals coming to help in a sector that needs employees.'
p12315
aS'The UK has far too many non-professionals coming in, and it has been proven they cost us a lot more than professionals (who actually make us money and contribute).'
p12316
aS'True, but the point Nigel Farage makes is to have a system whereby the UK lets in people based on the skills required at that time i.e.'

aS'That the only solution is to import labour from Eastern Europe and outside the EU?'
p12326
aS"These figures you're chucking about, 14% of workers in hospitals are migrants or whatever."
p12327
aS"Could it not be the case that we've just got so many immigrants and some of them have got jobs in hospitals?"
p12328
aS"And maybe if they weren't here that 14% would just be replaced by British employees?"
p12329
aS"I'm not saying I'm right, I don't know anything about the nhs."
p12330
aS"I'm just asking, how do we know those jobs HAVE to be filled by migrants?"
p12331
aS"If there's a labour shortage couldn't you just ease restrictions?"
p12332
aS'Australia, NZ etc.'
p12333
aS"do this whenever there's a low skill labour shortage in sectors like fruit picking, construction etc."
p12334
aS'and get a lot of migrants from nearby 3rd world countries in the pacific region.'
p12335
aS"They do the same when there's a lack of medium/high skill employment and get a lot of graduates from India, China, Korea, Sri Lanka etc."

p12344
aS'If HMRC were the big issue of the day Farrage would be sitting there saying HMRC is being destroyed by immigrants.'
p12345
aS'But the big issue for me is that immigration is a non-issue in the NHS - number one is the elderly, by a country mile.'

aS'So call him out on it.'

aS'Sadly very few politicians have the courage to say anything which my upset elderly people.'

aS"We can't do anything about people living longer and increasing demand."
p12356
aS'We can do something about increasing demand from immigration.'
p12357
aS'Yes we can - we increase supply... or restore funding to local authority run nursing homes.'
p12358
aS'Easy?'
p12359
aS'Or we can bar "immigrants" from the UK, lose 14% of the NHS workforce and decrease supply.'
p12360
aS'you see?'

aS"One works, one doesn't."
p12362
aS"But hay, don't let that stop your xenophobic jingoism... "

p12373
aS'Honestly, despite what everyone thinks there is a process to enter the UK from outside of the EU.'

aS'It is a lot easier for employers to get someone from the UK than to look abroad for labour.'
p12375
aS'Cut immigration sure, but I just entirely disagree with the 30,000 figure as it seems to be plucked out of somebodies arse and seems to ignore the need for unskilled labour from abroad that this country does have. '

p12486
aS'And immigration.'
p12487
aS'If you read the article, it explains that the vast majority of the increase in the UK population was due to immigration - 60% to be precise. '
p12488
aS'The population growth rate is the birth rate minus the death rate.'
p12489
aS'Then you add in (or subtract) net immigration/emigration.'
p12490
aS'So, other factors being equal: lower death rate, higher population growth rate.'
p12491
aS"Life expectancy hasn't increased dramatically since 2004."

p12505
aS'So are the hospitals.'
p12506
aS"The schools (in my area 80% of people didn't get their first choice of primary school)."
p12507
aS'The doctors surgeries.'
p12508
aS'Everything. '

p12515
aS'Pretty soon none of us will have to work.'
p12516
aS"I think the self congratulatory UKIP voters on this sub (and I'm sure in the real world) would be surprised if they knew that quite a lot of people can recognise that immigration plays some part to play in the pressure on the NHS, schools etc."
p12517
aS'They just think that the evidence would suggest that there are a whole myriad reasons as to why there is pressure on the NHS, a lack of houses, etc.'
p12518
aS'And immigration is only one of those reasons, and that a lack of a response to the demands that immigration places on this country is just as big a problem, if not more of a problem.'
p12519
aS'We had a labour shortage in the early 2000s, Labour opened the gates to try and get round that, whilst failing to deal with the consequences of it.'

p12521
aS'They disagree with him because of the way he presents his arguments.'
p12522
aS"Miliband (who I don't usually agree with) put it well with something along the lines of 'Farage plays to peoples fears, rather than responding to them'."
p12523
aS"He's presenting a false situation, he's selling a vision of the future where everything will be fine and dandy if only we had less immigrants."
p12524
aS"It's far too simplistic.\n\n"
p12525
aS'&gt; They disagree with him because of the way he presents his arguments.'
p12526
aS"I agree that some of Farage's bedside manner could use work but you can't really accuse him as the sole exponent of fear based rhetoric - the left wing bloc keeps shouting out doomsday predictions if the Tories get back in just like they did in 2010."
p12527
aS'As do the Tories.'
p12528
aS'None of the parties are particularly incompetent or going to destroy the country.'
p12529
aS"It's a bit hypocritical to call out Farage for doing it when everyone else is as well."
p12530
aS'&gt; there are a whole myriad reasons as to why there is pressure on the NHS, a lack of houses, etc.'
p12531
aS"That doesn't mean you can't optimise immigration though?"
p12532
aS'Why ignore it prolong such an argument instead of just have an honest discussion about it and get it out of the way so you can discuss other issues.'
p12533
aS'It concerns a lot of people so much that UKIP is polling somewhere near 20% in some polls, surely the best way to kill them would just be to acknowledge their often quite legitimate concerns rather than just laughing at Farage being a clown and disregarding the quite centrist voters following him because everyone wants to brand them as crypto nazi racists.'
p12534
aS"He's not the only exponent of fear based rhetoric, I just feel (and I'm sure many others do as well considering his perception) that he 's #1 at doing it."
p12535
aS"In saying that I don't support the others doing it either and I'm always disappointed when I see it happening."
p12536
aS"I don't think anyone is laughing about the issue of immigration anymore, or calling people clowns about it."
p12537
aS"I'm all for an honest debate over immigration."
p12538
aS"Personally I don't think we should leave the EU but we could cut immigration from outside the EU, and make EU immigration here based on several conditions (change benefits paid out, length of stay allowed if unemployed etc)."
p12539
aS"I also personally feel that Farage's pursuit over immigration, despite bringing it to the forefront of literally every debate is no longer the right approach."
p12540
aS"It's intellectually dishonest to constantly launch into a tirade on immigration without examining the other factors."
p12541
aS"Like I said previously it's a false image and I don't think it's an honest discussion."
p12542
aS"By all means talk about immigration, just be clear that 'fixing it' is not going to magically 'fix' this countries problems."
p12543
aS'&gt; we could cut immigration from outside the EU\n\nAs someone from outside the EU this is my biggest problem with the left wing bloc.'
p12544
aS"How is it fair that someone from outside the EU who's studied here, who is more skilled and able to contribute more to society than someone from within the EU should not get a fair chance at living, working and eventually getting citizenship in this country?"
p12545
aS'For many people in countries like Australia and NZ the UK is like an ancestral homeland.'
p12546
aS'Surely these nations merit a reciprocal free movement arrangement more than Spain or Portugal?'
p12547
aS'There are far more cultural connections and with the anglosphere and commonwealth countries than most of Europe especially Eastern Europe.'
p12548
aS'Why should an Indian doctor not have the same chance to work here as a Polish one?'
p12549
aS"If it's just about the economic impact of leaving the EU I feel like a lot of anti UKIP voters should stop playing the moral outrage card and just say they don't really care about fair immigration laws, just the bottom line and economic benefit being in the EU gives."
p12550
aS'Then we can have a fair argument about how to position the economy going forward (be an early leader in relationships with the developing world or stick with an ageing, declining EU with potential trading bloc benefits).'
p12551
aS'You are right in that do have to cut immigration from outside the EU because you simply cannot control EU immigration with the free movement principle but that lack of border control just seems bizarre to me.'
p12552
aS'You can have a points based immigration system like Australia, like NZ, like Canada - all quite tolerant, left wing nations - and still have high levels of immigration just more fair and controlled immigration.'
p12553
aS'If we built enough roads, schools and hospitals, then there would be no need to restrict non-EU immigration (in addition to the EEA migration) the way that we do now.'
p12554
aS'Oh, and maybe tone down the rhetoric a bit so that immigrants are not made scapegoats.'
p12555
aS'&gt; tone down the rhetoric \n\nAgreed.'
p12556
aS'Creates an unpleasant climate.'
p12557
aS'&gt; If we built enough roads, schools and hospitals\n\nSure but you have to pay for them.'
p12558
aS'Which means more taxation or borrowing or reduced spending in other areas.'
p12559
aS"None of us work for the treasury or are tax lawyers/accountants so we can't really speak with much authority about the finer details of costing."
p12560
aS"Now on the left you may argue that spending through taxation/borrowing is fine if it's investment and leads to long term growth and on the right you may claim it's reckless to spend money you don't have and it burdens future generations with interest and debt repayments."
p12561
aS"There are many competing theories but the the two major parties seem to be following similar advice that deficit reduction and eventually debt reduction once we're in surplus whilst stimulating the economy and making some cuts is the best way forward."
p12562
aS"The only real difference is the balance in between how much you're willing to cut spending to quickly cut debt/deficit and how much you think that taxpayers in good conscience should pay regardless of the economic harm of tax/borrowing to contribute to help people who rely on public sector services like welfare benefits, NHS, education etc."
p12563
aS'Both parties will claim that despite variations in their spending priorities they can do a better job based on them being better/more efficient at administering these departments and services.'
p12564
aS"I don't really think the general public can say with any authority they know with impunity that this minister or that minister is actually the right man to lead this service or that."
p12565
aS'But people have to form opinions on available info so fair enough.'
p12566
aS'Now importantly even if we do agree that all that borrowing/taxation, spending and building should happen how do you judge how much is needed?'
p12567
aS"Even with open borders just within the EU it's impossible to forecast migration patterns with any accuracy."
p12568
aS"Labour though it'd be 5-15k, ended up being 300k."
p12569
aS"If you extend this to the rest of the world there's no way to predict."
p12570
aS'There are so many variables like the conditions in each and every county (each of which has as complex problems as UK) as well as our own prosperity attracting them.'
p12571
aS"Even if we somehow magically perfectly forecast what's necessary it takes a long time to build."
p12572
aS'In the meantime, in the next parliament, over the next 5 years these policies still harm these  non EU migrants, they still put pressure on people living in the UK.'

aS'How do public services like hospitals built on borrowed money generate long term revenue to pay for their interest/debt repayments?'
p12581
aS'This just burdens the next generation.'
p12582
aS'If you forecast economic growth based on a larger more productive population, then there is no problem borrowing to pay for additional infrastructure.'
p12583
aS"That's investment and it's the constructive way of spending your deficit (so that your economy grows and tax receipt increase in the future)."
p12584
aS'The fact that UKIP ignores the real problem in the UK (which is chronic under-investment) is indicative of their real motive - to exit the EU.'
p12585
aS"I see where you're coming from but I'm highly sceptical of any spending administered by SNP, Plaid Cymru or Greens and would be very wary of any sort of coalition/confidence+supply agreement they strike with labour."
p12586
aS'I think, like most, I\'d rather the LD\'s hold the balance of power and moderate either major party to the centre but I\'d take the risk of 5 more years of austerity and as you\'d put it, "under investment" with UKIP/LD whispering in the Tory\'s ears than 5 years of reckless spending with the leftist bloc influencing Miliband.'
p12587
aS"At the end of the day, for me it comes to very little difference between Labour and the Tories but I'm more inclined to go right wing purely because they're offering a constitutional referendum."
p12588
aS"I don't care for the march of the EU towards political union and federalism and as bad as British bureaucracy is - from having worked in EU institutions - it's a better, less corrupt government than Brussels."

aS"What is too simplistic is the general term of 'immigrant'."
p12592
aS'UKIP have been keen to point out that their issue is with *unskilled* immigrants.'

aS"That's why you'll hear them talking about our immigration policy (or rather, the EU's) being the real issue."
p12594
aS'No-one can deny the contribution *some* migrants give this country, but frankly there is an element of exploitation of unskilled foreign labour.'
p12595
aS"The fact is that we can't just keep growing forever, and since *all* of our population growth is now attributable to immigration (UK birth rate is &lt; 2 per woman) we've simply got to look there in order to get some control of the situation."

p13657
aS'Well your original criticism was about me incorrectly reading between the lines.'
p13658
aS"Well he's just pretty much confirmed what I was saying. "
p13659
aS'Okay, read it all now, (sorry for the wait).'
p13660
aS'Yes he has confirmed what you said, that he thinks racism has all but gone from employment decisions nowadays due to legislation.'
p13661
aS'Not completely but nearly.'
p13662
aS'Also, upon re-reading, I do need to apologise as part of my argument was based on getting you confused with /u/pandiculater, so sorry about that.'
p13663
aS'I did almost the same thing that I said you did! \n\n'
p13664
aS'Yeah no worries, hope you had a nice dinner!'
p13665
aS'Nothing to do with me, I think you mean /u/pandiculater'
p13666
aS'Oh I do apologise.'
p13667
aS'Yes I did mean him/her.'
p13668
aS'Sorry about that!'
p13669
aS'Edited my post to sort it out.'
p13670
aS'No problem, thanks for fixing it.'
p13671
aS"Let me catch up with the conversation after I've finished making dinner and i'll write a proper reply then :)"
p13672
aS"If racism does exist, and I'm sure it does, you know what doesn't help....\n\nPeople like you who NEVER shut the fuck up about it."
p13673
aS'You are the reason that people are sick to death of the whole race issue.'
p13674
aS"It's like we can't say or do anything anymore without someone like you piping up about how unfair it is."
p13675
aS"You would get a lot further with changing people's prejudices if you just act and behave like a normal member of society."
p13676
aS'But by going on about race all the time and how unfair the whole system is, how do you think people are going to react to that?'
p13677
aS'I don\'t know what colour you are but the reaction is going to be something like this: "Bloody *(insert derogatory name for ethnic group here)* never stop whinging"'
p13678
aS'I\'ve not use the word "fair" once in this context.'
p13679
aS'My point has only ever been that the legislation exists for a reason, and getting rid of it would be a mistake.'
p13680
aS'But yeah, fuck me for being uppity right?'
p13681
aS'Jesus christ...'
p13682
aS"&gt;I mean you've got Leanne Wood complianing that Wales can't hire Indian doctors and this is somehow against UKIP's stance on immigration?"
p13683
aS"Doesn't make sense."
p13684
aS"50,000 less Polish strawberry pickers means 50,000 more skilled people 'of colour'."
p13685
aS'I did note that bit by Miss (Mrs?'
p13686
aS') Wood and it was the main reason for me posting the above question.'
p13687
aS'How would a controlled system stop the doctors and nurses we need from being hired from abroad?'
p13688
aS"Answer - it wouldn't, but you wouldn't think this listening to Wood/Milliband/Sturgeon et al."
p13689
aS"It worries me because they haven't evaluated the issue on facts but instead taken a visceral approach."
p13690
aS"This is not what I expect from politicians, it's undertandable in middle-management and office gossip but not from people that claim to be able to make a real difference."
p13691
aS"To be fair even in a point based system, if you're limiting immigration to 30,000 (give or take), you will probably reach a point where you're turning people away even if they are skilled, not only that but by all accounts we do need unskilled immigration as well."
p13692
aS'Arguably not in the numbers we have had, but the NHS, and nursing homes do massively rely on the work of relatively unskilled immigrants acting as porters, cleaners, caterers etc. '
p13693
aS"UKIP are a hap handed campaign directed at people who don't understand a damn thing about the cultures they invite into the country."
p13694
aS'It is designed to use the cultural friction generated by interactions between different religious communities (particularly Muslims with the bogieman of Sharia) as a boot to smack around the Germans.'
p13695
aS"It's an old political approach, but it is very easy to critique."
p13696
aS'Do you not agree it goes the other way?'
p13697
aS'I am not denying other political parties will not brandish and discredit UKIP as against immigration, but UKIP does the same back to other parties.'
p13698
aS'Being in favor for the Free Movement of Labour, is not "open borders", its just a lesser controlled border system, in which people who study and work in this country do not require a visa.'
p13699
aS'They still have to go through passport control.'
p13700
aS'All parties attack and discredit each other, the only thing I would say is about UKIP immigration cap as maybe an example of a physical stopping of immigration.'
p13701
aS'But yea.'
p13702
aS'The only thing I would say is true about UKIP is European Xenophobia, which seems to be built around this idea that "anything is acceptable as long as its against the EU", and this comes in the form of voting against EU laws on cross European Human trafficking laws, drug laws, relations with Russia and other far right wing parties though out Europe.  '
p13703
aS'&gt;The only thing I would say is true about UKIP is European Xenophobia, which seems to be built around this idea that "anything is acceptable as long as its against the EU"\n\nThe EU =/= Europe\n\nI like Europe and despise the EU.'
p13704
aS'I can\'t believe he actually typed that, whenever Farage talks about Europe he always begins it with "we love Europe, we want to co-operate with Europe, we want to be friends with Europe".'
p13705
aS"You can't be xenophobic towards an institution. "
p13706
aS'&gt; "we love Europe, we want to co-operate with Europe, we want to be friends with Europe".'
p13707
aS'Yea just like the Labour party starts with "We are a working class party" its all just lies.'
p13708
aS'Farage as never shown any respect towards europe.'
p13709
aS'His party treat them with suspicion and disrespect.  '
p13710
aS'Farage has shown respect to Europe.'
p13711
aS'Nobody buys this conflation of Europe with the political entity known as the European Union.'
p13712
aS'&gt; Farage has shown respect to Europe.'
p13713
aS'By?'
p13714
aS'Calling all eastern europeans criminals, coming here from "ex-soviet countries" trying to undermined our way of life.'
p13715
aS'Suggesting eastern Europe is Russias back garden and nothing to do with us.'
p13716
aS'Does not sound very respectful to me. '
p13717
aS'Do you really want me to go over the various ways in which your beloved European Union treats the citizens it claims to represent with utter contempt? '
p13718
aS'Yes ok I do, but I want you to come up with them where they are ideas that whole or at least the majority of Europeans disagree with.'
p13719
aS'Because remember the British are only a small part of the whole union and its the job of the EU to look out and make policy based for the whole EU not just Britain. '
p13720
aS'The referendums on the European Constitution, with Ireland in particular mind here, and its subsequent renaming to the Treaty of Lisbon and its passing without the democratic mandate that was originally going to be a part of it.'
p13721
aS'EU constitution was scrapped by the EC when it realized it was not going to pass.'
p13722
aS'But many of the NATION STATES, still wanted a agreement because some of the ideas in it they supported.'
p13723
aS'So the EC produced the Lisbon Treaty which was a watered down version, it then said to the NATION STATES, you can have referendums if you want or you can just sign it.'
p13724
aS'Most NATION STATES chose to sign it rather then have referendum (was there choice).'
p13725
aS'The EC has no legislation to tell a state how it chooses to sign treaties or not, that is the power of the nation state to hold a referendum or not.'
p13726
aS'If your angry at the democratic mandate, you should vent you anger at your government not the EU.'
p13727
aS'Unless of course you want the EU to force Nation states to have referendum? \n '
p13728
aS"Precisely: treating the citizens of Europe with total contempt when they realised that it'd be rejected."
p13729
aS'Because they might make the *wrong choice*.'
p13730
aS'Utterly appalling.'
p13731
aS'Why do you hate the European peoples so much that you deny them their democratic rights?'
p13732
aS'Why do you choose to sneak things in the back door instead?'
p13733
aS"What is with you and the EU's European xenophobia?"
p13734
aS"You don't appear to understand treating the peoples of Europe with respect."
p13735
aS"&gt; Precisely: treating the citizens of Europe with total contempt when they realised that it'd be rejected."
p13736
aS'Because they might make the wrong choice.'
p13737
aS'Utterly appalling.'
p13738
aS'Ok but that has NOTHING to do with the EU though.'
p13739
aS'I mean states like the UK make decisions all the time with out the consent of its people.'
p13740
aS'Is this what your annoyed about, becuase that is westminster.'
p13741
aS'&gt; Why do you hate the European peoples so much that you deny them their democratic rights?'
p13742
aS"I don't I support federalism, as does the EU, as I said the EU had referendums in France, Spain, Ireland, it realized the treaty was going to be rejected so it dropped it."
p13743
aS'Only after did the Nation States, France, UK etc.'
p13744
aS'tell the EC they wanted some agreements.'
p13745
aS"The EC was perfectly happy to move on, but the Nation States didn't want to, they wanted a agreement."
p13746
aS'&gt;  Why do you choose to sneak things in the back door instead?'
p13747
aS'Again the EU does not, Westminster on the other did, along with the other nation states.'
p13748
aS"&gt; What is with you and the EU's European xenophobia?"
p13749
aS'I have none if anything I have a xenophobia of elites of nation states getting in the way the democracy in the EU.'
p13750
aS'You do know that most democratic deficit in the EU is created by Nation State elites rejection of giving more power to the European Parliament?'
p13751
aS'You know thats the case, that our government does not want the European parliament the voice of the European people to have more power, because its afraid of giving power to European citizens including ourselves.'
p13752
aS"&gt;  You don't appear to understand treating the peoples of Europe with respect."
p13753
aS'I do, I give them so much respect I am happy to be be part of Union with them.'
p13754
aS'I respect them enough to trust that union to create laws that are in the interest of all of us. '
p13755
aS"I just don't understand your appalling xenophobia towards the people of the EU, you treat them with no respect at all."
p13756
aS'Why do you hate democracy?'
p13757
aS'Why are you so afraid of letting the people of Europe have their say in referendums?'
p13758
aS'Why do you collude with nation states to deny the people their say and do things even when they say no?'
p13759
aS'You say that France wants federation, but the FN just came first in the only elections they have to the EU.'
p13760
aS"Why don't you respect the people of France?"
p13761
aS'&gt; Why do you hate democracy?'
p13762
aS'Why are you so afraid of letting the people of Europe have their say in referendums?'
p13763
aS'Why do you collude with nation states to deny the people their say and do things even when they say no?'
p13764
aS"I don't, I told you I support a federal system, I support giving powers to the EU to make nation states have referendums and have to produce democratic mandates, are you?"
p13765
aS'What your telling me is you would support giving more powers to the EU so they can force nation states to have to have referendum on treaty changes?'
p13766
aS'Yes or No you would support that?'
p13767
aS'&gt; You say that France wants federation, but the FN just came first in the only elections they have to the EU.'
p13768
aS'Yes but pro-EU parties still got a majority in the election as did across Europe.'
p13769
aS'FN may have been the single biggest party, but the Pro-EU parties out number them still with the most combined support.'
p13770
aS"Why don't you respect those people view? "
p13771
aS'&gt; I support giving powers to the EU to make nation states have referendums and have to produce democratic mandates, are you?'
p13772
aS'oh, you mean like the ones that were held on whether to not to have a european constitution?'
p13773
aS"That you chose to ignore because they weren't convenient and because of your blatant european xenophobia?"
p13774
aS'&gt; oh, you mean like the ones that were held on whether to not to have a european constitution?'
p13775
aS'They weren\'t ignored, after the french result the EC went "hmm it looks like there is not a lot support for this we better drop it" and they did.'
p13776
aS'Do we have a European constitution?'
p13777
aS'No. \n\n'
p13778
aS'No, they renamed it the Treaty of Lisbon and proceeded regardless.'
p13779
aS'No, as I told you but you seem to not be reading my posts.'
p13780
aS'The Treaty of Lisbon came about after the EU was asked by the Nation States, by the UK, France, Germany etc.'
p13781
aS'To put together a treaty which had some of the reforms in the constitution agreement but was different.'
p13782
aS'After which the EC put together the Lisbon treaty at the request of the Nation States.'
p13783
aS'The EC then asked the Nations states to do what ever process they needed to accept and sign the agreement.'
p13784
aS'Its not the EU position or power to tell a nation state whether it should have a referendum or not.'
p13785
aS'That power is with the Nation state. '
p13786
aS'&gt; The EC then asked the Nations states to do what ever process they needed to accept and sign the agreement\n\nIncluding riding rough-shot over what the people had already told them.'
p13787
aS'That choice was down to the Nation state or government.'
p13788
aS'Your trying to point the problem at the EU, but its not going to work because the EU had nothing to do with a state choosing to sign the agreement.'
p13789
aS'The Lisbon Treaty was agreed and signed because the leaders of the  nations state wanted to sign it.'
p13790
aS"If your mad they didn't ask you opinion then you should be having ago at the Labour Government not the EU."
p13791
aS'The democratic deficit in the EU is all nation state created. '
p13792
aS'I am also mad at the labour government, but the fact is that the people expressed their democratic will and the EU, who were heavily involved in lobbying governments and formulating the treaty, decided to ignore the will of the people.'
p13793
aS'Your european xenophobia is clouding your thinking, the european people have a right to express themselves and be respected.'
p13794
aS"Why you and the EU can't understand that, I'm not sure."
p13795
aS"If what you're saying is true, that the EU had nothing to do with it, then why didn't they decide to put the brakes on their failed project?"
p13796
aS'Why did they continue to push for a new treaty?'
p13797
aS'&gt; but the fact is that the people expressed their democratic will and the EU.'
p13798
aS'I question this because the out come was not totally clear, 18 accepted 2 disagreed and the other 7 never got round to making a decision.'
p13799
aS'The problem was that after France and the Netherlands the nations states began to lobby for a Reform treaty which kept the previous treaty agreements instead of a new constitution.'
p13800
aS'&gt; Your european xenophobia is clouding your thinking, the european people have a right to express themselves and be respected.'
p13801
aS'Haha your trying so hard to turn this on me but with little success, as I told you 18 states agreed to the constitution, states like Spain held referendums and accepted the treaty.'
p13802
aS'However not all states a agreed so it was scrapped and replaced with with a different treaty which all states could agree with.'
p13803
aS'The EU decided that the treaty was not going to succeed with out all members agreeing so it was scrapped and replace by the Reform treaty which the Nation States wanted.'
p13804
aS"&gt; then why didn't they decide to put the brakes on their failed project?"
p13805
aS'Why did they continue to push for a new treaty?'
p13806
aS'Look i know your finding this hard, but I will say it one more time so you can get it.'
p13807
aS'The Nation States wanted a reform treaty so they pressured the EU to create one and it did. \n\n\n'
p13808
aS'&gt; However not all states a agreed so it was scrapped and replaced with with a different treaty which all states could agree with.'
p13809
aS'Oh, so you do admit that the treaty was the constitution without the democratic mandate?'
p13810
aS'&gt; The EU decided that the treaty was not going to succeed with out all members agreeing\n\nYou mean without getting a democratic mandate, because it despises the opinions of the European people, just as you do.'
p13811
aS'&gt; Oh, so you do admit that the treaty was the constitution without the democratic mandate?'
p13812
aS'Huh?'
p13813
aS"That's not even remotely what I said..... ok so for a treaty to be accepted in the EU it needs all members to agree, now for the treaty on the Constitution after 18 had agreed and 2 had not, the EU decided to scrap the treaty."
p13814
aS'The nation states however did not want this as there were some important things in the original treaty they wanted to be passed.'
p13815
aS"So the EU was lobbied by the Nation states to produce a new treaty with basically all the stuff that they did agree on from the old treaty, and just not the stuff they didn't agree on."
p13816
aS'EU presented the new treaty and ask nations to decide to the sign it or not, some had referendums others just signed it, like the UK.'
p13817
aS'The EU when it comes to treaty only needs to mandates to pass the treaty, approval from the European parliament, which it had and approval of the nation states which it had.'
p13818
aS'The Treaty was passed with a full democratic mandate.'
p13819
aS'&gt; You mean without getting a democratic mandate, because it despises the opinions of the European people, just as you do.'
p13820
aS'No I mean be the nation states, because that is how the EU works, it need approval from the EP, and the Nation state.'
p13821
aS"Now personally I don't like this set up and most Federalist want to Nation state go so we the European people can have a direct say instead of the nation states, and that reform is coming but it takes it time because nation states and anti-EU parties keep blocking the reform."
p13822
aS'You should join JEF young european federalists if you are concerned with the democratic mandate, they are a group pushing to make the EU system more accountable and more directly democratic rather then through the nation state system.      '
p13823
aS"&gt; So the EU was lobbied by the Nation states to produce a new treaty with basically all the stuff that they did agree on from the old treaty, and just not the stuff they didn't agree on\n\nSo they saw that it would not be passed because of that pesky thing that you and the EU loathe, democracy and the European peoples, and they decided to do it anyway."
p13824
aS'Glad you cleared that up for me.'
p13825
aS'&gt; You should join JEF young european federalists if you are concerned with the democratic mandate, they are a group pushing to make the EU system more accountable and more directly democratic rather then through the nation state system.'

p13835
aS'This is the problem with UKIP is that they say they have no problem with Europe or Europeans, but what they don\'t have is any respect for Europe and Europeans, they continuously are suspicious, they continually dis-respect countries by calling them eastern Europe "Ex-Soviet States" when the cold war ended 25 years ago, and while they supposedly stand for "sovereignty of the state" continue support Russias illegal occupations of other sovereign countries. \n\n '

p14549
aS'Well, yes.'
p14550

p14551
aS'"The immigration system" is literally just the means by which immigrants come in.'
p14552
aS'If you say "the immigration system has caused a strain on the NHS", you are saying that the additional people brought in by said system (immigrants) are to blame.'

p14554
aS"Immigrants don't chose the system on which to immigrate."
p14555

aS"What you're saying is this:\n\nSystem of immigration -&gt; Too many immigrants -&gt; Certain institutions unable to function properly\n\nI disagree with the logic entirely, but if we are to use that logic, it is the thing the system causes which is the problem, i.e."
p14558
aS'too many immigrants.'

aS'It is not a discussion of abstracts but of people.'
p14561
aS'Thus, it is supposedly the fault of too many immigrants causing fault.'
p14562
aS'If we reverse the preposition, that less immigration would improve services, we are still left with the variable being additional people, i.e.'
p14563
aS'immigrants.'
p14564
aS'I understand that you are trying to shift blame of failure away from the people themselves, which has nasty implications, to the government(s) that allow it so as to make the argument seem less harsh, but whichever way you cut it the implication in any case is that immigrants are causing problems.'
p14565
aS"I'd argue that you cannot blame people for acting in a way that is legal and is in their own best interests as they perceive them."
p14566
aS'Be it tax avoiders or immigrants, people will do what is best for them if the law allows it.'
p14567
aS"I'd argue it is the job of the government to make the things which make sense for individuals to be the same things that make sense for the country."
p14568
aS'Oh I agree absolutely.'
p14569
aS"But if you're closing a tax loophole its because you don't want people avoiding tax, and for an immigration system the objection is people using the system."
p14570
aS"People don't like tax-avoiders, hence why nobody objects when you build a political platform that shuts them out."
p14571
aS"But it's not strange, and it's quite depressing how some people can't seem to differentiate between a legislative mechanism and an abstract group of people."
p14572
aS'Though I suspect it boils down to wilful dishonesty rather than illiteracy from the perpetrator.'
p14573
aS"For want of a better comparison, you wouldn't blame criminals for an increase in crime when police decidedly become 'soft' on crime, you blame those that made policing 'soft' in the first place."

aS'Criminals are just doing what they would otherwise do, albeit far easier and at less of a risk than before.'
p14575
aS"Politicians are the ones responsible for the 'immigration system', they determine how many we let in, what kind of people we let in, how much access they have to benefits, how long they can stay for, etc."
p14576
aS'They have the power to change things for better or worse.'
p14577
aS'Not immigrants.'

aS'I can differentiate the two quite easily.'
p14588
aS'The immigration system, however, is what allows immigrants in.'
p14589
aS'If there are too many people in an NHS waiting room, and somebody is going to make the argument that it is the fault of there being too many immigrants in the community for the hospital to handle it, it is not the abstract of the legislative system that they are blaming, rather they are blaming the immigrants themselves who are in that waiting room.'
p14590
aS'They are not saying "stop more people from being in this room", they are saying "too many people are in this room, and it is this select group that shouldn\'t be in it in the first place".'
p14591
aS'The example of crime is false because when there is too much crime, the argument is "too many people are committing crimes, and the system needs to be changed to stop that".'
p14592
aS'There is implicit acceptance that systemic failures, be that in social care, the economy, or judicial system, have created too many criminals.'
p14593
aS'Criminals are accepted to be a bad thing, and thus people have no issue with blaming the system that creates criminals for the production of the unwanted group.'
p14594
aS'The systemic failures and the abstract group of criminals are accepted to be different but inseparable in the discussion.'
p14595
aS'Reducing crime is about reducing the number of criminals, so too is reducing immigration about lowering the number of immigrants.'

aS'A dam lets water pass, but rather than concluding that the water passes due to the valves of the dam coupled with the effects of hydrostatic head upstream, you seem to conclude that the water passes because it is downstream.'
p14599
aS'And that too much water has passed because there is too much water downstream, rather than the real reason being that perhaps the engineers responsible left the valve open, went on a fag break and forgot about it.'

aS"In other words, you're completely dodging and wilfully dancing around the root cause of the issue, and quite frankly, that is dishonest."
p14601
aS"If people want to blame immigrants for the predicaments this country is in then that is their prejudice and ignorance and I'd rather they voted for a party other than UKIP."
p14602

p14603
aS"That is not the argument I'm making and more importantly that is not the argument UKIP is making."
p14604
aS'To repeat once again, the issue here is overpopulation, and the root cause of this overpopulation is immigration, or the immigration system as you have put it.'
p14605
aS'To continue the example above the immigrants are the water and the government is the valve.'
p14606
aS'Only the government can prevent it and only the government can let it happen again.'
p14607
aS"I don't really know why you brought that up and... why you started mentioning social care, economy or the judicial system for my example I don't know... what I do know is you completely missed the scope of my point."

p14616
aS"UKIP''s platform is that there is overpopulation BECAUSE of immigrants."

p14625
aS"Edit: Just to clarify, in case it seems like I'm accusing all anti-immigration positions of being explicitly opposed to the individual immigrant or being malicious to immigrants as a group, the issue with OP's statement is that specifically he is trying to justify Farrage and UKIPs stance that he blames immigrants for, among other things, traffic."

aS'No, I just have a bit of experience of how publishing works in practice.'
p15157
aS"The draft copy gets prepared; it's edited to fit; the text is revised as needed until everyone who needs to be is happy; it goes to publication."
p15158
aS"This is obviously somewhat simplified but essentially we're seeing the draft before the text has been revised."
p15159
aS'If Miliband knocks it out of the park then it\'ll be completely revised, but it won\'t be a "Stop the presses!'
p15160

p15165
aS"Actually they are frequently changed after that as news develops and would be expected to especially for instances such as the debate tonight which hadn't even taken place when the placeholders needed to be set for the early draft cover."
p15166
aS'Content wise there would be stock phrases related to issues that would be cut and edited as needed but the first iteration of those would have started as generic soundbites anyway that can be referred back to as needed for related stories to push the political narrative the paper holds.'

p15171
aS"I don't remember him losing his temper, or tax attacks, though I haven't rewatched the debate to check."
p15172
aS"It doesn't seem to have been rigorously checked afterwards, as you suggest."
p15173
aS'There are relatively few times it would need to change as the editorial decision on which front page story to go for is decided in the afternoon of the day before for the most part.'
p15174
aS"For things like the debates when they know that they intend to run the front page on the debate but don't know what the outcome will be they prepare multiple options and go with whichever one requires the least additional work once the results are in."
p15175
aS'Sometimes they have to go before that or a bigger news story breaks and they end up having to stop the presses, but this is a lot rarer than the page changing between the nightly news the night before and the morning editions.'
p15176
aS"If it isn't rigorously checked, someone might well end up losing their job but at the pace newspapers work at in order to meet publication deadlines mistakes do happen but no newspaper likes printing retractions. "
p15177
aS'Accepting what you just wrote is an indictment of the current press system.'

aS'Either be responsible and write different drafts to cover all outcomes or abandon the printing medium altogether and go online.'

aS'They also have different headings, pictures, etc.'
p15181
aS'The reader only ever sees a fraction of what is actually written as content for each published paper.'
p15182
aS"But they go with what they think is the most likely outcome as holding material because it is least likely to need significant changing, just as in the Champions League final they'd have been preparing the Bayern Munich colours for the cup and confetti in 1999 towards the end of the match or for AC Milan at half time in 2005."
p15183
aS'And after preparing different drafts, that one was the one they went with?'
p15184
aS"We've come full circle: that's flagrant bias."
p15185
aS"This is the last thing I'm going to say on the subject as I'm being downvoted for contributing, but we all know that newspapers have their own political stance and they go with a narrative that fits that but that isn't the same as manufacturing the news."

aS'&gt; But this is all coming from a Londoner who always votes Labour.'
p15836
aS'So all politicians are the same, yet you always vote for the same party regardless of candidate or party policy?'
p15837
aS'I would have been with you a year ago, prior to the referendum and before Sturgeon took over.'
p15838
aS'I saw the SNP as a route to an independent Scotland through the referendum, now I see them as a route to an independent Scotland through Westminster.'
p15839
aS"People up here will soon tire of Westminster and the emptiness of 'The Vow' and we'll break off."
p15840
aS'And a lot of that will be down to the general situation in parliament, not individual policy.'
p15841
aS"I feel that's why a lot of people are voting for the SNP."
p15842
aS'Well I think all politicians are willing to be dishonest to get where they want to get, but they are ultimately constrained by what their core voters, party members (and donors..!'
p15843
aS') will allow.'
p15844
aS"So I guess that's how I reconcile my general cynicism and distrust of politicians with my willingness to back Labour even in these rather unimpressive times with Miliband.... not exactly inspiring talk I know."
p15845
aS"But it's how I see it."
p15846
aS'I feel like a part of it is that she need to appeal to a smaller demographic.'
p15847
aS'Ed/David/Nick are *trying* to appeal to 10x more people, which means they generally have a wider array of issues that need to be considered.'
p15848
aS"Or maybe not and she is just actually a good politician and I've been jaded by English politics for too long xD"
p15849
aS'A strong, confident, well spoken speaker.'
p15850
aS"Many things that Ed Miliband isn't, which holds Labour back when it comes to the undecided voter."
p15851
aS"Heck I'd be tempted to vote SNP the way Sturgeon presented her arguments in the last few debates."
p15852
aS"I assume that it's basically because she's not a plastic soundboard with an RP accent."
p15853
aS'Not a Sturgeon fan but can see the appeal.'
p15854
aS'She speaks passionately and naturally (unlike Miliband, Wood, and Bennett, who seem soooo trained).'
p15855
aS'Of the 3 "progressives" who were making lovely promises they can\'t keep, she\'s the only one with an established base of support.'
p15856
aS'Charisma + idealism = personal popularity.'
p15857
aS'I honestly cannot fathom how Ed "won".'
p15858
aS"Personal leanings to the right aside, he was absolutely destroyed by Sturgeon, made to look like he didn't even care about Wales by Wood, and even Bennett had him on the backfoot throughout."
p15859
aS'What did Ed have to offer in rebuttal?'
p15860
aS'Soundbites about the NHS which led to his biggest own goal of the night, when he was lambasted by all of the others, Farage included, for being part of the administration which began NHS privatisation, and being quoted as having said he was "okay" with private firms making a small profit from health services.'
p15861
aS'Apart from that, there was a lame attack on the SNP for having somehow "backed up the Tories" in the past, which again led to a stinging put-down from Sturgeon, who accused Miliband of burning bridges before a vote has even been cast.'
p15862
aS"Both were massive, foolish fuck-ups that I can't believe haven't made a solid dent in Ed's performance."
p15863
aS'Was I watching a different debate to everyone else?'
p15864
aS'The exit poll smells very fishy to me.'
p15865
aS'Sturgeon won it for me, Milliband getting into an argument over coalition with the SNP and then ruling it out was stupid.'
p15866
aS'The poll itself makes little sense, how can Milliband have "won" if Surgeon performed the "best"?'
p15867
aS"Because they're different questions."
p15868
aS"It's entirely possible to watch a debate (on anything, not just politics) where you already have an opinion and conclude that while one speaker was absolutely the best, you still haven't been convinced to change your mind for whatever reason."
p15869
aS'Can anyone remember a single policy point made by Miliband tonight?'
p15870
aS'It seemed all he was interested in doing was attacking Farage and Cameron with petty remarks'
p15871
aS"sure you have a choice between his plan and dave's plan."
p15872
aS'That was about all he said.'
p15873
aS'Well that and "come and debate me"'
p15874
aS"Not taking anything away from Ed, but let's be honest, the field he faced tonight was incredibly weak."
p15875
aS'Bennett and Wood are irrelevant and weak speakers, so that counts them out.'
p15876
aS'Effectively, it was a debate between Ed, Sturgeon and Farage.'
p15877
aS'Farage decided to shoot himself in the foot by going after the audience so that was him taken out.'
p15878
aS'So in the end, it was just between Ed and Sturgeon, and he barely came out on top.'
p15879
aS"To say he 'won' this debate is not really saying much."
p15880
aS'&gt; Farage decided to shoot himself in the foot by going after the audience so that was him taken out.'
p15881
aS'The UK is bigger than a hand picked audience such as this.'
p15882
aS'It makes him look petty though.'
p15883
aS'Does it?'
p15884
aS'Or is he saying what many are thinking.'
p15885
aS"Keep in mind the HIV comments, and how next day it's turned out the majority of the electorate agree with him on it."
p15886
aS'The guys not dumb, this was something calculated.'
p15887
aS'Wait a day or two and see how it plays into his hands.'
p15888
aS'He says lots of things I agree with.'
p15889
aS'Unfortunately they aren\'t nearly so important as both the things he says I really *don\'t* agree with, and the entire "IMMIGRANTS WITH HIV ARE BANKRUPTING THE NHS AND STEALING YOUR JOBS AND HOMES" tenor of his approach.'
p15890
aS"I could support lots of UKIP policies and wouldn't actually mind them exercising some sort of influence at Westminster if there wasn't an aura of ugliness about them - and no, this is assuredly not just in my head - he's chosen to double down on his HIV Health Tourist rhetoric, so he knows exactly who he's appealing to - but so does everyone else."
p15891
aS'That is one wagon on which I will not permit myself to become a fellow traveller.'
p15892
aS"&gt; IMMIGRANTS WITH HIV ARE BANKRUPTING THE NHS AND STEALING YOUR JOBS AND HOMES\n\nYeah that's not what he said and it's not even in the spirit of what he said."
p15893
aS'And thinking so is just a simplistic  caricature of UKIP and what their policies mean.'
p15894
aS"&gt;a simplistic caricature of UKIP\n\nHere I'm afraid we simply disagree."
p15895
aS'UKIP **are** simplistic.'
p15896
aS"There's no hidden complexity to the warp and weft of the narrative they're weaving."
p15897
aS'This point Carswell was making on Question Time about their independently audited manifesto is fine, but it rather falls flat when an hour earlier the leader said, on live television to the nation, that none of it (and hence all their other policies) actually matters because his only interest is in an EU referendum.'
p15898
aS"&gt;  There's no hidden complexity..."
p15899
aS'Exactly, UKIP are straight forward in what and why they propose, without the bullshit of other parties.'

p16122
aS"The next biggest group that I've met are current and former non-EU immigrants (who are now citizens) that get hit hardest by EU's free movement because mass immigration from within the EU means that room for non EU migrants gets slashed despite being highly skilled, having done their degrees in the UK and lived here since age 18."

aS"Why couldn't they select the audience from people who are generally unbiased, perhaps leaning towards one party but not so much that they're just going to clap everything their person says and stay stonily silent every time the opposition made a sensible point?"
p16278
aS"The ITV audience was a lot better, I can't stand this Punch and Judy clapping and booing crap that dominates political debate shows, let people watching make up their own minds. "

aS'Whilst UKIP are indeed the most dislike party in the country, they were also the winners of the most recent nation-wide election (last years European elections) and polling third place in terms of voting intention for the upcoming general election.'
p16281
aS'The audience at the debate did not appear to reflect this at all.'
p16282
aS'Perhaps this is in part because 4/5 of the other party leaders identify as being on the left side of the political spectrum and maybe each party was given equal audience representation rather than proportional.'
p16283
aS'Either way the result was that UKIP support in the audience seemed to be coming from a single individual (although perhaps the overt hostility from other audience members silenced those who might have been otherwise more vocally supportive of Farage).'
p16284
aS"The real audience certainly wasn't at the debate (a couple of hundred people at best) but the millions watching it on TV."
p16285
aS'And being that the UK populace is broadly right wing (you have to go back to the 1970s to find anything like an actual left wing government) Farage was absolutely correct to say that the real audience was those watching the debate at home rather than whoever was loudest there.\n'

p16301
aS"Or are you differentiating between UKIP policy and Farage's personal preference?"
p16302
aS'I dont trust farage.'
p16303
aS'as an extension of this, i dont trust the party he rules with an iron fist, but for this, yes i do differentiate between the two. '
p16304
aS"So do you think your distrust is maybe colouring your perception as even you've said that he has never denied wanting to introduce a profit motive to the NHS?"
p16305
aS"Can you think of anything he actually has changed his stance on depending on who he's been speaking to?"
p16306

aS"Manifesto promises aren't worth the printer ink they're printed with sort of thing?"
p16315
aS"I think what he wants to do is move to a European style top-up/insurance system because he doesn't believe the NHS can survive in the long term at the currently increasing rate of cost."
p16316
aS"I'm a UKIP fan but I'd have to agree with you on this."
p16317
aS"But maybe it's because he's fighting such an uphill battle that he has to resort to soundbites."
p16318
aS"It's funny he seems more intimidated by a bunch of middle class Londoners than the European parliament."

p16321
aS"The crowd's dislike of UKIP isn't 'Leftist BBC bias,' its an accurate reflection of the feelings of the country."
p16322
aS"Again so you all get it, it isn't an example of bias, its an example of  UKIPs divisive nature. "
p16323

p16493
aS'The difference between how much you have coming in, and how much you spend, is a pretty complex issue?'
p16494
aS"Let's be honest, democracy has been chosen as the least worst system devised so far."
p16495
aS'The fact is most people (I\'d guess at least 50%) aren\'t really capable of making an informed decision, and the majority of the rest vote based on "what\'s in it for me?".'
p16496
aS"I'd estimate the sort of person who understands the issues and votes based on what they believe to be the genuine long term national interest of the country is probably around 10%."
p16497
aS'In respect of fiscal policy yes, yes it is.'
p16498
aS'It is good to borrow during a recession - revenue goes down, borrowing goes up.'
p16499
aS'The UK can borrow cheaply on international markets but can be more expensive in times of recession.'
p16500
aS'The expectation is that revenue will increase and budgetary surplus will help to reduce debt, which is further reduced because borrowing has become less expensive due to an uptick in the local economy.'
p16501
aS'Point being that not running a deficit could be seen as a bad thing.'
p16502
aS'Our problem is Gordon Brown ran a deficit when times were good and should have run a surplus, leaving the current government to work on reducing the deficit during a recession when in fact they should have been looking to borrow more.'
p16503
aS'It looks like we are experiencing an upturn meaning revenue should increase, the cost of our debt will decrease.'
p16504
aS"Perhaps my comment was unclear, I didn't say that the relative merits of running a deficit or not wasn't a complex issue, obviously it is."
p16505
aS'I was just making the point that "the deficit" itself is a simple concept to understand, if you read the second bullet point above, it isn\'t that people are having a hard time deciding what to do about it, they don\'t even understand what it is.'

aS"Your comment worries me more, people are trying to become better informed and you're looking down your nose at them."
p16512

p16513
aS"Most people don't even watch these debates."

p16537
aS'And why could I ask?'

p16541

p16543
aS"Agreed it's a good thing that they are looking into it."
p16544

aS'Seems them watching the debate is a bit pointless if they want to be told who to vote for!'
p16548

aS'Stupidity is the show stopper. '
p16551
aS'Or, in this case, five years ago - when everyone else in the country clocked that the deficit and resulting austerity would be something worth getting their heads around.'
p16552
aS'My point is that everyone has to find something out for the first time at some point.'
p16553
aS'I understand.'
p16554
aS"It doesn't bother me that any one individual doesn't know what those words means, it bothers me that there are so many it featured on google's 'most searched' list."
p16555
aS'What other (not to sound like a dick, but fairly fundamental) concepts do they not understand?'
p16556
aS"And what about the people who didn't watch the debates - is there a large section of the population who intend to vote, but who still don't know what the deficit is?"
p16557
aS'Or what austerity means?'
p16558
aS"I like to think they're all first time voters who were still in school during the last election."

aS"I don't even know if you're joking."
p16563
aS'People who are voting in this election were 13 five years ago'
p16564
aS"Whilst some people asking that question won't know what the term 'deficit' means, I think numbers will be inflated by people simply wanting to know what the numerical figures are."
p16565

p16566
aS'well at least they are trying to find out I suppose....'

aS"I suspect a few MPs aren't sure either.\n"
p16581
aS"I'm a first time voter and I had to google the definition of austerity during the last debate."
p16582
aS"I was familiar with what it meant, but it wasn't a word I'd heard used before."
p16583
aS"I don't think that has anything to do with my ability to make an informed vote."
p16584
aS'&gt;It terrifies me that those people might be able to vote\n\nYet you probably agree with universal suffrage.'
p16585
aS'So you have to put up with it.'
p16586
aS"Not quite universal, I don't believe people below the age of majority should be able to vote"
p16587
aS'Yep.'
p16588
aS"The consolation being that it explains where Labour's votes are coming from...."
p16589

p16599
aS"The ones looking it up aren't the problem."
p16600
aS"It's the people who don't think and still vote"
p16601
aS'But that is no good if they look it up and realize that they have to read more than one line to understand it and just give up, which is what a lot if not most would have done.'
p16602
aS'I\'m willing to bet that the majority of people who looked up "what is austerity" still don\'t know what austerity is.'
p16603
aS"So, how come the Tories refuse to come to an open debate and then are given a 10-minute unchallenged chance to criticise everyone else's policies by the BBC while having no opposition to their own?"
p16604
aS'Very good point.'
p16605
aS'I usually like the bbc coverage but there has been a lot wrong with this programme.'

aS'Allowing the tories to bully them into excluding the lib dems is a travesty.'

aS'A debate is big audience and big time.'

p17006
aS'My thoughts:\n\nFarage - Very one note.'
p17007
aS"Attacking the audience didn't help."
p17008
aS'But there are many a person in this country voting for him because of that one note, and anyone saying otherwise will make them stick fingers in their ears and scream "LALALALA".'
p17009
aS'Sturgeon - Easily came out strongest.'
p17010
aS'Always had something to say about everything with well backed up points.'
p17011
aS'A bit wishy washy on NATO but hey ho.'
p17012
aS'I wish I could vote SNP, but will be in England for the election.'
p17013
aS'Wood - Made some good points, especially when discussing the NHS and immigration, her squaring off with Ed was good too.'
p17014
aS"But she needs to take a leaf out of Sturgeon's book and realise she needs to represent Wales to the whole union, not just her part of it."
p17015
aS'Bennett - I wish she could have said more.'
p17016
aS"Seemed like she'd done her homework this time around, but again she needs to work on her Public Speaking and Debate skills."
p17017
aS'She keeps fumbling over her words every now and then.'
p17018
aS'Honestly I think Lucas should be the party leader.'
p17019
aS'Given how Natalie mentioned her at the start, she probably does too.'
p17020
aS'Milliband - I actually came off liking Ed a lot more.'
p17021
aS"I don't think he is what this country needs, not by a long shot."
p17022
aS'But his closing remark was absolutely golden and his debating skills were on point, especially when squaring up against Farage.'
p17023
aS'Dimbleby - A MUCH better moderator than the last one.'
p17024
aS'Christ was the ITV one awful.'
p17025
aS'Audience - Seemed impartial until Farage kept droning on about immigration, then attacked them.'
p17026
aS'Then were quite skewed against him.'
p17027
aS'It was hilarious hearing only one person clapping Farage that one time.\n\n'
p17028
aS'Carolyn lucas wanted to concentrate on being a mum and mp. '
p17029
aS'Which is fair enough honestly.'
p17030
aS"She's done a bang up job as MP."
p17031
aS'I agree, I like her more for taking the step down.'
p17032
aS'A debate.'
p17033
aS"Or, to be more accurate, 'people talking past each other'."
p17034
aS'In all, it was a lot of status quo.'
p17035
aS'Milliband seems to want status quo from 2015, the three other centre-left want status quo from 10 years ago.'
p17036
aS'Nigel Farage was something a bit different but his immigration views are too hard of a gap to bridge for me. '

p17040
aS'Maybe because they polled he previously and used that information rather than asking them specifically for the debate?'
p17041
aS"It's kind of sad that Farage could have used this opportunity to grab as many right-wing voters as possible, but instead decided to take a giant shit all over the audience."
p17042
aS'I know he likes being "honest" about his opinions, but frankly that was completely unnecessary.'
p17043
aS'If Sturgeon was the leader of a national progressive alliance of parties at Westminster including SNP, PC, and some English party yet to be built but probably not the Greens, she would have my support to be Prime Minister assuming she would put aside the referendum chatter on national independence.'
p17044
aS'Ed is coming off much better than people thought, but I despised his drift to the right in this debate.'
p17045
aS'I know why he did it due to the lack of Cameron there, but still.'
p17046
aS'Natalie Bennett was much better tonight, but she still is so awkward.'
p17047
aS'Leann was okay too, I guess.'
p17048
aS'David Cameron and Nick Clegg are idiots for not showing up.'
p17049
aS'Miliband just dropped the mic.'
p17050
aS'Boom!'
p17051
aS"Miliband couldn't drop his pants if the elastic snapped."
p17052
aS'That was pretty good. '
p17053
aS'Bless you, I never mean any malice with anything I say on Reddit, just having a giggle.'
p17054
aS'I thought he was awful.'
p17055
aS'I agree with a lot of their policies, but he barely answered a single question and spent way too long explaining why Tories were bad and not why Labour was good. '
p17056
aS'Which bit were you referring to'
p17057
aS'Very end when he challenged Cameron to a one on one. '
p17058
aS"Oh, I turned off when they gotto the closing statements, I'll have a look now\n\nEdit: meh. "
p17059
aS"Miliband didn't answer a single question sincerely and was intent on conducting character assassinations all evening, and yet the audience were still clapping everything he said."
p17060
aS'Pretty disgraceful to be honest'
p17061
aS'Did we watch a different debate?'
p17062
aS'And I was referring to his desire to debate Cameron. '
p17063
aS'&gt;Did we watch a different debate?'
p17064
aS'Clearly'
p17065
aS'I thought Farage did very well.'
p17066
aS'Sturgeon did well.'
p17067
aS"I find Miliband's non-answers really annoying."
p17068
aS'If I was in the audience I would have booed his "I want a full majority" answer, to the question "I\'ll save you some time Ed, we know you want a full majority but what will you do in a hung parliament?'
p17069
aS'"\n\n'
p17070
aS'What\'s he going to do, say "yes we will team up with the SNP?'
p17071
aS'"\n\nYou do realise Labour are still fighting for seats against the SNP in Scotland, if he says they will just go in to coalition, he loses every single Labour vote in Scotland.'
p17072
aS"that's what everybody thinks he will do anyway."
p17073
aS'He is already losing a lot of votes on that basis.'
p17074
aS"Why pretend that he won't take the option of keeping the Tories out?"
p17075
aS"Why not explain why people in Scotland shouldn't want the SNP involved?"
p17076
aS'Why not cast a bit of doubt over whether the *SNP* could achieve what they say.'
p17077
aS"It wasn't just that one."
p17078
aS'His response to Farage of "there isn\'t going to be a European army" ignored the question completely.'
p17079
aS'If he could have said "It won\'t get that far because we will be able to stop it" that would have addressed the question, at least.'
p17080
aS'when he accused Farage of raising fears instead of addressing them.'
p17081
aS'and then changed the subject, so as not to have to address those fears...\n\nWhat use is the nuclear deterrent against ISIS Ed?'
p17082
aS'"Let me answer that, I think fighting ISIS is really important blah blah blah"\n\nstupid question admittedly but still.'
p17083
aS'edit: oh and he really doesn\'t need to repeat "these people aren\'t prejudiced, they have real concerns" every time as if to suggest that\'s not what he really thinks.'
p17084
aS"It's like a reverse dog-whistle."
p17085
aS'Farage did well?'
p17086
aS'He attacked the audience in the first 10 minutes...'
p17087
aS"one persons attack is another's standing up to."
p17088
aS'He has every right to speak without being booed down.'
p17089
aS'True, but the audience exercised their right to speak by booing.'
p17090
aS'in my opinion it was gratuitous.'
p17091
aS'in any event it was fair for Farage to argue that it was.'
p17092
aS'it turned that he was right that the audience had a somewhat lefty bias.'
p17093
aS"he didnt even say they shouldn't boo- just pointed out that that was not necessarily representative of the balance of public opinion."
p17094
aS"The don't have be leftwing just to dislike him. "
p17095
aS"&gt;The don't have be leftwing just to dislike him."
p17096
aS'...but it helps...'
p17097
aS'Still not proof Farage was right. '
p17098
aS'there was another thread here.'
p17099
aS'The audience details were released and it *did* have a somewhat left-wing bias compared to the general population.'
p17100
aS'Link please?'
p17101
aS'102 left leaning audience members vs 52 right leaning audience members.'
p17102
aS'over-representation of the snp/greens/plaid\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/32xf4h/bbc_have_released_the_audience_data_from_last/'
p17103
aS'I would not call the Lib Dems left wing for a start.'
p17104
aS'Plus the audience was supposed to represent the proportions of the countries undecided voters not the population generally. '
p17105
aS'But to assume the audience was booing because of their left wing bias?'
p17106
aS'Weak.'
p17107
aS'He was arguing like someone on here.'
p17108
aS'well he gets a lot of abuse from UAF and the like.'
p17109
aS'People following him and other UKIPers around to heckle or intimidate them constantly which must be bloody wearing after a while.'
p17110
aS'Even if he was wrong here you can sort of understand why he would think that.'
p17111
aS'Most of the time it would be true.'
p17112
aS'&gt;well he gets a lot of abuse from UAF and the like\n\nI remember recently watching Robert Nisbet, Sky News Correspondent, standing outside Grimbsy town hall(?'
p17113
aS') where Farage was due to appear at a public meeting.'
p17114
aS'Behind him on either side of the hall entrance were throngs of left-wing protesters shouting loudly and looking pretty close to causing public disorder or violence.'
p17115
aS'Nisbet did a piece to camera questioning why Farage entered the hall via a different entrance and didn\'t "engage" with the charming left-wing boot boys(and girls) standing outside the hall.'
p17116
aS'I had the strong urge to Tweet Nisbet and ask whether he was a complete moron.\n\n '
p17117
aS'Which /r/ukpolitics regular do you reckon is secretly Farage.'
p17118
aS'Probably Bulldog.'
p17119
aS'Ed Miliband just ruled out a coalition with SNP.'
p17120
aS'Remember that in 3 weeks time.'
p17121
aS'Since the SNP ruled out a coalition with them pretty much at the start this is nothing new.'
p17122
aS"Remember there's a difference between coalition, confidence&amp;supply and vote-by-vote. "
p17123
aS'A turd by any other name would still smell of shit.'
p17124
aS"Cameron wasn't there."
p17125
aS'He did that weeks ago!'
p17126
aS'That was so painful to watch.'
p17127
aS'It was like seeing someone get turned down for a date. '
p17128
aS'Why did Farage go after the audience on housing?'
p17129
aS'It was such a monumentally stupid thing to do: surely a huge no-no for anyone remotely versed in politics.'
p17130
aS"I've never liked him but I thought he was smarter than that."
p17131
aS'And other than that he just kept flogging the immigration horse.'
p17132
aS"The rest of them were prepared for this and ran rings round him, but he doesn't seem to have any other pages in his playbook so continued to get burned."
p17133
aS"The audience are just a minority of voters, he probably doesn't care about losing their affection."
p17134
aS'He gained much more admiration from viewers at home who agree that the audience were biased and shit.'
p17135
aS'Except they were selected independant of the BBC and to be representative, as he would have known if he bothered doing any research.'
p17136
aS'Going on a tirade about the left wing BBC and audience only made him look like a loon.'
p17137
aS'The only people agreeing with him are the people who would have voted for him anyway.'
p17138
aS"If you're a floating voter you're not turned on by someone frothing at the mouth, being shown to be mistaken and then coming across as a foolish child rather than a serious candidate."
p17139
aS"They weren't representative at all though, did you not hear the amount of cheers that were thrown at all of the leaders EXCEPT Farage?"
p17140
aS'The BBC did a shitty job of finding actually neutral audience members.'
p17141
aS"I'm voting Lib Dem yet agreed with much of what Farage was saying."
p17142
aS'The leaders collectively attacked Farage because they knew it would get an applause, and the audience encouraged them to do it.'
p17143
aS'The bias was clear from the start.'
p17144
aS'&gt;Farage: "It\'s terrible that David Cameron isn\'t here"\n\n*crickets*\n\n&gt;Miliband: "It\'s a real shame that David Cameron isn\'t here to defend his record"\n\n*crickets*\n\n&gt;Sturgeon: "It\'s a disgrace that David Cameron isn\'t here"\n\n*thunderous applause* \n\nAnd then the applause at every mention that the different leaders weren\'t going to support a conservative government.'
p17145
aS"Yep, definitely biased towards being angry that the PM hasn't shown up to a pre-election debate - which I suspect the vast majority of citizens are."
p17146
aS"That wasn't the issue, the issue was that they all said literally exactly the same thing but Sturgeon was the only one that got applauded."
p17147
aS'Once again, the audience was selected by a third party, not the BBC.'
p17148
aS"And it's a pretty sad defence to claim audience bias when your arguments appear unpopular."
p17149
aS"Maybe they're just bad arguments. "
p17150
aS'Once again, who exactly is this third party, what were their criteria for selection etc etc?'
p17151
aS'Adam Boulton said that the audience member he spoke to said that they had not been asked their voting intention.'
p17152
aS"Also the audience was drawn almost entirely from central London; this is not a London election, it's a national election and UKIP support is at its nadir in central London."
p17153
aS'And SNP support is towering in central London, as all know...\n\nAlso people react negatively when you attack them.'
p17154
aS'The audience was not hostile to Farage until he proceeded to blot his copybook on housing less than halfway through the debate.'
p17155
aS'Most central Londoners are anti-Tory and nothing else.'
p17156
aS"&gt;They weren't representative at all though, did you not hear the amount of cheers that were thrown at all of the leaders EXCEPT Farage?"
p17157
aS'Yeah, but supporters of all the other parties are quite likely to dislike Farage and his views.'
p17158
aS"I'm not sure exactly how the crowd was selected (were conservative/lib dem voters included?"
p17159
aS'Was it equally weighted or weighted according to polls?'
p17160
aS'etc), but even the method that gives most generous proportion of UKIP voters results with only a 20% UKIP-friendly audience.'
p17161
aS"It's kind of irrelevant, though."
p17162
aS"He's shown himself to be completely bat-shit crazy in both debates now."
p17163
aS'I think UKIP will tank like the BNP did last election.'
p17164
aS'&gt;  The BBC did a shitty job of finding actually neutral audience members.'
p17165
aS'Or maybe, yaknow, this is actually what the public thinks?'
p17166
aS"Except except that the split between public support for left and right wing parties is roughly 50/50 (not shocking to anyone who isn't an idiot), so that's not true."
p17167
aS'This just in: you can be right wing and still disagree with UKIP.'
p17168
aS"pro-tip; right wingers are likely to be sympathetic to UKIP's policies to the point of not joining in with loudly booing and jeering them and cheering for left wing politicians every time they attack them."
p17169
aS'Instead of hiding behind facile comments; do you honestly believe that that audience was representative of the opinions and beliefs of the British electorate as a whole?'
p17170
aS'Lol, they booed and jeered *when he attacked them* for "stunning lack of comprehension" and for being "remarkably left wing".'
p17171
aS"Have you considered that Farage's supercilious method of debating can turn people against him as easily as it can make them respect him?"
p17172
aS'And that when he directs it at the audience they might not like him as much?'
p17173
aS"No, clearly they're just all communists."
p17174
aS'So you completely ignored my question in favour of another facile response, exactly who said "they\'re all communists"?'
p17175
aS'I am merely giving the "our man got booed, audience must be biased" argument the (lack of) respect it deserves.'
p17176
aS'But having seen the data now I can confidently say that yes, broadly, it does represent the overall feeling.'
p17177
aS"I don't necessarily feel the amount of booing he recieved does, but hey ho, that's why you don't attack the audience"
p17178
aS'Maybe.'
p17179
aS"[This](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jamieross/the-audience-seem-to-think-nigel-farage-had-a-point-about-th?hc_location=ufi) buzzfeed article seems pretty straightforward (I know they're rubbish, but generally they're left wing so you can't exactly accuse them of being pro-UKIP), and it suggests that lots of people who were there who aren't pro-ukip at all agree that it wasn't representative."
p17180
aS"Given how repulsive many on the right find Green party policy (wanting to erase the concept of being British etc etc), don't you think it's interesting that Bennett receives almost no heckling/jeering booing etc from right wing audience members?\n\n"
p17181
aS"Probably because they don't take her or the Greens all that seriously."
p17182
aS"UKIP recieve a disproportionate amount of media coverage and so they're on everyone's mind."
p17183
aS'She also did not attack the audience.'
p17184
aS"Yeah, I've got to admit I lost a bit of respect for him after that, I actually like him a lot but he just came across as a tinfoil hat wearing nutter for me tonight."
p17185
aS'&gt; Except they were selected independant of the BBC and to be representative, as he would have known if he bothered doing any research.'
p17186
aS"I'm sorry but you and the BBC cannot keep hiding behind this assertion that these audiences are actually balanced when every single response they gave during the course of the debate was skewed way to the left of the public."
p17187
aS'Either the audience was selected to produce this response, or the BBC does a terrible job of outsourcing the construction of these audiences.'
p17188
aS'But hiding behind the assertion that the audiences are biased is fine?'
p17189
aS'Easy on the tinfoil, puh-lease.'
p17190
aS"It's not an assertion, it's a fact that can be verified by anybody with ears and a reasonable understanding of where the centre ground lies in British politics."
p17191
aS'It is not a fact, since facts require evidence in order to substantiate them as such.'
p17192
aS'It is conjecture, and wishful thinking on the part of supporters of UKIP desperately wishing it was all a bad dream and that when they wake up their man will have smashed it out of the park.'
p17193
aS'The simplest solution would be to ask the audience to remain silent during the debate(think they may do this in US presidential debates?).'
p17194
aS'There seems to be a certain element that are intent on cheering/booing, shouting out, and generally trying to cause agro - which makes me think there are political activists in the audience, not typical members of the public.\n \n\n'

p17222
aS"Can't understand why people are so pro sturgeon"
p17223
aS'She has made her anti-austerity policies fairly clear to Scottish audiences, but do you think the whole of the UK want to hear details only relevant to Scotland on a BBC debate?'
p17224
aS"See that's the problem, because what she has to say doesn't have as much relevance as English parties, she gets away with a vast amount of ambiguity yet her main desire for Scotland is independence, which is very worrying"
p17225
aS"Yes, but it's not her problem."
p17226
aS'In Scotland there have been plenty of debates in which her policies have been put to the test.'
p17227
aS'But in the UK-wide debate if she goes into Scottish politics in depth, English people will complain Scottish politics is dominating the election.'
p17228
aS"And if she doesn't she's accused of obscuring her policies!"
p17229
aS'At the end of the day all she wants are Scottish votes, but I think she genuinely has a wish to weaken the Tory-Labour coalition on austerity for the whole of the UK.'
p17230
aS'But she is there to secure Scottish votes, so she should be talking about at least some of her policies, and if not then she should actually talk about UK issues, but no, just dancing around the question..'
p17231
aS'When Dimbleby asked her what she meant by "strong immigration controls" she gave the biggest non answer ever, not a single real answer from her the whole night'
p17232

aS"The rest of the UK shed be very happy for lots of cuts that pays for more of Scotland's stuff. "
p17236
aS"If you think she's actually, genuinely doing this because she takes a principled stand against austerity at all, then that makes me happy as I'll be voting for her."
p17237
aS"Sadly, I'm too cynical to believe that's the only reason she says it."
p17238
aS"She's trying to win over old Labour votes in Scotland."
p17239
aS"I am in England so I can't really support her even if I really wanted to (which I don't)."
p17240
aS"But I think she's just appealing to what sounds good for the people."
p17241
aS"It's ready to say we are against austerity, but the hard thing is actually proving how you'll pay for it all."
p17242
aS"Any government would love to lower taxes and increase spending on services, but you can't do that."
p17243
aS"You need to balance the budget and I'm not heating how shell do that."
p17244
aS'But you are right, she wants to win over votes to hold the balance of power and get the benefits for Scotland.'
p17245
aS"In fact the only party that has actually don't anything to prove they have valid sums is UKIP, by having their manifesto independently verified. "
p17246
aS"She's made it pretty clear that her method is to balance the budget later than the other parties, tolerate a longer period of debt and in so doing reduce misery for people at the bottom in the meantime."
p17247
aS"If she is running in the UK election then she needs to have policy's for the whole of the UK not just Scotland."
p17248
aS"So you'd prefer her to pretend she can (and wants to) tell England, Wales and Northern Ireland what to do?"

aS"But it's certainly not the *only* important issue."
p17275
aS"Disclaimer: I'm not UKIP, I'm currently undecided."
p17276
aS'But I was surprised at how diverse their policies were. \n\n'
p17277
aS'Have you read UKIPs manifesto?'
p17278
aS"I think it's pretty coherent and well rounded in those policy areas."
p17279
aS'But, if they choose to focus on the EU, then so be it.'
p17280
aS'Certainly there is an argument to be made for the UK becoming independent before focussing on anything else. '
p17281
aS'It has significant impact on all of those issues, not just in immigration, legislation and money.'
p17282
aS'On defence - think about the escalation with Russia over the Ukraine.'
p17283
aS'This is a direct result of European expansion into Soviet sattalitte states.'

p17288
aS'Education and the NHS are subject to squeezes on resources due to concentrated influxes but I agree that the main thrust of the debate on those issues is not EU- Critical.'
p17289
aS'More importantly, however, is that our entire Welfare state is at risk; the majority of Europe have a contributory system in place where you have to pay in to recieve benefits or helath care - our system is universal.'
p17290
aS'Yet the EU insists that citizens from states with a contributory system get the same coverage as our citizens, regardless of the fact that this is not reciprocated.'
p17291
aS'They also insist that freedom of movement is non-negotiable.'
p17292
aS'So.'
p17293

aS'OJSlaughter missed the point - the single issue that Farage spoke about was immigration.'
p17301
aS'Any problem that was raised he had a fiendishly clever way to twist it round and blame it on the bogie men of immigrants.'
p17302
aS'There is many a spin doctor who would admire Farage for his ability to twist logic to his advantage in spite of facts and evidence. '
p17303
aS'He spoke about immigration in relation to both housing and the NHS.'
p17304
aS"It's a relevant issue when the topic is how do we afford to build more homes and how do we continue to fund our NHS whilst protecting it from PRIVATIZASHUN."
p17305
aS"He has never suggested it's the sole reason for all our problems but he is the only person willing to significantly reduce immigration, and believes that this reduction could have a positive effect on these issues."
p17306
aS'It\'s the other parties who accuse him of "blaming all the immigrants" because they are ideologically dedicated to the status quo on this issue. '
p17307
aS'Unfortunately in the fantasy world of UKIP immigration controls and leaving the EU solves everything miraculously, however the reality is far more nuanced.'
p17308
aS"You have to consider how much immigrants contribute to the state, what areas are overpopulated, which areas aren't."
p17309

p17310
aS'Furthermore you have to consider the genuine economic impact of abandoning the EU, we would loose all of the economic benefits and put British business at [risk] (http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-20956130), we would be set aside and outcasted and not even have the opportunity to implement our British vision of the EU. '
p17311
aS'seriously.'
p17312
aS'If you think that we need to leave the EU then it is fair enough to concentrate on that because it is a much bigger change than anything else being discussed.'
p17313
aS'More important than welfare and the NHS?'
p17314
aS'Yes because it has a direct effect on everything else'
p17315
aS'Whether you are for or against it is more important if the question is at stake.'
p17316
aS'If you are for the EU: the damage to our economy caused by leaving the EU will mean we have to cut welfare and the NHS.'
p17317
aS'If you are against the EU: the money we currently send to the EU would be better spent on the NHS and welfare, and being able to control immigration from former warsaw pact countries would reduce the demand on these services.'

aS'So you do believe that over 65% of the audience are to the right of Labour'
p18609
aS'Just answered you. '
p18610
aS'But the problem is that depends on where they poll, and where the debate is taking place - its not easy to be fair unfortunately!'
p18611

p18620
aS'Funny, last I heard there was about 1/3 of the country intending to vote Tory, and about a 1/6 intending to vote UKIP.'

p18622
aS'Depending on which Poll you are using '
p18623

aS'80% of the country are not far left.'

aS'More people means more housing needed.'
p18758
aS'How in the world in this controversial?'
p18759
aS'Yes, but he made two comments in that bit that were a bit disingenuous.'
p18760
aS'The first was "we have to build a house very 7 minutes just to cope with migration.'
p18761
aS'" That\'s 75,000 houses p/a, or one for every 4 migrants if you use the net migration = 300,000 figures.'
p18762
aS'The key point is that the question was about "affordable social housing," but he used figures for all migrants, of whom very few are eligible for or seek out such homes.'
p18763
aS'It was a bit of sleight of hand.'
p18764
aS"(Not that he's the only one doing some misleading."
p18765
aS')\n\nSecond, he also said that he wants to make sure social housing is only available to UK nationals.'
p18766
aS'This sounds great but is really tricky in practice.'
p18767
aS"My wife is British-born, but I'm an American resident."
p18768
aS'Do we not qualify?'
p18769
aS'What if we have 2 British-born children?'
p18770
aS"Anyway, the reason it's controversial as such is that he assumes that migration only affects demand: more migrants, more demand."
p18771
aS'But migrants also contribute to supply in direct ways (more laborers, driving down the cost of labor, making houses cheaper to build) and indirect ways (buying unrelated goods, e.g.'
p18772
aS'televisions, creating jobs for others, as well as making the pound stronger internationally and thus making the cost of goods required to build homes cheaper).'
p18773
aS"It's just extremely simplistic to think that the *only* way in which migrants affect the housing market is in trying to buy homes."

aS"&gt; (more laborers, driving down the cost of labor, making houses cheaper to build)\n\nThe cost to build isn't a major factor in home prices (in most regions) &amp; won't be unless planning restrictions are radically changed."
p18785
aS"Even if they are in large cities there often isn't space to build cheaply."
p18786
aS'Meaning cheaper labour does little to home prices.'
p18787
aS"And the claim that tax from immigrants can fund houses doesn't work for similar reasons."
p18788
aS'First of all it will be decades before tax paid comes close to paying for a house.'
p18789
aS'Secondly it just delays the problem.'
p18790
aS'Those immigrants are going to have children that need affordable housing.'
p18791
aS'Because we can just keep building more houses due to our infinite landmass. '
p18792
aS"That's not what people disagreed with."
p18793
aS"Farage claimed it was the biggest factor in the argument to point of saying it's the only one which is plainly not true; Increasing birthrates, decreasing death rates, not enough houses being built and yes an increase in net migration all come into it."
p18794
aS"But leaving Europe to rid ourselves of the immigrants doesn't solve the problem, it just reduces it."
p18795
aS"UKIP don't even have any sort of indication of how much they think they can reduce it by.\n\n"
p18796
aS'They said the I word!'
p18797
aS'Demonisation!'
p18798
aS'thats not the controversial part, whats controversial is UKIP want rid of the immigrant population and to stop more coming in, the sane people want to build more houses.'
p18799
aS'This appears to be the complete opposite of what I have seen on the subject.'
p18800
aS'UKIP appears to acknowledge that we are running out of space in the UK.'
p18801
aS'Anecdotally Portsmouth, my hometown, whilst not being hit the hardest my immigrants (to my knowledge) [is the most densely populated city in the UK outside of London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth), and our local city council is still trying to build homes on our tiny island city - our limited outdoor space is rapidly shrinking.'
p18802
aS'UKIP have no qualms with immigrants that have entered the UK legally, fullstop.'
p18803
aS'They have said that they wish to reduce the number of people entering the UK by leaving the EU, as currently we cannot turn away EU citizens under the Freedom of Movement.'
p18804
aS'In doing so the plan is to implement a points based system to allow in skilled workers that we are in need of, whilst still allowing students and tourists into the UK.'
p18805
aS'I have heard nothing about removing those who already reside here legally.'
p18806
aS'If I have my facts messed up I would urge you to bring them forward as the last thing I want to do is support a racist party.'
p18807
aS'well no they dont have problems with them on the surface, but they want to make life hell for them, and make them 2nd class citizens, but attacking their benefits and their rights to work here, as well as deniging them access to the NHS until they have paid national insurance for 5 years.'
p18808
aS'see [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11476780/immigrant-policy.html) for example.'
p18809
aS'But that solution is finite.'
p18810
aS'Eventually you will simply not have the space. '
p18811
aS'Its finite.'
p18812
aS"But we're not gonna run out of space any time soon."
p18813
aS"We'll run out of all of almost everything else before we run out of usable space "
p18814
aS"True but UKIP's solution is no better; in fact it is a lot worse. "
p18815
aS'How so?'
p18816
aS"Let's shut our borders? "
p18817
aS'Nobody is saying shut the borders completely.'
p18818
aS'If UKIP wanted to "shut our borders" you might have a point.'
p18819
aS"Since you had to make up a policy to support your stupid argument, it's fairly obvious you're in the wrong here m8."
p18820
aS'Okay - worded too strongly.'
p18821
aS'"Limited and controlled borders".'
p18822
aS'Hows that?'
p18823
aS'Or - "Take back control of our borders".'
p18824
aS"It's the same."
p18825
aS'In a UKIP idyll, the borders will be like a tall wall - able to get through, but no one will really want to climb over.'
p18826
aS"It's not a realistic expectation and limiting who comes into the country will not solve the housing problem.  "
p18827
aS"So decreasing the amount of demand won't help alleviate our supply problem for housing AT ALL?"
p18828
aS'yes but people also leave, what we have to do is make sure the people who are here are contributing, and they are, immigrates produce a net profit for the uk, our real problem here is UK nationals abusing the welfare system.'
p18829
aS'Net migration **which takes into account those coming in and those leaving** is at 300,000 a year.'
p18830
aS"That's an increase of a city with a population the size of Hull every single year. "
p18831
aS'Ah, the lazy Brits excuses again. '
p18832
aS'Source?'
p18833
aS'Show me where this policy is?'
p18834
aS"I've never read anyone seriously suggest that those are UKIPs policies."
p18835
aS'they are hardly saying it outright.'
p18836
aS'but the polices outlined [here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/11476780/immigrant-policy.html), would make immigrants 2nd class citizens and leave many with little choice but to leave.'
p18837
aS'and by leaving th EU they would vastly reduce the number of people coming in AND going out, by ending freedom of movement. '
p18838
aS"Sorry I've read that article and there's absolutely nothing in it which reflects your previous statement."
p18839
aS'Currently immigrants from countries outwith the EU are treated as 2nd class citizens and those from within the EU are treated as if they were UK citizens and have paid into the system the same as people who have paid in all their lives.'
p18840
aS'Surely those things are unfair?'
p18841
aS"It's a matter of perspective isn't it."
p18842
aS'The supply is having more of an effect than immigration.'
p18843
aS'Especially as most of them are low earners who wont be buying houses anyway. '
p18844
aS'Well if you are in favour of free borders with 27 other EU member states than all you can really talk about is supply because demand is uncontrollable.'
p18845
aS'Farage is the only realistic one on the panel for housing, he has tackled both demand and supply on this. '
p18846
aS'Supply is only short relative to rising demand.'
p18847
aS'The rising demand is going to be affected by the extra 200k or so people coming in.'
p18848
aS"Low earners still live in houses, and if they don't buy, then a BTL landlord will do so on their behalf."
p18849
aS'The simple fact is that because of immigration our population increases by the equivalent of the city of Nottingham or Doncaster every single year.'
p18850
aS"The fact they won't be buying houses is irrelevant because unless you intend on them living in a tent they're going to want housing."
p18851
aS'You need to build basically a new city EVERY SINGLE YEAR in order to meet the increase in demand just from net immigration alone which is just completely ludicrous.'
p18852
aS"That doesn't even address the demand from those from here leaving home and wanting their own place."
p18853
aS"They won't even acknowledge supply and demand"
p18854
aS'"We cant afford austerity"\n\nThey won\'t acknowledge economics whatsoever.'
p18855
aS'The left never do. '
p18856
aS'This debate is doing nothing but good for Farage.'

p18858
aS"Hadn't thought of that, maybe Cameron hadn't either."
p18859
aS'God, this is awful.'
p18860
aS'Its just beginning to seem like ganging up on Nigel Farage.'
p18861
aS"It's making me feel sorry for him which I'm not particularly keen on."
p18862
aS"I really don't like this audience."
p18863
aS'I agree it is fucking pathetic, it should be fair and Nigel is just being used as a scapegoat for applause from the audience.'
p18864
aS"It's okay, Nigel absorbs the power of the attacks and uses it to feed dark manifestations of his will, with him being so evil and all."
p18865
aS'When did British audiences start applauding so much??'
p18866
aS'Are we becoming American? '
p18867
aS'This audience is a bit of a disgrace.'
p18868
aS'I question whether they have a balanced political spectrum for the audience - or whether they choose to have an equal number of representatives from each party present.'
p18869
aS'The audience did seem rather militantly left wing at times.'

aS'Oh no, Ed\'s doing his stupid "turn to the camera and look into their souls" move again.'
p18871
aS"You can't teach charisma, give it up."
p18872
aS"Is it solely through choice that Cameron isn't there?"
p18873
aS"Look at me I'm so sincere! "
p18874
aS'Its through Camerons choices the debates are in the format they are.'
p18875
aS'Originally there was to be three all of which had him.'
p18876
aS'So yes &amp; no.'
p18877
aS"He wasn't invited to this one but only because he refused other formats."
p18878
aS'The green and welsh ladies are so far out of their depth when it comes to economics and defence. '
p18879

p18880

aS'Remember folks, the audience reflects the electorate; over half of those people in the studio are to the left of Labour apparently!'
p18885
aS"TLDR; Don't vote Tory. "
p18886
aS"Who in the BBC thought having the onscreen voter's opinion take up 40% of the telly as a good idea, translucent or not?!"

aS'Submitted an online complaint to the beeb about it.'
p18892
aS'You know its bad when Murdoch offers a better source than the BBC...'
p18893
aS"Wonder what Farage's rating in this did when made those comments about the audience and when he was attacked over his immigrant comments."
p18894
aS'Dimbleby is so much better.'
p18895
aS'Gets involved and probes the leaders. '
p18896
aS'I preferred Etchingham ( \xcd\xa1\xc2\xb0 \xcd\x9c\xca\x96 \xcd\xa1\xc2\xb0)'
p18897
aS'Disagree - he is a total moron'

aS'!'
aS"Please don't tell me there's going to be a 4th debate, at this rate if there is the audience are going to mob the stage."

aS'Did Miliband just say he respects the SNP for wanting to break up the country?'
p18903
aS'yes he did.'
p18904
aS'I believe he did. '
p18905
aS"Can someone please explain Ed's game plan?"
p18906
aS"I don't see why he's so aggressively saying he doesn't want to work with other parties."
p18907
aS"He was very much pushing that he wants a majority and avoiding answering who he would want to work with, but when snp say they want to help he's very vehemently telling them to Fuck off and he being very direct about it... "
p18908
aS"Ed can't have any labour voters thinking they can vote for someone else and still get labour."
p18909
aS'He needs to have voters think that the only way you get labour, is to vote labour. '
p18910
aS'I agree.'
p18911
aS"He's shooting himself in the foot."
p18912
aS"He doesn't believe he can get a majority surely?"
p18913
aS'! '
p18914
aS'To be honest, if it comes down to a hung parliment then SNP, Green and Plaid Cymru will probabaly work with Labour and if it comes down to it Labour would probabaly work with them to an extent.'
p18915
aS'So simply put he gains nothing commiting to a coalition right now.'
p18916
aS"He'd rather have a Labour majority and be able to easily control the whip than have a Labour, SNP (maybe PC and Green added ontop) coalition where he would have to compromise. "
p18917
aS'When will people start to realise that Farage thrives when \'"looney lefties" are heckling him?'
p18918
aS'If people are booing his "common sense ideas", it emboldens UKIP supporters. '
p18919
aS'Which suits those on the left perfectly if they take votes from the Conservatives.'
p18920
aS'They take votes from Labour and LDs, too, though!'
p18921
aS'They do, but significantly more from the Conservatives, and the Conservatives have done better as UKIP have declined over the past few months.'

p18938
aS'All im getting from this question is that apparently immigration is nothing but wonderful for the UK, has zero negative effects, and anyone who suggests otherwise is a bastard.'

aS'What a farce.'
p18940
aS'Pretty much.'
p18941
aS"Bennett is all for open borders which would be fine if everyone had a similar economy to us but they don't."
p18942
aS'The EU would be a much more beneficial entity for everyone involved if it was formed of nations with similar economies such as us, France, Germany etc.\n'

p18947
aS'Bizarre.'
p18948
aS"Stopped watching it, it's a total joke. "
p18949
aS"Because they're willing to accept the positives of immigration, and don't continue to return to it on just about every single fucking point."
p18950
aS'Nobody is denying the positives of immigration?'
p18951
aS'Just that it needs to be reduced and controlled? '
p18952

aS"They're appearing on a teleprompter hidden in his podium."

p19058
aS"I think that's a great thing for him to say."
p19059
aS"Actually accepting that his party has made mistakes is mature, it'd be worse if he just denied everything."
p19060
aS'Just tuned in Ed Miliband physically looks much better than he did in the two previous debates.'
p19061
aS'Why did Farage attack the audience earlier ?'
p19062
aS"They've been cheering empty platitudes from the left wing parties and in some cases booing Farage before he speaks."
p19063
aS"Dimbleby says they've used a polling organisation to get people in as a generally fair split but it doesn't look that way to me."
p19064

p19072
aS"It was funny to begin with but I hope it doesn't get too out of hand because it's starting to interfere with the debate."
p19073
aS'Because they all only seemed to applaud for the other leaders, who generally are all more left wing than his party. '

p19094
aS'Had an early bit of applause for Farage but that level of noise was drowned out by the audience when Leanna Wood pleaded to Ed to form a coalition in order to kick out the tories.'
p19095
aS'Disgusting BBC bias as usual. '
p19096
aS'Yep, now Farage has dared to mention the clear bias, he will get outrage by the left lol.'
p19097
aS"Yeah yeah it's BBC bias"
p19098
aS"b-but the BBC have selected a 'balanced' audience!"
p19099
aS'They applauded Farage the one time he made sense. '
p19100
aS"It's typically that way."
p19101
aS'If you look back to the independence referendum (pro-yes was very left wing) it was the same on every TV debate.'
p19102
aS'Left wing activists seem to try very hard to get on the telly.'
p19103
aS'As was mentioned in another thread, it seems like the left shout loudest.'
p19104
aS'Mainly because the right are busy in work.'
p19105
aS"Well without Cameron there Farage is the only one on the right, so that's probably going to cut down on the number of people who are left interested in attending and in what the panel has to say."
p19106
aS'Look very clearly and logically, the audience will be left wing.'
p19107
aS'This is because UKIP is basically the only right of centre party in the debate, and the audience will have been chosen based on which party they are inclined towards.'
p19108
aS"I'm genuinely not sure why anyone can even begin to argue against this point."
p19109
aS'David Dimbleby is technically correct but he is wrong in substance. '
p19110
aS'the audience is obviously not neutral'
p19111
aS"It will work in Farage's favour."
p19112
aS"4 of the same usual sound bites, a cheering lefty audience and being ganged up on will only strengthen people's support for him."
p19113
aS'Ed staring right into my soul again.'
p19114

p19126
aS'This debate is a farce.'
p19127
aS'I know right, I thought the immigration thing was unnecessary but his plan seems like the best solution'
p19128
aS'He insulted the audience and now you are surprised he gets a negative response?'
p19129
aS'That comment was posted before he did so.'
p19130
aS"Thing is, I don't even support Nigel, but it's fairly obvious the audience is heavily biased."
p19131
aS'I agree with Bennett.'
p19132
aS'With 0 MPs they will not prop up any government.'
p19133
aS"Miliband doesn't address a single point, attemps a character assassination and the audience clap him."
p19134
aS"Is it a balanced audience full of morons who don't see this clown for what he is, or is it simply full of left wing tools?"
p19135
aS'The previous panel debate was on ITV if I am not mistaken?'
p19136
aS'How come they managed to have an audience that remained quite (if I remember correctly), and yet the BBC audience is cheering/booing.'
p19137
aS'ITV seemed a lot more professional and organised. '
p19138
aS"You're remembering wrongly, the audience did make noise and were allowed to, it's just that they hated everything that the people were saying."
p19139
aS'There was more negativity displayed by them instead of applause like this time around.'
p19140
aS"We should replicate what the 'mericans do, the audience stays stone called silent in the presidential debates. "
p19141
aS'Why can none of them except Nigel accept that immigration has *any* negative consequences?'
p19142
aS'It can, but immigration also has positive consequences which often counteract the negatives.'
p19143
aS'Farage uses immigration obsessively as an argument for all our countries problems, without explaining the positives or giving it a rest and moving onto other policies about running the country.'
p19144
aS'You can see this so clearly in the TV debates.'
p19145
aS'Edit: Downvoted for mentioning immigration can have positives to the country!'
p19146
aS'Wow, some people on here are seriously brainwashed to think all immigration is bad .'
p19147
aS'Well, that shows the bias.'
p19148
aS'"I wont do a deal with the tories"\n\n*applause*'
p19149
aS"Well there's bound to be some applause - some people don't like the Tories."
p19150
aS"Given 65% of people are currently polling against conservative, I don't think bias had to play much of a part"
p19151
aS'I mentally clapped because she answered the question.'
p19152
aS'This is a classic BBC audience.'
p19153
aS'The vast majority of the country is voting Labour or right-of-Labour yet Sturgeon and Wood are getting massive applause for telling Miliband to drift to the extreme left.'
p19154
aS'&gt; This is a classic BBC audience.'
p19155
aS"Looks a bit of a foolish comment now given Dimbleby's comments."
p19156
aS'The audience reaction speaks for itself. '
p19157
aS"Don't expect kippers to be smart."
p19158
aS"You'd have to be deliberately ignoring it to not notice that there is a clear left wing bias in that audience."
p19159
aS"You'd have to be deliberately ignoring nigels 234215352 question time appearances to think the BBC is biased against him."
p19160
aS"Edit: On a non snarky note: it is in london, the only place that is barrageing farrage, so of course we'd act like normal and still act like he's a horrid assholes instead of buying into his bullshit like the rest of the country."
p19161
aS"The BBC isn't biased against UKIP but BBC audiences are typically very left wing."

p19163
aS'Farage gets invited on question time because he gets people to tune in.'
p19164
aS'Its as simple as that.'
p19165
aS'Its not because of any BBC bias. '
p19166
aS'He was getting some claps at the start until he attacked the audience. '
p19167
aS'Not really.'
p19168
aS'They chose some polling organisation with similar biases.'
p19169
aS'Changes nothing.'
p19170
aS"The audience is massively left-skewed and anybody who isn't wearing BBC-goggles can see it quite clearly."
p19171
aS'&gt;They chose some polling organisation with similar biases.'
p19172
aS'Nurse!'
p19173
aS'I cannot believe they moaned at Farage DARING to suggest that a housing shortage might have something to do with demand.'
p19174
aS'He was banging on about nobody knowing about business.'
p19175
aS'In business do you supply to the demand or cut out the demand to fit your supply?'
p19176
aS"It's about the concept."
p19177
aS'The state vis a vis housing is not a business.'
p19178
aS"They wouldn't even acknowledge that it had anything to do with it."
p19179
aS'Vis a vis?'
p19180
aS'Did you do the Brent pose?'
p19181
aS"Business is about profit, The Governments job isn't solely to make a profit, it's to look after the people, Governments and businesses have different prioritys."
p19182
aS'Yeah and they can do both by building more houses.'
p19183
aS'Either way providing houses is definitely business. '
p19184
aS'Providing houses is one aspect yes but can we make them at the rate now required?'
p19185
aS'I think not.'
p19186
aS'We need to slow down the rate of immigration and when we are back on track then we can start opening the doors again, hopefully slower than last time, giving time to adjust to an increase.'
p19187
aS'Do businesses care about quality of life for their customers?'
p19188
aS'Nope.'
p19189
aS'So?'
p19190
aS'How is that relevant?'
p19191
aS'Housing is business.'
p19192
aS"It's the one thing I agreed with Nigel Farage on."
p19193
aS'Simple question, do you build more houses to meet the demand at a profit, or simply turn the business away?'
p19194
aS'Housing is a public good.'
p19195
aS'Much like water or education.'
p19196
aS"Regardless of how it's paid for or who distributes it, on a political level it's not a business."
p19197
aS"That's just nonsense."
p19198
aS'Of course it is business.'
p19199
aS"It's not free you know?"
p19200
aS'They are not just nocking these houses up for nothing. '
p19201
aS'You heard it here first folks: if money is somewhat involved in a  process it becomes "business" and that somehow precludes it from being socially responsible.'
p19202
aS'Yep. '
p19203
aS'The moan was over the immigration comment.'
p19204
aS"Undoubtedly immigration is intrinsically linked to every issue but it isn't necessary to shoehorn it into every answer."
p19205
aS"We don't have that many immigrants."
p19206
aS'I agree with his solution but can he just shut the fuck up about immigration?'
p19207
aS"I'm getting a bit sick of divide and rule."
p19208
aS"It's transparent manipulation."
p19209
aS'300,000 a year is not that many?'
p19210
aS'This is a simple matter of supply.'
p19211
aS'This audience is legally obliged to be neutral.'
p19212
aS'There should be no moaning.'
p19213
aS"&gt;We don't have that many immigrants\n\n77% of the population disagree"
p19214
aS'&gt;The vast majority of the country is voting Labour or right-of-Labour\n\nBecause they have no option.'
p19215
aS'Maybe labour should be recognising that massive applause and moving where people want them to be. '
p19216
aS"No alternative, other than the Greens (running in 95% of seats), Plaid, the SNP, Respect, Left Unity, Class Warfare, The People's Front of Judea, The Judean People's Front, the Socialist Labour Party etc."
p19217
aS'No alternative if they actually want their vote to count (outwith Scotland).'
p19218
aS'The whinging on this thread about the "bias" of the audience completely ignores the fact that a huge number of the electorate want to vote for a party to the left of the where Labour is now, and to have that vote count. '
p19219
aS'Exactly!'
p19220
aS'SNP is essentially the Socialist left-side of Labour, and also high on potential voters and supporters at this time.'
p19221
aS"If all UK citizens could vote for them, they would be a strong major party, but they can't."
p19222
aS'So Labour it is.'
p19223
aS'If people are moving towards a left wing government, why is UKIP the party that has seen the most growth in england?'
p19224
aS"Doesn't that suggest the opposite of what you are saying?"
p19225
aS"They're getting applause because they are speaking sense."
p19226
aS"They're saying what people know to be true and saying stuff they often don't get a platform to say it."
p19227
aS'No.'
p19228
aS"They are getting applause because they are saying things that *you* clearly agree with, and the BBC's skewed leftist audience also agree on."
p19229
aS'You heard yourself.'
p19230
aS"It's an independent, balanced audience."
p19231
aS"You can't handle the truth!"
p19232
aS"It's balanced."
p19233
aS'Farage virtually just demonstrated that himself by attacking them for not agreeing with his crackpot ideas. '
p19234
aS'The audience will boo Farage and clap at trite points, the rest of the panel will demonise Farage and gang up on him.'
p19235
aS"And the polls will once again show that Farage's views are representative of the vast majority of the public."
p19236
aS'Yep.'
p19237
aS'People are sick of those politicians.'
p19238
aS"They don't get it."
p19239
aS"The activists don't get it."
p19240
aS'Until they get it UKIP will continue to grow bigger and stronger. '
p19241

aS'The polls that usually have UKIP around 15% of the vote?'

aS'Like most areas like this we celebrate our diversity and ukip will never win a seat in this constituency.'
p19266
aS"It's been shown that those most scared of immigration are living in areas that are the least affected by it, suggesting that people's fears are largely the product of fear mongering by Farage and the media. "
p19267
aS'And yet 70% want immigration reduced, your anecdotal evidence is irrelevant.'
p19268
aS"I'm saying that that the reason that 70% want it reduced is because of the blame game the media and Farage play and not reflective of how those that are actually affected by it feel"
p19269
aS"You're saying that people who don't agree with you are brainwashed?"
p19270
aS"No, I'm saying evidence shows that immigration fears are greater in areas less effected by it."
p19271
aS'Other than direct influence by the effects of immigration how are people forming their opinions? '
p19272
aS"Maybe people go and see other areas and don't want their homes to become like the areas that they see?"

p19499
aS"Let's be honest here, UKIP and what they stand for is nevertheless a small minority party no matter how much you agree with them."
p19500
aS"You're bound to get lots of criticism wether you agree with it or not."
p19501
aS'No, I agree that UKIP are a minority party and the polls show that the vast majority do oppose them.'

aS"You're right, the audience does seem to be very left leaning which is strange when none of the parties are really left anymore."
p19503
aS"I'd say Labour were centre or even slightly right of centre, it's just that they're left of the Tories and even further left of UKIP."
p19504
aS"Far be it for me to call the general public uninformed but I think when Labour, Plaid and the Greens talk about opposing cuts they all applaud because, well, why wouldn't you want to oppose that."
p19505
aS"The only problem is you can't spend without cutting something and I don't think they've spoken enough about what they actually will do to bring the deficit down."
p19506
aS'Of course you can increase Governmental spending without cutting.'
p19507
aS'The whole point of Labour, and generally left-wing parties, is that higher governmental spending comes from higher taxation of the rich and to tighten loopholes, and then investing that money back to the public services of the lay people, rather than having to only resort to cutting the spending of some essential services to pay for the increased spending of other essential services.'
p19508
aS"Of course Labour and the left don't agree with tackling the debt in the same way Conservatives do either."
p19509
aS'They approach reducing debt by spending on public services and our economy, with the idea it will progress the country further and quicker, generating more money and slowly paying back the debt due to a more impressive economy and advancement on technology and medicine, bit at the potential risk of ignoring our current debt issues and hoping for the future, where as the Conservatives want to reduce debt by cutting spending and paying it back in yearly increments now, with the idea it will give us a more stable and sure economy, but at the expense of cutting of our public services and therefore slower economic, technological and Medical progression.'

p19956
aS'Also, that was an attack within Europe, which is no longer realistic.'
p19957

aS"The other examples you give are not existential threats to the UK, and not incidents where we ever, or would ever have conceivably come close to considering using nuclear weapons anyway, even though we had nuclear weapons for each of those conflicts, so they aren't particularly helpful."

aS"Of course the US wouldn't use nuclear weapons to defend British colonies and offshore interests, but then neither would we!"

p20078
aS"So you wouldn't oppose the Taliban, just nuke the region?"
p20079
aS'Cool plan bro. '
p20080
aS'No what I mean is, we should have a small, well equip force to deal with threats in 3rd world countries back up with strong air power, but for large national security against Russia and China have a defensive nuclear force as a deterrent. '

p20086
aS"So if you wouldn't fire them in the defence of a NATO country what is the point of NATO."
p20087
aS'If they invaded us then our best bet is to have a strong conventional force to repel them, and keep our territory.'

aS'If for example Russia attacked Estonia, we would send forces to help Estonia.'
p20093
aS'Why would we use a weapon then?'
p20094
aS'If we did we would bring destruction to our own shores direct Russian retaliation.'
p20095
aS'However if they attack us directly, war has already been brought to us and there for it gives us less worry to launch a full nuclear attack, as we have already received damaged.'
p20096
aS'The best example I can explain of this is the beginning of the "Phony War" in 1939, Britain sent its army to France/Belgium, though war was declared, in the UK there was no real rush to set up a total war economy or fear of invasion as many believed that after a few small battles the Germans would seek peace on there all ready territory gains.'
p20097
aS'It was not until the Germans broke through the Arden, cutting through french/British forces, and the retreat to Dunkrik was the threat of German attack became real to British leaders, at this point Total war was a reality and any chance of peace was going to done until either side was destroyed.'
p20098
aS'This scenario has to come for the use of Nuclear weapons to happen, if a NATO nation like Estonia was invaded you would probably see this phony war stance come back.    '
p20099
aS'The minute you fire a nuke you have just sentenced your population to death and lost your territory and everything in it.'

p20103
aS"No it couldn't, don't be silly."
p20104
aS'Now, any nuclear power could with a multitude of strikes, but when we get to the point where the entire army is being destroyed by nukes everything has gone a bit pear shaped anyway.'

p20197
aS"I don't think the Lib Dems will fall away as much as people think though."
p20198
aS'The major boost in their popularity in the last election came from young voters inspired by Cleggmania.'
p20199

aS'They lost a big chunk of the social democrat base they had, but the Liberals are probably less impacted in this regard.'
p20202
aS"Quite a few people I know who were unhappy with the coalition are still planning to vote for them on the basis that while their first time in office wasn't great, it wasn't bad either and they are still a party worth supporting."

p20213
aS'The strength of the SNP worries me (from an English perspective).'

p20215
aS'A question to Scots: Why are the SNP still so strong, despite the failure of independence?'
p20216
aS"As a generally Conservative-leaner, I honestly think I'd prefer a Labour majority than a Labour-SNP coalition."

aS"We didn't vote for them the same way England won't vote for the SNP."
p20221
aS"The Conservatives are essentially an English party, they have so little relevance in Scotland that when we're ruled by them from Westminster, we suffer the fractures and weakness you just referred to."
p20222
aS"To be fair, the Tories did still get 16.7% of the popular vote in Scotland at the last general election, and don't look to be getting much less than that this time around."
p20223
aS'Not huge, but a lot more than the SNP are going to see in England.\n'
p20224
aS"Well, people in England can't vote for the SNP."
p20225
aS"If a carbon-copy version of the SNP appeared called the ENP and put up candidates across England I bet you'd see them pull in a lot of votes."
p20226

p20227
aS"' which is telling."
p20228
aS'I have always believed in proportional representation by the way, so if it were up to me the Tories would get 16.7% of the seats.'
p20229
aS"Which wouldn't go down well with regular Scots who hate the Tories."
p20230
aS"But I think that's the way we should elect our politicians."
p20231
aS'In reality the Conservatives are a damaged brand in Scotland but I reject the notion that conservative liberalism is irrelevant in Scotland.\n\n'
p20232
aS"They're not a damaged brand, in the areas that really count (central Scotland, urban areas, the Highlands) they are a non-factor."
p20233
aS"They always pull in a few votes because there are rich people almost everywhere, and they always do well in the borders because there's a lot of wealthy folk down there."
p20234
aS'But in our current FPTP system they are an irrelevance.'
p20235
aS'I just got a Conservative leaflet through the door yesterday; in 2010 their candidate got 2,158 out of the 30,000 votes cast.'
p20236
aS"It's the same for most Scottish constituencies."
p20237
aS"I have to wonder why they're wasting their campaign money on me."
p20238
aS"A user said a while back a lot of people in Scotland are for the SNP providing devolution to Scotland and providing policies they support, whilst voting no to independence as they didn't want to actually lose support of the Union."
p20239
aS'Plus the 45% who voted yes are mostly still United behind the SNP cause, whilst the 55% are divided between various parties.'
p20240
aS'That makes sense.'
p20241
aS'We need to sort out this devolution stuff fast (inc. an English parallel) before it cripples national authority.'
p20242
aS'FFA for England is the way forward, its hardly an ideal solution but its the only workable one at this point.'
p20243
aS'Once that happens Barnet can go and Scottish MPs have no reason to complain about been excluded from voting on policy in England.'
p20244
aS"Course that would result in a sizeable budget cut for Scotland and NI though i doubt Scotland would mind if they get FFA them self's, NI would be pissed though."
p20245
aS'FFA?'

aS'Full Fiscal Autonomy, England controls is own tax rates and decides what to do with the money raised in England.'

aS'Other regions of the country do the same once other regions funding stops been based on Englands spending because of the [Barnet formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_formula), the [West Lothian question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lothian_question) can be resolved, and England will be free to set is own policy and/or have its own devolved parliament.'
p20248
aS'But until that happens other regions will always demand a vote on policy in England even on matters that are already devolved so wont effect there constituents because it can effect there funding.'
p20249
aS'&gt; Plus the 45% who voted yes are mostly still United behind the SNP cause, whilst the 55% are divided between various parties.'
p20250
aS'Which is why FPTP sucks.'
p20251
aS"The majority will be almost entirely represented by a party they didn't vote for or want."
p20252
aS"It's not even the worst example, that would be when Labour won a majority in 2005 with a 35% share of the vote nationally."
p20253
aS'Some insight from a Scot living in Edinburgh here.'
p20254
aS'SNP membership skyrocketed after the referendum: the party rose to become the 3rd largest political party in the entire UK.'
p20255
aS"While the country as a whole chose not to become independent at the time, the referendum itself was viewed as an outstanding democratic success, a fact that has contributed to the SNP's reputation as a serious political player."
p20256
aS'The other fact is that despite the country voting NO, the party has still stuck to their guns and not forgotten their primary goal as a group: Scottish Independence.'
p20257
aS'I think a lot of people here see that as integrity and determination, so rather than thinking "Pack up, we\'ve failed", there\'s a far stronger sense of "Not this time, but we\'ll keep trying!'

aS'Bit odd to compliment them for still existing - I mean no-one expected them to shut up shop on September 19th did they?\n\n\n'
p20259
aS'No, but there\'s a real sense of "bloody, but unbowed" up here.'
p20260
aS'I think the very fact that we had a visible referendum at all, and that 45% is not a small number was enough to make many Yes-leaning voters feel cheery and victorious in some way.'
p20261
aS"Aside from that I think it's clear that there is some part of the SNP machinery which functions at an incredibly effective level at the moment for some reason, and better than any other UK party."
p20262
aS'A lot of the criticism being voiced from England seems to be based on exactly that assumption.'
p20263
aS'The SNP are going nowhere, not while they command such a huge membership and continued governance in Holyrood.  '
p20264
aS'They are booming at the moment no doubt about it.'
p20265
aS'&gt; Why are the SNP still so strong, despite the failure of independence?'

aS"It's worth noting that the BBC didn't select the audience or the questions as far as I know "

aS'Do you think 80% of the UK population think immigration has had no effect on the housing market?'

aS'Are people really that thick?'

p20506
aS"We don't know how many left to right voters there were here."
p20507
aS"Most centre-right voters do not identify with Farage so their quietness would just be a result of Cameron - or even Clegg's - absence."
p20508
aS'When most polls after every debate show him as winner of the debate or within 5 points it and on issues like immigration constantly give him 50%+ support you have to start questioning how balanced the audience is.'
p20509
aS'50% of the nation polls UKIP or Tory, I find it hard to believe the audience was chosen with a 50/50 left/right split.'
p20510
aS"Anecdotally a lot of Tory and Greens voters I've met have been quite sympathetic to him and his views but are concerned about the dogwhistle politics his party plays."

p20514
aS'Not sure how you got that from my comment.'
p20515
aS'Correct me if I\'m wrong but these are the facts as I understand them:\n\n* According to Dimbleby, BBC hired an unnamed "independent polling organisation" to "carefully choose" audience members "to represent the balance between all parties.'
p20516
aS'"\n\n* Adam Boulton interviewed an audience member, one of the selected questioners, who told him that the debate audience organisers had not asked her about her voting intentions\n\nIf both these things are true how exactly can you "carefully choose" a balanced, representative audience without knowing their voting intentions going into the debate?'
p20517
aS"Farage constantly seems to poll very well before and after most debates yet in the actual debate you'd barely think he has 5% support."
p20518
aS'Of polls alone UKIP is doing better than SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens combined yet - and forgive me for employing my anecdotal analysis - I sincerely doubt the audience had more UKIP supporters than minor party supporters.'
p20519
aS"The audience doesn't seem very representative at all when you consider the disconnect between the negative mood in the room towards UKIP and the very positive, warm results for UKIP in the post debate polls. "
p20520
aS'You used exit polls as a basis for stating that the audience selection was biased.'
p20521
aS"This new argument you've created holds a bit more ground."
p20522
aS"Yes, the audience who didn't like UKIP were far more vocal, but then again there's a lot more crossover between Plaid/SNP/Greens and Labour."
p20523
aS'It was inevitable.'
p20524
aS'If the DUP, Tories and Lib Dems were invited you would see the same kind of crossover.'
p20525
aS'But please, if you believe the BBC were biased in their selection of audience please complain, it would make my day. '

aS"&gt; This new argument\n\nI said the exact same thing in my first post \n\n&gt;there's a lot more crossover between Plaid/SNP/Greens and Labour\n\nWho together poll below 50%\n\n&gt;if you believe the BBC were biased\n\nWell ... no, from what I understand audience selection was done by an independent organisation."
p20527
aS"It's quite the leap to claim the beeb are stacking the decks in a liberal conspiracy."
p20528
aS'I just think most likely scenario their independent organisation tossed audience selection to some junior/intern who ballsed it up.'
p20529
aS"It's central London, I'm not surprised a random audience of a 100 odd wound up being majority relatively far left wing."
p20530
aS"Personally, as a rule of thumb, I'd rather there be no audience participation in debates."
p20531

p20539
aS'Besides, most of the 50% are you mention are Tory - not UKIP - supporters anyway.'
p20540
aS'Farage did ask a coupe of pertinent questions but overall I felt he was beating the same drum for 90 minutes and ended up being tangential to large parts of the debate.'

p26373
aS"It's not privatization when the government hires a contractor."
p26374
aS"It's privatization when the government leaves something completely to the private sector."
p26375
aS'For instance, privatizing the schools would mean that the government would no longer provide any services.'
p26376
aS'It would be something that parents would have to purchase.'
p26377
aS'It is privatization, and it rips us off.'
p26378
aS'If the government can directly employ someone to provide a service, they should, as that means they can apply necessary oversight.'
p26379
aS"A private contractor will always aim to maximize their profit while minimizing their operating costs, which means that the government will pay for a full day's work, but receive only the bare minimum that passes as a full day's work."
p26380
aS'This has worrying implications when contractory privatization affects organizations that deal with people, such as schools, prisons, hospitals, orphanages, and especially elderly care.'
p26381
aS'It is why those of us that are less off will end up spending our last years miserable, bed-ridden and sedated with as much medication as possible \xe2\x80\x93 because, you know, the government *pays extra* for that "service".'
p26382
aS"You don't understand."
p26383
aS"If the government can't hire a private contractor and manage that contractor properly, then it can't be expected to provide the service that the contractor provides."
p26384
aS'The government has no factories.'
p26385
aS"It doesn't make anything (other than paperwork)."
p26386
aS'It must, by definition, hire contractors whenever it steps outside the realm of government into other areas.'
p26387
aS"You don't need a contractor to pass a law."
p26388
aS'You will always need contractors to fulfill government healthcare or build roads or supply cops and soldiers.'
p26389
aS'The choice is either to nationalize all businesses (in which case, the government would control the means of production) or sever the tie of government and allow these businesses to operate within the bounds of the law.'
p26390
aS"Where you will always have problems (as you've quite rightly pointed out) is where government and corporations work together."
p26391
aS"Take away the government's power to regulate and they are out of it, along with those problems."
p26392
aS'I see your point.'
p26393
aS'Let me reiterate that government ownership should, in my perspective, only be mandatory in fields that, in one way or other, need to provide various people with basic human needs, as those are fields that humanity has time and again shown to be completely unable to handle morally in the context of money ownership.'
p26394
aS"I don't care who manufactures mini Obamas for tourists."
p26395
aS"I'm not sure you're understanding."
p26396
aS"Management is the easy part and that's the part the government is terrible at."
p26397
aS'The reason it is so terrible at it is because there is no profit motives in government.'
p26398
aS'The reason businesses are so good at it, is only because they have to be because of the profit motive.'
p26399
aS'A bureaucrat has no incentive to manage such important needs for people.'
p26400
aS'They get paid whether they do a great, good, bad or horrible job.'
p26401
aS"It's only when their performance is so outrageously horrific do they really get punished."
p26402
aS'On the one hand you have no faith in "humanity", well humanity is part of the government, except that a bureaucrat by his/her nature must sever their tie from humanity.'
p26403
aS'How else can they be "fair"?'
p26404
aS"Governments do not exist to provide more humanity, they do quite the opposite, clinically classifying people and forcing them to do things they wouldn't otherwise do."
p26405
aS'I see that to you, my view seems incoherent, because you have given up on fixing your government.'
p26406
aS"You're ready to shift all power to business, because you think that the stereotypical government worker is a lazy bureaucrat who only makes no decisions at all, and you are astonishingly *correct* in that belief."
p26407
aS'But, the solution to bad government isn\'t to leave the bad government in place and let someone sell you their "better" one.'
p26408
aS'The solution to bad government is making it good government.'
p26409
aS'Yes, but how do you make it good?'
p26410
aS'If you already have a large, unwieldy organization, is the answer to give it more power, people and money?'
p26411
aS'No.'
p26412
aS'The answer is to make it small, more efficient, so it may not have as much power, but what power it does have is efficiently used.'
p26413
aS'Thereby, you gain by doing less.'
p26414
aS'You also have to understand that every program underneath the government is vulnerable to politics, whether that means direct intervention by some high authority or merely a low-level bureaucrat attempting to curry favors with someone on high.'
p26415
aS'So whatever "fixes" you put in place get circumvented by politics.'
p26416
aS'Always.'
p26417
aS'No matter how many civilian review boards you have, no cop is going to write a ticket for another cop or the mayor.'
p26418
aS"And truly privatizing something like (say) education, doesn't mean the government wouldn't enforce the law regarding the people running the schools, it just means it wouldn't run the schools badly as they do now."
p26419
aS'Like now, government swoops in when a law is broken or someone complains.'
p26420
aS"The difference would be, under a private system, the private company would pay, the customers (ie students) would be compensated and it wouldn't cost taxpayers much."
p26421
aS'Under the current system, the government has to protect us from the government program, which is an inherent contradiction because of politics.'
p26422
aS'So the "protection" comes in the form of minimizing the political damage and covering up what went wrong.'
p26423
aS"That means, either no one is compensated or if they are, it comes out of the government's pocket, which is our pocket."
p26424
aS'And we pay at both ends, we pay for the bad education, the correction for that bad education, the PR to correct the "problem of the problem" and on and on.'
p26425
aS"We can't fire government, because we can't fire ourselves, but we can fire a private company."
p26426
aS'That company has the incentive to deliver at least a partially good product because of the profit motive.'
p26427
aS"&gt; The difference would be, under a private system, the private company would pay, the customers (ie students) would be compensated and it wouldn't cost taxpayers much."
p26428
aS'I already wrote about this.'
p26429
aS'You are only factoring in money.'
p26430
aS'You are completely forgetting everything else in the world that is not money.'
p26431
aS'You will forget morality because of money.'
p26432
aS'You will forget to do good because of money.'
p26433
aS'You assume that there is no money in helping poor people.'
p26434
aS'Poor people are poor, but they are not broke.'
p26435
aS'They merely have less money than, say, working class folks.'
p26436
aS'The business model would be aimed at them.'
p26437
aS"It wouldn't be great, but the schools in poor districts are pretty horrific."
p26438
aS'And since for-profit schools would want the best students, the smart ones would be recruited to better schools on scholarship.'
p26439
aS'And government could provide tax incentives to the private schools that service certain areas.'
p26440
aS'You assume that corporations=no morality.'
p26441
aS'Then how can you assume people in government are more moral?'
p26442
aS'&gt; You assume that corporations=no morality.'
p26443
aS'Then how can you assume people in government are more moral?'
p26444
aS"I don't."
p26445
aS'I assume they will do whatever they can get away with, hence the need for oversight, vertical transparency, etc.'
p26446
aS'In a privatized model, the same would utterly fail, because corporations \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0or, more accurately, the *people* behind the corporations \xe2\x80\x93 have virtually limitless resources and can "sponsor" the members of any oversight committee or similar. '
p26447
aS'But where does the oversight come from?'
p26448
aS'You cannot insulate one part of government from another.'
p26449
aS'Whatever happens in a state reflects on the governor.'
p26450
aS'Whatever happens at the Federal level impacts the president and policy makers at the state level.'
p26451
aS'Policy makers have zero incentive to act morally, they merely need to act in their best political interests.'
p26452
aS'Corporations do not have limitless resources.'
p26453
aS'Everything they do is a calculation to make money.'
p26454
aS"If it's cheaper to bribe Congress, they do it."
p26455
aS'But if Congress had no regulation power, that would be a waste of money.'
p26456
aS"Their choice would be to bribe Congress to change laws that their competition wouldn't stand for or attempt to get a leg up on competitors through competition."
p26457
aS'Your model has no competition, therefore, people in their jobs have no incentive to do anything, moral or otherwise.'
p26458
aS'Vertical transparency.'
p26459
aS'Granted, it does require witting folk ready to run for office.'
p26460
aS'Edit: http://www.pogo.org/'
p26461
aS'&gt; Vertical transparency\n\nCannot work and is just as corruptible as any political group.'
p26462
aS'And yes, it is political.'
p26463
aS'It also has no profit motive, which means, it too, is vulnerable.'
p26464
aS'"Witting folk"?'
p26465
aS"Oh, I'm sure they run, but they don't get elected."
p26466
aS'I mean, where are these people?'
p26467
aS'Have they ever run?'
p26468
aS'And what magical protection apparatus would shield them from the corruption of party politics to get anywhere?'
p26469
aS'Again, another model/solution that is just as corruptible.'
p26470
aS'The beauty of the private sector is that, well, everyone is out for the money.'
p26471
aS'Everyone involved knows that.'
p26472
aS'There are no ideologues, no political zealots, no kowtowing to religious nuts or special interest.'
p26473
aS'There is only math.'
p26474
aS'What is and what is not profitable.'
p26475
aS'You know where you stand, always and that knowledge allows you to make plans and move forward.'
p26476
aS'It is real, pragmatic and sensible.'
p26477
aS"The problem with government is that it is not any of these things unless you're constantly pressuring and monitoring it."
p26478
aS'And even then, that pressure and monitoring may not work.'
p26479
aS'Or may get delayed or may simply be politically impossible.'
p26480
aS"And if you truly want government to be more responsible to outside pressure, you'd shrink it considerably."
p26481
aS'Make it a real possibility that people can throw out elected officials.'
p26482
aS'Less powerful government means more powerful citizens.\n\n'
p26483
aS"And again, you're cherry-picking the points that are failing\nin the system to support your own privatization fantasy."
p26484
aS'These are things that have to be fixed anyway!'
p26485
aS"My point is, you can't fix the corrupting influence of politics any more than you can fix greed."
p26486
aS'The only thing you can do is separate the various influences and balance them against each other.'
p26487
aS'The current two party system cannot be balanced.'
p26488
aS'They are no longer opposing forces checking one another.'
p26489
aS'Over the years, the policies has cemented the power structure in such a way that there is no longer competition and there was precious little within the parties to begin with.'
p26490
aS'That power structure has slowly drawn in more and more of the private sector, which benefits, but also is being corrupted.'
p26491
aS"Once you're in an industry that needs government approval, you have to lobby Congress or watch your competitors crush you."
p26492
aS"You sever Congress's power in that area, you diminish the corruption."
p26493
aS'The greedheads in Congress go back to the private sector, where they can make more money.'
p26494
aS'&gt; The current two party system cannot be balanced.'
p26495
aS'Suggest you make it a more-than-two party system.'
p26496
aS'Privatization at scale can never work, because game theory.'
p26497
aS'It is always more advantageous for two corporations to work together towards a common goal.'
p26498
aS'This is why we have Coke and Pepsi, for instance, but no real third alternative.'
p26499
aS'Would love multi-parties or no parties.'
p26500
aS"However, you need to cut off the endless money supply and you can't do that without changing the policies that drive the money into these campaigns."
p26501
aS'It is not always more advantageous for two corporations to work together because they are both vying for the same market.'
p26502
aS'Their alliance is always very uneasy, because one will swoop in for the market share whenever possible.'
p26503
aS'Or are you now saying that corporations are good at keeping their promises?'
p26504
aS'And as far as Coke and Pepsi go, have you not heard of the many other colas available?'
p26505
aS'Some people (punishableoffense) are just born with small brains.'
p26506
aS'No way around it, no matter how much sense you throw at them.'
p26507
aS'They just repel common sense or plain out brainwashed.'
p26508
aS"I think, as compared to most redditors, (punishableoffense) was relatively polite and open to my views, even though he didn't agree with them."
p26509
aS"I appreciate your support, but let's all try to keep it polite."
p26510
aS"You can't win people over with vitriol."
p26511
aS'making govt good = making govt smaller and taking them out of the equation.'
p26512
aS'all the govt should do is run the court system and uphold the laws, plain and simple.'
p26513
aS'only the local govts should collect taxes to run the basic necessities such as trash removal and policing. '

aS'So lets take a look at these...\n\n\n**Myth 1:  The first myth is that American consumers will see a huge spike in food prices if companies are required to disclose the GE ingredients that are already in their products.'
p26520

aS"**\n\nThis isn't actually something farmers say.... so it isn't even really a myth."

aS'Second, this is a science issue so the opinions of farmers are not really relevant, just like the opinions of consumers.'
p26527
aS'If they want to use their market power,then go for it.'
p26528
aS'However, they would be better sered using the labels already in existence.'
p26529
aS'**Myth 3:  The third myth is that we can rely on voluntary measures alone.'
p26530
aS"**\n\nI understand that activists are not satisfied with voluntary labeling because it doesn't do what they want, which is to ban GM crops."
p26531
aS'However, you simply cannot mandate life-style labels.'
p26532
aS'**Myth 4:  The fourth myth we hear is that we cannot label GE foods because they are not dangerous.'
