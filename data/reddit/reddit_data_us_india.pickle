p387
aS'It turns out that most of the Internet consumed is rich media, especially videos.'
p388
aS'So if you look at things like text, text-message services like search or Wikipedia, or basic financial or health information, can be delivered relatively cheaply and can consume less than 1 percent of the overall infrastructure.'

aS'So if you are thinking about building something that operators can offer for free, it needs to be pretty cheap for them to do.'
p390
aS'And we\xe2\x80\x99ve basically figured out a series of services that people can offer, and it actually ends up being profitable for the operators.'

p392
aS'So even if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid for a phone plan, you can always dial 911, and if there is a crime or a health emergency or a fire, you get basic help, and we think there should be an equivalent of this for the Internet as well\xe2\x80\x94where even if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid for a data plan, you can get access to basic health information or education or job tools or basic communication tools, and it will vary, country by country.'

p394
aS'The worst part of this was the apps used to suck donkey balls, we had no choice to remove them , they took up memory in an already low-memory phone, and for no reason they used to run in the background making the phone slow.'

p1955
aS"But for mobile internet, the govt is already heavily into it and it's not a free market anyway."

p1957
aS'Each circle has a very operators and new operator cannot get in easily.'
p1958
aS"So it's not a free market at all."
p1959
aS"Instead of holding a no holds barred auction for the spectrum, if the govt decides that in each circle, it's going to split the spectrum into 10-20 pieces and bring closed to a free market, and accepts not the highest bid per se, but rather the highest bid which will get them 10-20 operators, then I think we need not have net neutrality for mobile internet also."
p1960
aS'What if the government allowed private ownership of the spectrum, and simply auctioned off chunks to the highest bidder sequentially?'
p1961
aS"Prices would be set naturally as telcos wouldn't have to worry about making their money back within 20 years and won't be artificially high."
p1962
aS"Also I'm not sure but what I'm getting from your suggestion of splitting the spectrum, it seems you're worried about a monopoly on the spectrum, but I don't think that's likely as it's similar to the first scenario explained in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOBD6v8g1F4"
p1963
aS'I would have agreed if your argument would have been more nuanced.'
p1964
aS'There are 2 types of networks - wireless (2/3/4 G) and wired (broadband)\n\nSpectrum over which wireless internet is provided is a national resource and is "licensed" to telcos for 20 years duration.'
p1965
aS"Telcos don't own it and govt has every right to dictate how telcos can use it."
p1966
aS'Net neutrality is a fair game here even by free market standards.'
p1967
aS'As for the wired broadband, for which telcos lay down the infrastructure themselves, there is a case of free market to dictate the services delivered.'
p1968
aS'However, advertising their network as "internet" will not be correct in this case.'
p1969
aS'They are free to market "Failnet zero" as a non-internet service over the cables they laid.'
p1970
aS"I'm suggesting that instead of licensing spectrum, the government auctions it off allowing private ownership of it."
p1971
aS"Government involvement every x years in choosing how it's auctioned only invites corruption and bureaucracy imo."
p1972
aS"This wouldn't artificially drive up prices as guaranteed property rights would let the market set the prices."
p1973
aS"Free market does not always work and it's not a perfect system."
p1974
aS"Government does need to make sure that the free market doesn't lead to monopolies, because it completely ruins the good parts of free market."

aS'But monopolies do hurt small businesses and consumers.'
p1983
aS'I agree with you that this is possible only in truly free markets, and the video acknowledges that.'
p1984
aS'Which is why I think market regulations are what need to be examined.'
p1985
aS'Monopolies are firstly something that cannot be established without government intervention, so its wrong to blame the players instead of the game.'
p1986
aS'Government should not own the spectrum and license it every few years, it should allow private ownership of the spectrum.'
p1987
aS"Where I agree with you is that how they've become a monopoly is wrong and immoral, through corruption in the government."
p1988
aS"However two wrongs don't make a right and that's why instead of forcing net neutrality we should look at ways of promoting competition. "

aS"If you ever ran a business through a Facebook Page, you'll know what exactly this means."
p3017
aS'Before Facebook Pages were very, very lucrative - you go ratchet up a following of 100,000+ genuine likes and every post you made would reach about 80-90% of these users.'
p3018
aS'Small, local businesses used to heavily depend on Facebook pages for letting their fans know about new products, promotions, discounts and various other communications.'
p3019
aS'Then Facebook started artificially limited the reach of the posts to 10% of the fans... then 8%... then even less, now people report 2%.'
p3020
aS'You can still get 80-90% coverage of your own likes, but only if you pay Facebook to promote your post.'
p3021
aS"For many small businesses (think your local pizza joint), this wasn't sustainable."

aS'Other than getting user data, there is another aspect that Facebook is targeting which is "Driving govt policy making and communication in developing countries".'
p3035
aS'If Internet.org becomes the last-mile method to connect with people, then all govts will have to route their messages through facebook for maximum reach.'

aS'If he wanted to provide internet access, he would provide the whole internet, not just facebook and a handful of other sites.'
p3047
aS"The internet in its entirety is a basic right, and offering schemes like Internet.org and violating net neutrality will open a can of worms that Zuckerberg won't have to deal with, but the Indian people would."
p3048
aS"This isn't exactly earth shattering."
p3049
aS'To some degree, everyone pumps up their identity online to look well known and popular be it a business or individual.'

aS"You're the product being sold to advertisers."
p3058
aS"You're not selling yourself, Facebook is selling you (or, rather, the data they have about you, and your constant eyeballs looking at the adverts)."
p3059
aS"I thought the internet.org's position was that you'd get some internet for FREE."
p3060
aS"So you'd get a basic version of facebook / bbc / some other random stuff with your normal phone connection (without having to pay extra for data)."
p3061
aS'That does not seem to violate the basic ideas of net neutrality does it?'
p3062
aS'Just talking about internet.org here, not airtel zero.'
p3063
aS"If they had given option to select the sites you wish to, yes it doesn't violate but since no such option exists it is against."
p3064
aS'If they want to give the internet for free, they should give the internet for free.'
p3065
aS'By that I mean give maybe 200mb for free irrespective of websites visited.'
p3066
aS"The fact that 'internet.org' is restricted to facebook and a few other sites means that someone is making money somewhere."
p3067
aS"I'm drawing an analogy with toll free telephone numbers."
p3068
aS'The person being called covers the cost of the call.'
p3069
aS"Isn't this similar to that?"
p3070
aS"No it's not."
p3071
aS'If eureka Forbes set up a toll free number, **anyone** could call it up.'
p3072
aS"If you set up a zero plan, the only people who can call it up/use it are people captured and stuck on that network, they can't call anybody else."
p3073
aS"That's the opposite of free."
p3074
aS'Plus this means there is an incentive to compete on an non infrastructure basis.'
p3075
aS'If earlier companies would only have to worry about price and reach,  now they can double charge content providers, thus reducing the pressure to compete on infra.'
p3076
aS"I don't know how Airtel zero is supposed to work."
p3077
aS'But hypothetically, someone owns a website and wants people to visit it as much as they like without having to pay for data.'
p3078
aS'The person is also willing to pay for the data usage.'
p3079
aS"I believe it would still violate net neutrality, but I don't see why one shouldn't be allowed to do that."
p3080
aS"This conversation is like agreeing that murder via bullet is better than murder via knife; we're discussing which type of murder is better but the concept that you shouldn't be murdering is lost."
p3081
aS"The simple reason you don't want people to violate net neutrality is the same reason you don't want companies to cheat or engage in corporate espionage."
p3082
aS"It creates a non level playing field, and on the Internet where minor advantages determine empires, it's a big deal."
p3083
aS"Net neutrality has been a de facto principle of the net, it's how hotmail could be accessible to everyone with a net connection, and how face book was able to grow so big: the nature of the Internet is a huge market place where visitors can sample any and all goods."
p3084
aS"But what the telecoms didn't like, is that they were tasked with building the roads which allowed people to trade, and the traders were making a lot of money off of it."
p3085
aS"They weren't getting anything."
p3086
aS'Remember - telecom companies used to only make money on the amount of phone time you used.'
p3087
aS"All of a sudden that's not enough."
p3088
aS'Now they want a cut of the money people are making in the bazaar.'
p3089
aS"So they tell you it's like a 1800 number, and they will be giving it to some people for free!"
p3090
aS'How cool is that!'
p3091
aS'Well these arguments are made to confuse you and hide the fact that the Internet is not like a telephone network.'
p3092
aS'If someone makes a great website, everyone would go to it.'
p3093
aS'If they stopped being good, people would go to their competitor.'
p3094
aS'The bazaar is a better model than pipes.'
p3095
aS"Many big companies don't want this."
p3096
aS'They live in fear of someone findings a way to out smart them.'
p3097
aS'So they say to the telecom people "I\'ll pay you more, but create a wall here, and I\'ll sell my goods in it.'
p3098
aS"These people won't see any of the other goods so it's great for me, and it's great for you because you get paid twice and can start controlling access to the market."
p3099
aS'"\n\n\nSo when they talk about zero rating.'

aS'Or .. How good were you when you applied?'
p4103
aS'I just posted that there are lots of openings in you category, but from my personal experience I think there are loads of guys out there with the same profile as you.'
p4104
aS'I think an employers mindset would be to get the person to start working immediately.'
p4105
aS'So when they can find the same workforce locally i.e., in finland and someone who can join immediately, they will definitely be inclined in choosing that candidate than a person from India.'
p4106
aS'One primary reason for this would be the time taken to process your visa and the delay in you joining.'
p4107
aS'AFAIK, you need to have some specialized skill not available in candidates who are applying for the same job portfolio.'
p4108
aS'Then you have a very good chance of getting through even if you apply from India.'

p4116
aS'There are many openings for software engineers, mostly for app developers, web developers, and others with experience with front-end, back-end and full stack web developers.'
p4117
aS'At least companies seem very picky about choosing kernel developers or those tasks that entitle C/C++.'

aS'I am doing my masters but i will try to answer to the best of my knowledge.'
p4127
aS'Doctoral candidates are considered as a work force so most likely you will be applying for a work permit under the researcher category.'
p4128
aS'You will earn the basic pay for any doctoral candidate (~2500) unlike US where the income or stipend is meagre.'
p4129
aS'Ofcourse since you come under the work visa you are not entitled for any student benefits.'
p4130
aS'This work visa does not allow yo to work in any other fields as a full time worker.'
p4131
aS'As for the procedure to apply, I am not aware of the details.'
p4132
aS'If i were you, then I would browse through the list of universities research group and mail the professors of the groups I am interested in. '
p4133
aS'&gt; You will earn the basic pay for any doctoral candidate (~2500) unlike US where the income or stipend is meagre.'
p4134
aS'Did you mean 2500 EUR?'
p4135
aS'Anyways, the income/stipend being *meagre* in the US is not quite true.'
p4136
aS'Most universities do provide you good sustenance. '
p4137
aS'Yes, atleast all my friends who are doing their PhD get somewhere around the sum I specified and those from USA, whom I personally know, get less and hence my opinion.\n'
p4138
aS'You have missed the most important factor - living costs.'
p4139
aS'These costs in the US vary from state to state, from city to city.'
p4140
aS'For example, University of Washington will get you ~3000 USD but University of Virgnia you might get ~2000 USD.'
p4141
aS"That's a huge variation, so that generalization is not possible.\n"
p4142
aS'Very true.'
p4143
aS'My opinions are biased based on people around me.'

aS'Since you have PhD, you should know better. '

p5445
aS'OK I copied this from "A Response to #airtelpledge from the SaveTheInternet.in\xc2\xa0Coalition"\n\nAirtel is incorrect when it says that Airtel Zero is like a toll free number.'
p5446
aS'Here is why:\n\n* A toll free voice service is a support mechanism for most businesses, and not the sole entry point for the business like an app or a website.'
p5447
aS'An Internet company has 100% dependency on Internet access providers and telecom providers, while that is not the case with most companies that use toll free voice services.'
p5448
aS'This leaves room for potential abuse, in case of differential pricing, manipulation of access speeds, or monopolistic hiking of rates, like in case of carriage fees in Cable TV.'

aS'Read what happened in Cable TV in India here.'
p5450
aS'* A toll free voice service isn\xe2\x80\x99t the mode of delivery for the service itself: it\xe2\x80\x99s a mode of information, and rarely, a mode of transaction.'

p5452
aS'* Providers of toll free voice services do not compete with their customers.'
p5453
aS'However, in case of the Internet, telecom operators have launched competing services.'
p5454
aS'For example, Airtel\xe2\x80\x99s Wynk is a music streaming service which has plans that come bundled with free data, while, at the time of launch, its competitors did not have that option.'
p5455
aS'This is a cross-media ownership issue, where the carriage mechanism also owns content, and can abuse its position of controlling access.'
p5456
aS'* Once one startup joins, because of high dependency, competitive pressure ensures that others also join.'

p5470
aS'Its ridiculous.'

aS'Cost of living and salary and everything is lower there.'
p7415
aS'Its like comparing rent in mumbai n delhi.'
p7416
aS'Of course its different but aying that its "unfair" is pointless. '
p7417
aS'Hmm name few "tier 2" cities that have the same kind of plans?'
p7418
aS'And er hyd is a tier 2 city?'
p7419
aS'O.o'
p7420
aS'So the cost of living in Hyderabad is so low that airtel is able to provide 16mbps till 75GB and then 2mbps for just 999 but here in Delhi 2mbps till 9GB and then 512kbps and that too we pay more than that....Really?'
p7421
aS'You want me to believe on that'
p7422
aS'Sigh.. Well of course it wpnt be the only reason genius, but im sure its one of the factors.'
p7423
aS'You can only price your products according to the cost of what it takes to be in business there, the buying power of the people snd the price of the competition.'
p7424
aS'Everything matters.'
p7425
aS'Its like saying in bombay, eating at restaurants is expensive.'
p7426
aS'It is because raw ingredients are more expensive, rent is more expensive etc.'
p7427
aS'A lost of the factors dont even determine how good the food will be.'
p7428
aS'It might be the same as the food in another branch of the same restaurant in delhi or hyderabad.'
p7429
aS'In case of telecom, there is a lot many factors going on.'
p7430
aS'I believe delhi prices may come down soon if a new competitor steps in.'
p7431
aS'I heard Railtel is making an entry. '
p7432
aS'Yes agree with competition thing, airtel just needs a good competitor in Delhi.'
p7433
aS'Right now they know  there is no competition in delhi, mtnl and tikona services are crap, local cable broadband providers are not many.'
p7434
aS'So only choice left is airtel, Monopoly.'
p7435
aS'As far as pricing is concerned new ISP are using fiber optics with at least 10mbps plans so obv their plans will be some what higher(twist- they still charge less than Airtel).'
p7436
aS'Airtel is not a new company, they are just rising the prices or cutting down the benefits.'
p7437
aS'Copper wires can easily deliver at least up to 8mbps speed.'
p7438
aS'I know a lot of things come into consideration when deciding on prices but this is just pure greed.'
p7439
aS'Nothing can justify this pricing. '
p7440
aS'Completely agree.'
p7441
aS'Greed is too lame a word to use.'
p7442

p7480
aS"I first came across this, detailed argument in Jaswant Singh's book - A call to honour."
p7481
aS"If Pakistan remains a country where an individual has no economic prospects, it's easier to slide into religious barbarism."
p7482
aS"It doesn't cost much to give a kid an AK and ask him to be on a boat and cause terror in a remote land."
p7483
aS'Unless the kid knows and realized what he could be missing out.'
p7484
aS'Ideology is useful for driving the leadership part of a movement but for mass recruitment and foot soldiers, you need poor, disillusioned youth with no prospects.'
p7485
aS'So this China deal works for India, as long as it results in lesser crazy-ready kids.'
p7486
aS"A Pakistan that doesn't collapse into tribal anarchy or turn into a talibanized theocracy is better for us, yes."
p7487
aS'Nuclear weapons falling into the hands of crazy warlords would be disastrous.'
p7488
aS'But stronger ties between countries that are hostile to us is never good.'
p7489
aS'China has very little interest in the welfare of India.'
p7490
aS'Russia or even the USA might, but not China.'
p7491
aS'What would you think of an outright strategic partnership with US if, hypothetically, US were to suggest it?'
p7492
aS'The US would want to use India as a pivot to keep China in check in the region.'
p7493
aS'So going completely over to their side would turn India into a pawn.'
p7494
aS'Much in the same way Pakistan has been used as a pawn.'
p7495
aS'It would also push Russia away and strengthen the dangerous possibility of a tripartite Russia-China-Pak alliance.'
p7496
aS'How do people here feel about superpowers seeking alliance with and bolstering Pakistan?'
p7497
aS"Like how despite being so much richer and more developed, India has to make do with outdated planes and aspire for Rafael's while the US decks out the paki Air Force with f-16s."

aS'It must be pretty annoying.'
p7499

p7500
aS'Gonna be an uphill struggle man. '

p7503
aS"&gt;India has to make do with outdated planes\n\nI don't think this is completely true."
p7504
aS'Many IAF planes are really really good, and during the Kargil war were quite decisive.'
p7505
aS'The [Sukhoi Su-30MKI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-35), for example is by no stretch an outdated plane.'
p7506
aS'Remember that F16 too is a very old plane, many of these Migs and Sukhois are similar with updated avionics and armaments.'

p7508
aS'Gonna be an uphill struggle man.'
p7509
aS"That's true."
p7510
aS'India has always had a very isolationist policy towards geopolitics, and leaned slightly towards Russia.'
p7511
aS"It's inevitable that global power balances change, and as India gets richer there will be more leverage to actually start to participate in the major power club."
p7512
aS"It's always difficult to not get caught up into the games of *other* major powers, and become a pawn like Pakistan."
p7513
aS'America/China both have the desire to "use" India, but then again that is how global realpolitik works.'
p7514
aS'Everyone is driven by their own self interests.'
p7515
aS'Chinese investment in Pakistan is win win for everyone.'
p7516
aS'Now, China has a very strong financial incentive for stable Pakistan.'
p7517
aS'Economic development reduces infant mortality which also reduces total fertility rate and kids being born into poverty and being swept into religious madness.'

aS'Extremism might spread to Chinese territory along the trade routes.'

p7523
aS'India has no chance of export led development, which is a good thing.'

aS'Gov Rajan has reminded Modi that Make in India, is really Make in India for India.'
p7525
aS'Export led model has several flaws that deserve its own post.'
p7526
aS"India's only real export is high end talent and it is imperative that we maintain extremely strong ties with Indian diaspora who are the ones who will invest in the knowledge economy that India is creating."
p7527
aS'The right development role model for India is Israel and not China.'
p7528
aS'It sounds crazy but it is true.'
p7529
aS'In terms of scientific achievements per capita, Israel is way ahead of any other country.'
p7530
aS'It is a perpetual startup nation.'
p7531
aS'India will become something similar after a two/three decades.'
p7532
aS'Diaspora led development not export led development.'
p7533
aS'Modi is a genius who is creating strong bonds with the Indian diaspora in US, Europe, Canada etc.'
p7534
aS"It's not always a good idea to assume that shifting global power balances will always be in India's favor."
p7535
aS'With immense pressure from NATO, Russia might gradually shift much closer to China, and a Russia-China-Pakistan pact would be a problem for India.'
p7536
aS"America has very complex interests, and won't suddenly become best buddies with India outside of business interests."
p7537
aS"They see India as an unreliable and often fickle ally that doesn't want to take sides."
p7538
aS"We don't have a democracy that is pliable enough (to them)."
p7539
aS'What this means is India might end up completely alone, with no reliable allies jumping to our defense on anything.'
p7540
aS'India has a very passive and isolationist role in geopolitics even now, and thinking shifting power balances is a credit to any individual Indian politician is simply naive.'
p7541
aS"Israel is not a model for anything, or anybody in the world - it's a tiny country formed of an extremely skilled immigrant population, propped up by enormous amounts of American aid and a very unique culture (in some ways there are parallels to Japan)."
p7542
aS'You have to realize that for the most part, India is still a very poor country plagued with internal problems (and the Kashmir/Pakistan issue) and mostly just a blip on the radar for most major world powers, even China.'
p7543
aS"Obviously this will change, but we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves."
p7544
aS"China isn't a good model because much of their success is the result of undemocratic and state-controlled capitalism moves."
p7545
aS'Not once in my comment have I mentioned that India will benefit from US or any of its allies getting closer to us.'
p7546
aS'Nor did I claim any Indian politician is responsible for shift in foreign policy of the West.'
p7547
aS'The trade deal with Pakistan is good for India in its own right.'
p7548
aS"That's what I have mentioned."
p7549
aS"On the Israel model, I don't think you are being creative enough."
p7550
aS'Think more long term, beyond two decades.'
p7551
aS'Indian diaspora is massive and is only going to swell in the coming two to three decades.'
p7552
aS'It will be the largest immigrant diaspora the world has ever seen (more connected to the homeland than the Chinese diaspora), way larger than the high skilled Jewish diaspora who returned to Israel.'
p7553
aS'When most of your population is concentrated in urban regions, and you have a hyper knowledge based economy, your innovation centres start looking like Israeli cities.'
p7554
aS'Last but not the least, Israel gets billion dollars in aid not merely because of geopolitical reasons, there is a strong Jewish lobby pushing it in that direction.'
p7555
aS'I credited Modi for having a long term mindset despite battling million demons of the present.'
p7556
aS'Indians, especially political leaders dont think long term.'
p7557
aS'The same mistake you are making.'
p7558
aS'Modi is thinking way beyond Make in India.'
p7559
aS"If you don't start building/maintaining ties with the diaspora now, you will not be able to be able to use this asset two decades down the line."
p7560
aS'**It is particularly important, as we worry about the flames of the present, to keep an eye on the future.'
p7561
aS'**'
p7562
aS'India does not benefit from this China-Pak trade agreement in any way.'
p7563
aS"If countries hostile to India co-operate that's a bad thing."
p7564
aS"It's not about being creative on Israel - I've seen people bring up innumerable countries like Japan, Singapore, Korea, Israel and China in the past."
p7565
aS'The problem is each of these countries are very unique and it\'s not really sensible to just copy what they do or start saying "our older leaders were so stupid, why didn\'t they follow them, Modi will JUST SEE!!!'
p7566
aS'"\n\nIndian migrants aren\'t really comparable to the Israeli situation, and Modi or whoever woos them won\'t really mean anything.'
p7567
aS'Most of the changes that are happening in the world have very little to do with Modi, or MMS and just 1 year into this government singing praises is a bit much imo.'
p7568
aS'Many people are fall into the trap of blind optimism.'
p7569
aS"&gt;more connected to the homeland than the Chinese diaspora\n\nThis simply isn't true."
p7570
aS'Fresh off the boat migrants have stronger ties, the Chinese in America are often 3rd, 4th or 5th generation immigrants.'
p7571
aS'You are also overvaluing NRIs tremendously.'
p7572
aS'Most NRIs want to settle in the West, and are hardly ever going to be a major driver for the Indian economy.'
p7573
aS"It's insanely unrealistic to expect NRIs to return in droves and start building megacities in India, it just isn't going to happen."
p7574
aS'And what stopped them from doing it up until now ?'
p7575
aS"Please don't tell me it's only about congress misrule that Modi will suddenly turn around."
p7576
aS'People go to the West for a better life; the sort of life they simply cannot get in India.'
p7577
aS"Modi isn't a god, he is a leader of a country plagued with innumerable problems."
p7578
aS"Honestly the kind of hype and expectations people have for Modi is just unreal - keep expectations under the stratosphere and maybe then you won't be disappointed."
p7579
aS'Things that seemed insane twenty years ago happen everyday today.'
p7580
aS'So things that seem insane to you now will happen twenty years from now.'
p7581
aS'Indians will return in large numbers, not to build Indian mega cities but to live in them two decades later.'
p7582
aS"Also, I don't understand why you are assuming I think Modi is a god."
p7583
aS'I just think it is a stroke of genius to form bonds with fresh off the boat Indian immigrants as a long term investment. \n\n'
p7584
aS"What we do have is a party that isn't totally dysfunctional, corrupt, and a leader that is popular with the people."
p7585
aS"There's less parliamentary deadlock obviously - so reforms can now actually get through."
p7586
aS'But to say modi is a genius ... seems just fanboyish as hell to me.'
p7587
aS"We've always had decent relations with the NRI community."
p7588
aS"In the last 1 year we've seen sensible economics from the govt, and no surprises in foreign policy."
p7589
aS"For the most part it's all just a continuation of what's been happening for almost 2 decades now."
p7590
aS"There has been very little real change to immigration status for NRIs - and that's one of the things the NRI community wants."
p7591
aS"Being nice to some fresh off the boat indians who have ties to hindu conservative groups won't suddenly transform the perception of the much larger NRI community."
p7592
aS"And PR only goes so far - it's good, but yeah ..."
p7593
aS"The NRI love for Modi is ridiculously exaggerated, and if you drill down it's very far away from reality."
p7594
aS'Some Indian communities - maybe.'
p7595
aS'And if we come back down to earth: megacities ?'
p7596

p10656
aS"However, I have also had my share of\nwhat I call\n'musically challenged' pupils - one such pupil\xc2\xa0being Robby(\xe0\xb4\x9f\xe0\xb4\xbf\xe0\xb4\xa8\xe0\xb5\x8d\xe0\xb4\xb1\xe0\xb5\x81)..\nRobby was 11 years old when his mother\n(a single mom) dropped him\noff\xc2\xa0for his first\npiano lesson."

p10659
aS'Well, Robby began his piano lessons and\nfrom the beginning I thought it\xc2\xa0was a hopeless\nendeavor.'
p10660
aS'As much as Robby tried,\nhe lacked the\nsense of tone and basic rhythm needed to excel.'
p10661
aS'But he dutifully reviewed his\xc2\xa0scales and some\nelementary piano pieces that I require all my students\xc2\xa0to learn.'
p10662
aS'Over the months he tried and tried\xc2\xa0while I listened and\xc2\xa0cringed and tried to encourage him.'
p10663
aS"At the end of each weekly lesson he\nwould always say 'My mom's going to hear\nme play\xc2\xa0someday'."

p10666

p10667
aS'Then one day Robby stopped coming\nfor his lessons.'

aS'I thought about\xc2\xa0calling him,\nbut assumed that because of his lack of\nability he had\xc2\xa0decided to pursue something else.'
p10669
aS'I was also glad that he had stopped\xc2\xa0coming\xc2\xa0\nhe was a bad advertisement for my teaching!'

aS"Several weeks later I mailed a flyer recital to\xc2\xa0the students'\xe0\xb4\xb0 homes."
p10671
aS'To\xc2\xa0my surprise, Robby (who had received a flyer)\xc2\xa0asked me if he could be in the recital.'
p10672
aS'I told him that the recital was for current pupils\xc2\xa0and that because he had dropped out,\xc2\xa0he really did not qualify.'

p10674
aS"'Please Miss Honor, I've just got to\xc2\xa0play'\nhe insisted."
p10675
aS"I don't know what led me to allow him\nto play in the recital - perhaps it was his\ninsistence or maybe something inside\nof me\xc2\xa0saying that it would be all right."
p10676
aS'The night of the recital came and the high\nschool gymnasium was packed\xc2\xa0with parents,\xc2\xa0relatives and friends.'
p10677
aS'I put Robby last in\xc2\xa0the program,\xc2\xa0just before I was to come\xc2\xa0up and thank all the students and play a\xc2\xa0finishing piece.'

aS"I thought that any damage he might do\nwould come at the\xc2\xa0end of the program\nand I could always salvage his poor\nperformance through my 'curtain closer'."

aS'Well, the recital went off without a hitch,\nthe students had been\xc2\xa0practicing and it showed.'

aS'ITT: BJP supporters arguing that their party should not bring in UCC.'
p12249
aS'Its seriously funny how Guha manages to write an article on removing Sharia from Muslims laws of India, but still come across as someone who is only interested in attacking BJP, RSS or Hindutva, and even Hinduism in the past in the form of Manu Smriti.'
p12250
aS'Let us look at the mentions to them in the article:\n\n&gt; One reason Ambedkar and Nehru first reformed Hindu laws was that a large body of Hindu liberals supported them, they were numerous and powerful enough to offset the opposition from reactionary bodies such as the Hindu Mahasabha and the **Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh**.'
p12251
aS'&gt; The **Bharatiya Janata Party, whose ideological forbears** bitterly opposed the reforms of the Hindu personal laws (on the grounds that it gave Hindu women too much independence), now claims to be in favour of a common civil code\n\n&gt; Is it merely that, since the BJP claims to be in favour, they must be against?'
p12252
aS'&gt; Part of the movement for a common civil code undoubtedly comes from a desire to impose uniformity and thus hasten national integration.'
p12253
aS'Hindutva ideologues additionally argue that the failure to thus far bring about a common code is because of an alleged "appeasement of minorities".'
p12254

aS'In the same para, Guha had the option to use some harsh language against the pernicious practices that are laid down by Koran, like child marriage with 50 year old men, but he does not.'
p12258
aS'Rather, he goes into a tangent and talks about the practice of untouchability, which has nothing to do with the debate on the UCC!'
p12259
aS"I mean, you write an article on polygamy, and the stripping down of rights of women due to Koran, and can't even come up with ONE word that criticizes Koran."

aS"You don't want to be killed by some poor Muslim who has been persecuted by the evil Hindutvavadis."
p12262

p12263
aS"Let me here coin the Guha's Law: **The only way liberals in India can criticize Koran or Islam or other religions is by criticizing Hinduism, and by implying by that they also criticize other religions**."
p12264
aS"They can't or never will directly criticize the other religions, cause that is against Indian Liberal code of conduct."

aS"He reproduces the Supreme Court's view because he does not agree with it at all:\n&gt; the Muslim husband enjoys the privilege of being able to discard his wife whenever he chooses to do so, for reasons good, bad or indifferent, indeed for no reason at all."
p12270
aS'And, is the law so ruthless in its inequality that, no matter how much the husband pays for the maintenance of his divorced wife during the period of iddat, the mere fact that he has paid something, no matter how little, absolves him forever from the duty of paying adequately so as to enable her to keep her body and soul together?'
p12271

p14822
aS'These states (esp TN and Kerala) rank high when it comes to socio-economic indices.'
p14823
aS'The median age in these states is 29, 27, 31, 26 respectively.'
p14824

p14846
aS'To make this a reality needs policy push '
p14847
aS'No, we should not aggressively farm the lands which are arable.'
p14848
aS'Instead we should try use the Gangetic Plain to create a network of canals within UP which will fuel the the entire region with water and the land will become more arable in the process.'
p14849

p14850
aS'If there is water present in the region, there will be trees.'

aS'I can understand that most people will not be happy to do this.'

p14860

aS"In some states, women are not allowed to pursue education further because they must learn how to become a housewife instead, the government's new policy changes towards this are really good."
p14864
aS'However, it still leaves behind those who cannot afford to send their kids to school simply because they do not earn enough money.'
p14865
aS'For them, we need to greatly expand the school infrastructure, because most of them will also be involved in the above scheme.'
p14866
aS'And the government needs to build boarding schools for these kids.'
p14867
aS'That way, the kids will be able to learn, live and eat amongst kids from similar backgrounds to theirs.'
p14868

aS"But I don't think you can deny that quality of life is considerably lower in Bihar than Maharashtra."
p14966
aS"I specifically asked for counterexamples in my statement, and didn't get a single one."
p14967
aS'Asking now, if you are interested.'
p14968
aS'&gt; i personally think the opposite would be much more likely\n\nAlso, as to the probability of the opposite being greater....anecdotal, but one of my Pune friends is married to a guy from Bihar she met at work.'

p14973
aS"That's not racism."
p14974
aS'&gt;For your information racism isn\'t "mwaha ha ha kill all jews" movies would have you believe.'

p14979
aS'I think it\'s far more productive to counter what you feel as racist with a proper explanation (like: it\'s the leadership of these states that makes them shit), instead of being so defensive and shouting "racism".'

p14992
aS"So they're not racist."
p14993
aS'You know what I always felt racism was defined as?'
p14994
aS'Unfairly judging/discriminating a community by saying their problems are caused by an inherent defect in the community without caring about the economical or sociological context.'
p14995
aS'But your definition is pretty good.'
p14996
aS'Mainly because it exonerates every instance of racism.'
p14997
aS'I checked this thread a long time ago, so perhaps there were slightly racist comments later on.'
p14998
aS'Anyway the thing is there will always be backward regions and communities pretty much all over the world.'
p14999
aS"It's the duty of governments to bring these up to speed."
p15000
aS'Obviously there are historical, socio-economic, governance, cultural and religious reasons for backwardness but that is secondary.'
p15001
aS'Other than extreme fascists or completely bigoted racists, everybody gets that.'
p15002
aS'Pointing out that a community is backward is not racist at all, and getting defense it about it is a bit silly imo.'
p15003
aS"I really don't understand why some people go out of their way to say that all cultures are equal and some should not be modernized - when it's so blatantly obvious that this just isn't the case."
p15004
aS'Bihar, UP and many other parts of north, central and north west India have living standards that are barely above sub-saharan africa.'
p15005
aS'They have very serious cultural problems, superstitions, medieval attitudes, a terrible political situation, communal tensions, oppressive tribalism and extreme violence.'
p15006
aS'They are far less modernized than some parts of India, less educated and less "westernized".'
p15007
aS"They're often more conservative."
p15008
aS'And yet, these people form an enormous chunk of decision making in the Indian parliament.'
p15009
aS'Naturally this will frustrate a lot of people who see these regions as holding India back.'
p15010
aS'Criticism is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something (or somebody) in an **intelligible** (or articulate) way.'
p15011
aS"I don't see much of that happening here."
p15012
aS'It\'s just a lot of "oooh... northie so poor, fucking up my developed state.'
p15013
aS'" Although I have to accept that a lot of constructive discussion has happened here since I posted my original comment.'
p15014
aS'And about the definition of racism I guess we will just have to disagree.'
p15015
aS'I believe that thanks to constant vigilance we have almost eradicated the "kill it" kind of racism but these are the kind of posts where the closet racists get a chance to let loose under the veil of criticism.'
p15016
aS'&gt;I believe that thanks to constant vigilance we have almost eradicated the "kill it" kind of racism \n\nI think this kind of bigotry is still quite rampant, and in India trying to eliminate this mentality is close to impossible.'
p15017
aS'Many Indians have a very ethnocentric, conservative and tribalistic view (in-group thinking) of the world - and this is very slow to change.'
p15018
aS'This is a far bigger problem and "my feelings are hurt" or the far-left SJW interpretation of racism and bigotry is something that is utterly futile to counter at this point in India.'
p15019
aS"Having said all this, I think it's true that some communities and cultures are indeed backward; and they definitely need to be brought up to speed."
p15020
aS"I don't believe that all cultures are created equal and that we should be okay with whatever regressive and medieval nonsense they promote."
p15021
aS'Society needs reform and this kind of radical egalitarianism is naive and holds people back.'
p15022
aS'Parts of central, north and NW India do indeed have severe social and cultural problems.'
p15023
aS'High fertility rates, dramatically greater crime rates, feudal mentalities, worrying levels of fundamentalism, superstition, a lack of modernization and westernization, communal tensions, terrible political situations, crime, anti-intellectualism and pathetic attitudes towards education and learning.'
p15024
aS'They should be helped out of this cesspit.'
p15025
aS'Saying "they\'re fine it\'s just their culture, stop being racist" is really silly imo.'
p15026
aS"&gt;Bunch of racist bigots all these so called developed states which can't handle the fact their prosperity is outside people's hardwork."
p15027
aS'Its not that, its more abt a culture clash, there have been migrants from outside states coming into Mumbai since decades.'
p15028
aS'There are a-holes among the UP-Bihar types who dont acknowledge that they owe their progress to Maharashtra cos they fked up their own states by voting over caste and chutiya samajwadis but still pretend like they are smartest ppl in the country  and say shit like "hindi hamari rashtra bhasha hai...since we speak hindi and Lord Rama ka ghar is our state that naturally makes us better that you darkie descendants of Ravana"...and also try to show preference to their own state ppl using dirty tactics and push out locals wherever they settle....which of course doesnt sit well with said locals and so you have sena nutjobs or their equivalents chasing up-biharis through the streets.'

p18003
aS'You have Airtel, on Sunday April 19th , there is a live telecast of Sachin Tendulkar having sex with Sunny Leone, while Aishwarya Rai is giving him a BJ, and at the same time there is an IPL final to be telecasted live on xyz.com.'
p18004
aS'On Sunday, you have an emergency, where you need to constantly send images of your hear monitor reading to your doctor so he can guide you.'
p18005
aS'The two online streaming has taken considerable bandwidth, and you are not able to send you information to your doctor.'
p18006
aS'Here, do you think it would have been helpful if Airtel did put a restriction on amount of Data usage by xyz.com, and porn straming site?'
p18007
aS'Would that violate net neutrality? '
p18008
aS'You watching sachin tendulkar having sex will not effect my connection with doctor.'

p18011
aS'If I chose to watch sex while dying it is fucking my problem.\n'
p18012
aS'I think you are confusing data plan with band width. \n'
p18013
aS'No you are the one who is confused and fucking big time.'
p18014
aS'If I take 80 GB plan @ 2 Mbps \n\n2 Mbps is my bandwidth.'
p18015
aS'You watching sex will not effect it.'
p18016
aS'lol, ok. so you get a constant speed of 2 Mbps regardless of anything?'
p18017
aS"it's constant at 2mbps, period?"
p18018
aS'I though you knew what you were saying.'
p18019
aS'Bandwidth is SHARED bhai, you 2 mbps is your allocated Bandwidth.'
p18020
aS"So if the data traffic is high, it'll affect your Download/upload speed."
p18021
aS"That's common sense."
p18022
aS'SPEED FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE DATA TRAFFIC .'
p18023
aS"That's why during peak usage, your internet speed decreases. "
p18024
aS'There are different set of regulation which state that minimum speed to be at least provide it you are offering x Mbps connection.'
p18025
aS'Okay.'
p18026
aS'That does not come in net neutrality.'
p18027
aS'This minimum speed can be increased by improving the infrastructure.'
p18028
aS'This has nothing to do with net neutrality.'
p18029
aS'This congestion occurs because there are more number of users latched to network thab it was initailly build foe.'

p18033
aS'What ever you are saying does not comes in net neutrality.\n\n\n\n'
p18034
aS'&gt;This minimum speed can be increased by improving the infrastructure\n\n\nThat improving the infrastructure is tremendous investment, good sir.'
p18035
aS"How do you expect telecos to improve the infrasturcture if they don't make enough profit to do that?"
p18036
aS'India unlike USA does not have just 3-4 service providers, India has 10. so, the economics and problems here are different from that of USA.'
p18037
aS'&gt;This congestion occurs because there are more number of users latched to network thab it was initailly build foe \n\nAnd how does your point answer my question?'
p18038
aS'What basically you are saying is , "that\'s not my problem?".'
p18039
aS'On one hand you are saying NN is about data discriminiation, i.e *certain entity getting more bandwidth to transmit their data to the customer then other.'
p18040
aS'* When I said what in case of heavy traffic, should important services like "sending pictures to your doctor" be given advantage over watching IPL, or porn, you said, *well improve infrastructure.'

p18042
aS'*. '
p18043

p18046
aS"They ain't suffering any loss so stfu about how much money is invested."
p18047
aS'Their profit increases every time.'
p18048
aS'Gali de k baat mat kar.'
p18049
aS"It's an example, don't you understand the difference between an example and a literal event?"
p18050
aS"What do you mean separate private channels, why don't VOIP, and OTT services use these leased lines instead of eating into the teleco bandwidth they built?"
p18051
aS"You still haven't answered my question, in case of heavy traffic, shouldn't there be a priority on bandwidth allocation."
p18052
aS'Please stick to the point. '
p18053
aS'OTT is being used by you not companies.'
p18054
aS'You are using that you have to pay for it.'
p18055
aS'You have to buy leased lines not them.'
p18056
aS'Actually at their office they do have a leased line connection so that their connection with internet is always at top performance.'
p18057
aS"&gt;in case of heavy traffic, shouldn't there be a priority on bandwidth allocation."
p18058
aS'Please stick to the point.'
p18059
aS'They can cap the speed of heavy users in an area.'
p18060
aS'Such capping does not comes under net neutrality.'
p18061
aS'Your problem solved?'
p18062
aS'Why cap the speed when I am paying for the speed?'
p18063
aS'that is more in violation then NN.'
p18064
aS'I am paying for 2 mbps, you want ISP to cap my speed, so that flipkart can not be downloaded at 10 Mbps?'
p18065
aS"that's illegal"
p18066
aS'That comes under fair usage policy not NN which differs for  telecom company and I am not entertaining you further you are quora dumb.'
p18067
aS'Lol, ok. Socialism Zindabad'
p18068
aS'Sending pictures to doctor ..lol you can send it even after net neutrality is implemented easily'
p18069

p18070
aS'Kya net neutrality be?'
p18071
aS"you are not able to answer my simple question, in case of heavy traffic, shouldn't there be priority in services?\n"
p18072
aS'Yeah you are very intelligent.'
p18073
aS'Do not support net neutrality.'
p18074
aS'Okay okay \n\nFirst you talk about revenue deceasing for telocs.'
p18075
aS'They you say they should throttle services such ha live streaming which earn them more revenue for socialism aka send doctor a PIC.'
p18076
aS'To decided karo socialism yaan revenue.'
p18077
aS'Dono nai milta intelligent bow'
p18078
aS'Wow, you should work in media for distorting my statement.'
p18079
aS'In case you don;t know if you pay for 2 Mbps speed, you get 2 mbps.'
p18080
aS'If certain services pay your ISP provider, so that when you use that service you get 8 mbps in addition to the 2mbps you paid for, is not your problem.'
p18081
aS'You are getting more then what you paid for.'
p18082
aS'What you are saying is , every service should be able to send you data at only 2mbps (hence socialism).'
p18083
aS'If a service provider pays ISP money so that their data can be transfered at a speed faster then others( all other will be sent at 2mbps, which you paid for), that is good for ISPs as it earns them revenue.'
p18084
aS'More revenue = better infra=better service.'
p18085
aS'Do you understand now or should i EL5?\n'
p18086
aS'Let me ask you another question, suppose your speed is 2Mbps, you get 2 Mbps, but if you are using flipkart, the download speed is 10 Mbps.'
p18087
aS'How does that matter?'
p18088
aS'you paid for 2mbps, you are getting 2 mbps.'
p18089
aS'What flipkart gives to airtel for addition 8 MBPS is not your problem.'

p18094
aS'Highway = Spectrum allocation of the telecos.'
p18095
aS'Lanes = your allocated bandwidth (in Mbps), and Data = Car, and Dataplan = fuel.'
p18096
aS'in case of less traffic you can use 2 lanes to drive (2mbps) , hence you can reach your destination faster, by changing lanes when necessary.'
p18097
aS'But the highway belongs to everyone, hence during peak hours, there is so much traffic that the car will reach the destination much much late.'
p18098
aS'Do you understand the difference between Bandwidth, data plan, internet traffic and interned speed now?'
p18099
aS"I didn't quite understand, sorry."
p18100
aS'You are saying, there is not a dedicated spectrum for Govt.'
p18101

p19476

aS'rape and acid attacks are not accidents though.. just sayin.. but govt should be paying their bills though..'
p19480
aS'If one person attacks another and the latter gets injured, should he also get a free or subsidised treatment? '
p19481
aS"oh k..  so think about rape and acid attacks.. they ruin their lives.. they are broke mentally and physically.. i think they deserve some govt help..      there are levels of cruelty.. and govt should help out in the cases that are really bad like rape and acid attacks.. \n\naccidents are very common and is more of a luck.. i mean if govt had enough money, i wished they were free, but you can't exptect govt to do that for now.. in western countries, every emergency hospital visit is pretty much free.. they must admit and treat even if patient can pay the bills or not.. i understand india is not at that stage yet, but we can start going towards it.. \n\nabout personal fights, well it could be subsidized depending on how bad the case is.. take the case of nirbhaya rape, that was also a personal attack.. she actually died of an attack than rape.. i think she shouldn't have to pay in such case.. \n\nbasically, govt should help in very bad cases and especially to lower economic class people in these cases.. "
p19482
aS'Yes right, acid attacks and rapes are intentional and can be prevented.'
p19483
aS'Accidents, on the other hand, just happen.'
p19484
aS'No matter how much you take care about safety, accidents are sure to happen.'
p19485
aS'So, accident victims should have more priority to get free treatment than victims of any other cause of injury or harm. '
p19486
aS'really??'
p19487
aS'so we should not help the family of someone who got raped or got acid attacked with face ruined  in mental, physicial and financial turmoil because of some intentional asshole.. \n\nbut we should help someone who was driving at 150 km/h carelessly and got into accident??'
p19488
aS"the thing about accident is, half of the times, it is your own fault you got into an accident.. but rapes and acid attacks are NOT your fault.. \n\nanyway.. i'm all for free all kind of emergency medicine.. but given the financial constraints, i believe if we are to choose, rapes and acid attacks should be free before accidents are.. and there are several reasons for that including rarity, severity and financial feasibility.. "
p19489
aS"&gt; anyway.. i'm all for free all kind of emergency medicine\n\n at doctors cost or govts?"
p19490

p19502
aS'this is what you said exactly: "accident victims should have more priority to get free treatment than victims of any other cause of injury or harm.'
p19503
aS'" \n\ndoesn\'t that mean you\'re saying that given the budge constraints, we should help accident victims before rape or acid attack victims??'

p19520

aS"It's one of those words that has lost all meaning - I don't think we have a real authority on the subject that we can ask."
p20005
aS'They mean that they would like to eat chicken but not on Tuesday cuz Hindu bro. '
p20006
aS'Different people have read it differently.'
p20007
aS'Here in r/india, I have seen people saying all kinds of stuff.'
p20008
aS'For some its saraswati vandana, following caste system et al.'
p20009
aS'For some others it is about wearing Indian clothes.'
p20010
aS'For some others its just being, and not really bothered about religion or culture or whatever.'
p20011
aS"Everything is 'being Hindu'."
p20012
aS'For a few, it is being one of these three: Modi supporter, BJP supporter, or RSS supporter.'
p20013
aS'For some it is about minorities declaring themselves originally Hindu.'
p20014
aS'So it is everything from being ultra conservative, ritualistic Hindu who believes in everything from caste system and Manu Smriti, to being ultra modern and atheistic.'
p20015
aS'As vague as it comes.\n\n'
p20016
aS'what do you mean by what does it mean?'
p20017
aS'Hinduism is a cultural lifestyle not a religious ishtyle.'
p20018
aS'It means that there is no single doctrine that determines who is a Hindu and who not.'
p20019
aS'You have to take a total picture of the person\'s "way of life" to determine if he is Hindu or not.'
p20020
aS'For example, a keralite hindu may eat beef, whereas a Gujarati Hindu may be vegetarian.'
p20021
aS'On the other hand, the Gujarai Hindu may not worship Vishnu ( being a worshipper of Krishna), whereas the Keralite Hindu may be a worshipper of Shiva, whereas the Gujarai Hindu may only follow [Swaminarayan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaminarayan_Hinduism), where Swaminarayan sect has relatively modern genesis.'

p20025
aS'Whereas in a real Secular society that is not the job of the court, cause all laws apply similarly to everyone.'
p20026
aS'So if you remove the bias for minorities in our constitution, all these definitions will become useless. \n\n '

p20028
aS'You are right - SC is not a Subject Matter Expert in "Theology".'
p20029
aS'The SC saying "Hinduism is a way of life" doesn\'t make it one nor if SC says "it is a religion" - it would.'

p20031
aS'Kuch bhi!'

p20045
aS'Arrey!'

aS'I meant that currently there are laws favoring majority and minority BOTH - not ONLY the minority.'
p20047

aS'I read about Soviet PM Bulganin and Indian talks, Khrushchev, esp [this article was informative](http://in.rbth.com/blogs/2014/07/05/nikita_khrushchev_on_early_russian_impressions_of_india_36465.html)  \nThis site is quite good although sometimes its a bit heavy on propaganda-esque rhetoric and language.'
p20800
aS'Their article on the [Indian Cold-Start military strategy against Pakistan](http://in.rbth.com/blogs/2015/03/16/how_indias_cold_start_is_making_the_world_a_safer_place_41995.html) was really good and informative.'
p20801
aS'Have read some Asian relevant CIA cables that were de-classified and is on their site, i think these are known to many, as these are the ones which provide an insight into what was going on with the US positions to India, Pakistan and China over the decades.'
p20802
aS'It provides an understanding of the Elites thinking, esp geo-strategic since its not muffled by public PR.'
p20803

p20804

p20805
aS'As for historical China, have read a lot about their development right from early stage, cultural developments, political and intellectual developments over thousands of years.'
p20806
aS'http://www.thegreatcourses.com/ TGC, was an invaluable resource for that.'
p20807
aS'It has some really incredible content on a lot of subjects, not just China.'
p20808

aS'Then there are the podcasts.'
p20812
aS"On China one can't go wrong with China History Podcast of Lazslo Montgomerry."
p20813
aS'A few BBC ones, like [In our times](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl)  \n\nDepending on the interests podcasts are another great resource, esp for Historical material.'
p20814
aS'They are even better than reading because the information is provided in a much more briefer and concise manner.'
p20815
aS'These are just a few i use, there is also an old Google Reader list and bookmarks list compiled over years for when there is a need to do research.'
p20816
aS'So i guess my recommendations would be podcasts and TGC website or others like it, plus Youtube videos from academics or other reputable channels/people.'
p20817
aS'Really depends on the fields of interest. '
p20818
aS'Thank you!'
p20819
aS'Also, btw I get a lot of my world political/economic knowledge from publications like FT and economist.'
p20820
aS'How good are these?'
p20821
aS'Because I notice a very anti-China (and even anti-India sentiment) in both.'
p20822
aS'But both publications cover a lot of topics and seem to give good insight, which is why I read them.'
p20823
aS'Personally i hold the same view about Economist as a lot of its critics hold, about their slant.'
p20824
aS'But i think that is my own bias colluding my judgment as well.'
p20825
aS"Other users here have informed me that though Economist has an anti-China and sometimes anti-India bias, it isn't really Anti-That Country but rather just following a very idealistic approach to its own beliefs in its writings, which are deeply rooted in Left(i hope i got that right) Liberalism."
p20826
aS'I do read them though, i have a list of sites in that feed of mine which is content from outlets and authors with whom i disagree 100%.'
p20827
aS"I can't stand people like Gordan Chang (the China collapse guy), but i follow him to keep up with him."
p20828
aS"Overall i'd say i think its correct to read Economist because their writers/journalists are still some of the best in the world."
p20829
aS'And the range of topic they cover is wide.'
p20830
aS"It was on Economist i learned that [Barca's passing under Pep was not just normal passing, it was unique](http://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2014/09/analysing-football-styles)  \nI sort of suspected this being a long time football and Barca fan but stats backed that up."
p20831
aS'Economist does a lot of such things across sectors.'
p20832
aS'Though at times i do find a hard time believing or taking a lot of their views seriously, ideologically(but as i said that is to do with me on a personal level).'
p20833
aS'FT is paywalled heavily, and bypassing it constantly is a chore.'
p20834
aS'But it most definitely does have really interesting and more importantly exclusive content.'
p20835
aS'These are Current Affairs sector though not Historical like you were suggestion in the previous comment.'
p20836
aS"For current affairs, i don't use podcasts, because they can inundate you, there is just too much info and too many episodes from too many podcasts to keep up with."
p20837
aS'Information overload.'

aS'Their growth has been impressive.'
p20846
aS"I will also recommend making custom Twitter lists, don't even have to be an active twitter user, just use it as a tool, find the content you find interesting and aggregate it in a list, Twitters recommendation engine is quite decent at times."

p20876
aS'It was a horrible mess for the Philippines between 1899 and 1946 depending on who you were.'
p20877
aS'For the elite descended from Spanish and half-Spanish citizens and landowners and the Chinese-descended merchantile classes, it was a minor hiccup as they traded old Spanish business contacts with American ones.'
p20878
aS'For the regular farmer under these groups, it was still business as usual, with only the forcible addition of compulsory education.'
p20879
aS'However, the worst off were those who in one way or another resisted the enroachment of American supremacy.'
p20880
aS'Away from the main towns, insurrections lasted up until 1910, necessitating scorched earth and concentration camp strategies very much similar to British treatment of Boer farmers during the Second Boer War, which was happening at approximately the same time.'
p20881
aS'Summary and retaliatory executions were normal, and at the same time the ferocity of counter-attacks especially in the southern islands were such that the old revolvers in use by troops had to be replaced by larger-caliber guns, which then drove the development of the venerable M1911 semi-automatic pistol.'
p20882
aS'After pacification however, exploitation was very much indirect and rarely punitive, as the landowners became willing participants in the American supply chain by converting their plantations to coconuts and other agricultural products to support the American economy.'
p20883
aS'I am not particular well informed on that sector of the globe, sorry.'
p20884

p20891
aS"AFAIK, Americans didn't want to go to war at all, they joined very very late."
p20892
aS'War was in sight as back as early 30s and it took a Japanese attack for the Americans to join.'
p20893
aS'Besides, given they were creating a new economy after the Great Depression, hence makes me doubt if Americans were really vying for a political dominance over the world.'
p20894

p20910
aS"You're assuming that the Japanese leadership was reacting to an economic sanction from the US when in fact they had already made plans for getting supplies and reserves from elsewhere."

aS'Like most wars, the Japanese leadership were acting on beliefs &amp; experience created by previous wars.'
p20912
aS'When they sneak attacked Russia in 1905 it led to a peace settlement overseen by Theodore Roosevelt.'
p20913
aS'Coupled with their experience in WW1 and their intelligence assessment that the US was increasingly isolationist (see neutrality acts) they arrogantly assumed that the US would not have the will to engage in the brutal warfare, recruit manpower, industrial resources (though they had the capacity) it would require to defeat japan. '
p20914
aS'Japan was a global power by that time, of course they had plans to take over territories like Philippines which were under US control at that time.'

p20918
aS'Majority of their supplies support was for the Allies.'
p20919
aS"US was not naive, you don't get to become a global hegemon by accident and stay that way for decades by accident either, it needs careful planning."
p20920
aS'And them slowly putting Britain aside was part of that plan.'
p20921
aS'But the debate here was another, i used this as just 1 of the points along others to highlight that the claim that US gave an ultimatum to Britain to leave India is rather naive and not how it happened.'
p20922

p21068
aS'FDR\'s reaction was nice, and the US intervention necessary at that point, but I would have wished if Wilson refrained from intervening in WWI driven by his messianistic view of "freeing the oppressed", fighting for democracy and all that jazz.'

p21084
aS'The strategy works similar to this:\n\nIf I have a piece of gold I can issue 100 piece of paper and tell people they can redeem the paper with me in exchange for 1/100 of my piece of gold.'
p21085
aS'After I spend/issue all 100 pieces of paper I print 900 more.'

p21102
aS'When the blight destroyed the potatoes, the Irish starved.'
p21103
aS'They were also forbidden from fishing.'
p21104
aS'Not only this, but the British turned away ships full of food aid for Ireland from the Ottomans as it exceeded the donation of Queen Victoria and they saw this as a slight against their queen\'s "generosity".'
p21105
aS'The death of a million Irish and exodus of a million more rests at the feet of the British empire which raped Ireland, marginalised her people (who were British citizens at the time) and left them to starve.'

p21107
aS'Nope.'

aS'Ireland was exporting enough food to feed its entire population and then some.'
p21109
aS"Potatoes were a great choice for those with just a few square metres of land outside their tiny stone houses to feed their families, they're energy rich, grow well in nearly any type of soil, and combined with milk can provide almost all your nutritional needs."
p21110
aS"The real point though is that the Irish weren't in charge of their destiny, the British decided everything, and they treated the Irish with near total contempt."
p21111

p21120
aS'The Irish famine was entirely natural, the food that was exported was by private citizens and the efforts that were made were serviceable but sabatoged, first by a more progressive pm being replaced with a laissez-faire one, and that the person in charge of the charity works was a classist, racist bastard.'
p21121
aS"You don't understand our history and should try to approach it with respect if you do, rather than just wanting to fill in an agenda. "

aS"i'm not saying that yo don't feed them, obviously you do."
p21137
aS"But it really couldn't go on."
p21138
aS"Even when the power of the landlords was broken by British initiatives in the late 19th Century to fund farmers buying their land, really at pretty generous rates (iirc there were schemes that the government would provide like 3/4 of the money and they had to be paid back over ten years), that amount of people couldn't live off the land as they did."

p21384
aS'As I said, presenting fringe, outdated research as facts is very unprofessional.'
p21385
aS'"I have presented my facts, you present yours" is a bad argument because the probability of somebody who\'s read about the Bengal famine coming along is ridiculously low; it\'s essentially telling a bunch of redditors what to believe, presenting not-very-reputable sources as fact.'

aS'Fringe research should first, ideally, be presented to academia, not to forums to attempt to sway opinion.'

p21412
aS"Then again, nobody on here is a professional, so I don't know what I was expecting."
p21413
aS'Also, his Nobel prize has nothing to do with the Bengal famine; he was awarded one for *empirical* studies on famines, not his assumptions on one particular famine.'

p21419
aS"I'm confused."
p21420
aS'Do you or do you not want to dive into the details of those sources?'
p21421
aS'It seems all it takes is someone voicing an object against a source for you to quickly discredit them.'
p21422
aS'You claim nobody is willing to dive into the details of a source to do a thorough examination (this is not Academia after all).'
p21423
aS'Hence, you should be willing to accept that a Nobel laureate is a reputable source.'
p21424
aS'But if someone is critical of said source, you have a problem with it -- yet you do not want to do a thorough critique or even analyse any pre-existing criticism thoroughly yourself.'
p21425
aS'So it seems you\'re saying 2 different things:\n\n1) I want "acceptable" sources.'
p21426
aS'If a critique has been voiced against said source, I will discount that source as legitimate.'
p21427
aS'2) I am not willing to dive deep into any of the above to do a thorough analysis of the source myself.'
p21428
aS'So, taking it to its logical extension, what is means is this:\n\n"I will only respect X as a source if and only if there is no criticism Y against it.'
p21429
aS'" In doing so, you are already prejudiced against X by not granting it the same respect as you do Y.'
p21430
aS'So basically, you want universal acceptance.'
p21431
aS'Except this is fallacious, because the topic under discussion is an inherently controversial phenomenon that has been historically very poorly studied, not to mention, people have actively tried to suppress it.'
p21432
aS'Churchill being one of the most revered men of the 20th century and all that.'
p21433
aS"Don't get me wrong, I am all for counter narratives, and an not claiming that the original sources are 100% correct, but the entire point is that when there is a contentious issue under question, you do not wave away the sources as not legitimate enough (Your original comment had nothing to do with the validity of source material or counter claims, but with the fact that the sources happened to be economists and journalists making them invalid/not acceptable enough, a laughably ridiculous notion)."
p21434
aS'No.'
p21435
aS'What you do is talk about both sides of the aspect.'
p21436
aS'So which is it?'

aS'Excellent!'
p21443
aS'It is both of these.'

p21792
aS"Dacca was even more famous as a manufacturing town, it's muslin a source of many legends [...] But in 1840 it was reported by Sir Charles Trevelyan to a parliamentary enquiry that Dacca's population had fallen from 150,000 to 20,000."

p28140

p28141
aS"However, it's important to understand a few things."
p28142
aS'First, anti-vaccination parents aren\'t exactly a "small minority," particularly when you look at the stats by community.'
p28143
aS'Anti-vax parents tend to cluster in certain areas, and because of the way diseases like measles and pertussis spread, these pockets of low vaccination rates are a huge issue.'
p28144
aS'Anti-vax parents will continue to be a serious public health problem even if our overall national vaccination rate remains high.'
p28145
aS'Second, because our vaccination rates in the U.S. have remained high, adult immunizations/boosters were never really considered much outside of some high-risk individuals (e.g., hospital workers, military personnel, etc).'
p28146
aS"For a long time,  it was believed (and I think there was evidence to show this) that as long as vaccination rates among children remained high, adults weren't an issue, even if their immunity from vaccines started to wane."
p28147
aS"In fact, most insurance companies wouldn't even cover adult vaccinations prior to the early 2000s."
p28148

aS"Third, you are absolutely right that herd immunity is everyone's responsibility."
p28150
aS'This needs more attention.'
p28151
aS'But people and doctors also need more/better information.'
p28152
aS'For example, most doctors will tell you that the Tdap vaccine (tetanus, diptheria, and acellular pertussis) is good for 7-10 years.'
p28153
aS'The problem is that the pertussis component of the vaccine only lasts 2-3 years.'
p28154
aS"But I've still encountered doctors who didn't know this, or even doctors who were not yet aware of the new CDC guidelines recommending women receive the vaccine during the third-trimester of each pregnancy."
p28155
aS'So the information needs to get out there to people and to physicians as well.'
p28156
aS'I work in public health and the dissemination of this information (or lack thereof) is more of an issue than people realize.'

aS'If the CDC reports that 90% of US children are vaccinated than non vaxxers ARE a tiny minority--immuno-compromised children are part of the remaining 10% of unvaccinated children.'

aS'Some people are reacting to gluten via Celiac Disease, some people seem to be reacting to other components of the wheat like the specific types of sugars, and there also seems to be at least one additional condition that is a reaction to gluten, but has more to do with psychological symptoms than digestive ones.'
p29264
aS'We have more questions than answers at this point.'
p29265
aS'The big question is why these things are becoming more common in first-world countries.'
p29266
aS'Blood samples from the 1950s show lower levels of gluten antibodies than modern blood samples.'
p29267
aS'Countries divided politically and economically, but not genetically, also show greater prevalence in the more modern and wealthier societies.'
p29268
aS"So we're losing our ability to digest foods, and the big hypothesis now points to the microbiomes that we've been killing off with a multifront onslaught of antibiotics, antimicrobial cleaning products, and preservatives in our food."
p29269
aS"All in all, it has been a very enlightening and productive field of research, but that doesn't necessarily mean we understand it yet, either."
p29270
aS'This study referenced pretty clearly showed no link between physical symptoms and gluten.'

aS'It would be difficult to find a better study.'

aS'We know what celiac disease is and how to diagnose it.'
p29275
aS'This study shows no evidence to support people claiming gluten intolerance out side of celiac disease.'
p29276
aS'Further study should be done, no doubt.'
p29277
aS'More data never hurts.'
p29278
aS'But the picture is becoming clearer and clearer that non celiac gluten sensativity does not cause physical symptoms as far as we know today.'
p29279
aS'Obviously people are suffering but right now i think it makes sense approach these symptons systematically and scientifically rather having people running around self diagnosing gluten senstivity when the symptoms could be coming from very different sources.'
p29280
aS'I would be interested to see reference for the blood test info though.'
p29281
aS'I had not heard that before.'
p29282
aS'I disagree - there was no control group, and all of the subjects experienced increasing digestive symptoms for the duration of the study.'
p29283
aS"That's the reason they couldn't find a link to gluten - because everyone was getting worse the entire time, no matter which phase of the test they were on."
p29284
aS'The only exception was the first of the washout phases when all of the suspected food triggers were removed.'
p29285
aS"After that, the patients' reports of symptoms all increased with seemingly no link to what they were eating."
p29286
aS'Further, the study only selected 32 of the subjects, out of the ~120 who were self-diagnosed and willing to participate.'
p29287
aS'So 3/4 of the subjects were eliminated due to a lack of testing for Celiac or because of genetic markers associated with Celiac.'
p29288
aS"It's a pretty similar number to the proportion of subjects who showed symptoms in Gibson's first study, but we don't know if they would have ever qualified for a diagnosis of Celiac through villous atrophy."
p29289
aS'NCGS may be a sort of "pre-Celiac" condition, and we\'d certainly be better off if we could diagnose Celiacs before they reach a point of imminent starvation.'
p29290
aS"Gibson's third study on psychological symptoms is important too, because it used the exact same subjects from the second study (the 32 who definitely didn't have Celiac markers)."

p29292

aS'The police repression took place as new information emerged about the whitewash of the police murder of Michael Brown.'
p30031
aS'A day after ABC News broadcast an uncritical interview with Wilson, with anchorman George Stephanopoulos allowing the well-coached cop\xe2\x80\x99s claims that he killed Brown in self-defense to go unchallenged, it was revealed that police who arrived on the scene of the August 9 murder immediately began a cover-up.'
p30032
aS'According to transcripts of the grand jury proceedings, Wilson was allowed to keep his gun and wash the blood off his hands before any testing, and only later in the day did he turn in his police pistol as evidence.'
p30033
aS'The policeman who took Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s initial statement at the shooting scene did not take notes or use a recorder, and investigators from the St. Louis Medical Examiner\xe2\x80\x99s Office never took photos or any distance measurements at the scene.'
p30034
aS'The grand jury proceedings were no more legitimate than the \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation\xe2\x80\x9d by the police and medical examiner.'
p30035
aS'According to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, of the more than 162,500 cases presented by US prosecutors from 2009 to 2010, grand juries voted not to return an indictment in only 11\xe2\x80\x94i.e., one in 14,759 cases, or 0.0068 percent.'
p30036
aS'The grand jury in the Michael Brown murder brought back no charges precisely because St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch and the political forces behind him did not want a prosecution.'
p30037
aS'The police have been given a license to kill and unleash military repression against the American people by the entire political establishment, from the Obama administration and the Justice Department, down to the state and local level.'
p30038
aS'Determined to impose deeply unpopular policies of austerity, poverty-level wages and war, the American ruling elite is increasingly resorting to authoritarian methods: militarized police, mass arrests, domestic spying and state-sanctioned murder.'
p30039
aS'The United States regularly denounces regimes for suppressing \xe2\x80\x9ctheir own people\xe2\x80\x9d and violating human rights if these governments happen to come into conflict with US foreign policy.'
p30040
aS'Endless imperialist-backed \xe2\x80\x9ccolor revolutions,\xe2\x80\x9d including in Iran and Ukraine, have employed this method to destabilize and overturn regimes in pursuit of US geopolitical interests.'
p30041
aS'Meanwhile, the capitalist state in the US employs violent repression in an effort to terrorize and suppress social opposition to unprecedented levels of social inequality.\n'
p30042
aS'Ferguson and the Right of Resistance\n\nBarack Obama, the obsequious errand boy for the financial and corporate plutocrats who own the U.S. government, made a pathetic appearance on national television to try to persuade the \xe2\x80\x9cnatives\xe2\x80\x9d to remain peaceful in response to the non-indictment of the Ferguson killer-cop.'
p30043
aS'His inane comments extolling the value of non-violence and the rule of law seemed strangely incongruent with the militaristic rhetoric and policies of his administration over the last few years.'
p30044
aS'Yet, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s positions on law and violence are not as contradictory as they might appear when these positions are resituated within the context of imperial logic and the framework of power.'
p30045
aS'Legitimate violence is always determined by history\xe2\x80\x99s dominant powers and employed as a weapon to maintain and extend that dominance.'
p30046
aS'Over the last five hundred years Europe emerged from the backwaters of history and cultural backwardness to predominance as a result of genocide and land theft in the Americas, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and colonial/capitalist development.'
p30047
aS'The violent establishment of capitalism, racism, and heteropatriarchy enabled the West to impose its definitions of legitimacy, including \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d violence.'
p30048
aS'Thus when Palestinians resist the theft of the their land and the killing of their people by Israeli colonists, their response is defined as illegitimate violence that sparks support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright to defend itself.\xe2\x80\x9d When Africans waged national liberation struggles to free themselves from European colonial domination in places like Kenya, Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa, the West condemned their efforts as illegitimate.'
p30049
aS'Furthermore, because those struggles were determined to be illegitimate colonial powers felt justified to viciously attack those efforts with the support of the U.S. government.'
p30050
aS'And when African Americans organized against police violence and for self-determination and our own definitions of liberation in the 60s, our efforts were deemed illegitimate.'
p30051
aS'We were brutally suppressed with the full range of state terror tactics including beatings.'
p30052
aS'Therefore, we should understand the State\xe2\x80\x99s response to our discontent in the aftermath of the murder of Michael Brown in this context.'
p30053
aS'The heavy-handed use of violence to deny the people the human rights to peacefully assemble and freedom of association is consistent with the historical uses of violence to control and suppress opposition.'
p30054
aS'And the state\xe2\x80\x99s determination that more militant forms of popular resistance are illegitimate helped to shift the attention of the capitalist media to black resistance and away from the issue of impunity for yet another law enforcement official who literally gets away with murder.'
p30055
aS'The focus on the forms of resistance taking place in Ferguson is reflective of a shared, cross-class and racialized world-view that accepts the carefully constructed elite view concerning what constitutes illegitimate resistance.'
p30056
aS'This hegemonic view creates a moral myopia that makes it impossible for many in white America to understand the point of view of the resisters to this non-indictment.'
p30057
aS'This ideological and even cognitive disconnect makes the call for more national conversations on race such a dangerous diversion from the more immediate historic task at hand.'
p30058
aS'The task of the African American resistance movement is not to worry about sitting down with white people infected with the disease of white supremacy, but to build the capacity of black poor and working class folks to resist the intensifying expressions of repressive state power directed at our people.'
p30059
aS'From that base, we can and should talk about building coalitions with other oppressed communities and people who are ready to take on the task of opposing the settler capitalist state at every level.'
p30060
aS'So while the corporate media has been somewhat successful in shifting the focus from the injustice of the non-indictment to the reaction of protestors, the insights provided by brother Malcolm X offer a framework for understanding what must be done.'
p30061
aS'For Malcolm, resistance is not a crime.'
p30062
aS'In fact, the fight for human dignity and human rights is what makes us human.'
p30063
aS'But he argued that there is a price that people must be prepared to pay.'
p30064
aS'According to Malcolm:    \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be allowed around us other humans if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay the price.'
p30065
aS'You should be kept in the cotton patch where you\xe2\x80\x99re not a human being.'
p30066
aS'You\xe2\x80\x99re an animal that belongs in the cotton patch like a horse or a cow, or a chicken or a possum, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to pay the price necessary to be paid for recognition and respect as a human being.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd what was the price?'
p30067
aS'\xe2\x80\x9cThe price is death really.'
p30068
aS'The price to make others respect your human rights is death.'
p30069
aS'You have to be ready to die\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all we want\xe2\x80\x94to be a human being.\xe2\x80\x9d  In our quest for authentic freedom for ourselves and our children who are being spiritually and literally murdered, Malcolm is reminding us that we have to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.'
p30070
aS'This willingness to sacrifice, as inchoate and thinly grounded as the mass resistance was in Ferguson, demonstrated, nevertheless, that many of our young people are still prepared to pay the price for freedom.'
p30071
aS'We should be proud that the spirit of struggle, resistance, and sacrifice is still alive.'
p30072
aS'The experience of Ferguson demonstrated to people around the world that despite the opiate of credit-based false prosperity, illusions of system inclusion and Barack Obama \xe2\x80\x93 African Americans are finally awakening from an almost two decade long sleep and in the process reawakening the spirit of resistance for everyone.'

p30515

p30516
aS"Someone sticking a finger in someone else's ear for a wet-willy is not the same in scope or severity."
p30517
aS'The cop decided to charge him with felonious assault and through a plea deal with the judge he was able to get it reduced to a lesser charge.'
p30518
aS'It is absolutely the cop who decided what to write on the ticket. '
p30519
aS"You can't compare an old lady pinching your cheeks to someone walking up and putting their spit in your ears."
p30520
aS"I can't believe you even said that. "
p30521
aS"Yes you can, pinching someone's cheek and giving someone a wet willy are both meant to be playful."
p30522
aS"If the guy pinched the cop's cheek the cop still would have arrested him, that's the whole point."
p30523
aS'Cop overreacted to something most people brush off.'
p30524
aS'When you say "putting their spit in your ears" you\'re more saying spitting in someone\'s face and that takes it out of context.'

p30526
aS"He licked his finger and stuck it in the guy's ear and twirled it around as a razz. "
p30527
aS"You aren't allowed to do that to anyone."

aS"You'd want to press charges."
p30530
aS"You're literally the stupidest person I've ever encountered "
p30531
aS"In most cases people are just bothered by it if they don't share they in the humor, and in most cases it doesn't lead to felony assault charges."
p30532
aS'Can you imagine if a third grader got a felony assault charge for giving someone a wet willy?'
p30533
aS"That's because it doesn't happen."
p30534
aS"If someone telling you this is the stupidest person you've ever encountered you should probably get out more. "
p30535
aS'Change "pinches my cheek" to "spits at my face" and maybe you\'ve got a valid comparison.'
p30536
aS"It's assault."
p30537
aS"Though to be honest, randomly pinching a cop's cheek would likely get you arrested all the same."
p30538
aS"You just don't do that."
p30539
aS'See, that changes the intent.'
p30540
aS'Pinching a cheek and giving a wet willy have similar intent.'
p30541
aS"Spitting in someone's face and punching them are more similar in intent than giving someone a wet willy. "
p30542
aS"Just because you didn't intend to commit a crime doesn't make it any less a crime."
p30543
aS'Deserving of a lesser punishment, perhaps, but still a crime.'

aS'&gt;Deserving of a lesser punishment, perhaps, but still a crime.'
p30546
aS"Exactly, the dude thankfully didn't get charged with felony assault which is what the cop wanted to hit him with."

p31639
aS'Now you have one officer stabbed to death, and a suspect shot to death, and for what?'

p31641
aS"It's absurd."

p31913
aS"The police say the shooting happened because the officer's life was being threatened."
p31914
aS"Now that we know this guy was a violent criminal (violent from the video of his grabbing the clerk by the throat and throwing him against the shelf), it is very easy to believe the police's story that the guy attacked and threatened the police officer."
p31915
aS'Now, if they can prove with objective evidence that the guy was not actively attacking the police officer when he was shot, then they could convict him of murder.'
p31916

p31922
aS'Now that the autopsy has been released though and it sounds like it shows that Michael was gunned down while surrendering, it will be interesting to see what comes of this.'
p31923
aS"I also don't think that the autopsy by itself disproves the cop's story but it still doesn't make sense to me that even if the cop was struggling with this guy if he was unarmed why was it necessary to shoot him."

p31933
aS'That is an absolutely extraordinary accusation, and one that I find very difficult to believe.'
p31934
aS'I find it much easier to believe that the kid was being violent and attacking the officer, considering he has just finished being violent and robbing a convenience store.'
p31935

aS'Whether it happened in Wal-mart or in your home, those cops should go to jail.'
p32149
aS'If you want to also prosecute the local police department then that is all good with me.'
p32150
aS"If someone called and said an *adult* was and it wasn't in that adults home, I wouldn't too much."
p32151
aS"I don't know why you came up with that other situation, since it is completely different."
p32152
aS'You can wave a gun around all you want in your own home, not in public.'
p32153
aS'A call about an adult is taken more seriously than a kid.'
p32154
aS'Try your sensationalized bullshit somewhere else.'
p32155
aS"And I don't know where you are getting this idea that I think they were competent."
p32156
aS'Personally, in my view of the world, about 75% of people are *completely incompetent* under legitimate stress.'
p32157
aS"It's not the person's fault."
p32158
aS"It is the fault of whoever allows them to be in that situation, especially if they don't prepare them."
p32159
aS'So either cops need better training, or we are going to have a ton of incompetent ones.'
p32160
aS'Unfortunately, good training would probably see opposition by people saying they are being "militarized".'
p32161
aS'And in a sense they would be right.'
p32162
aS'It would also cost a fuckton of money, so good luck with that too.'
p32163
aS'My point was sensational but just to show the irrelevance of someone calling and reporting something that the cops would take immediate and lethal action because of.'
p32164
aS'Again, who gives a shit who called about what?'
p32165
aS'I could call on you.....\n\nMy thought is that we are arguing whether the cops were mistaken, whether they were at fault.'
p32166
aS'I think so.'
p32167
aS'You seemed to say that it was not their fault, that it was their lack of training so you blame the system (that is what you posted).'
p32168
aS'So to be clear, while I also blame the system, I blame the stupid-ass cops who could not see that a man was playing with a non-lethal toy gun, talking on a phone, no harm had occurred or was happening, and they still shot the man fatally.'
p32169
aS'You seem to want to defend the cops involved and blame their instructors.'
p32170
aS"I don't understand that."
p32171
aS'Even you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.'
p32172
aS"It's irrelevant until you are told someone is very dangerous and *you* are the one who has to deal with them."
p32173
aS"Then it's pretty relevant."
p32174
aS'What do you think went down?'
p32175
aS'They walk calmly up to him, say "can you please put that down" and shoot him?'
p32176
aS'Think about it.'
p32177
aS'They ran up, screamed "drop it", he didn\'t and shot him.'
p32178
aS'It probably took 3 seconds.'
p32179
aS"You don't take your time when you think you can die, trust me on that."
p32180
aS'&gt; Even you and I, with no training at all, would not have killed that man.'
p32181
aS'Bull-fucking-shit.'
p32182
aS'You have no idea how you would act, and pretending you do is terrible.'
p32183
aS"You've never had your life threatened, you've never thought your actions in the next 3 seconds would determine the course of your life, your family's lives, many bystander's lives and their families."
p32184
aS'As soon as you think someone is seconds away from killing you and many others, you can have an opinion.'
p32185
aS'Until then you should probably leave it to people with more experience.'
p32186
aS'They probably thought they would be able to easily distinguish a threat and act accordingly as well.'
p32187
aS'And they had as much reason to believe that as you do now.'
p32188
aS'How does that make you feel?'
p32189
aS'Confident?'
p32190
aS'Less so?'
p32191
aS'You keep saying "if they think the situation is life-threatening" but it wasn\'t.'
p32192
aS"It wasn't even close."
p32193
aS'It would not even seem so to any reasonable person.'
p32194
aS'This is where we disagree.'
p32195
aS'Again, if I called the cops and said that you, a man in a park, was brandishing a weapon, would you think it justified if the cops came and gunned you down like an animal?'
p32196
aS'And again, it makes no sense to defend these cops.'
p32197
aS'They were wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.'
p32198
aS'Just admit it.'
p32199
aS'Say "the police fucked up.'
p32200
aS'" That is all I want and my request is reasonable.'
p32201
aS'But you keep defending them.'
p32202
aS'You ever hear the phrase "hindsight is 20-20"?'
p32203
aS"It doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what you *think* they are."
p32204
aS'&gt; Just admit it.'
p32205
aS'Say "the police fucked up.'
p32206
aS'"\n\nI think if you back up a couple comments you will find just where I said that.'
p32207
aS"But I'm guessing you probably didn't read all of what I've said."
p32208
aS'That would probably be why you brought up that "not life threatening" point again when I already explained that.'
p32209
aS"If that hypothetical guy in your story didn't drop the weapon, and it wasn't clearly fake, yes they would be justified in shooting him."
p32210
aS'Adding the "like an animal" thing is more sensationalist bullshit just to stir people up.'
p32211
aS"Please don't spread that and stick to clear facts."
p32212
aS"You're beginning to sound like a major news network."
p32213
aS'You can be wrong but not totally liable for it.'
p32214
aS'Recently a plane had to make a landing on a beach near me and killed a father and little girl.'
p32215
aS"He was wrong but I don't blame him."
p32216
aS"A court might and I'll have to respect whatever they say(since they would know more of the facts), but until then I'm not going to let hate fly."
p32217
aS"It's pretty nice being moderate in life until you know all the facts."
p32218
aS'You should try it out.'
p32219
aS"It's calming."
p32220
aS'You are the one who seems to be stretching the bounds of reason.'
p32221
aS'Think about the situation.'
p32222
aS'A man called and reported possible trouble, 10 minutes later the cops arrive, they see that no-one is hurt, a man is talking on his cell-phone not shooting people.'
p32223
aS'Think about that for a minute and then tell me where the police were justified in shooting him.'
p32224
aS"Again I ask you to put yourself in the victim's place."
p32225
aS'Who gives a shit who called on whom?'
p32226
aS'I could call about the mayor right now - would you think it appropriate for the cops to bust into City Hall and shoot him?'
p32227
aS'If the police were not justified then they are guilty of acting inappropriately and should be punished.'
p32228
aS'They did not "accidentally" shoot him, they had time to assess the situation and without reason shot the man.'
p32229
aS'Hindsight, foresight, clear sight - it is all the same.'
p32230
aS'Where are you getting your insight into what happened?'
p32231
aS"You seem to know pretty well, but that article wasn't exactly long and detailed."
p32232
aS"If the mayor was waving around what people thought was a gun and someone called it in, then the police arrive and he doesn't put it down I would hope they wouldn't let the fact that he is the mayor stop them from doing what they think they should."
p32233
aS"Why aren't you mad at the person who called it in?"
p32234
aS"If someone tells me I might be shot I'm going to take their word for it and act with caution."
p32235
aS'I think that the marine who called it in is a moron and should have known better but also think that he was justified in reporting what he thought was a criminal and dangerous situation.'
p32236
aS'I do not think that the police were justified in shooting the man because of that call or by anything that the man could possibly have done.'
p32237
aS'You tell me if you think otherwise.'
p32238
aS'What could this victim possibly have been doing, what could have the cops seen, what scenario was unfolding, that would justify shooting him?'
p32239
aS'Again, there had to be at least a few minutes between the call and the arrival of the cops.'
p32240
aS'They saw no bullets fired, no blood, no screaming people...... just a guy with a (pellet-)gun talking on a cell-phone.'
p32241
aS'Should the cops have arrived because of the call?'
p32242
aS'Sure.'
p32243
aS'Acted cautiously?'
p32244
aS'Of course!'
p32245
aS'Shot the man?'
p32246
aS'NO!'
p32247
aS"You're problem is that they acted irrationally?"
p32248
aS'Great.'
p32249
aS'Now go put your life in perceived risk and see if you act rationally.'
p32250
aS'What could he have been doing?'
p32251
aS"Well, I'm assuming standing there holding what looked like a gun and not dropping it when told."
p32252
aS"There isn't much you can do between the time someone aims and they fire."
p32253
aS"It doesn't matter what they saw, it matters what they perceived, and they perceived a threat according to the official story."
p32254
aS'You want to know the thought process of someone who expects to be shot?'
p32255
aS"Here it is, it's pretty simple."
p32256
aS'"Oh shit, looks like gun!'
p32257
aS'" *pull trigger*.'
p32258
aS'No thinking involved.'
p32259
aS"Even people trained for combat don't think in the moment."
p32260
aS'You act on instinct.'
p32261
aS"Thinking comes later, you don't have time for that now."
p32262
aS"You know another reason why I'm not judging harshly?"
p32263
aS"Because I know I don't know the facts."
p32264
aS'What time did this occur?'
p32265
aS'Was the store crowded?'
p32266
aS'Was is business as usual?'
p32267
aS"I'd like to think it wasn't crowded at the time."
p32268
aS'Most cases of "guy with gun" don\'t involve blood and casings everywhere, actually.'
p32269
aS'People run and people suck at shooting.'
p32270
aS'If I was arriving I would think that, unless it was crowded, people ran away and stayed away and the guy was hold up inside.'
p32271
aS'Did the guy who called tell the employees?'
p32272
aS'Did he tell other people?'
p32273
aS'Did people leave while completely avoiding the victim thinking there was a problem?'
p32274
aS'I would.'
p32275
aS'And what makes you think nobody else thought there was a problem?'
p32276
aS"If these guys walked in and there were dozens of shoppers going about their business that's one thing."
p32277
aS'But I have no reason to believe that is true any more than I have reason to believe the alternative.'
p32278
aS'And you keep bringing up the cell phone like it makes him look less threatening or something.'
p32279
aS'Why?'
p32280
aS'If they shot him after seeing all the evidence you are assuming was there, they did it because they wanted to kill someone.'
p32281
aS'Nobody is as dumb as you are thinking these guys are.'
p32282
aS'They either acted out of fear or malice.'
p32283
aS"And you shouldn't punish someone acting out of fear and you can't determine malice without an investigation in this country."
p32284
aS"You could get these guys for manslaughter, now that I think of it, but I'm not on the jury so it doesn't matter what I think."
p32285
aS'Many minutes in between report and police arrival.'
p32286
aS'Store was not in chaos, no blood or screaming.'
p32287
aS'If the man had a cellphone then only one hand was holding a rifle.'
p32288
aS'I agree that the cops acted out of fear - that was wrong.'
p32289
aS'I stand by my assertion that the cops made a mistake and are guilty of manslaughter.'
p32290
aS'Where are you getting that information?'
p32291
aS'And in what world can you not operate a rifle with one hand?'
p32292
