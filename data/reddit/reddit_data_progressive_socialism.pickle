aS"[r/socialism](http://http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism) holds the answer to [u/william_1995's](http://www.reddit.com/user/william_1995) social problems."
p66
aS'Social integration is fundamental to a Socialist state and dissolution of secondary groupings is a prerequisite.'
p67
aS'*One nation, one identity!'
p68
aS"* [Economic Socialization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_%28economics%29) combined with [Gordon Allport's Contact Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hypothesis) will help you become popular."
p69
aS"You will observe that certain group members (let us refer to them as 'Capitalists') are part of several [secondary groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_groups) of relatively small sizes, simultaneously, for example- multiple study groups (henceforth referred to as 'cottage industries')."
p70
aS"These members are considered 'popular'."
p71
aS"Popularity of Capitalists (henceforth referred to as 'means of production') is therefore a result of having minor control in several cottage industries simultaneously even if individual stake in each cottage industry is equal to the stake of any other single member of that cottage industry (these members will henceforth referred to as 'Proletariat')."
p72
aS"Capitalists therefore have the tools to aggregate multiple cottage industries into a single, larger group (henceforth referred to as 'large-scale industry') and eventually we see certain cottage industries die out while others combine into monopolistic large-scale industries."
p73
aS'The Proletarian nightmare now is exclusion from all large-scale industry whereas the Capitalist enjoys a position of disproportionate power wherein s/he can exercise control over the functioning of each constituent cottage industry by assuming the nodal position between two or more separate cottage industries.'
p74
aS'Capitalists have scope for further growth by contact with other Capitalists but the Proletariat can only choose between being a mere part of a large-scale industry.'
p75
aS'[*Economic Socialization in Marxist Theory*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_%28economics%29#In_Marxist_theory) suggests that Capitalists turn obsolete once degree of degree of socialization of production and centralization of capital advances further.'
p76
aS'&gt;Socialization of the workplace is contrasted to rigid hierarchy and bureaucracy; as workers gain more autonomy, they gain more collective decision-making power and control over the output they produce in a socialized work environment.'
p77
aS'The Proletariat assumes greater degree of control but remain weaker than the Capitalist who has already proceeded to integrate multiple large-scale industries.'
p78
aS'Therefore we can conclude that in the primary stages where group sizes are small, assuming position of the Capitalist is most beneficial to you.'
p79
aS'If members in *your* secondary group are hesitant to go meet others, you have the advantage of having a primary identity as member of that secondary group when approaching other groups.'
p80
aS'Go meet others groups.'
p81
aS'It is important that you are perceived as a representative of your secondary group at this point instead of as an individual.'
p82
aS"This gives you the benefit of having certain background information available about who you are while adjudging you as someone who is different from the rest of *his* group because you have first-mover's advantage."
p83
aS'Contact Hypothesis suggests that if you successfully integrate into this new group, you will play the most crucial group in integrating the first group with the second because members of both groups will perceive you as the normal representative of the other while knowing that there is no reason to suspect any inter-group hostility- a signal that such an alliance is acceptable.'

Robert Oppenheimer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer), the American scientist who had headed the [Manhattan Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) that developed the [atomic bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bomb) for the United States during [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).'
p91
aS"The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's [top secret security clearance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance#Top_Secret) being revoked."
p92
aS"&gt;The hearing was a product of longstanding doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty, and suspicions that he was a member of the Communist Party and might even have spied for the Soviet Union."
p93
aS'The concerns about him were exacerbated by personal conflicts between Oppenheimer and others in the atomic community, including [Lewis Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Strauss), chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, and [Edward Teller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller), with whom he had clashed over the development of the hydrogen bomb.'
p94
aS'&gt;Proceedings were initiated in 1954, since Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily give up his security clearance and was still working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire at the end of June.'
p95
aS"A number of Oppenheimer's colleagues testified at the hearings, and as a result of the 2 to 1 decision of the hearings' three judges, Oppenheimer was stripped of his security clearance shortly before his consultant contract was due to expire."
p96
aS'The panel found that Oppenheimer was unusually discreet with atomic secrets, but that he was a "security risk.'

p565
aS"I can't stand the notion that we have to stop saying some things -- *especially* when those notions are so often based either on a misplaced grasp of the real problem ('bad words' vs. *mean-spirited people* or cultural ignorance) or a wholesale misunderstanding of language itself."
p566
aS"For example, there was a movement starting in the late '60s and extending pretty much up to now to replace the suffix *-man* with *-woman* on many words such as 'mailman'."
p567
aS"What most English speakers don't know is that this suffix, though identical in sound and spelling (a *homograph*), is *not the same word* as English 'man' (adult male human)."
p568
aS"It's in fact a Germanic suffix that *predates* English, and it's *non-gendered*."
p569
aS'It means "one who does (or handles or deals with), person responsible for [the attached foregoing base word]".'
p570
aS"A 'policeman' is therefore linguistically not 'a man who polices' but *anyone* who polices."
p571

p572
aS"A 'chairman' is one who chairs (runs a meeting or group)."
p573
aS'And so on.'

aS"English 'man' is in fact derived from a *different* Germanic word, *Mann,* which means the same thing."
p575
aS'(But is different from German *Mensch,* which has a broader meaning is not necessarily male.'
p576
aS")\n\nOr I consider D.C. mayoral aide David Howard, who in 1999 *lost his job* because he (correctly) used the word 'niggardly' (miserly, stingy), but most people around him didn't know that though similar, the word has no etymological relationship to 'nigger'."
p577
aS"Or consider the Americans who get their panties in a twist over Brits (correctly) using the very common slang term 'fag' for cigarette (due to its similarity to a twig)."
p578
aS'That most Americans would use the word differently does not make those British speakers wrong, merely the victim of popular ignorance.'
p579
aS"And I have argued for several years now that 'gay' when used to describe something as silly or campy (including, yes, a person) is a *different word* from 'gay' meaning 'homosexual'."

aS'I have argued that they do share a related (though not entirely shared) origin, but their modern conflation with each other is rooted in ignorance.'
p582
aS"Even putting all that aside, policing language doesn't solve the real problems, and in fact may make them worse."
p583
aS"Because now you've taken a word from the free cultural market and tried to restrict its use."
p584
aS'That makes the word more valuable and powerful, and it can then be used to incur *greater* injury than before.'
p585
aS'One may liken this to the interdiction of drugs: Though some interdiction is necessary in the public interest, wholesale bans result in higher prices, more crime, greater violence, and costly diversion of resources that almost certainly have more worthwhile use.'
p586
aS'GLAAD\'s misguided and undoubtedly costly campaign against the popular expression, "That\'s so gay" is first of all probably hopeless, second of all diverts resources that are probably better spent on things like supporting GSAs, and third of all add power to a phrase that most people up to now mostly ignored or shrugged off, and is *rarely* used with the intention of denigrating gays.'
p587
aS'(And is very ineffective even when it is: It\'s like a little kid yelling "Poop!'
p588
aS'") It astounds me that anyone wasted one stupid dollar on this, never mind the tens of thousands that campaign has to have cost.'
p589
aS'How many GSAs could have made better use of that money?'
p590
aS"What was true at the start of the PC revolution in the '80s is just as true today: You can't control language, and you can't control people by trying to control language."
p591
aS"Even with all good intentions, it's misguided and ultimately fruitless."
p592
aS'The most you can hope to accomplish is *distorting* both language and culture, possibly without ever coming to deal with the real problems you were hoping to.'
p593
aS'What we should be doing instead is encouraging discussion, asking open-ended questions such as, "What does this really mean?'
p594
aS'What is its literal meaning and historical path to the present?'
p595
aS'What do people really mean when they say it -- what do they hope to convey?'
p596
aS'" And so on.'
p597
aS"But acting like words by themselves are the problem won't solve anything.\n"
p598
aS"I don't necessarily disagree with you."
p599
aS'However I am not a trans*person, and literally all of the trans*people I know view "tranny" as a hateful slur.'
p600
aS'Out of respect for them, I won\'t use it, the same way I don\'t use the words "fag" or "nigger".'
p601
aS'If marginalized populations want to "take back" a word they\'re welcome to, but the words are not mine to take back.'
p602
aS"You're welcome to take back the word as well, but don't pretend that just because you personally don't think it should be offensive that means most people don't find it to be offensive... You're obviously intelligent, you know most people do."
p603
aS"Additionally, I think it's disingenuous to argue that certain words *technically* don't mean what people think they do."
p604
aS'Just because the suffix "men" in certain circumstances isn\'t gendered doesn\'t mean that the vast majority of people don\'t see it as gendered.'
p605
aS"At that point I'd argue the meaning of the suffix has changed, as word meanings do throughout the centuries."
p606
aS'Whether or not this represents a substantial loss to the language is another matter entirely, but the fact remains that if the majority of people believe "peruse" means to skim over something, but you use it to mean its original definition (literally the exact opposite), you will be misunderstood.'
p607
aS"You won't be able to communicate your meaning clearly, which to me defeats the purpose of precision of language. "
p608
aS'This is a useless argument.'
p609
aS"You've already decided what's true, and you're not going to accept that your view isn't the only valid one."
p610
aS"Your example of 'peruse' is good evidence that you're ready to reach for anything that you feel may bolster your *feelings* about all this, rather than what might be true but you would prefer isn't."
p611
aS"That's very natural and understandable."
p612
aS"But reality is not made of wishes and dreams; it's made from sometimes hard truths."
p613
aS'And the person who can face that will understand that words are not the enemy.\n'
p614
aS'Oh, were we arguing?'
p615
aS'I thought we were having an interesting and respectful discussion about the nature of language and the use of slurs.'
p616
aS'My mistake. '
p617
aS"It's a slur against an oppressed group."
p618
aS"Don't use it."
p619
aS"Isn't tranny eseentially transvestite soooo I'm confused"
p620
aS"I think it's a slur only if you *mean* for it to be."
p621
aS'Words by themselves are inert.'
p622
aS"Like other tools, their moral and ethical meaning is based on their use, and we shouldn't be too quick to condemn hammers only because people have been killed by them."
p623
aS"If someone means to be disrespectful by use of 'tranny,' then yeah, fuck them, I agree."
p624
aS'And I also agree that *non*-disrespectful use is not going to be common, at least not right now.'
p625
aS'But I want to be careful about condemning words themselves.'
p626
aS'They exist and are part of our culture, and we should treasure even the offensive ones.'
p627
aS'By setting some beyond the pale, we imbue them with individual meaning and impact that they would not have otherwise.'
p628
aS"Do you seriously not understand what you're doing?"
p629
aS'She was using the term to refer to herself - there was no malice nor disrespect intended or implied until you declared the word itself a symbol of bigotry.'
p630
aS'Do black people who say nigger hate black people?'
p631
aS'Do I really have to answer that?'
p632
aS"People like you just aren't happy unless they're being persecuted."
p633
aS"If you weren't so insecure you would understand that things are not as black and white as you make them out to be and that you are creating bigotry rather than righteously quashing it."
p634
aS"And you're a fucking bigot."
p635
aS'Are words like retarded and nigger also not slurs?'
p636
aS'Do you understand that there is a historical context behind the usage of these words, and that these words are still used to oppress today?'
p637
aS'Or are you just completely ignorant?'
p638
aS'Jew boy is incredibly offensive to me you intolerant anti semite.'

aS"Please delete this account or I'm contacting the mods."
p640
aS"There's a reason why he's known as just a comedian."
p641
aS"Confirming the other responses, it's a slur against trans* people."
p642
aS'Maybe.'
p643
aS'Slander is a product of intent, not discrete action.'
p644
aS"I've had this argument many times with people."
p645
aS"I definitely don't presume that a young person who calls a garment 'gay' has any discriminatory intent towards gay *people*."
p646
aS'Especially if that shirt *is* gay.\n'
p647
aS'Maybe true.'
p648
aS"Doesn't help the fact that it perpetuates homophobia."
p649
aS'Your statement contradicts itself.'
p650
aS"Like I said, I've had this argument many times before, and you're unlikely to offer anything I haven't heard before."
p651
aS'Either intent is the key or it is not.'
p652
aS"You can't have it both ways."
p653
aS'If I\'m right ("Maybe true"), then it does *not* perpetuate homophobia.'
p654
aS"That's simple logic."
p655
aS'The essential fallacy here is focusing on discrete tools and actions instead of discernible intent from context.'
p656
aS'The very dramatic way of illustrating this is that I might have many reasons for killing a man, ranging from patently evil to totally necessary.'
p657
aS'If you focus on the action to the exclusion of its context, you ignore or overlook the intent, and blanket assertions conflating the two will very often result in irrational conclusions.\n'
p658
aS'It matters who is using a term just as much as their intent.'
p659
aS"You can mean to say that someone is an 'awesome dude and good friend' all you want, but if you're a white guy using 'my n#####' to do that...you are not solely communicating the idea of 'n#####-as in awesome dude and good friend' but you're also communicating your privilidge and lack of respect towards an oppressed group."
p660
aS'As intent cannot exist without the person, your remark is obvious, needless, and pointless.'
p661
aS'This is a completely worthless obfuscation on your part.\n'
p662
aS'Calling something "gay" as a way of expressing dislike perpetuates homophobia.'
p663
aS'Now if you use it another way I\'d be really interested in what makes something "gay", because last I checked gay people aren\'t a homogenic group and if you base your definition off of a stereotype, well, that\'s pretty homophobic too.'
p664
aS"You're an idiot."
p665
aS"Well that's an appropriate response :/"
p666
aS'Experience has taught me that some people are not worth my time.\n'

p681
aS"But in all LGBT-friendly spaces I visit on- and offline it's considered offensive."

p683
aS"It's settled then: Budweiser is vastly superior to Sam Adams."
p684
aS'Popularity does not equal truth.'
p685
aS'Or as someone else once said, sometimes a majority simply means that all the fools are on one side.'
p686
aS'Were Confederate states right about slavery because they broadly agreed about it?'

p995
aS'In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default [constructor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming\\)) of the class ([subroutine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) that creates objects), and as the [type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) of objects generated by the type, and these distinct concepts are easily conflated.'
p996
aS'&gt;When an object is created by a constructor of the class, the resulting object is called an *[instance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science\\))* of the class, and the member variables specific to the object are called [instance variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_variable), to contrast with the [class variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_variable) shared across the class.'
p997
aS'&gt;In some languages, classes are only a compile-time feature (new classes cannot be declared at runtime), while in other languages classes are [first-class citizens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen), and are generally themselves objects (typically of type Class or similar).'

aS'In other words, it seems that He immediately practiced sharing and mutual aid right after scorning others for practicing trading and exchanging.'

p1376
aS"You're conveniently ignoring these parts:\n\n&gt;  **in the temple**\n\n&gt; **My house shall be called the house of prayer**\n\nFrom which it's quite clear he's referring to church members exploiting their positions of power."

p1383
aS'What did He equate "buying and selling" to?'
p1384

p1385

p1390

p1404
aS'"\n\nI\'m not sure how to make the point in the passage any clearer than this.'
p1405
aS'If you still somehow relate this to "powerstructure " or "a boss forcing her employee to have sex" or something like that, then I don\'t think there\'s really much left I can do to explain the point of the passage to you.'
p1406
aS"&gt;Not when we're talking about approval or disapproval of money in general."
p1407
aS"Lets put it another way, accepting a gift (even if this gift is in the form of money) from someone who's just trying to show appreciation for your help is not the same as demanding someone to give you something in return for help or else you won't help him/her."
p1408
aS'Again, Jesus did much to show that a money economy (I.e.'
p1409
aS'any economy based on trading and exchanging; this includes barter economy) was not necessary to have and should be replaced with an economy that revolves around sharing and mutual aid.'
p1410
aS'Methods of doing so include "He didn\'t charge the wealthy for services after all.'
p1411
aS'" He never even charged the wealthy for the help He provided to them even though He knew that they were more than capable of paying him.'
p1412
aS'He was still focused on promoting the practice of sharing and mutual aid.'
p1413
aS'Also notice how there is no "buying or selling" or "trading or exchanging" being done when Jesus accepts money.'
p1414
aS'Again, in this case, that\'s all the money would be to Him is not a "medium of exchange" (i.e.'
p1415
aS'money), but just simply a gift since no trading or exchanging is being done.'
p1416
aS'So this actually is a case of sharing and mutual aid, where one person provides "money" to Jesus simply out of generosity.'
p1417
aS'Again, there is no actual buying and selling that is occuring.'
p1418
aS'&gt; Let me rephrase what Jesus said so it can be more clearer.'
p1419
aS'Let me rephrase it in a way that\'s consistent with the politics of the era, so that it will be extra more clearer:\n\n"When you can change money only in the temple, the clergy become thieves and the temple, which only the clergy live in, a den of thieves.'
p1420
aS'"\n\nHe didn\'t call money changers in general thieves, only the people who allowed the money changers to work in the temple under the protection of the clergy.'
p1421
aS'Basically, it means the church (i.e.'
p1422
aS'the people effectively in charge of the community) shall not show favoritism to one businessman over another.'

p1453
aS'The party was called "socialist worker\'s party" precisely to split the base of the KPD, not because they were actually interested in socialism.'
p1454
aS'The Nazis only managed things like the Enabling Act and getting into power by preventing the KPD and SPD from even voting, and using the paramilitary wings and youth cults to actively suppress labour organising.'
p1455
aS"I'm not calling you a Nazi (anymore), not that it even matters."
p1456
aS'It\'s pretty clear to me that you are just another generic TRP neoliberal/ancap/"libertarian".'
p1457
aS"I don't have time to spend much more time here but if you examine the late 1920s and early 1930s in Germany and compare the conditions with the kind of ideology you seem to espouse you'll find that there is plenty of common ground, a lot of which acted as a platform for Nazi organising."

aS'The thing you should understand about the Nazis under Hitler is that they were first and foremost politicians.'
p1459
aS'They tailored their ideology to acquire power.'

aS'Fascism arose as a sort of playing all sides against one another political game.'
p1461
aS"Germany, being in the grips of their devastating post WWI depression and hyperinflation, was ripe for any group who could seem powerful enough to solve the country's problems."
p1462

aS'To say that these standards were enacted *before regulation* is not anything like the same thing as saying that they were enacted *before unions*.'

p3014
aS'Economics is not dealing with a simple system, and you are correct that economics has shown it to be a function of supply and demand, but it is not ONLY a function of that - there are many other factors that economics chooses to ignore because economists prefer to legitimise their science than debase it.'

p3762
aS'also you are calling someone creating a good product and starting a business an asshole (ironic) which is stupid, but whats stupider is you think creating a good product and starting a business is an anathema to socialism.'
p3763
aS'the red scare at work. '
p3764
aS'what i meant is that in countries were the government is large and controls allot through the use of force, people use it for their own gain.'
p3765
aS'places where there is little government, no one can use force to control allot of people. '
p3766
aS"No one explained this to you a few days ago but I'll give a proper explaination:\n\nWhen Socialists talk about Capitalism we don't refer to the market system which is the mode in which goods and services are alloted, rather Capitalism is a mode of production, that is the way in which goods are services are made."
p3767
aS'Specifically Capitalism is the mode of production in which those who own property direct production, if you own the chair making factory you decide how they are made, you decide how many are to be made, in what manner and form, how the employees are to be organized, how they are to work, and most importantly how the profits are to be spent.'
p3768
aS'You own the factory, its your choice and thats that.'
p3769
aS'Of course we must also divide the concept of a Capitalist from the concept of an Entrepreneur and a Manager.'
p3770
aS'That is a Capitalist is simply who owns the business, though it is not uncommon for them to directly manage it in the vast majority of cases there is an employee designated as the manager who makes the decisions for him, it is often the case in large business that a huge amount of Capitalists share ownership of a company while each owning a huge owning shares in a huge ammount of other companies, in the vast majority of cases they did not select these firms themselves but rather had an investment firm do it for them.'
p3771
aS'Entrepreneurs while often ending up owning a share in a firm they form are not synonymous with Capitalists, you can clearly be a Capitalist without forming a firm by buying one and you can be an Entrepreneur without actually owning a firm you form for instance by promising a Capitalist full share in a firm in exchange for investment and taking him as a manager.'
p3772
aS'So though these things may overlap they are not the same concepts just as a door is not the same thing as wood though you may have wooden doors you can obviously have doors made of steel and wood made into tables.'
p3773
aS'Marx seen these relations of production, that is how the Capitalist and workers relate to how goods and services, as constituting Classes, he recognized the Capitalists often share common interests against the interests of the workers.'
p3774
aS'The problem is the workers obviously outnumber the Capitalists and the Capitalists rely on the workers to create profit.'
p3775
aS'The fundemental issue arises then when we look at why the Capitalist exists when they contribute nothing to the productive process, they did not build the factory or machines, they did not put together the products or deliver them, they did not organize the workers and yet every single cent of the net profit goes to their pocket.'
p3776
aS"The workers will eventually begin to see this and question why they put up with this, they will ask why can't we just run things by ourselves, we can democratically decide how our own work day goes, how the products should be made and how the profits are spent and if thats not efficient for the work we do we can simply vote our own manager."
p3777
aS'This is what Socialism is purely, it does not nessitate any sort of Government interferance as it has incorrectly been made to be thought of.'
p3778
aS'This is a threat to existence of the Capitalists as a class and so they recognize they must work together to prevent this from happening, fortunately for them the state through the use of force protects their ownership of the property that make production possible, the land, the resources and the machines and buildings or in other words the means of production.'
p3779
aS'The problem is the workers became too educated over time to perform more complex jobs and so demanded the state should be run democratically, this is a problem to Capitalists as their small numbers were set to gain no representation against the workers who composed the vast majority of the population.'
p3780
aS'However while the workers have numbers the Capitalists have power, they own the press, they own the schools, they own the media and own the businesses.'
p3781
aS'For their continued existence they must ensure their ideology is the dominant one in society.'
p3782
aS"And so they set to work to both insure the people believed their place was necessary and good and they insured that the politicians would represent their interests, helping into power those who do and crippling the chances of those who don't through publicity, bribes and threats."
p3783
aS'The State therefore becomes an appendage of the few, when Marx talks about history as Class conflict he means the struggle between the interests of the ruling class between the interests of the working class.'
p3784
aS'\nThanks for your explanation, here are my thoughts on the idea.'
p3785
aS'&gt;Specifically Capitalism is the mode of production in which those who own property direct production, if you own the chair making factory you decide how they are made, you decide how many are to be made, in what manner and form, how the employees are to be organized, how they are to work, and most importantly how the profits are to be spent.'
p3786
aS'Not always 100% corrects.'
p3787
aS'There are many variables to how you run a place that makes it not always your will what happens, EG, subsidiaries, in corporations the managers dont own anything, not even warren buffet owns what he buys, its his companies property, not his.'
p3788
aS'&gt;it is often the case in large business that a huge amount of Capitalists share ownership of a company while each owning a huge owning shares in a huge ammount of other companies, in the vast majority of cases they did not select these firms themselves but rather had an investment firm do it for them.'
p3789
aS'yes I agree, \n\n\nThe problem is the workers obviously outnumber the Capitalists and the Capitalists rely on the workers to create profit.'
p3790
aS"Don't forget that the stock holders rely on the managers to make a profit too."
p3791
aS'&gt;The fundemental issue arises then when we look at why the Capitalist exists when they contribute nothing to the productive process, they did not build the factory or machines, they did not put together the products or deliver them, they did not organize the workers and yet every single cent of the net profit goes to their pocket.'
p3792
aS'Of course they contribute, they run the business, they either started it, or they are entrusted to run it.'
p3793
aS"Just because they dont physically run the machines or trucks dones not mean they dont contribute, My personal friend is a manager of a company he started in the 50's."
p3794
aS'his net worth is 180million pounds, he works about 9-13 hours every day and rarely has a day off.'
p3795
aS"also, they dont get the majority of the profit, most CEO's earn a few million, and most of their money comes from the stock market, which takes nothing away from the workers."
p3796
aS"&gt;The workers will eventually begin to see this and question why they put up with this, they will ask why can't we just run things by ourselves, we can democratically decide how our own work day goes, how the products should be made and how the profits are spent and if thats not efficient for the work we do we can simply vote our own manager."
p3797
aS'you mean they dont notice how the CEO or manager sets up new trade deals, is planning the expansion, seeing how to make it more efficient ect...\nalso, this whole democratically run actory was tried in Russia under Lenin in 1921, it was stopped after a month as production plummeted.'
p3798
aS'&gt;This is a threat to existence of the Capitalists as a class and so they recognize they must work together to prevent this from happening, fortunately for them the state through the use of force protects their ownership of the property that make production possible, the land, the resources and the machines and buildings or in other words the means of production.'
p3799
aS'Anyone who works in a company with a normal intelligence realises the managers contribute allot to the company, and if they are not satisfied they are free to start their own company.'
p3800
aS'no one (other than the practical government) is stopping them.'
p3801
aS'Also, i cannot take Marx seriously when he talks about  workers being used and abused when he fucked his own maid and then threw her out of the house when she was pregnant, essentially a death sentence.'
p3802
aS'Another reason I cant take socialism seriously, is because in theory they want a stateless society where everyone is in a equal utopia, yet always they seem to use the state and turn the country into a hell hole. \n'
p3803
aS'But do you not see here that you are still regarding the role of a firm owner as synonymous with firm operators, even if we are to say they are highly overlapping categories (which statistically by a large margin they are not) they are still self evidently separate categories.'
p3804
aS'Our problem is not that managers exist and that they should be rewarded more than average workers but with the way in which people earn money simply from the ownership of property alone with absolutely no other input necessary.'
p3805
aS"For instance I'm sure your friend works a great deal even far more so than the average person and likewise is especially skilled at what he does but there is nothing in a Socialist system which says he should not be rewarded for that, only that the decision to reward him is done by the democratic agreement of the entire firm rather than those who own it, and he should be rewarded for the work alone rather than simply by the arbitrary declaration of a piece of paper."
p3806
aS'Will the workers decide to pay him less than he is worth?'
p3807
aS'Would they not put him in charge despite it being more efficient for production?'
p3808
aS'No, it would absolutely foolish of them to offer less than a skilled worker is worth, if they do he will move on to some other firm that will offer him more and they will suffer from his loss thus it is necessary through market forces that he should receive the exact value of his labour, the same can not be said of Capital earnings which are not based on supply and demand but rather through State enforced subjective distinctions of property rights.'
p3809
aS'&gt;Our problem is not that managers exist and that they should be rewarded more than average workers but with the way in which people earn money simply from the ownership of property alone with absolutely no other input necessary.'

aS'thank you for your posts.'

aS'remember, if you want you can start a company and do these things if you think they are right, no one is stopping you. '
p3816
aS'Indeed there are such businesses structured like this operating today known as Co-operatives, the issue though is that we live in a society in which vast inequalities have already been produced and many certain industries are controlled totally by Oligarchies of Capitalist firms Oil being a perfect example, I and others might not like the way in which the current choice of Oil Corporations are operated and am technically "free" to set up my own oil firm but the truth is the market is already water tight, it would be practically impossible to compete as an upstart without billions and billions of dollars to start up.'
p3817
aS"These Oligarchic industries then have massive implications for the rest of the economic world, if I had a Co-operative car company we would have to work closely with the Oil industry only to find the owners of the Oil Corporations are also the same owners of the Capitalist run Car Corporations, my Co-operative Computer manufacturing firm has to rely on Capitalist owned Silicon mines who also own Intel, there's a vast network of ownership within the Capitalist class who have little to gain from my success but everything to gain from my competitors and though there are anti-collusion laws in place it still goes on quite easily."

p4346
aS'Most nordic social democrats, at least in Sweden, defined themselves as democratic socialists all until the neoliberalism spread, some more enthusiastically than others.'
p4347
aS'For instance, in Sweden the social democrats together with the central trade federation created the [employee funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_funds).'
p4348
aS'The funds was a reformist attempt to "buy out" capitalists of their control over the means of production.'
p4349
aS"I think that what I am trying to say is that democratic socialism has meaning and value to it, and it's far to easy and simplistic to dismiss Sen. Sanders by saying that he cannot be a democratic socialist because he admires the Nordic states."

aS'If you (an impersonal "you") think that someone like him is the best shot that working class Americans have at some legitimate form of progress, I can respect that; as long as you don\'t talk about Sanders in terms of socialism or socialist policies, because then the debate goes sideways and we all start becoming "least worst" liberals.'

aS'90% of the time, when someone is called a social democrat, they mean the permanent welfare state you talked about.'
p4657

aS"He wants to start programs assisting workers who want to build cooperatives, which is cool, but that doesn't touch the vast majority of the working class in this country."

aS"I didn't mean to insist whether or not market socialism is valid, I'm just saying that measures to assist workers in building cooperatives is an ocean away from the abolition of private property."
p4677
aS"I don't doubt that Bernie would like to see more worker cooperatives."

p4682
aS'Is that the non-state socialist strategy? '
p4683
aS"Well, as my flair would suggest I support worker owned cooperatives and other forms of market socialism as a way of structuring business entities, but I certainly wouldn't advocate that is the only useful weapon to use in eroding private property ownership or wealth inequality that arises from it."
p4684
aS"If you also are in favor of other methods of doing so I certainly support you, which is why I hope I'm welcome here, but that isn't my area of focus or expertise."

aS'My problem is that because the system is so large and so difficult to to track that the people on it see it as their primary source, and will continue to use it as such.'
p5204
aS'I am an idealist, I want these people to recognize why this system is in place, and to use this support as a means to further succeed.'
p5205
aS"On the same note, as a realist, I know that this is not likely, but that doesn't mean I am going to abandon hope, that the people will look at the world through my lens (or through the lens of a free thinker, and achiever)."
p5206
aS'The people that are on the welfare system need to shift their way of thinking, they need to change their paradigm.'
p5207
aS'They think a lot like addicts, in the sense that they have grown accustomed to the system that creates a comfort zone.'
p5208
aS'In order to fix the system, we need to adjust the way that we think.'
p5209
aS'We have to stop thinking for them, and they have to think for themselves (this does not apply to all).'
p5210
aS'Unfortunately, this is unlikely, but again I will not give up hope.'
p5211
aS'So what is your basis for your belief that now too many Americans are lazy because of government programs?'
p5212
aS'Is it anything besides nostalgia for the past?'
p5213
aS'Yeah, perhaps nostalgia for the past, but my upbringing as well.'
p5214
aS'To clarify, I think that everyone is lazier.'
p5215
aS"I think you're full of it, but this conversation isn't going to be productive so whatever."
p5216
aS"I have Apsberger's too."
p5217
aS'At least I was diagnosed with it when I was much younger.'
p5218
aS'How did you get SSI for it?'
p5219
aS'Because I have trouble getting jobs because of it, or at least the low-pay service industry jobs.'
p5220
aS"I'm going to college part time for a Psych degree so I can get a decent job that doesn't cause me sensory overload."
p5221
aS"I don't like to be around a lot of people."
p5222
aS"So I'm pretty terrible as a big team player because I tend not to interact."
p5223
aS'I was finally able to land a really good job on a very small, specialized team, and that seems to work really well for me.'
p5224
aS"My teammates think I'm a bit abrupt and direct at times, but I've developed an excellent sense of humor and I smile a lot and that seems to take the edge off."
p5225
aS"I can still get pretty intense if I'm very focused or passionate about a topic though."
p5226
aS"So I'm aware of it."
p5227
aS'What do you want to do with a Psych degree?'
p5228
aS'I also have a psych degree.'
p5229
aS'I thought it was helpful to get a better understanding of how people think and feel about things.'
p5230
aS'I was thinking about going into I/O Psychology actually.'
p5231
aS'I thought it was fascinating.'
p5232
aS"But my family didn't have enough money to go to the college I wanted to."
p5233
aS"I went to my third choice which was ok.\n\nWhat I've learned about myself is that I much prefer jobs that require thinking, a lot of prep work, and planning and organizing, and when I interact with people (such as in a meeting) I have a clear role."
p5234
aS"If I'm leading a meeting, I focus on what I'm supposed to talk about and have an agenda."
p5235
aS"It's most difficult for me when I'm in a meeting and I don't really have a clear purpose for being there."
p5236
aS"I actually have to take notes because I'll fall asleep if I don't."
p5237
aS'Anyway, rambling.'
p5238
aS"Jobs like this are technical writing (which I almost did), programming if you're into that (I was for a bit, you get no love though), I finally landed in Web Project Management."
p5239
aS"I've been in the industry and worked for my dad for 10 years so I know my way around a web site and how it's made."
p5240
aS'What are you in to?'
p5241
aS'I like helping people and the workings of the human brain fascinates me.'
p5242
aS'I ideally would like to help other people on the autism spectrum.'
p5243
aS'I was recently diagnosed with a severe case of congestive heart failure.'
p5244
aS'Not only does this give me a much lower life expectancy than I had before this condition was known, but it also means any serious physical or emotional stress and anything beyond very modest physical exertion puts me at risk of sudden death.'
p5245
aS'I mention it all because I also know firsthand what the disability application process is like.'
p5246
aS"In fact, I'm still in the middle of an appeal for Medicaid, even though I had no income and no significant assets prior to the hospitalization that led to the diagnosis of my CHF (not to mention major surgery to save a lung that had been full of fluid for so long it was on the brink of being a total loss."
p5247
aS')\n\nEven though the state government has bungled my Medicaid application (leaving me to deal with increasingly anxious collections agents handling much overdue bills,) I was one of the lucky ones when it came to disability itself.'
p5248
aS"Bad information from the national Social Security helpline forced me to re-apply two months after diagnosis, but other than being shortchanged 2 month's benefit, I'm on track to actually get paid."
p5249
aS'I painstakingly filled out the epic questionnaire on my own, and my parents were able to provide me with shelter and food while I had no means of my own.'
p5250
aS'As it happened, tests and scans conducted to see if my heart failure was caused by a treatable underlying condition have not answered that question, but they did catch a case of kidney cancer at a very early stage.'
p5251
aS'In a conversation with my evaluator, he seemed downright startled to find I had kidney cancer on top of crippling heart failure.'
p5252
aS'Six months after initial diagnosis, only four months after that second application, I was told last week that my claim had been approved (though I have yet to receive any payment.'
p5253
aS')\n\nThat said, part of the mythology of welfare fraud is a function of previous crackdowns on this non-problem.'
p5254
aS'One quirk of the existing system is that approval comes with a lump sum payment of benefits withheld during the claim evaluation process.'
p5255
aS'For me, as an indigent dependent with a limited work history, that lump sum is no great amount.'
p5256
aS'However, many disability beneficiaries are immediately given enough wealth to disqualify them from further payments.'
p5257
aS'Stories about people on disability immediately making down payments on luxury cars or taking fancy trips are mostly bullshit, but in cases where they are true it is a combination of a hard luck case suddenly having more money than he or she may ever have possessed in the past, and poverty requirements which mean that such funds cannot simply be stashed away to prepare for lean times in the future.'
p5258
aS'I still consider myself one of the lucky ones, because I got a favorable federal disability ruling from the first evaluator on my claim.'
p5259
aS"A patient advocate (hospital employee who facilitates social service applications) I've been working with is also on the case of a man in worse shape than me (same condition, but even more severe, such that he can barely stand on his own) who was recently denied."
p5260
aS'Apparently, the normal way of things is a kabuki process of rejections and appeals.'
p5261
aS'This means that legitimately needy citizens languish with little or no support while relatively healthy individuals still bulldoze through the process if they are sufficiently persistent with the appeals.'
p5262
aS'In the mean time, I still wait for a reversal on my bogus Medicaid ruling.'
p5263
aS"My kidney cancer was successfully treated (though I don't go back for my first follow-up scan to verify a cancer-free abdomen until next month."
p5264
aS')  However, the M.D.'
p5265
aS'who performed that procedure also noted a suspicious spot on my back.'
p5266
aS'I thought by September I would have Medicaid, and he said it was fine to wait that long to get the spot looked at by a dermatologist.'
p5267
aS'Here I sit in mid-October, still sporting the suspicious blemish (and having a history with cancer), yet I do not know how I would have it cut out (barring self-mutilation.'
p5268
aS')  Hopefully, given the favorable federal ruling, the state will soon follow suit and I can start referring my medical debts to Medicaid.'
p5269
aS"In the mean time, as a man under doctor's orders to avoid emotional stress, rare is the day no one piles on with another demand for money I've never actually had."
p5270
aS'More than thirty years ago, Ronald Reagan campaigned on an obvious lie involving the use of food stamps to purchase vodka.'
p5271
aS'Ever since then, it has been the American way to cut back on services to our least fortunate citizens while raising barriers to access.'
p5272
aS'Veterans literally lose their minds and their homes while struggling with untreated battle scars.'
p5273
aS'Our sick and injured also sometimes wind up becoming homeless or deceased because servicing the agenda of fucktarded right-wing political hacks matters more than caring for the most vulnerable of our own citizens.'
p5274
aS'We are literally the worst nation on Earth when it comes to the discrepancy between what we could afford to do and what we actually do when it comes to welfare policy.'
p5275
aS"I do not contend we need to be as compassionate as Germans or as organized as Italians or as charitable as the Swiss, but surely it is long past time to end the of domination moral monsters in discussion on America's social safety net."
p5276
aS'How can we keep claiming to be the greatest nation on Earth if we never even try to act like it?'
p5277
aS"**TL;DR** I'm going through this process too, though I'm lucky enough to be able to lean on my parents for support."
p5278
aS"I've long been a vocal critic of America's inhumane approach to poverty relief, but only recently have I come to understand how decades of conservative political ideas have fucked things up even worse than I imagined."
p5279
aS'But your disability amount is decided on what you have paid into it over the years through working.'
p5280
aS'So how are these always poor people getting huge sums to buy cars?'
p5281
aS'Aside from that, you are lucky to have family.'
p5282
aS'Can you imagine going through all of that alone?'
p5283
aS'With no support system?'
p5284
aS'Yeah that is me. '
p5285
aS'As I understand it, there are a range of factors.'
p5286
aS"However, yeah, because I've spent much of my adult life either with no job or with an annual income under $8,000, my actual benefit is less than $500/month and it will top out at $710/month even if I start paying household expenses or attempt to move out on my own."
p5287
aS'The only silver lining (if you can call it that) is that I (having just received my lump sum today) remain under the poverty threshold despite getting four months of benefit all at once.'
p5288
aS'And yeah, in my case, if I were alone I would have been a beggar just to get medication and food.'
p5289
aS"There is a good chance I wouldn't be here today without my parents' kindness in giving me shelter, feeding me, buying my medications, and even putting gas in my car."
p5290
aS'In addition to the teams of doctors and nurses who saved my life twice over in the hospital, I am eternally grateful to my parents for their support while I adjust to living with a heart that leaves me short of breath if I so much as attempt a brisk walking pace.'
p5291
aS"If it's any consolation to right-wingers out there upset by my freeloading ways, the average life expectancy for people with my condition is under 5 years, and I'll be lucky to get much more than 10 despite being far under the median age for a CHF diagnosis."
p5292
aS'Still, everyone keeps reminding me that a lot can happen with medical science in 10 years, and I am respecting my many new limitations, so I hold out some hope.'
p5293
aS'In any case, I hope your situation resolves as favorably as the system will allow very soon.'
p5294
aS'Fortunately a good portion of SSA workers were considered essential during this shutdown, and if there is any shred of human decency in the House Republican leadership, the overworked bureaucrats who have to deal with this Kafkaesque tangle of hurdles and restrictions will even be liberated from the reduced pay of the sequester relatively soon.'
p5295
aS'**Edit:** Oh, and to actually be responsive, it is important to keep in mind that payroll taxes are different from regular IRS withholdings/payments.'
p5296
aS'Even minimum wage workers or part time employees in the $10,000-$18,000/year range are going to make non-trivial contributions to Social Security and Medicare.'
p5297
aS"America's working poor far outnumber our nation's idle poor."
p5298
aS'While the ultra rich may only support those programs with a small fraction of their annual income, payroll taxes apply in full to millions of workers who qualify for a full refund of income tax withholdings.'
p5299
aS"This is precisely why Mitt Romney's 47% speech was, beyond its scumbaggy tone, also flat wrong on the facts."
p5300
aS'A person eligible for $1,200/month in benefit who spends just one year fighting for the approval of a claim would get $14,400 as a lump sum payment.'
p5301
aS"That isn't enough for a new Cadillac, but it would cover the down payment (or the cost of a used car that right-wing observers could still grumble about as if it were new."
p5302
aS')'
aS'Thank you!'
p5303
aS'I hope so too.'
p5304
aS"A friends wife lost her leg and gets disability and her check hasn't come, so the shutdown has halted that."
p5305
aS'I should find out this month or next month.'
p5306
aS"As far as getting a lump sum, I had no idea since i haven't gotten to that point."
p5307
aS'But if you are disabled, you have to go to a doctor and show a lot of proof of being disabled.'
p5308
aS'They said that some 60% get denied.'
p5309
aS"So if you get it and go through all that and get a lump sum, why would they buy something that isn't going towards bills."
p5310
aS'I mean, if you have a car you need a license and a place to park it unless they are buying a car to live in.'
p5311
aS"I honestly don't care what people do with the money."
p5312
aS"They pay taxes and if they have cancer and going to die and they want to spend their last months travelling using that money, I wouldn't care."
p5313
aS'Yeah the 47% was laughable.'
p5314
aS'Everyone, even conservatives were like...um no that is wrong.'
p5315
aS'I hear stories of people abusing the system, but i have yet to hear how they actually tricked the system.'
p5316
aS"I'm legit sick and I can't even get in the system."
p5317
aS'If i had a kid i would be able to get welfare but that is a problem with the law.'
p5318
aS'They should reward people for NOT having kids and using protection instead of having kids to get a check.'
p5319
aS'When you are hit with being homeless or getting knocked up to get help, I see how people see that as a way to stay living.'
p5320
aS"Sure there are lazy people who don't want to work."
p5321
aS"There are also people who do and can't get jobs."
p5322
aS'The job market is terrible.'
p5323
aS'It is a viscous cycle. '
p5324
aS"As I understand both from conversations with my patient advocate and knowing a couple of people who got SSI based on mood disorder claims that were not evident in social interactions (which isn't to say I know they are fakers, but to allow for the possibility critics might only be 90% wrong rather than totally wrong about welfare) the trick is relentless appeals."
p5325
aS'I was told to expect the need for repeated appeals even in my case backed up by solid medical evidence provided by M.D.s with unimpeachable credentials, but I guess my evaluator was moved by the fact that I was both a CHF patient and a renal cancer patient.'
p5326
aS'However, my point was that people in good health are actually more capable of a sustained campaign against bureaucratic resistance, and apparently the system eventually caves when it looks like an appellant is simply never going to admit defeat.'
p5327
aS'Also, yeah, I hear you on the job market.'
p5328
aS'I spent most of the late 90s in a Web design job with a respectable salary.'
p5329
aS"In theory, given a supportive work environment and a boss tolerant of moderate absenteeism (some days it feels like I never truly wake up, and I'm under doctors' orders to avoid strong stimulants), I could deliver high quality work product."
p5330
aS"However, I'm sitting on a a huge pile of medical debt that can only be paid if Medicaid approves my May application."
p5331
aS"I wouldn't want to stiff the doctors, lab techs, and hospital that repeatedly saved my life just so I could get back into the lower middle class (a real paycheck would make me ineligible for Medicaid, but bankruptcy would be my only other realistic shot at outliving those huge debts."
p5332
aS')  Also, our cutthroat economy means that it is the stuff of fantasy to imagine a work environment where my need to avoid all forms of stress is actually respected by supervisors.  '
p5333
aS"You can't eat healthy on $180 per month?"
p5334
aS'No matter what you might have heard, it is more expensive to eat junk food than it is to purchase meat and vegetables and cook a healthy meal.'
p5335
aS'You might not be able to shop at Whole Foods, but there is no correlation between nutrition and cost when it comes to fresh veggies. '
p5336
aS'Really?'
p5337
aS"I don't shop at whole foods but go ahead an stereotype."
p5338
aS'And it is a lot cheaper to buy double cheeseburgers than apples.'
p5339
aS'Also, rice.'
p5340
aS"It isn't healthy for you."
p5341
aS'It is cheap but not healthy.'
p5342
aS"Also, the food stamps don't cover toilet paper/tampons/soap."
p5343
aS'So, having cancer and being told to eat right is near impossible with $180 a month.'
p5344
aS'Can you give me a grocery list for 1 month of food that costs $180 that is healthy.'
p5345
aS'I have hollowed /r/Frugal and took some advice but mostly it is either starve or eat unhealthy food.'
p5346
aS"You can usually find apples in season for around a buck a pound, that's a lot cheaper than double cheeseburgers - unless you are buying one apple at a time."
p5347
aS"White rice isn't so healthy, but whole grain rice is."
p5348
aS'So are dried beans, and cheap as shit.'
p5349
aS'Once a week go to a supermarket, buy lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, and peppers.'
p5350
aS"You can easily get a week's worth of salad veggies for around $5."
p5351
aS'Potatoes are dirt cheap.'
p5352
aS'You can get a whole pound of ground beef for the cost of your double cheeseburger and then make your own.'
p5353
aS"Just don't buy processed food or snacks and $180 per month is pretty doable for a single person."
p5354
aS"I'm not trying to sound preachy and I am actually a big supporter of public assistance."
p5355
aS'But I think that people who claim that junk food is cheaper than real food are only giving fodder to the right-wingers that are trying to end these programs. '
p5356
aS'You are though.'
p5357
aS'I was using cheeseburgers as an example.'
p5358
aS"You can't use your food stamps card at a restaurant."
p5359
aS'But getting 5 cheeseburgers on the dollar menu is cheaper than buying all the veggies to make a salad.'
p5360
aS"I can't eat carbs per my doctor."
p5361
aS'And ground beef is around $7.'
p5362
aS'Also, you should watch Food, inc.'
p5363
aS'It goes into great detail on why healthy foods cost more and how it is cheaper to eat fast food rather than buy an apple.'
p5364
aS'The only reason the right attacked being healthy is because a black woman told them to.'
p5365
aS'If it were Laura Bush,  it would never have been an issue.'
p5366
aS'Suddenly it became one after people got mad that the first lady wanted people to be healthier which would lower the cost of insurance and medical bills.'
p5367
aS"Anyway,  as someone who has cancer among other things,  and having no access to treat it and prevent it from spreading and\n having your doctor give you a list of food to avoid which you can't afford is something that you know nothing about."
p5368
aS"Until you are here, in my position, be happy you don't have to deal with this."
p5369
aS'My last grocery bill was $76.'

aS'The ability to spend a little bit more (whether its on white goods, services or whatever) usually means you save money, paying in advance for things (like mobile phones, gas, electric etc..) is usually vastly cheaper than paying monthly or buying tokens..'

aS'Part of the reason for the lack of a bullshit detector when it comes to welfare urban legends is that it makes everyone feel a little less guilty when these programs are cut and families go without the basic necessities of life. '

aS'I used to work as a clerk in a grocery store in a fairly run down area with a large concentration of welfare recipients.'

aS"Now, that all said, in my little welfare-area grocery store, I'd routinely see people come in on the day that the checks went out, wearing extravagant quantities of jewelry, towing 3 or 4 shopping carriages full of an almost equal measure of candy, soda, and so on with actual food, and this was back almost 20 years when fresh food items weren't nearly as disproportionately expensive as they are now."
p5487
aS'These folks would come up to my register, pay for their food stamp total with their stamps (which at that time did not include candy, soda, etc), and then pull out a massive roll of bills (like, rap video sized roll of bills) to pay for their soda, candy, a couple cartons of cigarettes... and then roll the whole mess out of the store.'

p5661
aS'Never have been.'
p5662
aS'The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is meant to *alleviate* the effects of poverty, not to keep people on the brink of starvation.'
p5663
aS'Thus people who have jobs, can still get food stamps if their pay is low compared to the number of mouths they have to feed.'
p5664
aS'It is meant to FREE UP other money a family has by subsidizing food costs.'
p5665
aS'Furthermore, we **overproduce food**.'
p5666
aS'This creates a surplus.'
p5667
aS'Food Stamps helps to get rid of this surplus while  subsidizing farmers by allowing them to sell food that would otherwise be wasted.'
p5668
aS'This is why Food Stamps are part of the Farm Bill and are run by the Department of Agriculture.'
p5669
aS'Food Stamps are not only for the destitute, and are actually a part of our industrial food system that subsidizes farmers for making too much food.'

aS'Housing assistance goes to landlords.'
p5675
aS'Even the simple dispensing of benefits is a moneymaker for big banks, particularly J.P. Morgan, who facilitate the electronic payment system.'

aS"So here's an interesting question: where would grocery stores be without food stamps and other welfare programs?"
p5677
aS'Where would Walmart, McDonalds and other minimum wage employers be, without the government to help pick up the tab and make life almost bearable for their workers through Medicaid and other programs that provide what used to be provided by employers?'
p5678
aS'Far from being a hand out to the poor, welfare is in reality a massive taxpayer subsidy to make up for the failures of capitalism.'
p5679

aS'As a compensation the worker is awarded a wage, which is functionally and quantitavely inferior to the value/product created by the worker which is appropriated by the capitalist.'

aS'If I understand correctly, labor credits would be paid to you as remuneration for work done.'
p6327
aS"The only difference seems to be that labor credits can't be traded or used to buy capital goods?"
p6328
aS"I know nothing about labour credits, but I would hazard a guess in assuming that they differ quite fundamentally in the sense that if a labour credit is a measure of time worked, everyone's time becomes equally valued."
p6329
aS'Not so with wages.'
p6330
aS'Again, I know nothing and have read nothing about various ways of implementing labour credits, but, at a glance, it seems rather problematic.'
p6331
aS"Marx's abstraction of labour time necessitates an averaging of concrete labour across society, and so it seems obvious enough that while labour can be equal in an abstract sense, it is not equal in a concrete sense."

aS"I hope labour credits don't treat concrete labour as equal."
p6333
aS'The entire concept of "Labor credits" sounds like an asinine attempt to insist that money can become something entirely different simply by referring to it with a different label.'

p6337
aS"Then say:  \n  \n&gt;The only difference seems to be that labor credits can't be traded or used to buy capital goods?"
p6338
aS"That's an incredibly significant difference, is it not?"

aS"Labor vouchers aren't a form of currency because they cannot circulate and therefore cannot be transformed into capital. \n"
p6340
aS'What are capital goods, and how are they different from regular goods?'
p6341
aS'Capital goods are used for production for exchange and thus their use is realized in the accumulation of capital, this differs from consumer goods which are consumed as they are used. '
p6342
aS"If that's the case, then isn't every commodity a capital good to its producer and seller, yet at the same time a consumer good to its buyer?"
p6343
aS'Sorry I got a little mixed up with replies.'
p6344
aS"I was quoting someone who mentioned capital goods but I replied as capital, then you asked about capital goods so I answered you're question separate from the initial comment."
p6345
aS'Let us clarify because we may have started with a false premise: Capital goods are indeed what I said, a commodity is something produced to be exchanged, Capital is the money used to purchase something(s) in order to ultimately sell it again at a greater exchange value.'
p6346
aS'But to answer your question, no, not all commodities are used to produce for exchange. \n'
p6347
aS"Well now I'm completely confused."
p6348
aS"Seems to me like we're got four different terms here: capital, capital goods, consumer goods, and commodity."
p6349
aS'What do each of them mean exactly, and how do they differ from each other?'
p6350
aS"Also, you said that capital refers to money, but can't any commodity be capital, given the right circumstances?"
p6351
aS'Yeah the confusion comes when mixing different types of economic jargon.'

aS'Classical economics, Marxian economics, and modern or neoclassical economics all use slightly different terminology.'
p6353
aS"I hope you'll understand if I stick to Marxian terms."

p6355
aS'I use money (capital) to purchase means of production (tools, equipment, a factory, raw materials, labor power, etc.'
p6356
aS') to produce a car.'
p6357
aS'I sell this car, making it a commodity, for money (more than what I started with, thus realizing the initial capital investment).'
p6358
aS'Another key distinction in Marxian economics is the concept of use-value and exchange-value.'
p6359
aS'Using the above example the car was of no use-value to me.'
p6360
aS"I don't drive it or get any use out of it, I only care about the profit it generates."
p6361
aS"Therefore I don't produce it for use-value but I produce it for exchange-value, ie to be exchanged."
p6362
aS"&gt;Also, you said that capital refers to money, but can't any commodity be capital, given the right circumstances?"
p6363
aS'At the risk of breaking my pledge to stick with Marxian terms, the answer is yes in modern neoclassical economics but no in Marxian economics (what we Marxists call "Capital" is more specifically called "Finance Capital" in modern economics).'
p6364
aS"To Marxists capital is the money bit (but not all money is capital, if you're hungry you may use money to buy a hamburger but you aren't using capital because you didn't buy it in order to exchange it at a higher price later in order to create more money for yourself, if you did this would be an example of merchant capitalism)."

p6981
aS"I also don't see the requirement for living a model life."
p6982
aS"It's pretty much impossible to not do stupid stuff, especially while young and given the state of society and the media."
p6983
aS'How do you not fall in to the trap of doing misogynistic stuff.'
p6984
aS'My guess is that everybody has done this, but not everybody is so famous that it sticks.'
p6985
aS'The important part is to recognize these mistakes, to recognize your privileges and to make sure you remember them in the future.'
p6986
aS'I do however agree with these parts of the critique: \n&gt;he substance of your critique of the political class is not structural but is aimed at the fact that many of them went to public school.'
p6987
aS'You say nothing that suggests you are a revolutionary in anything other than a Fabian reformist viewpoint.'
p6988
aS'This is just populism.'
p6989
aS'No doubt, that populism sells you books.'
p6990
aS'and \n\n&gt;Your lack of grassroots involvement beyond superficial statements puts you outside this movement.'

aS"Most anarchists I know, weren't born that way, many of them didn't even come to embrace the principles because they were directly oppressed by their boss or living miserable lives."
p6997
aS'They came to the conclusion by having sound principles and empathy, seeing unfairness all around and gradually learning how to apply these principles in various situations (from misogyny to state authority).'

aS'Oh hey look, shitty comments directed towards an anarchist in /r/socialism.'
p7002
aS'How fucking shocking.'
p7003
aS'If my eyes were rolling any harder they would spin my head right off.'
p7004
aS"Based on the guy's post history, he's here because he saw the article on the front page, not because he's a /r/socialism subscriber."

p7008
aS"If anything's ever to change, that change will need a lot of people who are just following their gut feeling."
p7009
aS"And if Brand can turn the general gut feeling a bit more to the left, that's a good thing."
p7010
aS"That's garbage"
p7011
aS"I don't hate Brand at all."
p7012
aS'But I think your comment helped illustrate one of my major criticisms of him.'
p7013
aS'Although he is an international celebrity, presumably with greater means than the average person, he is only acting locally.'
p7014
aS'I mean, he released a book entitled "Revolution" and he hasn\'t been very revolutionary in his work.'
p7015
aS"Publishing a book, having a show which has, at very least, done things in both the US and UK, and appearing on television isn't acting at anything beyond the local level?"
p7016
aS"I'm not the biggest fan of Brand, but I don't understand this concern in particular."
p7017
aS"You have been bombarded with some sort of awareness of his activism, haven't you?"
p7018
aS'Unless you happen to live in his neighborhood, how is that not anything beyond local action?'
p7019
aS'Do you expect him to pick up a rifle or something?'
p7020
aS"&gt;Publishing a book, having a show which has, at very least, done things in both the US and UK, and appearing on television isn't acting at anything beyond the local level?"
p7021
aS"I suppose he did all those things but he didn't necessarily do them with any kind of revolutionary, or even socialist end."
p7022
aS'I said he is an international celebrity, not an international activist.'
p7023
aS'His show, of which I must admit I have only seen clips, if understand it correctly was just a talk show.'
p7024
aS'It had a lot of celebrities on it, he did some skits, some of them were somewhat edgy, but I find it difficult to put that in the activism category.'
p7025
aS'I mean he was an entertainer, and he was well compensated as such.'
p7026
aS'He went on a book promotion tour, but the only time I ever saw him on TV promoting his book, it was not *Revolution*, it was *Booky Wook* 1 or 2.'
p7027
aS'He has done a lot of stuff on TV, radio, in film, etc., but how much of that was dedicated to activism?'
p7028
aS'I know he has only started being an activist in earnest since about 2009, but again, he has a lot of fame, and presumably a bit of fortune, and what is he doing?'
p7029
aS'He does good work and he has helped some people.'
p7030
aS'Maybe he is too naive to know what more he can do.'
p7031
aS"But I don't believe that."
p7032
aS"I think Brand is plenty smart, he's just not doing nearly what his means allow him to."
p7033
aS'Just one example I can think of off the top of my head, so that you don\'t think my saying he could, and perhaps should do more, means that I want him to "pick up a rifle or something".'
p7034
aS'Brand could request to meet with some members of Syriza, travel to Greece and hold some kind of a press conference declaring that he supports Syriza, that his fans should support Syriza, and call on the U.K. government to end austerity, etc.'
p7035
aS"I mean there's a million things more he could do, but the only things I've seen from him doing lately is the Trews, which have kind of fallen off lately, and promoting his book *Revolution* which from what I can tell of the first chapter or two, which he read aloud online, to put it politely, isn't very revolutionary."
p7036
aS'I know that if I had his means, his fame and fortune, I would be doing a lot more.'
p7037
aS"&gt;You have been bombarded with some sort of awareness of his activism, haven't you?"
p7038
aS"Recently, in the last month or so, no, I haven't."
p7039
aS'He did an ok interview about a month back, but I recently unsubbed from the Trews after he published two videos where he talked about rice resonance and 50 Shades of Gray. '
p7040
aS"It's pretty unquestionable that he could perform better in every area even vaguely related his activism."
p7041
aS'The ego and the somewhat shallow nature of the ideas he focuses on limit him.'
p7042
aS"But, at the same time, let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good."
p7043
aS"While he hasn't advanced any revolutionary ideas, and the the conventional ideas he's advanced have not possessed all that much depth, he has nudged many thousands into the door so that they might find that depth for themselves, and I would think that this amounts to activism on a rather broad scale."
p7044
aS"I can't think of anyone else who has gotten the message of class inequality and the viability of alternatives to capitalism out there more effectively in the past 5 years."
p7045
aS"&gt;let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good."
p7046
aS'Agreed.'
p7047
aS'Also, lets not make good the enemy of improvement.'
p7048
aS'&gt; I would think that this amounts to activism on a rather broad scale.'
p7049
aS"I agree, but it's not nearly the most effective kind of activism."
p7050
aS'Again, lets not let good be the enemy of improvement.'
p7051
aS'Criticism serves a vital function.'
p7052
aS"&gt;I can't think of anyone else who has gotten the message of class inequality and the viability of alternatives to capitalism out there more effectively in the past 5 years."
p7053
aS'I can think of a few off the top of my head: Cornell West, Richard Wolff, David Harvey, Amy Goodman, Chris Hedges, Slavoj Zizek and why not just throw in Syriza and Podemos for good measure.'
p7054
aS"Maybe he's been the most effective in Britain, emphasis on maybe, but that's not so much a compliment to him as it is an insult the British Left (I left out the rest of the UK because there was the Scottish independence thing headed by a socialist party)."
p7055
aS"I mean, it's not like he called for a revolution at the VMA's."
p7056
aS'Rather, he called for the audience (perhaps his largest audience ever) to vote for Barack Obama.'
p7057
aS'To me, that is was regression away from *the door*.'
p7058
aS'But to be fair, I believe that was in 2008. '
p7059
aS'I would rather he effect change locally than incite colonialism elsewhere.'
p7060
aS"I would rather he use his means to effect change anywhere he can, and not just anywhere that's convenient."
p7061
aS"But of course, it's up to him."
p7062
aS'I have no idea what you are talking about with him inciting colonialism.'
p7063
aS'His performances??'
p7064
aS'?'
aS'When you criticize him acting locally, I assumed you meant you would rather he expand his actions globally.'
p7065
aS"What he's doing for the council estates in England is fantastic."
p7066
aS"He can't do something like that elsewhere because it's not his home."
p7067
aS"I'm not sure what else you could want from him."
p7068
aS"I wouldn't want some rich bloke from Essex with a naive notion of socialism to try and solve problems in Bangladesh or some other far-flung place. "
p7069
aS'&gt; I assumed you meant you would rather he expand his actions globally.'
p7070
aS'Assuming your meaning of *globally* by the rest of your comment I think you may have made an incorrect assumption.'
p7071
aS'I was referring to the places where he has been, preformed, and where he is well know.'
p7072
aS'The UK being chief among them.'
p7073
aS"I didn't say he should go work internationally (although he already does), just that he is an international celebrity and he could be doing a lot more than he is anywhere, but especially the U.K. or even just London."
p7074
aS"&gt;He can't do something like that elsewhere because it's not his home."
p7075
aS"People don't usually work at home and many well know revolutionaries made their biggest impact in the places where they were not raised and would likely not call home."
p7076
aS"Just to use examples from Brand's Messiah Complex: Malcolm X, Che Guevara and Jesus Christ were all revolutionaries most know for work they did many miles away from their homes."
p7077
aS'Also, some of the most successful revolutionaries and socialists were born into the high classes, including Gandhi.'
p7078
aS"What you're doing is called ethnic or cultural determinism, and it has really viscous implications, not least of which is ethnocentrism."
p7079
aS'Moreover, asserting that because Brand is (currently) rich and (currently) lives in England, where he also grew up, he must therefore automatically be naive about the struggles of poor people in foreign nations is a pretty unenlightened point view.'
p7080
aS"I'm not saying Russel isn't naive, I'm saying the naivete is not determined by his class status and nationality."
p7081
aS'Autonomous working class organisation is inspiring.'

p7106

p7107
aS"All I've seen is that he seems to have taken steps in the right direction, and I'm going to be encouraging of that change rather than discouraging of it because he's not released a statement specifically apologising for it."
p7108
aS"That's just my opinion."
p7109
aS"I didn't say it should all be love and cuddles because he said a nice thing about women, all I said was that just because he did a shitty thing in the past that doesn't mean he's just as shitty today."

aS"I'm sure a lot of women jumped at the chance to sleep with him."

aS'Unless you think all casual sex means both parties see the other as a walking sex toy?'
p7147
aS'I agree with you.'
p7148
aS'Sex addiction is more than being promiscuous or liking sex in the same way that being an alcoholic is different from going out to a bar every day after work.'
p7149
aS"It's used with varying degrees of legitimacy, but the label pretty much is a direct statement saying that you use people for sex, treating them as objects as a result, as well as indicating some further, related, assholish behavior which lead you to dealing with sex addiction as a problem."
p7150
aS"We're not saying that promiscuity is a problem any more than we would be saying that going to bars is a problem if we pointed out that someone was an alcoholic."
p7151
aS"If you're habitually being shitty to people, and it's almost exclusively women that you're being shitty to, then it is hard to distinguish that from misogyny, especially if you have a tendency to use sexist language."

aS'Still, he does at least acknowledge the problem, and puts some effort towards working on it.'

aS"There is evidence that he's actively trying to be less shitty."

p7158
aS'As if the women in question gained nothing in the transaction?'
p7159
aS"Perhaps it is treating women as if they're incapable of having sex with a famous person on their own terms that is the real misogyny here?"
p7160
aS'Absolutely nothing wrong with sexually active women or sexually active men.'
p7161
aS'However, nothing about Brands attitude indicates he was doing anything but treating them as objects to be used, like a sex doll. '

p7193
aS"So someone who does that probably sleeps around as a symptom but sleeping around definitely doesn't mean you're doing so inherently."
p7194

aS'He basically suffers the same problem as Prince Charles does, who is seen as a prince without a chance of actually making a difference as king, but uses his affluent time for pet projects.'

aS'In fact, whats wrong with someone choosing to do drugs in the first place? '

p7238
aS'Why, because he overcame drug addiction?'

p7371
aS"And I'm being a grumpy old man when every time Russell Brand pops up every comment focuses on the man instead of what he is saying. "

p7373
aS"I'm sure he's informative for someone coming in fresh, but the majority here out-pace him by a long shot."
p7374
aS'Then why listen to him at all?'

aS'I think he was good to listen to when I started getting into socialism, it was just easily digestible.'

p7394
aS'And I really hope he has this effect on other people as well, because it helped me tremendously.'
p7395
aS"That being said, it's probably a good choice that I didn't limit my knowledge of socialism to him, because he rarely digs deep into anything."

p7399
aS'For his push to be a noteworthy socialist, I think at his level he can be a good advertiser.'
p7400
aS'but I think he wants people to consider him a public intellectual.'
p7401
aS'Most public intellectuals come from being scholars.'
p7402
aS'He wants to use his fame to skip that step and have everyone think of him as a leader.'
p7403
aS'Atleast this is how it seemed from the 2 or 3 interviews/youtubes I saw him on.'

aS'So, I can criticize both at once.'

aS'Does Russel Brand really promote class consciousness though?'
p7441
aS'To be honest, all I really know about him is from a few images like this, but it seems to me that pushing for discussion of inequality can only lead to greater awareness of the failures of capitalism.'

aS'The theory under capitalism is that lower middle class and the working class have no money to save, they spend all of it as soon as they get it, mostly because they have to to meet their needs.'
p7743
aS'Thus, by taking money sitting in banks from the wealthy, you create more demand for products, helping companies (though not necessarily their executives or shareholders!'
p7744
aS"), and create more jobs when they can't meet demand."

aS"It's one of those things that gets funnier the more times you read it."
p7785
aS'What it says is that capitalism is a broken system because a small number of people decide what needs to be done based on their own profits and that is all that is done.'

p7852
aS'The answer is a resounding NO!'
p7853
aS'It was the workers who laid the railways, mined the resources, processed the raw materials, worked the factories and it is the workers who produce the wealth, not the tycoons.'
p7854
aS'It was their labour that made the industrial revolution and the "golden age of capitalism" possible.'
p7855
aS'And the working class still had to (and continues to) struggle for adequate pay, non-excessive working hours and safer working conditions among others. '
p7856
aS"They didn't mine oil or lay down track because they didn't need to."
p7857
aS'They had the upper-hand in the equation.'
p7858
aS"Please hear me, I'm not arguing right and wrong here, I'm arguing realistic vs. out-to-lunch."
p7859
aS'The reality is that Rockefeller and the various millionaire elites *gave* the workers jobs, not the other way around.'
p7860
aS'They had bargaining position.'
p7861
aS'There were plenty of people who would work for them if you wanted to walk off the job.'
p7862
aS'They built America *via* the workforce they employed.'
p7863
aS'Yes they often used corrupt practices, yes there were public funds that paved the way for them, but at the end of the day they were (and are) in the drivers seat.'
p7864
aS'They bought that seat when they started, or took over, or inherited their respective companies.'
p7865
aS'To act as if you have a say in what they do with those companies just because you entered into a lopsided agreement with them is simply unrealistic.'
p7866
aS"To make posters with idealistic rhetoric about the good 'ol days and expect any measurable change is unrealistic. "
p7867
aS'Why were those jobs theirs to give?'
p7868
aS'Should they be?'
p7869
aS'The jobs were theirs to give because they owned the companies.'
p7870
aS"They were in the driver's seat with controlling interest."
p7871
aS"It's oversimplified, but if I give someone a job to cut grass, it's mine to give because I own the grass; I'm the one cutting the check."
p7872
aS"It's their right to tell me I'm setting the wage too cheap and walk away."
p7873
aS"That's fine, I'll hire someone who will agree to it."
p7874
aS"Again, I'm not defending the tycoons or saying they were right in everything they did, I'm simply pointing out the reality of the situation that I feel the writer is out of touch with."
p7875
aS"I see his point - I simply think he's cheating to get there by calling upon a strawman version of history that didn't exist. "
p7876
aS'Why does the capitalist own the business though?'
p7877
aS"Why don't the workers who actually produce the products or provide the service?"
p7878
aS"That's the question I think you will run into."
p7879
aS"Your grass cutting example simply doesn't work."
p7880
aS'At face value it seems comparable to a business, but in actuality there are some key differences.'
p7881
aS'In your lawn mowing example, it is purely a service based transaction.'
p7882
aS'I pay you, you mow my lawn.'
p7883
aS'However, in the capitalist-worker transaction, a business transaction, the boss is paying the worker to make money for him.'
p7884
aS'I pay you 10 dollars, you make me 20.'
p7885
aS'It is based on profit production, unlike your grass cutting example.'
p7886
aS"An example  that would work with lawn mowing would be if I hired you to mow someone else's lawn with my lawn mower."
p7887
aS"I pay you 10 bucks to mow someone else's lawn, they pay 20 dollars, I get the remaining 10 after paying you."
p7888
aS'You may think, why would the worker not just mow the lawn and keep the 20 dollars himself?'
p7889
aS'Why would the worker accept 10 of those dollars going to a boss?'
p7890
aS'Because the boss has monopoly ownership on lawn mowers.'
p7891
aS'The worker has no lawn mowers to use.'
p7892
aS'I assume you picked up on this, but the lawn mower represents the means of production.'
p7893
aS'Capitalists have monopoly ownership on means of production, so workers must work for them, producing profit for them.'
p7894
aS'So overall your example fails to properly represent a capitalist business.'
p7895
aS'There is no profit making involved in your example, but businesses are based on profit production.'
p7896
aS"That's why they exist!"
p7897
aS"A better example would be a worker mowing other people's lawns for 20 dollars, being paid a wage of 10 dollars, and the rest of the money going to his boss."
p7898
aS"Despite the worker being the one who mows the lawn, the boss can extract profit because he's the one who owns the lawn mowers."
p7899
aS'People would argue this is unjust for a variety of reasons.'
p7900
aS'An easy and pretty common objection is why does the capitalist (boss) have monopoly ownership of the lawn mower?'
p7901
aS"Why doesn't the person doing the work own the machines he works with?"
p7902
aS'Another objection is why does the capitalist own the profit if the worker produced it?'
p7903
aS'The worker mowed the lawn, the worker should own the 20 dollars made.'
p7904
aS'Another important objection is where does the capitalist get the money to pay the workers from?'
p7905
aS'Sure he does indeed pay them, but where does that money come from to pay them?'
p7906
aS'Well, it comes from the workers working!'
p7907
aS'The workers make the money which the capitalist then pays them with!'
p7908
aS'So sure, the capitalist is the one "cutting the checks", *but he\'s only able to do that because workers are producing a product or providing a service!'

aS'What did I say wrong?'
p8460
aS"You could still run into the problem of appealing to the bourgeois state for the implementation of revolutionary measures when the bourgeois state's whole existence is based upon the reproduction of capitalist relations and counter-revolutionary measures."
p8461
aS"But for anyone who's Marxist understanding extends beyond the Communist Manifesto....standing in elections provides a massive opportunity for spreading socialist ideas, why do you think the Bolsheviks stood in elections?"
p8462
aS'Standing candidates gets you media attention which allows you to create a platform for your party on the basis of working class issues like austerity, housing etc, standing in bourgeois elections is one of the fundamental tactics of a successful revolutionary party.'
p8463
aS'I agree with you.'

aS"My point wasn't an attempt to advocate abstentionism or some sort of ultra-leftism."

aS"No he was the main proponent of do what works, compromise when it's necessary and don't compromise when it isn't"
p8473
aS'Was it the Germans around the same time as Lenin then?'
p8474
aS"I'm sure there was someone/a group that can't exactly be said to not having an understanding of Marx beyond the Communist Manifesto."
p8475
aS'Do you mean the German Lefts?'
p8476
aS"Yeah but didn't they call themselve the German Communists or something?"
p8477
aS'I believe you\'re talking about those German leftists that Lenin wrote "Left Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder" about - those who advocated against working with trade unions or participating in bourgeois elections.'

p8480

p8482
aS'A lot of people believe it is actually better for things to get so bad that people will rise up.'
p8483
aS"Marginal reform and improvement such as voting in a socialist or communist party, in those people's minds at least, mean it is automatically betraying it's cause by compromising with capitalists."
p8484
aS'The slight improvments only serve to make people more complacent.'
p8485
aS'The counter-argument some change is better than nothing and improvement in pay, free time, etc means that people have more time to think, express themselves and take part in poltiics.'
p8486
aS'And so marginaly reform can have a "snowball" effect.'
p8487
aS"Both sides of the argument has some merits and I don't think either has been proven wrong yet beyond a doubt."
p8488
aS"I'm guessing you're not from the US?"

p8492
aS'There are independent parties like the Green Party, but there is literally not one reason you should vote for them rather than not voting because they never even come close to double digit percentages of votes.'
p8493
aS"Voting for the Green or Libertarian parties is like getting up at 8AM and driving to the voting center to declare that you're not voting."
p8494
aS"TLDR: I don't vote."
p8495

aS"It's a self fulfilling prophecy."

aS'We should all go and vote for tiny insignificant parties merely to show that we do care, and that other people should choose not to vote for the main parties as well.'

p8500
aS"I'm not a reformist, and I accept that ultimately voting won't change the system but fuck, it's better than doing nothing. "
p8501
aS'If nothing else, running in elections will help build socialist political machinery and organization that will be needed during and after any potential revolutions to combat the return to capitalism or feudalism (or other equally unpleasant post-capitalist forms of society).'
p8502
aS'Exactly.'
p8503
aS"Although personally I'd rather see that organisation achieved through revolutionary syndicates and corresponding community bodies. "
p8504
aS"Those aren't mutually exclusive."
p8505
aS'How a political party and campaign is organized is up to the people who belong to it. '
p8506
aS'Again, I agree.'
p8507
aS'But the danger with organizing a political party is that it might actually take power, and looking at history this has not always produced the best results...'
p8508
aS'But something like Deleonism could work I guess, yeah.'
p8509
aS'Idk much about the political system in UK but in the US, there is basically a single-member district plurality system.'
p8510
aS'It makes voting for third parties practically ineffectual  since the representative office is won by whom ever holds the plurality of votes.'
p8511
aS'Single member district plurality viscously reinforces the two-party system in the US.'
p8512
aS'And most political agendas pushed by third parties or lobbyists, are absorbed into the platforms of the Democrats or Republicans.'
p8513
aS'Essentially, third parties are rendered impractical in the US political system and are pushed into the shadows, discouraging voters from "wasting" their vote on thirds instead of putting it into "good use" by voting for the Dems or Repubs. '
p8514
aS'Not voting only takes the tiny voice you have completely out of the system.'
p8515
aS'My county has lots of young and progressive people in it but it is completely run by backwards, ignorant, and at times, hateful old people who still complain about integrated schools.'
p8516
aS'The reason my county is so lop sided despite the mix of citizens is because the old people are the only ones who vote.'
p8517
aS'They vote on everything.'
p8518
aS"They don't just vote for president."
p8519
aS'They vote for county offices and at midterms.'
p8520
aS'They vote during primaries.'
p8521
aS'The politicians in turn pander more and more to the older population and as a result we get politicians who openly run on a platform of allowing open carry in public schools.'
p8522
aS'You should vote.'
p8523
aS'The last midterm election was a landslide for the right because of a lack of turnout not because of a change in the countries views.'
p8524
aS"It had the lowest turnout since WWII and young people were by far the ones who didn't show up."
p8525
aS'If the under 30 crowd voted in the midterm at the rate they did for president the Dems would have won my a comfortable margin.'
p8526
aS"I'm not saying the Dems are ideal (even if I believe they are at least headed in a better direction than the repubs) Vote for who you want."
p8527
aS'Write in Bernie Sanders even if you live in Kansas if you want.'
p8528
aS"The point is if you keep telling them you don't care at all then they will never even attempt to address your issues to win an election because they don't have to."
p8529
aS'Public displays of frustration over how the system works are all fine and good but rarely change much.'
p8530
aS'What has for generations and will for generations more change little by little how things work is to drag your ass to the polling place and one by one tell them you want something different.'
p8531
aS"Call your congressperson, write to them, campaign against them, that's how things change. "
p8532
aS"It's a lesser-of-two-evils thing."
p8533
aS"I'd rather be ruled by Democrats, who would at least let me marry the guy I love."
p8534
aS'The two parties are extremely similar in the "grand scheme of things," though.'
p8535
aS"Old comment but a lot of people can't vote because we have dead end jobs we can't leave to vote."
p8536
aS'That is a legitimate point.'
p8537
aS"I worked those jobs when I was in my early 20's too."
p8538
aS'By federal law however, they have to allow you to vote absentee or early voting or by another means if you can not make it on voting day.'
p8539
aS"It takes more effort to ask for the form beforehand and mail it in but that's exactly what a lot of these backward counties are counting on."
p8540
aS'They are counting on young people not bothering to do it and therefore not counting. '
p8541
aS'Still need to vote.'
p8542
aS'I live in Oklahoma and even though my vote is still washed out by racists here, I still go vote.'
p8543
aS'Plus there is always a lesser of two evils.'
p8544
aS'In addition, sometimes our local ballots have candidates here that are worth voting for.'

p8549
aS'You can vote and be a revolutionary at the same time.'
p8550
aS"That's true."
p8551
aS'Just making the point that, the political system forces your "opinion" to fit into a few pre-defined spaces.'
p8552
aS'So it looks to others like you are "approving" this or that.'
p8553
aS"Isn't it possible to submit a blank/no confidence vote?"
p8554
aS'Not in the US.'
p8555
aS"You can vote an abstention, bit it's just not counted then."
p8556
aS'This no such thing as a recall vote or no confidence vote at the federal level.'
p8557
aS"Some states allow recall referendums, but they're rarely successful or even attempted."
p8558
aS'However, if you really want to, you could submit a ballot full of write ins, and write something like "no" or "not voting" for every option.'

aS'I always thought this was a bit of a superficial take on things--like so what if it legitimates bourgeoisie democracy on some level?'
p8604
aS"I don't see any practical, positive effect in delegitimizing the system via not voting."
p8605
aS'The state will continue to clank on regardless of how many people do or do not vote.'
p8606
aS'Similarly, people in general do not judge the legitimacy of the state by how many people did or did not vote, so its not very useful even as a propaganda tool.  '

aS"On both sides, the parties' class alliances are breaking down, which reflects a breakdown in America's domestic hegemonic structure."

p9656
aS'That said, minimum wage jobs do not exist as some sort of social incentive.'
p9657
aS'They exist purely because the capitalist class will pay the least amount possible for labor unless stopped by an outside force.'

aS'Advocating that minimum wage jobs are essential punishment for being new to the workforce, an immigrant or unable to find a better job due to lack of opportunity or skills is incredibly dehumanizing.'

aS'Three or four bedrooms on the other hand is superfluous for a single urban dweller.'
p9703
aS"It's a rather new occurrence wherein rent is becoming unaffordable and taking up 40-50% of somebody's monthly income."
p9704
aS'In fact, rent taking up 50% of income is about the average in NYC.'
p9705

p9716
aS'Really, the only situation in which someone earning minimum wage needs more than one bedroom (without another income-earning roommate or spouse) is that of a minimum wage-earning single parent with no child support.'
p9717
aS'This is incredibly rare; less than half of a percent of Americans earn minimum wage in the first place, and only about half of those are working full time.'

p10071
aS'Why?'
p10072
aS'Sure there will always be physical differences between humans, but if we remove the ability for people to take advantage of these privileges by eliminating money, ensuring security through community training and conflict resolution, then any attempt by a person to assert themselves over their common man will fail.'
p10073
aS'&gt; Why worry about methods of management in a company, when the rate of population growth on the planet suggests a far greater looming problem?'

aS'The former would almost certainly lead to higher wages for the workers.'
p10514
aS'In your scenario, an owner with more capital can afford to pay their workers more money (since they are presumably generating more profits), but they are still alienating the workers from the amount of profit they generate, so more profits would go to the workers in a situation where capital is shared vs. owned by one person.'
p10515

p11084
aS"But I do think that, when you're talking about bankers or any of those high paying professions, you have to note that these individuals aren't receiving the *majority* of their wealth from the work that they do, rather they are still receiving the majority of their income from ownership of stock elsewhere or in the firm that they work in."

p11547
aS'If companies are withholding wages or firing employees in contradiction to the employment contracts they agreed to, it is a legal issue, not an economic one. '

aS'One who starts a company does work, often longer hours than "workers".'
p11550
aS"On the other hand, it's just a comic strip."
p11551
aS'I think that classifies as management, the manager would never make millions more than the actual workers.'
p11552
aS'Yeah.'
p11553
aS'The comic is making it seems like the manager has been doing no work at all though.'
p11554
aS"It can be interpreted in many ways, it probably means owners are hugely overpaid more than they don't work."
p11555
aS'BUT LE TIME PREFERENCE'
p11556
aS'I like the comic, but I can already tell you what the capitalist response will be:\n\n"Then why doesn\'t the worker simply start his own factory?'
p11557
aS'"\n\nHow do we properly respond to that?'
p11558
aS"I know there's a good answer, I can never seem to respond adequately when the question is proposed though."
p11559
aS'1.'
p11560

aS"I'm sure I could think of more, but I think those are sufficient for now."
p11570
aS'Thanks, comrade, those are great responses and exactly what I was looking for.'
p11571
aS'No problem!'
p11572
aS'You could also explain that a worker starting a coop, as good as it is, does little in the way of stopping cyclic crises doing incalculable harm every decade or so, the need for infinite growth on a finite planet, vast disparities in wealth and power, environmental degradation on a mass scale, alienation based on wage labor, mass waste of usable resources, for profit wars, the corruption of the political sphere, imperialism, inequitable and unjust distribution and so on that characterize capitalism.

aS'&gt;Banks are much more likely to lend money to capitalist businesses than coops.'
p11579

aS'&gt;Massive corporations have used the government to create crushing regulations, severely limiting start ups.'
p11581
aS'This is a complaint about crony-capitalism, not free-market capitalism.'

aS'&gt;What the worker was objecting to was getting so little in return for his work, not the system itself.'
p11584
aS'Not the worker I was talking about.'

p11591
aS"Workers are most usually workers because they don't have the money (and along with money comes time and skills) necessary to start a business."
p11592
aS'Investors and lenders would be less likely to give a loan to such a person who has little money.'
p11593

p11596
aS"&gt;This isn't really a response to the question, it's simply a complaint about the perception of coops in comparison to more traditional business models."
p11597
aS'How is it not a response?'
p11598
aS"Why doesn't the worker just start a coop is the question, and an answer is that banks are less likely to lend he who wants to start a coop money than a capitalist business."
p11599
aS'&gt;&gt;Massive corporations have used the government to create crushing regulations, severely limiting start ups.'
p11600
aS'&gt;This is a complaint about crony-capitalism, not free-market capitalism.'
p11601
aS'The obvious argument is that crony capitalism is capitalism nevertheless, or that "free market" capitalism necessary leads to crony capitalism, or that there is literally no such thing as "free market" capitalism because markets necessarily imply rules that are enforced by the government (such as most basically private property, validity of contracts etc, but more recently things like no selling organs or using toxic materials) and therefore can never he totally "free".'
p11602
aS"But anyways, again, the question is why doesn't a worker just start a worker coop?"
p11603
aS'One answer is because corporations use to government to create crushing laws and regulations, rather than beneficial ones.'
p11604
aS'They did!'
p11605
aS"It's called the libertarian party :P"
p11606
aS'Well that is per unit of product.'

aS'So the capitalist organizes the operation to scale larger, and those pennies in profit turn into millions. '

aS'What makes you think that the unskilled labor of the worker is of equal value to the executive management? '
p11609
aS"You haven't understood."
p11610
aS'The labour of the worker creates the profit.'
p11611
aS'All the management does is manage it.'
p11612
aS"That's the difference between wages and profit."
p11613
aS'The difference between he who earns a wage and he who earns a salary, as a CEO or manager, which is nothing more than a portion of profits. '
p11614
aS'&gt; The labour of the worker creates the profit\n\nnot necessarily.'

aS'All workers do is work.'
p11620
aS'Do I win the argument now?'
p11621
aS'Of course labour is an exception.'
p11622
aS"Because it's the source of all sources of profit, including the bar, the food, and the alcohol."
p11623

p11624
aS'"Do I win the argument now?'
p11625
aS'"  Nope. \n'
p11626
aS'It is no more the source of profit than the other resources, unless referencing a specific situation.'
p11627
aS'You can say "managers just manage" or "owners just own".'
p11628
aS'It means nothing.'
p11629
aS'If I came in an say "workers just work" I would be laughed off the thread.'
p11630
aS"Labor isn't just randomly the one and only source of profit because it is present at every stage of production."

aS"Well I'll let you go and try to bake some bread with only an oven and no baker, then."
p11632
aS'I don\'t say labour is "the one and only source of profit", I say it\'s the ultimate source of profit, the base, the source on which all other sources depend.'

p11634
aS'&gt;I don\'t say labour is "the one and only source of profit"\n\nThat was your opinion earlier.'
p11635
aS'&gt;The labour of the worker creates the profit\n\nNot very ambiguous.'

p11639
aS'And give me an example of a laborer who labored without oxygen.'

aS"You can't, so that means that oxygen should dictate the direction of a company."
p11641
aS"It's a non sequitur."
p11642
aS'The firm is paying the laborer to do a specific task with their capital.'
p11643
aS'The worker is then paid for that task.'
p11644
aS'The firm did not hire the laborer as a business strategist, so what makes the laborer, who is being compensated for his/her contribution, entitled to make decisions, just because he/she may have an opinion that nobody asked for?'

p11646
aS"It's 3 am, I'll read your stuff tomorrow. "

aS"&gt;  but it's the most meaningful source."
p11648
aS'subjective.'
p11649
aS"&gt;There are three aspects to the price of something: the raw materials, the wages of the workers, and then the capitalists' profit."
p11650
aS"wrong\n\n&gt;By looking at this model we can see that in the vast majority of productive processes, capitalist profit is created via lowering whatever wages he's paying the worker."
p11651
aS'Or by using substitute resources, or by increasing efficiency of production through technology, or by economies of scale, so on and so forth.'
p11652
aS'Maximizing profit can be done in countless ways.'
p11653
aS'Your simplistic and uneducated "model" makes me want to vomit, and stop spending time on this exchange.'
p11654
aS"&gt;BTW there's more to being a capitalist than being a CEO."
p11655
aS'Some people literally just invest money and sit on their capital investment, getting even wealthier because this allows the worker to keep generating profits for them.'
p11656
aS"How much work do you want to claim they're doing?"
p11657
aS'Value is value.'
p11658
aS'Value can manifest in money and labor as well as other things.'

aS'When somebody invests wealth, they are contributing, whether you like it or not.'
p11660
aS'Investment creates business, which is good for everyone. '
p11661
aS'The fundamental principle of the argument is still the same.'
p11662
aS"Wishing it away by claiming that the worker can't manage his/her own labor, or the collective their own workplace, and that only the capitalist-by the chance of his ownership of the machines-is capable and justified in managing these things is nonsensical and silly."
p11663
aS'It misses the point that the criticism is over the exploitation of the laborers, not the ability for the workers to sell their products or run an operation, which is unaddressed.'
p11664
aS"The challenge of running the operation does not justify the theft of the workers' production by the boss or anyone for that matter."
p11665
aS'I always see that argument from capitalists and people who support capitalism.'
p11666
aS'So just how lazy does the owner have to be for them to not deserve to collect all the profits?'
p11667
aS"It's not about laziness, it's about exploitation."
p11668
aS"Nobody's saying capitalists are lazy."
p11669
aS'Business owners could be the hardest-working people at their jobs, but they still make their money by taking it from workers.'
p11670
aS'I understand this.'
p11671
aS'I was asking about people who justify the relationship between owners and workers by saying they work hard.'
p11672
aS"I was asking if they its fine for them to take because they work hard then is it fine for them to take if they don't work hard. "
p11673
aS"I think the response would be: No, they don't deserve the profit if they don't work hard."
p11674
aS'The free market will run them out of business because some other company will be working hard to provide a better product at a better price.'
p11675
aS'So then you respond...? '
p11676
aS"That's not true."
p11677
aS'They act as a catalyst for the effort of those workers.'
p11678
aS'That requires effort.'
p11679
aS"They make the workers' effort more valuable than they could make it on their own (if the owner didn't, why wouldn't they be self-employed?)."
p11680
aS'To say that the owner serves no purpose is preposterous.'
p11681
aS"If the owner was simply skimming off the top, then why don't collectives dominate the corporate world?"

p11683
aS"That would add to the expense if the owner didn't add more value than is taken."
p11684
aS"The market wants low prices, so if there's fat it will eventually get cut out. "
p11685
aS"&gt; They make the workers' effort more valuable than they could make it on their own\n\nSo could the workers if they were able to have collective ownership."

p11692
aS"Of course there doesn't, but what I meant was that any earnings the owner makes add to cost."
p11693

p11694
aS'&gt;Lobbyists and regulated industries my friend.'

p11697
aS'Both majority employee owned.'
p11698
aS"Nothing's stopping other companies except the market."
p11699
aS"&gt; &gt; They make the workers' effort more valuable than they could make it on their own\n\n&gt;So could the workers if they were able to have collective ownership."

aS'However, all of the previous points in combination suggest that the capitalist adds more value than the capitalist takes. \n'

p11720
aS'Not only are they majority employee owned (the founder/inventor has a minority stake too), but they (along with GitHub and the perpetual reddit favorite Valve) are also organized in a so-called "lattice organization" ([from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._L._Gore_and_Associates#Culture)):\n&gt;Unlike the traditional management structure that Bill Gore had experienced at DuPont, he proposed a flat, lattice-like organizational structure where everyone shares the same title of "associate.'

aS'Bill Gore articulated four culture principles that he called freedom, fairness, commitment and waterline:\n* Associates have the freedom to encourage, help, and allow other associates to grow in knowledge, skill, and scope of responsibility\n* Associates should demonstrate fairness to each other and everyone with whom they come in contact\n* Associates are provided the ability to make one\'s own commitments and are expected to keep them\n* A waterline situation involves consultation with other associates before undertaking actions that could impact the reputation or profitability of the company and otherwise "sink the ship.'

aS'All other things being equal, if the capitalist is simply deadweight then his income would drive up costs for his company, no?'

p11753
aS"However, that's not the case."

aS'Coops are not more competitive than for-profit businesses.'
p11755
aS'Why is that, if the capitalist is simply deadweight?'
p11756
aS'Well, I would answer that he is not, and to compete with the coops he must more than pull his own weight.'

aS"No, I'm pretty sure the edited comic missed the point of the discussion and you're claiming that by me saying the point of the discussion that I'm missing it also."
p11806
aS'The edit is claiming that the boss is somehow entitled to exploit the worker and keep his production because he can manage a company, which is no justification at all.'
p11807
aS"That argument is irrelevant to the original image's message because it is not a justification of the alternative/original position being criticized."
p11808
aS"But isn't the boss providing some service to the worker by not requiring him to macromanage a business?"
p11809
aS'It is also possible that he offers the workers some sort of benefits package as well which is also a service.'
p11810
aS"I'm aware that not everyone does this, and that's a shame, but at what point do you draw the line between worker and bossman?"
p11811
aS'As /u/MellonWedge said, the worker is free to do things his way if he likes, but it is probably not the most efficient way to do things.'
p11812
aS"&gt; But isn't the boss providing some service to the worker by not requiring him to macromanage a business?"
p11813
aS'Which can be taken over by a manager (or board of managers) elected by the workers and have the profits divided between the workers and managers rather than the owner taking all of the profits.'
p11814
aS"How is the owner taking all of the profits if the worker (in the comic) gets paid 25% before the maintenance/advertising/paying off corrupt gov't officials/other misc overhead?"
p11815
aS'There is this thing called [political economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy), we can actually use it to make sense of capitalism.'
p11816
aS'Profit must be measured against the initial sum of money invested to determine if there is a surplus of money or not (M-C-M1); if the initial investment is not taken into account in terms of historical costs (what was actually paid), profit ceases being a useful concept.'
p11817
aS'Therefore, profits can only be determined by taking into account the costs of production.'
p11818
aS'Variable capital (wages) is a necessary cost of production, so profits are only determined after wages and other costs are paid.'
p11819
aS'This is how actual capitalists determine their profits in the real world btw.'

p11821
aS'*Political economy* originated in [moral philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_philosophy).'
p11822
aS'It was developed in the 18th century as the study of the economies of states, or *[polities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity)*, hence the term *political* economy.'
p11823
aS'&gt;In the late 19th century, the term *[economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics)* came to replace *political economy*, coinciding with the publication of an influential textbook by [Alfred Marshall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall) in 1890.'
p11824
aS'Earlier, [William Stanley Jevons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons), a proponent of mathematical methods applied to the subject, advocated *economics* for brevity and with the hope of the term becoming "the recognised name of a science.'
p11825
aS'"  \n\n&gt;Today, *political economy*, where it is not used as a synonym for economics, may refer to very different things, including [Marxian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxian) analysis, applied [public-choice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice) approaches emanating from the [Chicago school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics) and the [Virginia school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_school_of_political_economy), or simply the advice given by economists to the government or public on general [economic policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy) or on specific proposals.'
p11826
aS'A rapidly growing mainstream literature from the 1970s has expanded beyond the model of economic policy in which planners maximize utility of a representative individual toward examining how political forces affect the choice of [economic policies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy), especially as to [distributional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(economics\\)) conflicts and political institutions.'

aS"I think you're confusing profits and revenue."
p11832
aS"Revenue is all the money coming in, profits are what's left after paying for all those things.  "
p11833
aS"Seems strange to say that workers don't get any profits when you define the profits as the money left over after paying workers."
p11834
aS"It's technically correct...but..."
p11835
aS'Profits are just receipts minus costs.'
p11836
aS'Wages are a cost.'
p11837
aS"Therefore there's a relationship between high profits and low wages."
p11838
aS"It's not rocket science. "
p11839
aS'Indeed, but the original point that the owner is "taking all of the profits.'
p11840
aS'"  It sounds as if the worker isn\'t getting compensated because you\'ve used profits as exactly the money that the business owner keeps after paying workers.'
p11841
aS'Note I\'m not questioning your definition of profits; I\'m suggesting that the "workers receive no profits" is a tautology and tautologies talk about semantics and not the world so I\'d be hard pressed to make a political point out of it.'
p11842
aS"It's clearly not rocket science and there's no need to be snarky, I hope you can see what I was getting at."
p11843
aS'Okay, that\'s reasonable, but the point of the previous argument was to make the boss look "lazy," or like he didn\'t bring anything to the table for the money he makes, right?'
p11844
aS"I don't think it's quite as black and white as that."
p11845
aS'But it is for the most part.'
p11846
aS"The only thing the boss has that the workers can't themselves have are the machines that the boss owns, and that's only because the boss owns them."
p11847
aS"There is literally nothing that a boss can offer workers that can't be achieved through a collective arrangement."
p11848
aS"Right, and I don't think that the boss has a right to make so significantly much more that the workers can't afford such things, but whoever invested the money into the means should receive more income from said machines."
p11849
aS'If a worker invested into those machines, should they receive more income from those?'
p11850
aS'I would probably agree with that.'
p11851
aS"However no matter how much money is invested in the machines, there are two things which make it irrelevant:\n\n1) the money that was invested, as explained in the comic, was made off of the labor of others, making that money exploited from someone else and not the boss's to use\n\n2) upon establishing the machines as capital for further production they stopped being the boss's personal property and de facto the personal property of the worker who works them, under that worker's control until force is otherwise applied to separate worker and machine."
p11852
aS'You can read more about private/personal property [here in a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/20txk5/communism_socialism_and_capitalism_according_to/cg6syhw) I made a bit back.'
p11853
aS'The simple act of owning the machines without using them himself is also exploitation.'
p11854
aS'1.'
p11855
aS'Not every case of investment comes from the exploitation of others.'
p11856
aS'What if a worker invests into a machine he uses often?'
p11857
aS'2.'
p11858
aS'That line of logic only makes sense from a socialist perspective.'
p11859
aS"In today's world, if you pay for something, it's yours."
p11860
aS'You own it.'
p11861
aS"I don't necessarily feel exploited when I work for someone else that has more money than me."
p11862
aS"Obviously it depends on the situation, and there are exploitative corporations out there, but I don't think every person who invests into business is exploiting the workers of said business."
p11863
aS'There are laws and such in place to prevent exploitation of workers.'
p11864
aS'&gt; but at what point do you draw the line between worker and bossman?'
p11865
aS'A worker produces surplus value and a capitalist owner expropriates that surplus value.'
p11866
aS"That's it."
p11867
aS"Even that isn't necessarily a clean line because a worker could own theoretically any amount of a company through stock."
p11868
aS'Is he a capitalist owner if he owns one share?'
p11869
aS'What about 90%?'
p11870
aS'A worker is one that survives by selling their labour power as a commodity for wages.'
p11871
aS'A capitalist is the one doing the hiring, living off of invested capital.'
p11872
aS'The only grey zone here is the petty-bourgeois, small enterprise owners that live partly off of their own labour and partly off of their invested capital.'
p11873
aS'If a worker somehow owns 90% of some company (this is of course not a realistic scenario), but still chooses to work for some unknowable reason, they are still a capitalist.'
p11874
aS'If a worker does not work, they will eventually be destitute and starve.'
p11875
aS'If a capitalist chooses not to work, they can simply live off of their invested capital, hiring professional managers to protect their investments.'
p11876
aS'Right, but if the capitalist distributes some of the surplus value, is that so wrong?'
p11877
aS'The capitalist has inevitably done some work to make that surplus value more correct?'
p11878
aS'&gt; The capitalist has inevitably done some work to make that surplus value more correct?'
p11879
aS'Surplus value is produced by workers doing productive labour, that is, producing some commodity to sell.'
p11880
aS'Capitalist bosses surely labour as all human beings do, but they do not produce surplus value, not unless they are down on the assembly line during an episode of undercover boss.'
p11881
aS'Capitalist owners are literally superfluous to the labour process in production.'
p11882
aS"Obviously this isn't socialism's goal, but a boss does create surplus value by advertising etc."
p11883
aS'More demand would mean more value, and if the "boss" creates more demand he is increasing surplus value, right?'
p11884
aS"I think there's some merit in commodity markets like this, because it gives motivation to people."
p11885
aS'As someone else in this thread said, "People like stuff.'
p11886
aS'" I don\'t think it would be beneficial to do away with that in a society.'
p11887
aS'Capitalist owners do not produce advertising, they hire workers to produce advertising.'
p11888
aS'Sorry, they make logistical decisions on behalf of the workers, which is a service that the institution provides.'
p11889
aS'That would be a better way to put things.'
p11890
aS'Just to clarify: Is the Boss meant to represent the *owner* of the company, or is he meant to represent the CEO or other exec?'
p11891
aS"Because the *owner* isn't actually doing anything at all."
p11892
aS'The CEO/other is, but is getting 100 times the pay or more, of the average worker in the company.'
p11893
aS'I think the exec is probably overpaid, but does useful stuff to earn *a* wage (probably not enough to justify the absurdly large salary), and the owner is deadweight unless otherwise specified.'
p11894
aS"Ultimately this is the main problem with this simplistic propaganda, that all use some 100-150 year old stereotypical fatcat / monopoly-man in a tuxedo to represent 'capitalist'."
p11895
aS'It just bears almost no resemblance to the current day situation.'
p11896
aS'You need a lot more nuance to make that point, or change to a more relevant simple point if your medium (poster/flier/imgur propaganda) requires it.'
p11897
aS"That's special pleading, this idea that somehow our era is different from other eras."
p11898
aS'Guess what.'
p11899
aS'We still have means of production owned by a few.'
p11900
aS'We still have sweatshops.'
p11901
aS"They might be in China or Taiwan or Bangladesh these days, but they're still there."
p11902
aS'Profit is still made from exploited labour, in exactly the way that this cartoon suggests.'
p11903
aS'Things are still being produced, and always will be as long as people want to live in houses, eat food, and wear clothes.'
p11904
aS'Capitalism is still unstable and still has its periodic crises, most recently in 2007-2008. '
p11905
aS'Well frankly yes, every era is different from any other, and to ignore that is to water down your analysis in a childlike or [quasi-religious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8GMidDRn2k) manner.'
p11906
aS"I take David Harvey's recent point that people love their Capital vol 1 worldview while ignoring vol 2, and miss that over time production can be more or less the focus of the profit squeeze."
p11907
aS"For production it's just not the case that the sweatshop manager telling someone to work harder is the one pocketing the main surplus."
p11908
aS'Rather they are themselves getting squeezed by the retailers (Walmart) or the trademark holders extracting rent for their brand (Nike).'
p11909
aS"That's not even to get into the difference between the executives and the owners (shareholders), which was a contended point raised down the thread here."
p11910
aS"So ultimately yeah, you can massively simplify and use ridiculous top-hat &amp; monocled caricatures, but I think you're only going to connect with people who already agreed with you and knew what you're going for, while turning off the rest."
p11911
aS'But the material conditions are the same.'
p11912
aS'People will always have to produce things, as long as we want to eat food, wear clothes, and live in houses.'
p11913
aS'Currently, as for the last 150 years or so, these means of production are privately owned and the things produced are produced to be sold for profit.'
p11914
aS"In that important respect, there's no difference."
p11915
aS"This is not just about Marx, but you can hardly have been a good student of Marx if you didn't notice how he emphasised the importance of a productive base."
p11916
aS"If there's any confusion, just simply think about who owns means of production and who doesn't."
p11917
aS'That will give you the class position of everyone at a glance.'
p11918
aS'This thread by the way is full of ignorant people who have their heads filled with capitalist ideology that they teach them in college economics classes.'
p11919
aS"They're finding it hard to even conceptualise production, and economic activity generally, which is not for profit but for need."
p11920
aS"Of course it's a simplified picture, but all analyses of society are."
p11921
aS"That's because human society and economics are incredibly complicated."
p11922
aS"If you're going to do any analytical work at all, you need abstract models that explain them."
p11923
aS'And I happen to think that the class model, where people have class positions in relation to their ownership of means of production, is a broadly accurate one, now as in the past.'
p11924
aS"By the way, I don't see a top hat and a monocle in that cartoon."
p11925
aS"It's just a guy in a suit. \n\n"
p11926
aS'Well have an upvote for a spirited defense to my charges.'
p11927
aS"And thankfully this one didn't have a top-hat or monocle on the fatcat tuxedo'ed capitalist but plenty of these that get highly upvoted in this sub do, and those ridiculous caricatures are what I'd pushback against (picture equivalent of buzzwords/rhetoric that preach to the choir)."
p11928
aS"About the only case of capitalist 'owners of production' you could see in real life might be candid shots of the NFL owners' boxes in stadiums, so old propaganda of direct interaction of a capitalist in a fancy suit yelling at the white everyman worker toiling away just really need to be brought into the modern era to have an effect."
p11929
aS"The cartoon doesn't have a monocle or a tophat in it."
p11930
aS"It's probably from the 70s, I've seen variants of it before."
p11931
aS'Also, "the white everyman worker".'
p11932
aS'We need more diverse political cartoons, is that it?'
p11933
aS'This is the kind of idiocy that I think really saps the movement of strength and purpose.'
p11934
aS"When we've got to focus on the clothes that someone is wearing in a cartoon, or their race, as opposed to the actual message of the cartoon."
p11935
aS'Futile, superficial, literalist idiocy.'
p11936
aS'And I agree with you that these cartoons are often dated.'
p11937
aS'But you know what?'
p11938
aS"They're starting to become relevant again."
p11939
aS'I don\'t know if you\'ve noticed, but the ruling class (and I do use that "dated" term deliberately) in both the United States and Britain is actively trying to roll back all the gains that the working class have struggled for in the last 150 years, actively trying to take us all back to the days of the sweatshop and the workhouse.'
p11940
aS'They\'re beginning to use the old language again, language about "the deserving and the undeserving poor".'
p11941
aS'Social Darwinism has come back into fashion again, this time under the guise of "libertarianism".'
p11942
aS'If they can use the old language and the old imagery, I say we revive the old language of the left.'
p11943
aS'If they talk of the undeserving poor, we can talk of the idle rich.'
p11944
aS'Because as the French say, "plus \xc3\xa7a change, plus c\'est la m\xc3\xaame chose". '
p11945
aS'&gt; Also, "the white everyman worker".'
p11946
aS'We need more diverse political cartoons, is that it?'

aS"My point is that the race of the person depicted in the cartoon doesn't matter."
p11958
aS'These things are irrelevant.'
p11959
aS'This cartoon is quite obviously from the 1970s.'
p11960
aS"I've seen variants of it before."
p11961
aS'But its message is still relevant. \n\n'
p11962
aS'Well, in a lot of ways, they are one and the same.'
p11963
aS"CEO's are not owners, but majority shareholders in a corporate society."
p11964
aS"I don't believe a CEO deserves that great of a gap in salary, but I believe that they deserve some small gap in salary."
p11965
aS'Is that so wrong? '
p11966
aS'The goal of socialism is not to run a capitalistic business for profit.'
p11967
aS'The line between worker and owner is simply this: one owns means of production and one does not, despite the fact that he built them.'
p11968

aS'But, he is able to do things his way.'
p11974
aS"If he doesn't like the way his boss does things, he saves money, and sets up his own shop, where he manages spending and still makes products."
p11975

p11976
aS"You're missing the point."
p11977
aS"It's not about becoming another boss."
p11978

aS'What would be the point of that? '
p11980
aS"I don't see where either comic is making any argument for whether the boss is or is not justified in doing anything."
p11981
aS"I don't see where you're pulling a normative claim out of either."
p11982
aS"The second comic:\n\nJournalist criticizes the boss for taking the workers' produce\nThe boss's responses is that he isn't pocketing all the money, there are other costs because he has a company to manage."
p11983
aS"Does not respond to the claim that he's exploiting the workers."
p11984
aS"Ain't hard to read, friend."
p11985
aS'The first comic makes no claim that he\'s "exploiting workers".'
p11986
aS'Edit: At least not exploiting in a way that implies any normativity, in which case I just exploited a sandwich for lunch.'
p11987
aS"That's incorrect, the very definition of exploitation in socialism is that you are not returned the full value of your labor, which is the very point of the comic."
p11988
aS'Okay, sure, but under that definition no normative claim is made.'
p11989
aS"There's no appeal in either comic that says that the exploitation is unjustified or justified."
p11990
aS"Not being returned the full value of your labor (something the comics discuss) doesn't imply that the boss is or is not entititled or justified to do what he is doing (something the comics make no argument about)."

p11999
aS'Unjustifiable on what basis?'
p12000
aS"If you think this comic makes a moral argument you have no clue what you're talking about."
p12001
aS"I'm not a philosopher, but the comic clearly exists to convince the viewer that the boss is unfairly taking the wages of another."
p12002
aS"Considering that this was first drawn up by a socialist for the sake of spreading socialism then it's pretty damn obvious both in intent and general assumption by the viewer that the stealing of the product is unjustified."
p12003
aS"I don't mean to be blunt but honestly who gives a fuck about whether there are moral or normative claims made?"
p12004
aS'Who cares about that technicality?'
p12005
aS'Are you going to just continually argue semantics?'
p12006
aS"It's pretty damn clear that the comic is making the point that the workers are getting bamboozled and that the edit is arguing that the boos isn't keeping the money for himself, which is not an address to the fact that the worker is getting his shit taken by the boss man."
p12007
aS"You're thinking in terms of the capitalist paradigm of profit, and seem to have swallowed the idea that capitalism rewards efficiency."
p12008
aS'Capitalism is actually an immensely wasteful system. '

p12011
aS"If it were legal I could burn down a competitor's factory and jack up the price of my product, for example."
p12012
aS'But we can think of plenty of ways it rewards efficiency as well, such as the cost of fuel providing an incentive for developing more efficient distribution.'

aS"&gt;I am not convinced of [capitalist advantage through government dictation]\n\nWell, first of all, let's take a look at our politicians."
p12276
aS"Since the early twentieth century, they've been doling out propaganda against socialism/communism."
p12277
aS'They\'ve vilified labor unions, run amok with a "Red" witch hunt, and even today, being called a "Socialist" is considered an insult in American politics.'
p12278
aS'Those are just opinions, sure, but they dictate the attitude that most Americans hold about the idea of a socially run business.'
p12279
aS"But let's look at other ways government might dictate that Capitalists should have an advantage."
p12280
aS"Let's look at our schools, specifically our public schools as they are government organizations."
p12281
aS'Again, propaganda is spread to this day downplaying the effectiveness of a socialist way of life.'
p12282
aS"We hear all about how it's a failing economic system (U.S.S.R., Cuba, China) and how it leads to tyranny and dictatorship."
p12283
aS'These are things currently being taught by public school history teachers.'
p12284
aS'Do they talk about the Canadian coops that produce about 35% of the maple syrup that we use in the world?'
p12285
aS'Do they talk about the OCDC, which has set up hundreds of co-ops worldwide that are successful in their missions?'
p12286

p12291
aS'Doughnut, right?'
p12292
aS"Ok, so that's schools, but what is the government doing to actively help out capitalists more than socialist cooperatives?"
p12293
aS"Well, recently we've had two huge bailouts of the banking sector and the auto industry, for one."
p12294
aS'We continually offer these capitalists outs when it comes to taxes and our government treats Corporations as people.'
p12295
aS'So much so that Corporations are able to give exorbitant amounts of money to political campaigns, further ensuring their interests are met.'
p12296
aS'Now, to say that the government does nothing for cooperatives and the like is disingenuous, but in no way does the government do nearly enough to foster the growth of these "other" ways of doing business and the capitalists make sure of it.'
p12297
aS"I don't think I convinced you because you seem so set in the ways of capitalist thought that I doubt anything I can type here will convince you."

aS"All you've done is re-add the mud to the water, when, if you really re-analyzed it, the situation still doesn't change in any really meaningful way."
p12307

p12308
aS'The comic was intentionally simplified.'
p12309
aS'No one thinks a capitalist does nothing.'
p12310
aS'They just think that either workers should self manage or at least hire/elect the managers themselves.'
p12311
aS"Nevertheless, you didn't really contradict the comic."
p12312
aS"You just tried justify the capitalist's taking of the money. "
p12313
aS'Problem is if you ask anybody, nobody will honestly claim that the labor is of equal value to the product.'

p12324
aS'The very nature of capital ownership in the economy under our current laws makes it less attractive as well. '
p12325
aS'But the kind of value (nebulous concept) which we add to products by manufacturing them, under capitalism, is only in the direction of that which can be sold at a profit.'
p12326
aS'This skews everything, including the concept of value. '
p12327
aS'Profit is determined by prices which are determined by supply and demand.'
p12328
aS'How does this skew value?'
p12329
aS'Because the things and services which are produced, are produced not to meet needs but to make profits.'

p12337
aS'They know "the price of everything, and the value of nothing".'
p12338

aS'Such is business.'
p12359
aS'&gt;They do not care about what is of value to customers, but merely what the customers will buy\n\nIf you are telling me that customers buy what they do not value, the door is over there...\n\n&gt;They know "the price of everything, and the value of nothing".'

aS'You cannot "pay" a machine less than how much value it added, and likewise with raw materials.'
p12370
aS'Workers however, only need to be paid what it takes to keep them alive and working, not the value they add.'

p12372
aS'Lets say it is worth 20 dollars.'
p12373
aS'If the machines and resources cost 10 dollars, you have 10 dollars left, which the worker added.'
p12374

p12375
aS'The worker only needs to be paid what it costs to keep him alive, in this case 5 dollars.'

aS'The system has been one of exploitation and inequity for most of history, and even if we all agree that a system in place now is fair (not that I believe it is), then that still fails to correct for the injustices of the past.'
p12400
aS'For the sake of fairness and understanding where you are coming from - yes some (few) workers did manage to scrimp and save and avoid things like illness and other misfortunes and eventually have the collateral for a bank loan to create their own factory.'

p12402
aS"It's an opportunity afforded to a lucky few, and fewer still who manage to find success."

aS"No one said anything about being completely equal, that's obviously stupid\n Just that the profits should be shared among society rather than a small exploitative cadre of capitalists. "
p12476

p12477
aS'Because large, standardized operations are more stable and have greater longevity.'
p12478

p12489
aS"Capitalism doesn't inhibit means of doing business. "
p12490
aS'Well there are a few responses down this road.'
p12491
aS'First, there is nothing to prevent a co-op, but there is little support for co-ops either.'
p12492
aS'There are no subsidies in most countries (Italy is one exception) for establishing a co-op, and it is rarely presented as a practical alternative, despite some of the successes of co-ops.'
p12493
aS"&gt;Capitalism doesn't inhibit means of doing business."
p12494
aS'Except that it does on two front.'
p12495
aS'As described, when you have a history of injustice and exploitation, suddenly saying "Okay, everything is fair now - lets run the race" when one party has a twenty lap head start - is not some issue that can be overlooked.'
p12496
aS'Co-ops are now in situations where they have to compete against massive monopolies, subsidized industries, and a terrifyingly monstrous financial sector that is increasingly predatory on industrial capitalism.'
p12497
aS"Finally, one can take the standpoint of Market Abolitionists such as Michael Albert, and say that capitalism does inhibit means of doing business in the same way that slavery or feudalism inhibit means of doing business - you're forced to compete against a system that can abuse and exploit labour to boost the bottom line."
p12498
aS"That's not a fair fight, and that's not a system we want to live in."
p12499
aS'&gt; but there is little support for co-ops either.'
p12500
aS'Whenever I talk coops with socialists, they praise their success, and attribute their overall failure to lack of government assistance.'
p12501
aS'The subsidies of oil companies are often criticized, but so many are for consistently following environmental regulations and buying up bankrupt infrastructure.'
p12502
aS'What good are you doing by starting a coop, just because you think it is a better system?'
p12503
aS'There are benefits to incorporating, but as far as I know there is nothing stopping a coop from  incorporating.'
p12504
aS'&gt;As described, when you have a history of injustice and exploitation, suddenly saying "Okay, everything is fair now - lets run the race" when one party has a twenty lap head start - is not some issue that can be overlooked.'
p12505
aS'What head start?'
p12506
aS"We are talking about structures of business, they don't magically get better over time."
p12507
aS'If the coop structure is better, it will succeed in competition with the standard corporate structure.'
p12508
aS'For example, the coop will probably be more attractive to workers, thus giving the coop the advantage of a great pool of workers from which to acquire the most efficient ones.'
p12509
aS'By the way, how would socialism inhibit means of doing business LESS than capitalism?'
p12510
aS"Finally, one can take the standpoint of Market Abolitionists such as Michael Albert, and say that capitalism does inhibit means of doing business in the same way that slavery or feudalism inhibit means of doing business - you're forced to compete against a system that can abuse and exploit labour to boost the bottom line."
p12511
aS"That's not a fair fight, and that's not a system we want to live in."
p12512
aS'In a free society, the aforementioned advantage will apply.'
p12513
aS'The corporations do not own the workers as in slavery and do not control the safety of the workers in their communities as in Feudalism, so coops would receive better consumer reputations (as consumers are in the labor markets) and would have "first pick" advantage over particularly efficient laborers.   '
p12514
aS'Older and larger institutions do have a head start - they have stocks, bonds, residual incomes, diversification, multiple operations, economics of scale, property rights, etc.'
p12515
aS'If you want to reset everyone to zero and then say, "Let\'s Capitalism" then I suspect you would see many co-ops emerge very quickly, although this is only a suspicion.'
p12516
aS'The problem that your arguments have is that they seem to exist in some thought-experiment world in which there is a serious labour shortage, rather than the opposite we are experiencing at this time.'
p12517
aS"When labourers have fewer options, the choice between abhorrent conditions or starvation isn't a choice at all."

aS'Also - the "efficiency" of labour argument is one of those things that doesn\'t seem to apply to the real world.'
p12519
aS'From Tim Wise (this was an article about racism/discrimination, but the points do apply):\n\n&gt;But much inequality in the labor market stems from factors other than overt bias.'
p12520
aS'For example, more than eighty percent of all jobs are never advertised, according to the National Center for Career Strategies, but are filled through informal networks of associates, friends, family, and other connections.'
p12521
aS'As such, there is no open competition for most positions, such that employers can size up all the possible people they could hire, and then make an overtly biased decision.'
p12522
aS'Rather, most hires are made without a broad competition...\n\n&gt;Similarly, since the employer can\xe2\x80\x99t know about employees who didn\xe2\x80\x99t apply, because they were out of the network for doing so, they can\xe2\x80\x99t realize after the fact that they lost out by not doing more to diversify their hiring.'
p12523
aS'They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that there were equally or more qualified people of color they might have hired, because they would have no awareness of such persons.'
p12524
aS'Nor would their competitors be better in this regard, since they too likely hire heavily by networks and informal mechanisms.'
p12525
aS'In other words, the market fails to provide adequate information to employers, the likes of which they would need to make true merit decisions, or recognize the mistakes that come from a racially unequal network for jobs.'
p12526
aS'&gt;But in practice, employers cannot know whether hiring a particular person (or not) was the \xe2\x80\x9ckey\xe2\x80\x9d to their profits in the following quarter: there are too many variables that impact profits, of which labor productivity is only one.'
p12527
aS'Also, since the marginal productivity differences between employees hired and those passed over are often small, discerning the impact of racist hiring versus non-racist hiring is virtually impossible.'
p12528
aS'&gt;Third, even in theory the only way the argument could work is if the passed over applicant then applied for work with a direct competitor in the same market, industry, and geographic locale as the racist.'
p12529
aS'For example, if a racist employer in the insurance industry in Indianapolis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hire blacks because he thinks they are generally lazy, unless the spurned black applicant applies for work with a direct competitor, in the same town, how could employer number one see the result as a mistake, due to the productivity of the rejected applicant?'
p12530
aS'If the rejected applicant got a job selling cars, or in another town altogether, how would that worker\xe2\x80\x99s productivity at the dealership, or in Chicago, even come to the attention of the racist employer who passed him over, let alone be comparable to the productivity of whatever white worker was ultimately hired by the racist to sell insurance?'

p13071
aS'A plutocracy would be the best term to describe the US, or "bourgeois democracy" as known in Marxist political theory.'
p13072
aS'Engels called it a "democratic republic":\n\n&gt;The highest form of the state, the democratic republic, which in our modern social conditions becomes more and more an unavoidable necessity and is the form of state in which alone the last decisive battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie can be fought out \xe2\x80\x93 the democratic republic no longer officially recognizes differences of property.'
p13073
aS'Wealth here employs its power indirectly, but all the more surely.'
p13074
aS'It does this in two ways: by plain corruption of officials, of which America is the classic example, and by an alliance between the government and the stock exchange, which is effected all the more easily the higher the state debt mounts and the more the joint-stock companies concentrate in their hands not only transport but also production itself, and themselves have their own center in the stock exchange.'
p13075
aS'In addition to America, the latest French republic illustrates this strikingly, and honest little Switzerland has also given a creditable performance in this field.'
p13076
aS'But that a democratic republic is not essential to this brotherly bond between government and stock exchange is proved not only by England, but also by the new German Empire, where it is difficult to say who scored most by the introduction of universal suffrage, Bismarck or the Bleichroder bank.'
p13077
aS'And lastly the possessing class rules directly by means of universal suffrage.'
p13078
aS'As long as the oppressed class \xe2\x80\x93 in our case, therefore, the proletariat \xe2\x80\x93 is not yet ripe for its self-liberation, so long will it, in its majority, recognize the existing order of society as the only possible one and remain politically the tall of the capitalist class, its extreme left wing.'
p13079
aS'But in the measure in which it matures towards its self-emancipation, in the same measure it constitutes itself as its own party and votes for its own representatives, not those of the capitalists.'
p13080
aS'Universal suffrage is thus the gauge of the maturity of the working class.'
p13081
aS'It cannot and never will be anything more in the modern state; but that is enough.'

aS'What is interesting to me is how much is basically correct about what he wrote in 1884 and what it missed about the development of propaganda and other forms of governmentality in the 20th century.'
p13084
aS'Engels seemed to think the democratic republics were fertile ground for proletarian revolution\n\n&gt;One can conceive that the old society may develop peacefully into the new one in countries where the representatives of the people concentrate all power in their hands, where, if one has the support of the majority of the people, one can do as one sees fit in a constitutional way: in democratic republics such as France and the U.S.A.\n\n...\n\n\n&gt;If one thing is certain it is that our party and the working class can only come to power under the form of a democratic republic.'

aS'A democratic republic centering itself on liberalism and power of choice (or illusion of) is perhaps the best type of state to defend the bourgeoisie.'

aS'Consider a few examples: 1) the cost of lobbying for the defeat of an environmental bill may be less than the potential loss from it, 2) the cost of out of court settlements multiplied by the likelihood of injury from a faulty design may be less than the cost of a recall, 3) contributing money to a humanitarian cause may result in good publicity and increase sales more than not making this contribution.'

p13376
aS"On top of that, corporations are all competing with one another to recruit the top executives, so even if it would save them more money not to pay millions in signing bonuses, salaries, and severance packages, not doing so means that they can't compete as well for the best executives."

p16718
aS'In general would you agree with the following simplistic narrative (critiques welcome, again, i\'m no expert on this):   During the robber Baron era, taxes were low, so the natural "evening out" of wealth that progressive income taxes bring about, was not in existence.'
p16719
aS"After 1930 as income taxes became more progressive, income gaps came down...as globalization started (70's/80's), the same progressive income tax was not enough to counter the growing in balances."

p16740
aS'Capitalists adore income inequality and while people like Adam Smith used to know that too much is too much, there is no such concept as "too much" in modern capitalism which has become completely divorced from ethics.'

aS'"Too much" is an ethical concern, and in modern government and elite thinking ethical concerns have no place in the market.'
p16742
aS'The point I was trying to make is that unless we understand what capitalism is and how it works, how the game works, we will always be playing catch up with it.'
p16743
aS'Fiddling with taxes to level the income gap is at best playing this game of catch up.'

aS"That money you hand over to the racetrack if you lose goes to pay people's salaries, upkeep on the property, business taxes, savings for future growth of the racetrack."

aS'It goes to pretty much the same thing that an investment in that racetrack would go to, had it been traded on the market.'
p16832
aS'The money that the race track makes off of bets that they win is not equivalent to money invested by shareholders--it is operating revenue instead.'
p16833
aS'The excess of that revenue (over expenses) will likely be reinvested in the track, yes, but it is disingenuous to claim it as the same as purchasing stock in the company.'
p16834
aS'An investment in the racetrack on the open market would have gone strictly to capital improvements, as no company that is going to be in business for long will issue stock to pay their workers/variable expenses.'
p16835
aS'Yes, when you buy a stock in the secondary market, you are not investing capital to companies looking to expand their business.'
p16836
aS'However, without these secondary markets, very few investors would take the risk on small startups, and they would never make it past the initial stages of growth.'
p16837
aS'Even after your explanation, I feel like it was still a very valid analogy, and fairly close to the mark, if nowhere near directly equivalent (as most analogies are like to be)'
p16838
aS"It's not a valid analogy."

aS"If you buy 123 shares of XYZ, you're buying a small part of XYZ."
p16840
aS'If XYZ is profitable, you make money, if XYZ is not profitable, you lose money.'
p16841
aS"That happens to be the way it works most of the time, yes, but that's not even *really* the most important part of the analogy."
p16842
aS'Most people who put money into stock could hardly care any less whether the company itself is successful or not -- it just happens to be the case that the success of the company is directly tied to a return on investment.'
p16843
aS'If you remove the process of how the return is generated, the stock market is essentially the same as gambling.'
p16844
aS'You put money in, and hope to get more money out.'
p16845
aS"One might be a *smarter* play, but that doesn't really change anything."
p16846
aS"Also, there's such a thing as selling short, and betting on failure in the first place, even in the stock market.\n\n"
p16847
aS'Short selling is important to stabilizing the stock market, when stocks take a dump and start to plummet, the only people who are buying, are short sellers... take a look at how the financials traded after short selling was removed.'
p16848
aS'Not even the slightest.'
p16849
aS'There are magnitude differences in the amount of investment that comes from betting vs stocks.'

p16853
aS'Sure, but a guy like Romney is liquid enough to not need that cash for a year.'
p16854
aS'No, stock market is the small part that is not gambling.'
p16855
aS'When you invest in stock market, you are buying shares of companies that do make actual profit.'

p16858
aS'(you get to count 60% of the profit as capital gains)'
p16859
aS"That's gambling, of course."
p16860
aS'And then he gets more income through the investments.'
p16861
aS'That income should also be taxed at normal income rates.'
p16862
aS"Right now, it's taxed at substantially reduced rates."
p16863

p16864

p16865
aS"It's investment income."
p16866
aS"I believe it shouldn't be taxed at a lower rate than non-investment income."
p16867
aS'That is double taxation, and many people share your belief.'
p16868
aS'This is why it is a current issue.'
p16869
aS'There is no right side of the issue, it is just two different perspectives.'
p16870
aS"Like estate tax, people that make money and die can't pass the home over to their children because the estate tax is too high of a burden to the child."
p16871
aS'Many people are against that, however this is taxed at a high rate.'
p16872
aS"It's no more double taxation than any other form of income is double taxation."
p16873
aS'Every single bill gets taxed over and over again as it travels through the economy, and I don\'t see why a transaction of buying shares of company X from person A, then later selling them to person B, is any more "double taxation" than, say, charging taxes to purchase goods, on money that has already been taxed through income.'
p16874
aS'If anything it seems *less* like double taxation.'
p16875
aS'But taxing those capital gains and dividend payments as regular income will invariably discourage investors from investing in them.'
p16876
aS'In an open economy, such as almost all economies today, investors will simply move their investments to countries with lower tax rates, which will damage the American economy in the long rum.'
p16877
aS"No they don't."
p16878
aS'They move it to where profits are highest. '
p16879
aS'True, good point.'
p16880
aS"Wouldn't another possibility be that there is a movement away from equity markets to bond markets, which are generally considered safer?"
p16881
aS'Since the reward is now lower (due to higher taxes), risk would need to drop in a similar manner.'

p16886
aS'And people who can even consider investing in low tax markets overseas are already doing it while they are investing here.'
p16887
aS'Fact is that our middle class drives enough profit that raising capital gains taxes would still generate beaucoup money for investors even if the tax rate is a bit higher.'
p16888
aS'You could say this about every tax.'
p16889
aS'The question is whether this specific form of profit deserves to be exempt or not.'
p16890
aS'I see no reason why *this* form of profit is somehow more valuable than the other forms of profit.'
p16891
aS"this is true, but can't be taken to an extreme."
p16892
aS'If were true in all cases, then all money in the world would be in Singapore or some other low tax country.'
p16893
aS'Other factors come into play.'
p16894
aS'However i agree with the general idea of trying to keep taxes low.'
p16895
aS'However I am against having a discrepancy between capital gains(especially in extreme scenarios...say over 1 Million a year) and income.'
p16896
aS'In an ideal world, both income taxes and capital gains would move to a lower, but equal level.'
p16897
aS"Having the discrepancy creates division in the country and while it won't really solve anything, i think the rates should be made equal just to remove the debate and create a sense of fair play/working together/everyone doing their part, etc"

p17815
aS'You may not support all of his views, but the majority of the views in this picture line up with his very well.'
p17816
aS'The fundamental problem I find with his policy is that [according to Libertarian Philosophy](http://www.lp.org/platform), he empowers the very corporations he does not believe in dictating policy; lack of a federal government leaves too many opportunities for abuse of power by businesses.'
p17817
aS"If Paul's outside of that sphere of thinking, that's fine, but I haven't seen things to indicate that."
p17818
aS'Link me if you have something to the contrary?'
p17819
aS"Free markets regulate themselves,  if the federal government didn't have power to lend out so corporations and lobbyist couldn't buy it and use it to there advantage by writing policies to kill there competitors there would be more strict regulations on corporations,  Ron Paul is against corporation welfare and he has said he would gladly have regulations to monitor and keep track of fraud and those sorts of things as long as they didn't affect the markets."
p17820
aS"So just because us libertarians say we want less regulations or no regulations,  that just means we don't want the government and corporations regulating themselves,  we want a fair system that everyone plays by the same rules,  the constitution and the agreement contracts."
p17821
aS"Explain the theory of more strict regulation on corporations with no one there to enforce those laws?I'm not saying our system is perfect, but if you remove the feds, who enforces this?You can go with the theory that people won't buy from a dishonest corporation, but how many people as we type are buying gas from BP, or shopping at Walmart?How many are even aware of their corrupt practices based on a healthy dose of propaganda and suppression?"

p17826
aS"Right, but lifting regulation is only going to help them hide-if they're getting Billions, and they haven't created jobs or cleaned up their act on their own, how is taking away any sort of check on their power going to help?"
p17827
aS'Walmart actually runs the same game you just mentioned-that is, getting uncontested subsidies for setting up their business-except they engage in it on a local level.'
p17828
aS"If you don't agree with subsidizing business, you probably won't like their behavior once you look below the surface..."

p17830
aS'Chinese labor is often exploitative.'
p17831
aS"The average American doesn't care about this, but they should."
p17832
aS"I'm not saying get rid of the government,  i'm saying if the law was the constitution and the agreement contract of corporations then it would be more strict,  for example,  if a corporation polluted someones land they could get sued and lose there business,  instead they get fined by the government who let them rent federal land to pollute on and actually make a profit,  instead of all these incompetent corporations getting bailed out and tax breaks,  they wouldn't receive them,  the only way they could out beat the competition is by having a better product,  the lying cheating stealing that corporations do is going to happen whether there is regulations there to try and prevent it or not,  and we have no problem with punishing those who do those things,  it's not like corporations can run around and abuse people and commit fraud freely with less regulation."
p17833
aS"So, instead of having corporations buying out government and having a federal protections, we'd have people buying out judges directly and we'd be empowering corporations to hire it by having less oversight, which they're already doing.....I don't see how this is helping. "

aS'Sorry to burst your libertarian bubble.'
p17852
aS"It's kind of funny that you say for a free market to work you need honest people to make it work and since that is impossible a free market is impossible,  yet Keynesian economist like to say they use empirical studies and know economics,  but they miss the same point you just made,  you cannot predict what humans needs and desires are,  that is why economics is a soft science,  and truly the scientific method cannot be used to prove a theory until you can predict human behavior."
p17853
aS'You simply cannot regulate a market,  no one is smart enough to play god with the economy,  and free markets are all for punishing those who abuse the market like lying cheating stealing fraud etc.'

aS"You may have had the perspective you posted before 2004, but I ask people who they voted for when they say what you just did, and they never want to tell me-I suspect it's because they're aware of the above."

p17971
aS"And that certainly accounts for some of the big corporate welfare that's gone on during Obama's term, including some real mishandling of the bailout and TARP, and the concessions given to the healthcare industries in democrats' attempt at healthcare reform."
p17972
aS'And I absolutely agree that this is a serious problem in our political system.'
p17973
aS'But, and even you mention it yourself - there are huge differences in the way both parties treat social issues, and those differences are stark and far-reaching.'
p17974
aS'One party participated in, endorsed, and encouraged the use of torture, indefinite detention without trial, and other heinous crimes (in either the legal or moral sense) while professing to be a party of family values (but I dunno about you, my family does not condone torture) and morality.'

aS'The other party did not.'
p17976
aS'One party continues to use oppression tactics to deny basic human rights to huge swaths of the population, with their only argument being essentially religious doctrine, a principle that clearly ignores the separation of church and state espoused in the first amendment of the United States constitution.'

p17978
aS'One party explicitly demeans women and denies them basic rights of privacy and control of their own bodies, even to the point where it has threatened lives -- all in the guise of being "pro-life".'

p17980
aS'I am not at all happy with the actions and legislation that has taken place over the last decade or so (since I started paying attention to politics, anyway), and I am certainly not going to sit here and tell you that the democrats are in any way less a vessel for corporate America to infiltrate the government at the expense of the majority of the population.'
p17981
aS'However, I honestly cannot get behind the idea that the two parties are the same, or that it would be okay to let radical Right-wing conservatives take over and allow these atrocities to continue because it\'s "all the same".'

aS"I'd also ask that you please reread my post - I don't think I've ever said any of the things you're arguing against, and I really don't know where you would have gotten the impression from my post that I am, in any way, defending the Republicans - the exact opposite, actually."

p17989
aS'First point-you can\'t say the Democrats have "no balls" when the Republicans were the first people pushing framing indicating that they "need to work with both sides".'

p17992
aS"Via inclusion, Obama has proven a point that would have only been theory before, and led to critique based on hypothetical situations-Obama included them in the process, and they have done nothing but stonewall every bill he's tried to put forth, while providing none of their own."
p17993
aS'Despite their buzz word talking point mantra bullshit about "creating jobs!'
p17994
aS'", they\'ve only put one bill on the table that I know of to resolve the issue, and if you saw the video, I think we know what their focus has been(hint:It\'s not about creating those jobs they got all those tax breaks and deregulated a whole bunch of things for).'
p17995
aS'This is my personal beef with the issue-when this conversation comes up, the defense that\'s always put forth is "Well, the Dems are doing it too".'
p17996
aS'Meanwhile, this is coming from the same party that speaks of personal accountability as a solution for most problems-why aren\'t they exemplifying that?They certainly love to state that as a solution for the poor that are dealing with trying to eke out an existence with no medical care, jobs that are being traded to line the pockets of a few who don\'t care about using that power to better the system, and a college system that the GOP hasn\'t given a shit about in years while speaking of "hard work" this and "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps" that.'
p17997
aS"I can name three issues I have with democrats on the issues, but at least they're not trying to take my rights or my opportunities to self-actualize based on who I am, and if that's the choice other than a person who wants to take off all of the regulatory bodies to supposedly fix things and a party that doesn't consider me human by long standing mantra, I'm voting for Obama, thank you."
p17998
aS'\\Additional note-I also tend to hear corny defenses of the GOP, that speaks of a glorious past in which "Martin Luther King was a republican!'

aS'", and "The republicans fought against prejudice!'
p18000
aS'"-that\'s cute and all, but when there\'s been several cases that have shown that they don\'t hold any values of equality for citizens of the US(including Nixon\'s Southern Strategy, Trent Lott\'s statements on Strom Thurmond, Strom Thurmond\'s illegitimate black daughter(funny, no one ever critiqued or stereotyped white people for abandoning their children over that one...?'

p18741
aS'However, the lack of regulation on journalism now (no reg requiring truth!'

p18753
aS'Our society, and the challenges it faces, are too complex today for any one person to have a truly indepth understanding of all issues.'
p18754
aS"Even if the mass media functioned at the highest standards of journalistic excellence; it still wouldn't be enough."
p18755

p18765
aS"You don't need to understand every detail to know which side you fall on in most social issues because empathy plays a strong factor in most of those decisions, leaving more time to study the issues that require in-depth research, such as economic concerns. "
p18766
aS"&gt;our fast paced lifestyles prevent discussion and thought\n\nWhich is basically the point I'm making."
p18767
aS'I just add the extra dimension of the complexity of the issues themselves.'
p18768
aS'&gt;it is possible to know which side you fall on before becoming an expert in the subject\n\nOnly if you have experts whose analysis you can trust, or access to objective data from sources you can trust and the intelectual wherewithal to do a preliminary analysis yourself.'
p18769
aS'These, sadly, seem to be rare conditions.'
p18770

p18772
aS'What also should be acknowledged is the extent to which irrational biases also impact issues like economics.'
p18773
aS'Many people react to the complexity of such issues by relying of snap judgements and gut instinct (i.e.'
p18774
aS'irrational subconscious biases) rather than applying much thought to the matter.'
p18775
aS'Precsiely because in depth thought takes time and effort to formulate.'
p18776
aS'This is why I stated elsewhere that some people may become well informed on a few issues, but will remain ill-informed on most.  \n'
p18777
aS'&gt; It may have been possible for the majority of voters to be well informed on all issues of the day in the agrarian society the founders were setting up a government for, but it is not possible today.'
p18778
aS'I would argue even then not.'
p18779
aS'People were just as if not more busy, and access to information was lesser than today courtesy of the internet.'
p18780
aS'It is true politics played a much greater role in day-to-day life, in particular during the mid-to-late 19th century, but this was often a more single issue thing, and varied.'
p18781
aS'In a territory, *of course* politics was of import, but the politics of import were questions of whether you wanted to become a state or split into multiples (The Dakota Territory &amp; mountainous west deliberately split up into more territories/states to give greater Republican representation in Congress and the electoral college) or become independent.'
p18782
aS'If you were a woman, you fought for the right to vote.'
p18783
aS'Politics was much more sectional and factional back in the day, but became increasingly homogenized in terms of the parties starting with the 1850s but moreso come the 1890s/1900s.'
p18784
aS'When parties were less uniform, it became necessary to educate yourself who advocated what if you wanted to see your politics in government.'
p18785
aS'A Democrat in Georgia was radically different from a Democrat in New York, and a Republican from Pennsylvania was different from a Republican in California.'
p18786
aS'As the parties have become more uniform, you can expect (though not know for certain) that a Democrat supports abortion rights and a Republican opposes them, or whatever issue you wish to use as an example, and vote accordingly.'
p18787
aS'I respectfully disagree.'
p18788
aS'I think 10 to 30 minutes a day browsing the news would be sufficient to stay abreast of the key issues, on the breaking info as well as the context.'
p18789
aS"It's just things like /funny are soooo distracting! "
p18790
aS'And anyone who has in-depth knowledge of a subject that is later covered by the news will tell you the news is utter crap.  '
p18791
aS'If you are talking about network news, then I agree.'
p18792
aS'However, thanks to the internet, EVERYONE has access to credible and timely news sources.'
p18793
aS'They just have to do it.'
p18794
aS'Not making that effort is due to cultural values.'
p18795

p18796
aS'&gt;EVERYONE has access to credible and timely news sources\n\nYes, but they also have access to a lot of nonsense, and not many people have the capacity to effectively differentiate one from the other. '

aS'There are laws against lying in commercials, but not in the news.'
p18803
aS'WTF?'
p18804
aS"The issue is that if deliberately mislead someone so they will give you money it's fraud."
p18805
aS'However, News organizations sell advertising space, not news.'
p18806
aS"They can lie to their audience all they want because the audience isn't paying them."
p18807

p18808
aS'Thanks for the explanation.'
p18809
aS'That makes sense.'
p18810
aS'On a separate but connected point, it is dangerous to democracy to have a journalism industry that cannot be trusted to tell the truth.'
p18811
aS'Just like it is dangerous to have a political class that are owned by plutocrats.'
p18812
aS'Just like it is dangerous to have the legal system owned by plutocrats.'
p18813
aS'Just like it is dangerous to have a huge portion of society that values ignorance above knowledge. '

aS"The Founding Fathers, as great as they were, simply couldn't envision a country of this size and scope."
p18816
aS"If you think about the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, it's actually kind of cute."
p18817
aS'It allows Congress to regulate INTERSTATE commerce only.'
p18818
aS'It was intended to be a limit on federal power - states would have control of their own economy.'
p18819
aS"Now it's used to justify just about everything Congress does because all commerce is interstate."
p18820
aS'Same with the "informed electorate" idea.'
p18821
aS"Even if you hook up the best journalist with the most well-meaning citizen, it's simply impossible to be fully informed without it overtaking your life."
p18822
aS'And this is really the root of all our ills.'
p18823
aS'Money in elections is a big problem, for instance.'
p18824
aS"But it wouldn't be unless people allow themselves to be controlled by money."
p18825
aS"Someone with great ideas and no money will always lose to the guy with the commercials - but that's because PEOPLE LISTEN to the commercials."
p18826
aS"You ultimately can't buy a vote unless someone is willing to sell - and today, we are. "
p18827
aS"I'm far less concerned about money in politics than most other political observers are."
p18828
aS'Money provides a megaphone; it amplifies your message.'
p18829
aS"It doesn't make an unappealing message more appealing on it's own."
p18830
aS'Mitt Romney learned that the hard way.'
p18831
aS"Yes, it's true that on average the candidate with the most money wins the election, but that is correlation not causation."
p18832

p18835
aS'Congressional elections are a particularly good (or, rather, bad) example of this.'

p18838
aS"This lack of real representation is what's causing the worst problems we're seeing today."
p18839
aS'Money is just an aggravating factor.'
p18840
aS'It would be hilarious that you think a "free press" is a regulated press, if it wasn\'t so depressing and horrifying.'
p18841
aS'Do you not recognize that your complaint about "lack of regulation" on journalism ignores that journalism is more heavily regulated than it\'s ever been in history? '
p18842
aS'You are wrong.'
p18843
aS'Go read up on the the Fairness Doctrine that was removed by the Reagan administration. '

aS'Under the American electoral process, math dictates that no third party will ever survive to become a viable option.'
p19009
aS"For example, if American third-party candidates get 15% of the vote nationwide, they can still end up with 0 seats in the legislature if they don't win any individual districts by a plurality."

aS'Not every country has a broken voting system (and therefore a two party system).'
p19021
aS"Indeed, I'm surprised this isn't something American voters care about more, but then, why would either of the two major parties campaign for a system that allows third parties more representation in the government?"
p19022
aS'For example, the Australian senate is chosen with a proportional voting system; If a party gets 1% of the votes 1% of the senate is from that party, rather than "winner takes all".'
p19023
aS'We have preferential voting for the house (including the PM), but at least then it\'s impossible to "throw away a vote".'
p19024
aS"If you vote for a third party, and they don't win, then your vote automatically counts towards your next preference who is still in the running to win (think voting for an independent, who doesn't have near the majority of votes, so your vote then goes towards the democrats, which you listed as your second preference)."

aS"It's actually an issue that I'm not sure is possible to solve, changing the voting process without the support of those currently voted into power."
p19026

aS'We vote for the person, not the party.'
p19029

aS'So...yeah, the country is boned.'
p19034

p19055
aS'I don\'t think that\'s something that can really be avoided if you have a group of democratic representatives: you could "ban" political parties, but all that will happen is that the parties will become unofficial, shady deals done in secret behind closed doors.'
p19056
aS"I'd much rather have political parties official and publicly acknowledged so that voters know who they're voting for."
p19057
aS'However, a bigger problem is the voting system.'
p19058
aS'The First-Past-the-Post voting system used in the US (and other countries like the UK) [guarantees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) that there will eventually be a two party system.'
p19059
aS"It's the two party system that is the real problem: it reduces the choice for the electorate, crushing all minority opinion."
p19060
aS'All modern voting systems allow voters to rank the candidates in order of preference, allowing voters to vote for the candidate they want to win, instead of forcing them to vote against the one they want to lose.'
p19061

p19095
aS'While the "no" campaign drew together politicians from across the spectrum to tell a consistent message, the "yes" campaign was only really liberals and leftists.'

p19372

p19436
aS"I'm not interested in which solution is chosen and after crunching the numbers there is really only a couple that will actually work instead of kicking the can down the road."
p19437
aS"In that example, I don't really care which one you chose (within reason--there is obviously abuse in the pension system and if you gamed the system and have 3 pensions cutting you a large monthly check, I'm good with reneging on the deal...I'm also good with increasing taxes on the wealthy, property taxes, whatever, just fix it)."

aS'Do you?'
p19445
aS"Obamacare provides, if you're willing to spend up to 10% of your income on premiums alone, a health plan.....which still requires all the copays, deductible meetings, etc....all of which rack up really quickly with any kind of a health problem."

aS"Last thing I'll comment on--agreed, Obama isn't an 'unlimited dictator,' however, I didn't vote for any of the guys/gals in congress either....and who do you think we should hold accountable for our governments' public policy?"

p19453
aS'People who talk like you, especially those in the media, who are so committed to appearing above petty partisan politics that they cannot ever admit that one party is worse than the other, are exactly what lets the Republicans get away with all the shit they pull: the bullshit, the unreasonable demands, the lies, the unwillingness to compromise, the demanding benefit cuts as part of a deal then turning around and blaming Democrats for cutting benefits, all of that is only possible because they know nobody will call them out on it.'
p19454
aS"Because that's the thing: by refusing to distinguish between the two sides, you remove any incentive not to be the worse of the two."
p19455
aS'And yes, Obamacare is nowhere near as good as it should be, but it still makes a lot of people a lot better off.'
p19456
aS'You say it distracts from establishing a better system, but what better system is remotely possible, politically?'
p19457

aS"And finally:\n\n&gt;who do you think we should hold accountable for our governments' public policy?"
p19459

aS"Is there a reason we can't say both?"
p19461
aS"Failing that I'd go with whoever's worst."
p19462
aS"Maybe that's the problem--maybe the problem is all the Republicans."
p19463
aS'Your argument would be far more persuasive if, about the things the president has nearly 100% control (see half the items on this list), he acted less like a Republican, I could even see the problem was clearly the Republicans.'
p19464
aS"However, his policies (note, again, I don't mean laws....I mean things solely decided by the commander in chief of the military), you could convince me."
p19465
aS"Until then, however, I'm stuck where I think things are--the democratic party is just a slightly better Republican party, their platforms are nearly identical, and to vote for one or the other is throwing away my vote anyway, so why not at least vote for a political party that closely represents my views?"
p19466
aS'Yes.'
p19467
aS'You might get four years of someone just barely slightly worse if you voted that way.'
p19468
aS'But if you vote for the lesser of two evils, then we end up in this situation where both of the candidates suck, and we\'re stuck there for decades at a time thanks to "logic" like yours.'
p19469
aS'Plus, to quote someone else:\n\n&gt;Besides, if you\'re going to apply game theory to the situation in a shortsighted local fashion - not taking into account others thinking similarly, and not taking into account the incentives you create for later elections based on what potential future candidates see you doing today - if, I say, you think in such a strictly local fashion and call it "rational", then why vote at all, when your single vote is exceedingly unlikely to determine the winner?\n'

aS'(If you live in California, go ahead and vote for whoever you like best).'

p19475
aS'That is, the perfect candidate (the one who the most people would vote for) would be pretty bad.'
p19476
aS"Third party candidates lose partly because they aren't treated as legitimate candidates, but mostly because people just don't agree with them, however unfortunate that may be."

aS"I'm presenting a contrary opinion (about a specific detail no less) and I'm being downvoted and am met with Ad Hominem attacks."

p21779
aS'How do you see these articles as supporting your position?'
p21780
aS"I'm not going to read them for you."
p21781
aS'Your philosophies are fine in an academic sort of way, your political party sucks and is a tool of the Oligarchs it seeks to defy. '
p21782
aS'&gt; Of course.'
p21783
aS'The real issue here is who gets to decide what those rewards should be.'
p21784
aS'Libertarians support allowing market forces and voluntary negotiations to make that determination.'
p21785
aS'Progressives seem to prefer getting their people into positions of power where they can dictate their preferred terms to everyone.'
p21786
aS'So strawmen are okay when Libertarians use them? '
p21787
aS"To be fair, that's what government does; dictates terms to the people (through laws backed by threat of force)."
p21788
aS'And you must admit, Progressives would rather have their own people in power than, say, Conservatives.'
p21789
aS'This is mentioned by contrast with the Libertarian perspective that there is already too much government dictating to people and we need to scale that back sharply.'
p21790
aS'A Libertarian in power is going to be the only person dedicated to *not* dictating to anyone as much as possible.'
p21791
aS'&gt; It should remain illegal to harm people by dumping toxic chemicals in a river.'
p21792
aS'But why?'
p21793
aS'Why would an ethos that says you are beholden to nothing but what people are willing to pay you say that there have to be rules?'
p21794
aS'How do Libertarians define human decency, because again every single one I\'ve met is a "Fuck you, got mine" type with too many quotes.'
p21795
aS"If you don't like your power company how is deregulation going to help you?"
p21796
aS'Anyone can buy those lines, buy land, build a power plant.'
p21797
aS'Right now you just sound like a wealthy elite bitching that your kids still have to mingle with the "coloreds" at a public ~~school~~"indoctrination center". \n'
p21798
aS'A core tenet of Libertarian thought is the "Non-Aggression Principle," which would assert that intentionally poisoning someone (or an entire population through toxic chemicals in a river) is an act of aggression and therefore immoral.'
p21799
aS'This principle also applies to personal property.'
p21800
aS'It is not a matter of "fuck you, got mine.'
p21801
aS'" It is a respect for your right to personal property and an expectation that you will be obliged to show me the same respect; that I will not attempt to take what is your propert by force, nor should I be subject to use of force to divest me of my property.'

p21805
aS'This is one wholly improper misuse of state authority that Libertarians hope to correct.'
p21806
aS'Competition among providers always benefits the consumer by allowing alternatives.'
p21807
aS'For a long time,  television companies fought cable and manipulated the FCC to prevent competition.'
p21808
aS'Then consumers got a choice.'
p21809
aS'Then cable companies fought satelite (and still do) but that too has become more common.'
p21810
aS'The result is now these companies are forced to appeal to consumers by offering improved service and lower prices, all thanks to competition among providers.'
p21811
aS'With government enforced monopoly, they could charge anything they want and provide shitty service because there would be no alternative.'
p21812
aS'This principle applies to every business; it only gets better when consumers have more freedom of choice and worse when there is no freedom to switch to another provider.'
p21813
aS'The idea that Libertarians are "beholden to nothing but what people are willing to pay" is nothing more than demonization intended to cast them as "greedy monsters," or simply ammoral.'
p21814
aS'Libertarians are people too, with compassion and a desire to help others succeed as much as they hope to succeed themselves, just like everyone else.'
p21815
aS'The core principles dictate that any right I expect to enjoy I must also apply equally to my fellow citizens.'
p21816
aS'Libertarian ideals do not preach or endorse racism in any way.'
p21817
aS'Nor sexism.'
p21818
aS'Nor classism.'
p21819
aS'Nor withholding the right to marry just because you are gay.'
p21820
aS'It is ultimately a Humanist philosophy (imho).'
p21821
aS'The accusation of "greed" is based on the mischaracterization of the Libertarian belief that all human interactions are "transactions" of one kind or another.'
p21822
aS'If I have labor and you have money, we trade.'
p21823
aS'This is called "working for a living.'

aS'" It\'s not a radical concept and it has nothing to do with wanting to harm anyone or fuck people over.'
p21825
aS'It is a principle that dictates value for value and applies equally to chraitable acts.'
p21826
aS'If I give freely of my time, effort or money to help a person in need, I get the value of exercising my compassion and making the world a better place.'
p21827
aS'All of this is fully consistent with Libertarian ideals.'
p21828
aS'As for "school indoctrination," this is a more difficult argument to make.'
p21829
aS'But, again imho, the evidence is there.'
p21830
aS'The schools are run by the government and are heavily biased towards teaching that government is the only valid solition to a variety of social, moral and personal ills.'
p21831
aS'This is the epitome of state-run propaganda being taught to children, and thus constitites "indoctrination.'
p21832
aS'" Lest you be confused, this has nothing to do with objecting to education itself, nor with wishing to withhold education from anyone.'
p21833
aS'It is an appeal to incorporate alternative ideas with equal or superior validity into the curriculum.'
p21834
aS'It is also an appeal to allow and in fact promote more alternatives to state-run schools with the purpose of improving education through competition, allowing people more freedom of choice so that they can switch educational providers if they wish.'
p21835
aS'The government monopoly on education has degraded the quality of education overall and prevents necessary and proper improvement.'

aS")\n\n\nYou won't, that's the point."
p21839
aS'You always have to accept a lesser of two evils and more often than not the Libertarian Party offers up peacemeal solutions that improve "liberty" in one regard while committing an aggressive act towards others, i.e.'
p21840
aS"laws that cripple social safety nets without creating any transition to stabilize the lives and health of thousands before the free market does it's undeniable and completely sacred magic and fixes everything."
p21841
aS'There is a philosophical validity to Libertarianism, and the idea of preesrving freedom.'
p21842
aS"There is little to no validity in the established Libertarian Party, and I don't really have to prove that because even if I'm wrong they'll never win an election to prove me so."
p21843
aS'Would you support regulation to prevent oligarchy, like heavy restrictions on Lobbyists and Public Campaign funding?'
p21844
aS'The re-establishment of the estate tax Pre Bush Era?'
p21845
aS'The closing of a majority of tax loopholes that ensure that our GDP decays from within?'
p21846
aS'Because every \'Libertarian" solution I\'ve heard has a glaring issue that will likely make things worse, e.g.'
p21847
aS'kill school funding because if there is a demand for schools they will be built and everyone will have the chance to go to them which will prevent us from sinking back into an era where only wealthy white males were educated enough to become policy-makers...wait...'
p21848
aS'I just want to know why you think the Libertarian Party as it exists will ever be able to do any better given its constituents than any other political ideology that inherently creates a platform for the regulation of trade of goods and services?'
p21849
aS"Just like Socialism, there don't have to be issues with the ideology for there to be massive pitfalls in its implementation."
p21850
aS"If you're not a Libertarian Utopian, why bother aligning yourself with the actual Party as it is a failure?"
p21851
aS'If you are, then surely you must realize that all Utopias share the common flaw of human will?'
p21852
aS"So my real question: why are you a Libertarian if it's not going to make a difference anyway?\n"
p21853
aS'Before I address this current missive, lets establish that you have no objection to the rest of my statement (outside of the one area quoted that I admit needs careful consideration)? '
p21854
aS"Please don't tell me you advocate charter schools."
p21855
aS'What do you see as the problem with charter schools that might make them an unworthy or unworkable alternative to government-run education?'
p21856
aS'Because in real world examples they are utter shit.'
p21857
aS'Thats why. '
p21858
aS'Actually, they tend to do very well.'
p21859
aS'Can you link me to some information to the contrary?'
p21860
aS'If there is evidence I am mistaken, I would like to know.'
p21861
aS'Ugh, here is a link to the Bloomberg article.'
p21862
aS"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-28/one-in-five-charter-schools-should-close-on-performance.html\n\nI wouldn't call 20% failure rate good."

aS"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865582169/Study-Majority-of-US-charter-schools-perform-equal-or-worse-than-traditional-schools.html?pg=all\n\nI will allow you the concession that state schools aren't great, however I don't believe taking the brakes off is a good idea. "
p21865
aS'Those are good links, and I see why you might tend to draw your previously stated conclusion.'
p21866
aS'But, two things come to mind.'
p21867
aS'First, a charter school failure is good thing.'
p21868
aS'It means that customers tried that "brand" and found it didn\'t meet their needs so they switched.'
p21869
aS"That's a total free market win."
p21870
aS"I feel bad for the school and the teachers, but I wouldn't argue for keeping them open if they can't deliver a good product."
p21871
aS'Second, public schools can\'t "fail.'
p21872
aS'" No matter how bad they are at doing their job, the government keeps giving them tax money.'
p21873
aS'Recent proposals to give parents "vouchers" from tax money that they could use at private and charter schools were shot down (some states or counties do allow this but it is a very small amount).'
p21874
aS'To send your kid to a private or charter school you must be able to afford it in addition to paying taxes to fund public schools, rather than instead of paying for public schools.'
p21875
aS'So the government protects its monopoly on education even when competition would be better.'
p21876
aS'Its really sad that this ideology that "only government can do it right" over-rides what is actually good for kid\'s education. '
p21877
aS'That is a fair enough argument, my only concern regarding charter schools in on the provision that they may not be put to the same rigors as state schools.'
p21878
aS'I really hate doing this but and it is kind of lazy of me but have you heard of waiting for superman?'

p21889
aS'Same with anarchy.'
p21890
aS'A small commune of 30 people anarchy works wonderfully.'
p21891
aS'In fact it probably works better than having any sort of leader or set rules.'
p21892
aS'However, on any scale, anarchy would break down.'
p21893
aS'I suppose if we go back to The caves  it would work well...'
p21894
aS'But we like things like infrastructure.'
p21895
aS'I am sure that I can be wrong.'
p21896
aS'But I will bet your life and my life and a million dollars that never on any scale that anarchy could work. '
p21897
aS'You speak so authoritatively about what sociologists apparently say about anarchy.'
p21898
aS'Could you cite some sources on that?'
p21899
aS'Define "work?'
p21900
aS'" Is your concept of "efficiency" based on a capitalist standard?'
p21901
aS'People tend to assume that this current system works on a "large scale.'

aS'" It doesn\'t.'
p21903
aS'Capitalism is chaotic, it is constantly reproducing itself, and in perpetual regional crises.'
p21904
aS"Needs aren't met, excesses are made, and overproduction is the rule rather than the exception."
p21905
aS'Regardless of this, you tell me that "anarchism" or any kind of alternative is utopian -- frankly, to think that the current system can function for much longer is *the* utopian position, not the alternatives that have been proposed.'
p21906
aS"I think the one argument point you'll get in response to your 'certitude' (I think you're pretty much dead on, personally) is that hypothetically, in a sufficiently advanced and educated society (built out of a heavily governed one mind you) individual citizens could be held responsible for their own actions by themselves."
p21907
aS'Libertarians seem to think that the human race is always on the verge of this kind of blissful society full of philosopher kings (obviously facetious, pretty much every Libertarian I\'ve met is a "Fuck You, Got Mine" type deep down and that\'s why they subscribe to the ethos) and that it\'s this horrible wall of regulation that\'s preventing us from being what we truly are.'
p21908
aS"In actuality, our manufactured 'rules' are the only thing keeping most people from allowing their animal nature to subsume them, and even so many arrive there through slow, steady habituation. "
p21909

p21910

p21911
aS'Assumes Libertarian ideals have no room for actual rule of law and that the law as we know it does not already function by holding individuals accountable or that this would evaporate if Libertarian ideals were implemented as law...\n\n&gt;Libertarians seem to think that the human race is always on the verge of this kind of blissful society full of philosopher kings \n\nAssumes Libertarian ideals need some utopia within which to become suddenly valid (also a Straw Man argument about Philosopher Kings, BTW)...\n\n&gt;(obviously facetious, pretty much every Libertarian I\'ve met is a "Fuck You, Got Mine" type deep down and that\'s why they subscribe to the ethos)\n\nAssumes Libertarian ideals have no room for charity and moral obligation to care for the less fortunate.'
p21912
aS'Also a gross demonization predicated on the mischaracterization of the ideal "What makes you think you have the right to take what is mine by force?'
p21913

aS"Assumes Libertarian ideals have no room for any regulation whatsoever (more Straw Man antics)...\n\n&gt;In actuality, our manufactured 'rules' are the only thing keeping most people from allowing their animal nature to subsume them, and even so many arrive there through slow, steady habituation."
p21915
aS'Assumes (again) Libertarian ideals would result in lawless chaos without rules and are somehow inherently contrary to a functional society...'
p21916
aS'So many unproven, baseless and outright confabulated assertions without any resemblance to the truth,  lol.'
p21917
aS'Shall I go on?\n\n'
p21918
aS"The problem with attacking the way an argument is presented instead of the argument itself (which, by the way, is a form of the ad hominem) is that it leaves you open to this:\n\nJust because someone makes an assumption (implicit or explicit), it doesn't mean the assumption is wrong."
p21919
aS'I *assume* my bank has the cash on hand to honor a withdrawal.'
p21920
aS'I *assume* my drinking water is safe.'
p21921
aS'I *assume* if I called the police, they would come to my house.'
p21922
aS'Am I wrong for holding those assumptions?'
p21923
aS'Of course not.'
p21924
aS"While you're busy attacking the argument itself instead of the content, you've already lost the audience, made your own argument weaker and and did not advance the discussion."
p21925
aS'You could have avoided it by pointing out the assumption then commenting on *why* that assumption is wrong.'
p21926
aS'That latter bit is the important part.'
p21927
aS"But you didn't do that because many of those assumptions are spot on and not far from the truth.\n\n"
p21928
aS'You make a fair point about the potential to succumb to the Fallacy Fallacy.'
p21929
aS"Just because someone's logic is faulty that doesn't mean their conclusion is automatically wrong."
p21930
aS'They could be accidentally or intuitively correct.'
p21931
aS'However, I assumed that by describing the nature of the assumptions in such a brief way this would demonstrate why they are false without need for a lengthy explanation of each.'
p21932
aS'The general nature of my critique was to point out that this writer was attacking his/her own distorted perception of Libertarian ideals rather than actual Libertarian ideals (Straw Man), and then asserting unproven conclusions based on these distorted ideals and misunderstood desired outcomes (Begging the Question).'
p21933
aS'These logical Fallacies are intended to give us tools by which to judge the validity of an argument.'
p21934
aS"When the entire argument is one big run-on Fallacy, that's a huge red flag."
p21935
aS'In this case, he/she was not even close to accurate, by accident or otherwise.'
p21936
aS'&gt; So many unproven, baseless and outright confabulated assertions without any resemblance to the truth\n\n\nSounds like a Libertarian Party meeting.'
p21937
aS'You even managed to quote Star Trek. '
p21938
aS'You respond with yet another unproven and baseless opinion, not even bothering to support it with an argument.'
p21939
aS"It's not baseless, and the proof will come in the next ten elections the Libertarian party completely fucking bails on...a la the last ten."
p21940
aS"I've been to several in several different contexts and states."
p21941
aS"My argument against Libertarians efficacy and intention is that I've seen them at work and no matter how much Von Mises they quote they're either deluded into thinking they aren't being used by the Koch Brothers or they know how selfish and narcissistic they are and try to pass it off as amicability and wisdom (Penn Gillette). "
p21942
aS'Sadly, this is more Begging the Question.'
p21943
aS'It is not a given that Libertarians are being manipulated by the Kochs.'
p21944
aS"In fact, it isn't true at all."
p21945
aS'Therefore, your accusation of delusion is wholly innacurate.'
p21946
aS'One cannot ascribe characteristics to an entire group based on the perception of a mere handful of supporters.'
p21947
aS'A better benchmark is the vast population of non-rich, lower/middle class individuals who espouse Libertarian ideals.'
p21948
aS'Likewise your mischaracterization of Libertarian ideals as "greedy" or "selfish" is innacurate, though this is a more forgivable misattribution.'
p21949
aS'This is primarily a matter of misunderstood definition (see my prior posts about the Myth of Altruism).'
p21950
aS'All humans act in "self-interested" ways, which includes expressing the desire to help others and to see them succeed, along with wanting fair value exchange in business dealings (you might be suprised to know that a "living wage" is entirely consistent with Libertarian ideals).'
p21951
aS'Just because I recognize I do charitable works to make myself happy, is it any less valuable, good or right?'
p21952
aS'Who defines the rules?'
p21953
aS'The ruling class and the overarching cultural hegemony, no?'
p21954
aS'Our "rules" are in the interests of profit and capitalists.'
p21955
aS'The point is to break this mold. '
p21956
aS'We define rules because as of yet our species lacks the individual autonomy to survive alone or in significant isolation relative to the status quo.'
p21957
aS'"Rules" are arguably not totally necessary, but as a means of convenience and talent humans are able to establish language and shared terms for things (using a language is technically following a rule, and personally in the midst of existential fuck-all I\'m glad to be a slave to my words sometimes) and this evolves into systems.'
p21958
aS'The systems are not perfect and perhaps our greatest flaw is our willingness to buy into our own BS and believe that the rules are perfect simply because they are intended to be common.'
p21959
aS'Upon basic logical examination we know that just because something is law does not make it right, but we also operate on a day to day basis with a very strong sense of our own moral guidelines and regardless of our level of self-awareness or the context in which we formed them.'
p21960
aS'Most often (the majority of differing cases being considered abberations, perhaps unfairly) these moral codes, no matter how nuanced they become, hold some common elements from the society and thus we find that though rules are fallible and must be allowed to change they are also a powerful way to communicate the experience of time to young generations without requiring them to know every hour of the past.'
p21961
aS"Breaking the mold is important for testing our ontological limits, but I'm uncomfortable with anyone who says that suffering and immensely wasteful loss of life is acceptable in the pursuit of anything man wants to create or build or invent or whatehavyou, conceptual or otherwise."
p21962
aS"I see the cold logic in saying that at the cost of millions of people's well-being we can have a pretty good mock-up of Utopia...but the human in me just wants to keep everyone alive and reading, and that takes less money and effort than we're all expending in the rat-race right now. "
p21963
aS'Nothing in particular.'
p21964
aS'I was just pointing out that libertarians are not always anarchists. '
p21965
aS'I would argue libertarians are never anarchists, since libertarianism has nothing to do with the anarchist tradition, which is historically far-left.'
p21966
aS'Other than that it *was* synonymous with anarchism(including the leftism) from the 1850s to the 1950s.'
p21967
aS'Well yes, far-right capitalists have stolen the term "libertarianism" and now  they\'re trying to steal the word "anarchism" from the leftist lexicon.'
p21968
aS'But it has since been coopted by capitalists who are generally who Americans are referring to when the talk of libertarians and certainly who PZ Meyers was talking about.'
p21969
aS'Hence past tense.'
p21970
aS"It's a reminder that these people have coopted philosophies they do not understand, particularly the AnCaps."
p21971
aS'For the most part I simply write off libertarian beliefs because they have no foundation in any sort of reality.'
p21972
aS'If you look at their makeup, the "libertarian" movement is largely made up of privileged middle-class whites. '
p21973
aS'This.'
p21974
aS'I feel like their party is simply a bunch of kids trying to protect their parents wealth. '
p21975
aS'You could likely count the number of minorities in their little "Free State Project" with just your ten fingers alone.'
p21976
aS'Therefore, libertarianism has *everything* to do with the anarchist tradition--both are historically far-left.'
p21977
aS'Libertarianism is, and always has been, fundamentally anti-capitalist in orientation.'
p21978
aS'Left-leaning people are generally too smart to be anarchists beyond the age of 21.'
p21979
aS'If you look at what self-identified anarchists have to say, it tends to be about smashing the welfare state, not smashing any real apparatus of power or privilege wielded by the state.'
p21980
aS"That's completely false."
p21981
aS'I have never heard an anarchist on the Left discuss "dismantling the welfare state" in the context of contemporary capitalism.'
p21982
aS'That would be societal suicide. '
p21983
aS"And there's a whole history of rich literature discussing anarchism and its methodology."
p21984
aS"I would advise you look through some of it, rather than thinking you're clever while actually coming across foolish. "
p21985
aS'Most of that provides cover for the "I don\'t want guv\'m\'nt takin\' away MY money" crowd to continue railing against socialism and voting for Tea Party types.'
p21986
aS'Even if a few hundred or a few thousand Americans were true blue anti-statists, setting aside the tinfoil hat nature of going down that path, ultimately the consequence of that subculture is to facilitate inappropriate levels of confidence in the "libertarian leaning" neanderthals among us.'
p21987
aS'Your conflating anarchism and libertarianism.'
p21988
aS'Modern libertarianism is a political philosophy 60 years old.'

aS'Such sanction of activities can only occur in a regulatory form biased towards (and protective of) corporations that must be (and is) separately encoded as law.'
p22265
aS"Libertarian ideals include holding both corporations and individuals accountable for their actions, rather than what we have today which is innapropriate collusion between government and business to the detriment of individual citizen's rights and freedoms."

aS"I'm not confusing anything, I think we're just using language differently."
p22267

aS'As with most "political debate" I think we are all a lot closer in "ideals" than the "extreme positions" would lead us to believe.'

aS'If I own 1% of a company that is 1 billion in the hole (meaning I likely invested $1mil at least), then yes, I would expect to risk losing my house.'
p22345
aS'That would be the risk of owning that much stock of a large company.'
p22346
aS"But it's much more likely that if I invest $10k into a company, my risk of loss is more akin to the $10k."
p22347
aS'It would be extremely rare for a company to owe orders of magnitude more than it was worth unless there was fraud involved.'
p22348
aS'However, that is mitigated in that if the fault of the bankruptcy is the board and/or the CEO, the responsibility for payment would be theirs, not the stockholders.'

p22356
aS'That is exactly what libertarians are suggesting (including me).'
p22357
aS'Pooling their resources to influence politics to the degree that they do needs to stop, because they are abusing it.'
p22358
aS'You mean like how reddit pooled its resources to stop SOPA?'
p22359
aS'The only reason lobbyists are a problem is because of the amount of favoritism the federal government can grant.'
p22360
aS"In a libertarian government, the central government cannot grant favoritism to any particular company and so you wouldn't have much in the way of lobbyists, either."
p22361
aS'Well, you know SOPA was not good for anyone.'
p22362
aS'How I probably should have phrased it is corporations often use political influence that winds up harming people (oil companies for example).'
p22363
aS"I don't know that a libertarian government would necessarily solve this."
p22364
aS'But there is something wrong when big corporations run over the people.'

aS"&gt; I don't know that a libertarian government would necessarily solve this."
p22366
aS'But there is something wrong when big corporations run over the people.'
p22367
aS'There might be some flaws about a libertarian government which you could level, but this would be one of the strong suits.'
p22368
aS'There would be no incentive to lobby because the centralized government would not have much power in terms of granting favors for one company over another.'
p22369
aS'The federal government would be prohibited from infringing on personal property rights.'
p22370
aS"It's simple, but the implications of that are huge."
p22371
aS'This would probably take too long to write out at the moment, but if you work that out in your mind a bit, you will see that if the government is limited in that way, there is barely any reason left to engage in lobbyism for big corporations.'
p22372
aS'What IS the solution?'
p22373
aS'Sounds to me like the solution to regulatory capture is to strip the regulator of the power that is being abused in the marketplace.'
p22374
aS'Seeing as regulatory capture usually involves allowing businesses to avoid regulations, deregulation is merely giving them what they want and hardly a improvement.'
p22375
aS"That's one side, sure."
p22376
aS'The other side is that regulation is used to prevent competition in the market place, either through barriers to entry, prevention of mergers, or sweetening sell-out deals so larger fish can acquire smaller competitors more easily.'
p22377
aS'The problem with most regulations is often that they prevent the market from operating efficiently to the benefit of the entrenched party.'
p22378
aS'If this were not the case, the entrenched party would be under competition and forced to change its behavior.'
p22379
aS'I see this problem most poignantly in telecom and media.'
p22380
aS'Others may have experiences that see it in other sectors.'
p22381
aS'Interestingly, the power to write rules entails the power to make exceptions.'
p22382
aS'If the power was stripped to do this, there would be lest power to create loopholes.'
p22383
aS'But as you say, how do we prevent something like fracking with poisonous materials.'
p22384
aS'The answer the libertarians give is that the people who are affected by the behavior should be able to sue the responsible party, up to and including shuttering them.'
p22385
aS'Currently, many regulations actually strip the ability of citizens to sue for damages, and if they can sue, the damages are capped to protect the companies.'
p22386
aS'The libertarian position is that all of this needs to go a way and more general power must be granted to citizens to sue.'
p22387
aS'Without this extra power, I agree with you, deregulation just means wanton destruction without consequence.'
p22388
aS'With this extra power, we would have to go through scenarios and formulas to determine if private citizens could sue hard enough to matter.'
p22389
aS'So well-written, so many unwarranted downvotes...'
p22390
aS'Quite few regulations are aimed at limiting competition.'
p22391
aS'If you look at the financial crisis, this was a prime example of regulatory capture allowing banks to avoid regulations.'
p22392
aS'Dereguation would have made the process much easier.'
p22393
aS'&gt; The problem with most regulations is often that they prevent the market from operating efficiently to the benefit of the entrenched party.'
p22394
aS'Who is the entrenched party regarding health and safety laws or environmental regulation?'
p22395
aS'How do these prevent competition?'
p22396
aS'&gt; The answer the libertarians give is that the people who are affected by the behavior should be able to sue the responsible party, up to and including shuttering them.'
p22397
aS"But what about issues where people aren't aware of the damage that is being done to them or can't prove it?"
p22398
aS'Can ordinary people really match the resources of big business?'
p22399
aS'What about issues like air pollution where the health damage is long term, spread across a huge number of disorganised people?'
p22400
aS'Leaving everyone to sue each other would be fantastic for lawyers but a nightmare for everyone else.'
p22401
aS"You do realize that the vast majority of Libertarians (minus a very small fringe) don't advocate for removing regulations that protect health and safety, right?"
p22402
aS'Libertarian ideals do not equal "no rule of law.'
p22403
aS'" This is a common mischaracterization.'
p22404
aS'Really?'
p22405
aS"Most of the ones I've come across do (or at least greatly reduce them)."
p22406
aS'Its a pretty common claim that regulations are strangling private business or something.'
p22407
aS'Some regulations do, and others are entirely appropriate.'
p22408
aS'There is an active debate in the Libertarian community about where to draw the line, though the general trend is towards vastly reduced amounts of regulation overall.'
p22409
aS'It is pure demonization to say that Libertarians are only for pro-big business deregulation.'
p22410
aS'This grossly mischarachterizes the actual stated position in the party platform the majority opinion of self-described Libertarians.'
p22411
aS'Ask any Libertarian if he/she would advocate that the law allow nuclear waste to be burried or dumped in the city center and you will find almost every single one of them say no.'
p22412
aS'I think Libertarians have failed to adequately address the problem of common resources like air, water, and land.'
p22413
aS"Their fallback for land is private property, their fall-back for water is that there's an upstream and a downstream so you can trace the misdeed (but they're wrong), and they have no answer for air."
p22414
aS'I believe this to be one of the greatest failings of their political philosophy.'
p22415
aS'&gt; Who is the entrenched party regarding health and safety laws or environmental regulation?'
p22416
aS'How do these prevent competition?'
p22417
aS"If you've never tried to start your own business you probably wouldn't have run into this."
p22418
aS'If you have, you may have not run into this.'
p22419
aS'But many businesses have to spend a lot of money to get over regulatory hurdles to even begin operation, even if their business is not really presenting a risk.'
p22420
aS'This is the way bureaucracy kills things.'
p22421
aS'Regulations are wide reaching and open to interpretation and the interpretation generally is done by the government agency and creates costs for private business.'
p22422
aS'A friends NYC restaurant was inspected and docked heavily because of an unwashed cheese grater.'
p22423
aS"The problem is that the cheese grater was hanging from the ceiling of the kitchen and never used by the cooks, it wasn't a tool used to prep food, but it was present in the kitchen, suspended by a wire."
p22424
aS'The cost for re-inspection was several thousand dollars.'
p22425
aS"Another friend's restaurant was told he MUST have a hand-washing sink at the counter where sushi was being prepared, but the place was so tiny all the chef had to do was turn around and take 2 steps (or 1 large one) and he'd be at the sink."
p22426
aS'In order to satisfy the regulation, the owner had to take a saw to the counter, cut a hole in it, insert a sink basin, and since there was no plumbing at that precise spot he had to run hoses from the old sink to the new one just to satisfy the regulation.'
p22427
aS'These are relatively common and simple in NYC restaurants.'
p22428
aS'Bigger problems arise when $10k pieces of equipment are the only things that satisfy a particular regulation when business is barely clearly that much in revenue, or when the documentation requirement is so large you need to retain a consulting firm for 50-man hour a quarter, just to process 150-page regulatory compliance documents.'
p22429
aS'All of these things cost money.'
p22430
aS'Competition only works efficiently when little guys can get started and turn into middle-sized guys and, in the aggregate, serve enough customers to provide price and quality competition to the big guys.'
p22431
aS'Small things like going from an A to B in health department grading over a cheese grater and a single tomato wrapped in saran wrap but not in the fridge (btw, refrigerated tomatoes are terrible) can be enough to drive a NYC restaurant out of business in under 6 months.'
p22432
aS'The requirement to buy $10k pieces of equipment are often far too much to bear and require either a bank loan or cause the entrepreneur to not even attempt it and move on to another project.'
p22433
aS'But the most important question you raised:\n\n&gt; Can ordinary people really match the resources of big business?'
p22434
aS'This is a major problem with our judicial system, no matter what political ideology or philosophy we are talking about.'
p22435
aS'For the Libertarians to even have a chance at making their position tenable, we have to reform the judicial system to make it easier citizens to have their grievances redressed and harder for well-moneyed defendants to escape unscathed.'
p22436
aS'I actually like that this is the linchpin for Libertarians because it gives me a focal point for actionable change.'
p22437

aS"It doesn't."
p22564
aS"You're starting from flawed premises: the decentralized government (A) isn't a singular thing that controls something and (B) isn't intended to *control* corporations."
p22565
aS'A "decentralized government" is a system of multiple independent governmental bodies working in parallel.'
p22566
aS'Governments are generally the only entity in a society that has legitimate claim to the use of violent force.'
p22567
aS'Regulatory capture by corporations effectively transfers the power to use such violent force from the government to the corporation.'
p22568
aS'The goal of a decentralized government is to spread control of violent force over as many independent bodies as possible, making the task of usurping that power for corporate gain more difficult and the task of maintaining control over that power more cumbersome and vulnerable to collective opposition from the members of society.'
p22569
aS"In this way, the decentralized governmental structure isn't intended to control a highly centralized corporation but instead to (A) mitigate the damage it can cause and (B) create a plethora of avenues for adjustment and response to bad behavior."
p22570
aS'In contrast, a highly centralized governmental structure aggregates violent force in such a way that (A) the stakes of regulatory capture are MUCH higher and (B) the avenues for adjustment and redress are highly constrained.'
p22571
aS"&gt; isn't intended to control corporations\n\nYes, it is totally, as corporations are conventions born of government."
p22572
aS'Nothing more.'
p22573
aS'Just because we have created a concept of "corporations" and enabled their creation through legislation and government bureaucracy doesn\'t mean the government intends to *control* them in the sense of dictating what actions they can and cannot do.'
p22574
aS'That would be nigh impossible as the domain of action is practically infinite.'
p22575
aS'Again, I contend that governments seek to *mitigate damage* not directly control.'
p22576
aS'Both centralized and decentralized governments can achieve this goal.'
p22577
aS'&gt; Governments are generally the only entity in a society that has legitimate claim to the use of violent force.'

p22580
aS"I am permitted to use violent force against a mouse that's invaded my home."
p22581
aS'I am permitted to use violent force against anyone trying to use force to kill me.'
p22582
aS'Our government has agents; agents we authorize to use force *on our behalf* for the same things.\n\n '
p22583
aS'&gt; generally\n\nIn special cases you are allowed to wield violent force: sport, self-defense.'
p22584
aS"That's pretty much it."
p22585
aS'You cannot be a vigilante.'
p22586
aS'You cannot premeditate the use of violence against criminals, etc.'
p22587
aS'The standard social contract, world-wide at this point, is such that you give up your rights (or the vast vast majority of them) in your exercise of violent force in exchange for participation in the society.'
p22588
aS'Hence, the government has a functional monopoly on the use of violent force.'
p22589
aS"To be fair, most of the time we also don't allow governments to use force in anything other than a defensive manner, the idea that a proportional response is the only acceptable one is pretty ingrained in most national legal systems and indeed somewhat in international law (wars of aggression are not lawful, defensive actions are etc.. its only recently that the idea of a pre-emptive defence has really come into its own..)."
p22590
aS"If we include imprisonment as a violent act (which lots of people do...) it again is something that we regulate with due process and (with a few notable exceptions) generally don't overuse in terms of either lengths of detention or conditions in detention."
p22591
aS'People have most of the same rights, we can act in self defence, we can arrest someone and cause them to be incarcerated and we can generally bring private criminal and civil prosecutions.  '
p22592
aS'While I understand the metaphorical similarities, I believe it is the actual difference between individual and state that the Libertarian uses to argue for the damage of any government larger than minuscule.'
p22593
aS"By way of easy example, let's look at regulatory capture."
p22594
aS'A regulatory body, influenced by a large and old business entity (Big W), unilaterally uses the powers of regulation granted to it by the Congress to determine that selling used Widgets requires a license.'
p22595
aS'The justification is cited as being that old Widgets can potentially be dangerous to consumers.'
p22596
aS'However, the true economic impact is that many of Big Ws competitors go out of business due to the cost of compliance, future potential competitors have a larger barrier to entry, and consumers have reduced choices in where to go to buy Widgets.'
p22597
aS"Now, let's say I open a used Widget shop and begin selling without a license."
p22598
aS'What will happen?'
p22599
aS"My neighbors won't confront me."
p22600
aS'Big W has no recourse.'
p22601
aS'Instead, armed officers will approach me at my place of business or my home.'
p22602
aS"They will most likely not be violent, though given the use of [force](http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/tarrant/Owners-irked-after-raid-on-Arlingtons-Garden-of-Eden--219354841.html) against this [organic farm](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/texas-swat-team-conducts-_n_3764951.html) in Texas, I'm no longer sure it will be a calm visit."
p22603
aS'Regardless, failure to comply with the demands to stop selling Widgets will result in armed officers physical detaining me and imprisoning me.'
p22604
aS'To recap, people elected officials, elected officials appointed trusted officials, trusted officials acted without direct elected official influence (therefore the action was not directly approved by the "will of the people") but with the direct influence of a business entity seeking to use violence to improve its business prospects, the threat of violent force is used to enforce a regulation that harms many and benefits few.'
p22605
aS'This is not a situation where there would be equivalence.'
p22606
aS'I think anyone would be hard pressed to find an equivalent individual use of force that mirrors this scenario.'
p22607
aS'Thus, I contend that the governmental use of force is not identical to the limited use of force afforded citizens.'
p22608
aS'Citizens may use force only for self preservation against a clear and present danger.'
p22609
aS'Government may use force in the interest of long-term self-preservation, the maintenance of behavioral codes, and any other interest it may seek to promote.'
p22610
aS'So while I agree that there exist checks and balances, due process, and the rule of law, I believe that the entire point of contention between political philosophies is whether or not the current implementation and surrounding foundation are the most just.'
p22611
aS'Libertarians argue that the problem is precisely that government has an influence over so wide a playing field that the defenses we have for self-regulating are insufficient to ensure a just society.'
p22612
aS'They argue that we must fundamentally limit the scope of government to have any hope that our tools for self-governance are effective.'
p22613
aS'In contrast, people who push for greater government power believe the problem is that governments are powerless to stop the constantly growing influence of purely economic entities and that government must continue to grow and evolve much as the corporate entity does.'
p22614
aS'So, how do you see it?'
p22615
aS'Have I argued sufficiently that governmental use of force is categorically more expansive than the use of force by the individual?'
p22616

p22681
aS'Is there a specific rule that we could look at?'
p22682
aS'From what I can tell, the main reason that agencies like ASCAP and the MPAA can act as they do is because of Copyright Law.'
p22683
aS'I see a possible solution to this issue being to change Copyright legislation to expand the definition of "fair use" to allow playback in commercial venues as long as music/movies aren\'t the main profit centers for the business.'
p22684

p22701
aS'No.'

aS'I do not believe the FCC is structured in any way, shape, or form that would allow for incremental reform.'
p22704
aS'I think instead of trying to race special interest in the reform game (a race we have all been losing for decades) that we need to review what regulations exist the FCC have enacted that are worth keeping, abolish the FCC completely, and either (A) devise a new agency with a totally new structure to start from the best regulation we selected or (B) move the responsibility of those regulations to an existing agency that has the power to enforce and the structure to resist capture.'
p22705
aS'And this is where I think we differ.'
p22706
aS"We both want reform, but you think I'm being rash for wanting somethings razed to the ground and I think you're woefully ignorant of the level of corruption of your up against if you think incrementalization will work."

aS'Every gain is so rare and so hard-fought that 4 - 8 losses occur before the gain is enacted.'

p22710
aS"At some point, you realize the problem isn't the individual regulations, it's the governing body."
p22711
aS"And since you can't vote them out, you've got to kick them out."
p22712
aS"Since you can't directly change regulation, can't vote on regulation, and your elected congresspersons are outnumbered by political appointees, you really don't have much hope of reforming when corruption becomes so thoroughly entrenched."
p22713
aS'Grassroots reforms are public, the corrupt are watching and establishing defenses very early, they have more lawyers, more money, and more influence, and they begin their chess game before you even get your movement explained well enough to get support.'
p22714
aS'By the time you\'ve got something before the Congress, you\'ve more than likely lost the battle for hearts and minds, and the reform you\'re seeking to enact is based on your limited knowledge of the regulatory regime which has already changed slightly, but enough to absorb your reform in the worst case (for them) or demonstrate "good faith" to Congress and get it killed before it gets any teeth in the best case (for them).'
p22715
aS'So I empathize with the "burn it down" mentality because I\'ve seen the futility of fighting entrenched interests and I\'ve seen the problems of having so large of a government that Congress can barely keep up.'
p22716
aS"The appointees are operating without sufficient government oversight because we'd have to increase the number of elected officials just to get the oversight in the first place, and by the time that happens the size and number of agencies will continue to grow and outstrip our ability to oversee them, yet again."

aS'They are too long, too convoluted, and contain too many caveats.'

p22734
aS"&gt; It's a false statement."
p22735
aS'Is it a false premise, given that I\'m using the word "generally" as a stand-in for the small caveats of sport and self-defense?'
p22736
aS'We could refine it further to be "violence against humans" to cover animal slaughter for food.'
p22737
aS'Let\'s go right to "violent force", shall we?'

aS'Property and force go hand in hand.'
p22741
aS'Okay?'
p22742
aS'Your meaning is unclear.'
p22743
aS'Are you stating that there is an equivalence between a piece of paper and a punch in the nose?'
p22744
aS'Are you stating that without property there would be no force?'
p22745
aS"I fear I'm in danger of losing the thread of your argument and you've only just begun to explain it."
p22746
aS'My statement is that governments are, in general, the only entities with legitimate claim to using violent force, also reformulated as physical violence.'
p22747
aS'This can entail physical harm, physical restraint, deprivation of air, water, or food (generally a derivation of physical restraint), and death (generally a derivation of physical harm).'
p22748
aS'Your statement is that force and property go hand-in-hand.'
p22749
aS'I can imagine a society without property as such that still must make decisions on the legitimacy of the use of violence.'
p22750
aS"I'm hoping you can clarify your position so that I might be better able to participate in this argument."
p22751

p22758
aS'The people of the US have consented to a form of government that changes over time via representative democratic rule.'
p22759
aS'One of the core assumptions of this government is that "the people" give up their rights to exercise violence in society for the mutual benefit of a safe and stable society, enforced by violence conducted by the government.'
p22760
aS'This nigh universal tenet of self-governance comes with an inherent risk: that those entrusted with wielding violence justly behave unjustly.'
p22761
aS'This risk is mitigated by various structures within the rule of law: elections, term limits, a constitution, "checks and balances" between various governmental structures.'
p22762
aS'My claim is that both a centralized and a decentralized governmental structure can mitigate the damage caused by so-called (by you) "centralized corporations".'
p22763
aS'(which, by the way, they are not.'
p22764
aS'Each corporation wields power independently of each other and therefore private sector corporate behavior is decentralized).'
p22765
aS'Further, my claim is that of the risks inherent in both strong central and weak central governments, their are unique risks of regulatory capture and the unjust wielding of violence by a central government that are absent or lessened by many smaller governments with smaller geographical domains of influence (as in a federation).'
p22766
aS'You came into the discussion to argue an early premise about the monopoly of force, which I attempted to refine to mutual satisfaction.'
p22767
aS'You then moved on to what seemed like a grievance in my refinement that omitted something specific about property and its connection with violence.'
p22768
aS'I asked for clarification on this point and attempted to demonstrate a little bit of my familiarity with the problems of property in an attempt to help you help me understand.'
p22769

p22775
aS"You intermix positive and normative statements so much it's difficult to argue."
p22776
aS'"violence" is an emotional term.'
p22777
aS'&gt;  I worry this is going nowhere.'
p22778
aS'And it will go nowhere so long as you mix emotional with factual.  \n'
p22779
aS"&gt; You intermix positive and normative statements so much it's difficult to argue."
p22780
aS'"violence" is an emotional term.'
p22781
aS'Then let us define it.'
p22782
aS'I have been using violence to mean "the use of physical force to cause injury, damage, death".'
p22783
aS'Will that enable us to continue this discussion?'
p22784
aS'&gt; How can a decentralized governmental structure mitigate the damage caused by so-called "centralized corporations".'
p22785
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p22786
aS'A "decentralized government" is one in which there are many entities with smaller adjacent domains of jurisdiction, as opposed to a "centralized government" where a single entity covers all domains of jurisdiction within state.'
p22787
aS'Corporations, I argue, are more akin to decentralized governments.'
p22788
aS'There is no single corporation with control over the economic activity of their entire market (unless you have a monopoly or cartel).'
p22789
aS'Instead, you have many corporations, each with their own governing body, own decision making process, and their own domains.'
p22790
aS"But, without even going into the terminological argument here, let's talk about the operative portion of your question: mitigating damages."
p22791
aS"Let's discuss some of the types of damages a corporation can cause."
p22792
aS'Environmental (commons) damage, direct application of physical force (including imprisonment, harm, and death) against 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons), and direct application of physical force (including destruction, damage, and theft) against property claimed by 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons).'
p22793
aS'A government with jurisdiction over any entity can take punitive action against said entity for violating the code of behavior enforced by said government.'
p22794
aS'The government must therefore have sufficient power to become of aware of these violations, enforce the punishment, and to construct and maintain a just code of behavior by which to govern.'
p22795
aS'In a decentralized government, the existence of many government entities may increase awareness of violations by virtue of the larger aggregate volume of information flowing through the whole system.'
p22796
aS'All violations occur at specific locations and at specific times, therefore stronger relationships between governing bodies and multiple locales enables a distributed information gathering system to be maintained.'
p22797
aS'In a centralized government, bureaucracies are used to create the same level of awareness, but I propose that the evidence is such that reliance on local government has not been supplanted by these bureaucracies.'
p22798
aS'In a decentralized government, resources may be more constrained in any given governmental body than they would be in a centralized one.'
p22799
aS'This may negatively impact the ability of a governmental body in a decentralized system to enforce punishment on larger actors.'
p22800
aS"I don't readily see why this would be the case."
p22801
aS'Given that private entities are not permitted to maintain their own militias, a decentralized government would still maintain a monopoly on the use of physical violence for the purposes of regulatory enforcement.'
p22802
aS"A corporation, despite it's larger economic capacity, would still be unable to resist arrest."
p22803
aS'If this point is contended, we would be in the realm of pure speculation as in the US we have never seen a corporation raise a mercenary army to opposed state forces in the enforcement of regulation.'
p22804
aS'Lastly, we come to the ability to construct and maintain a just code of behavior.'
p22805
aS'In a decentralized government, we would be most assuredly be in a situation where there were differences across any given state in the code of behavior.'
p22806
aS"A modern example would be California's laws regarding labeling of products as well as emission standards for cars."
p22807
aS'The people that are represented by that governing body ostensibly have different ideas for the optimal definition of justice than their neighbors.'
p22808
aS'In a centralized government, there is one behavior code.'
p22809
aS'As seen by the implementation of centralized decision-making systems, this behavior code changes much more slowly.'
p22810
aS'This means injustices are introduced more slowly and injustices are resolved more slowly.'
p22811
aS'It\'s not clear that centralization or decentralization presents the better system for maintaining a code of behavior until we look at the concept of "regulatory capture".'
p22812
aS'Through this mechanism, the power of the government to apply punishment can be directed to the benefit of few to the detriment of the many.'
p22813
aS'This is generally assumed to be something that cannot happen given a well functioning government with checks and balances.'
p22814
aS'However, in existing implementations of government, we see that special interest is able to bypass the inertia of centralized government to enable injustices to be added to the code of behavior more quickly than they can be removed.'
p22815
aS'Further, it has been demonstrated that these injustices can be defended through further manipulation of the code of behavior, enacted quickly by special interest.'
p22816
aS'It is the claim of Libertarians that the situation is such that the citizenry will always lose this race so long as the ability of the governing body to modify the code of behavior is unfettered.'
p22817
aS'Therefore, the claim is that many codes of behavior allow for 2 things: 1) more work for a special interest due to needing to manipulate hundreds of entities instead of one and 2) greater redress of injustice due to smaller domains more responsive to their constituents.'
p22818
aS'Sorry, too long.'
p22819
aS'Honestly, how can I reply to that manifesto?'
p22820
aS"Please tell me it's a copy &amp; paste. "
p22821
aS"It's not."
p22822
aS'I expected you to deconstruct the points and make counterpoints.'
p22823
aS'Allow me to make it easier for you:\n\nGiven:  \n"Violence" is defined as "the use of physical force to cause injury, damage, death".'
p22824
aS'"Decentralized government" is defined as a system of government characterized by the existence of many individual governing bodies, with individual jurisdictions, each having both a common set of rules regulating their operations as well as individual bodies of legislation reflective of the will of the subset of the governed represented by said individual governing body.'
p22825
aS'"Centralized government" is defined as a system of government characterized by a single governing body with a comprehensive jurisdiction and one body of legislation reflective of the entirety of the citizenry of the state in question.'
p22826
aS'"Centralized corporation" is defined as a corporate entity with a decision making body.'
p22827
aS'"Decentralized corporation" is defined a corporate entity with multiple decision making bodies that act independently over some aspect of the corporation\'s behavior.'
p22828
aS'Do you accept these definitions for the sake of our current debate?'
p22829
aS'Current question, posed by JohnnyBeagle:  \n&gt; How can a decentralized governmental structure mitigate the damage caused by so-called "centralized corporations".'
p22830
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p22831
aS'First, we must identify the potential damages caused by corporations.'
p22832
aS'* Environmental (commons) damage  \n* direct application of physical force (including imprisonment, harm, and death) against 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons)  \n* direct application of physical force (including destruction, damage, and theft) against property claimed by 1 or more persons (unauthorized by said persons)  \n\nDo you accept that these are types of potential damages caused by corporations?'
p22833
aS'Do you have any others you feel need to be added for the sake of argument?'
p22834
aS'We may amend this list later as the need arises.'
p22835
aS'Having defined the types of damage that may be caused by a corporation, we must now move on to how any government may mitigate these damages.'
p22836
aS'I propose that there is really only one way: *punitive action*.'
p22837
aS'I further propose that while prior restraint may be posited as a second technique, it is wholly reliant on punitive action to enforce and therefore may be reduced to punitive action for the sake of argument.'
p22838
aS'Would you agree that punitive action is the only mechanism by which a government may mitigate the damage caused by a corporation (enumerated above).'
p22839
aS'At this point, we have:\n\n1) Definitions  \n2) Enumeration of the types of potential damage caused by a corporation.'
p22840
aS'3) Specified the mechanism by which a government may mitigate such damage.'
p22841
aS'Barring modifications based on your objections, we must further elucidate the problems indicated by your question:\n\n&gt;How can a **decentralized governmental structure** mitigate the damage caused by so-called **"centralized corporations"**.'
p22842
aS"That's a David and Goliath situation that is possible, but more fairy tale than fact."
p22843
aS'[Emphasis mine]\n\nI will take the liberty of reforming your question into a conjecture: Centralized governments are more effective at mitigating the damage by centralized corporations when compared to decentralized ones.'
p22844
aS'So, how about I let you get a word in edgewise here, determine if our definitions and enumerations are common, and determine if my formulation of your conjecture is in fact accurate.'
p22845
aS'If so, we can then proceed to deconstruct my above screed to a more formal argument as to why a decentralized government would have the same or better capacity to mitigate the damage caused by ANY form of corporation when compared to a centralized government.'
p22846
aS'Nothing controls big corporations, but big government makes big corporations.'
p22847
aS'&gt; but big government makes big corporations.'
p22848
aS"So you're trying to tell me that absent big government, the wealthy will not cooperate for their mutual benefit?  "
p22849
aS'Its a pretty common libertarian trope. '
p22850
aS"I can conspire with my buddy to make everyone in the neighborhood pay me to keep the air oxygenated, but it's a hell of a lot more work to do so if there isn't a bribable gang in the neighborhood willing to use violence to enforce it."
p22851
aS"If you aren't aware that billions of dollars go missing in the Pentagon, and that a majority of no-bid contracts are handed to the politically connected (and never completed), it may be time to educate yourself about what the Federal government is actually doing with your money."
p22852
aS"And before you start: it's not the GOP."

p23619
aS'There is no "give", and therefore it is not valid to argue that there should be an equivalent "take".'
p23620
aS'The way to counter this is to say that the responsibilities of the governed are ALSO self-evident and understood to be inherent and extant to the human condition.'
p23621
aS'Would you like to make this claim?'
p23622
aS'If so, what responsibilities do you believe are inherent to all humans everywhere that everyone can agree to?'

p23627
aS"It's not a direct argument at all."
p23628
aS'Are you saying the responsibility inherent to the human condition is adherence to the social contract?'
p23629
aS"I don't think any human MUST adhere to it as part of their condition, but I do believe that humans who don't adhere to the social contract are still afforded the rights enumerated in the Constitution."
p23630
aS"That's why, shock of all shocks, NON-US CITIZENS are still treated as though they have the same rights as citizens."

p23638
aS'These aren\'t "goodies", they are not easements, privileges, rewards for good behavior, blessing bestowed by rulers or governing bodies, boons to be negotiated for.'

aS'These are AXIOMATICALLY DECLARED RIGHTS.'
p23640
aS'They are the foundations for all arguments proceeding from the basis of civil society.'
p23641
aS'If you disagree with these rights you are NOT in the same domain as others and cannot proceed with the formulation of any argument regarding governance and politics until the core assumptions are resolved or the domain is constrained sufficiently so as to ensure no contradiction in axioms between the two arguing parties.'
p23642
aS'There is no tit-for-tat, no tradeoff, no give-and-take.'
p23643
aS'Rights are declared as inherent to the human condition and therefore anyone adhering to a given charter that declares such rights applies these rights to ALL humans regardless of any qualifying characteristics of the human, be it creed, fealty, or even criminal status.'

aS'Criminals still have rights and it is the domain of law to determine by what logic the collective is permitted to abridge the rights of an individual, the most obvious reasons being codified in criminal law.'
p23645
aS'But even criminal law is very careful and respectful of the rights of the criminal, because they are NOT goodies, they are not frivolities, and they are not whimsical privileges afforded individuals by their benevolent rules.'

p23674
aS"ADDITIONALLY, I have NO IDEA how ANY OF THIS is relevant to the conversation we were having just ONE FUCKING POST AGO about whether or not a declaration of rights shouldn't also contain a declaration of inherent responsibilities like adherence to the social contract of a particular state."
p23675
aS"I also am starting to worry that you won't even bother to explain yourself but instead will question me about some other non-sequitur that you feel vindicates your position but to the rest of us makes you look like someone who can't control their own thought process long enough to fashion a reasoned argument to engage in a debate."

aS'Libertarian philosophy starts from core values regarding individual liberty.'
p23970
aS'It then describes government, quite accurately, as an institution of the collective which demands that individual liberties be abridged for the common good.'
p23971
aS'Then, it moves on to state that the abridgment of individual liberty should be as limited as possible to promote the core value of individual liberty.'
p23972
aS'Then, it attempts to argue for alternative solutions to collective problems that do not involve the abridgment of individual liberty.'
p23973
aS'Finally, it argues that power tends to aggregate and corrupt and that not only are their alternatives to the current level of abridgment of individual liberty but that the powerfully corrupt abuse the collectives trust to harm us and, as such, it is important to strip the government of certain powers to ensure that the institution we trust remains trustworthy.'

p23980
aS'I do think that you run into a lot of people that argue a pro-market stance because "the market is an end" and not only do I disagree with that axiom but I also firmly believe it\'s not a base axiom but a derived one and that one can argue "the market is a means" quite successfully with a libertarian who values honest debate.'

p23997
aS'Capitalism itself is not the issue.'
p23998
aS'The way it is implemented is the issue. '
p23999
aS'Systemic poverty can only exist within systems of economic hierarchy, such as feudalism, capitalism, and state socialism, so pointing to capitalism bringing people out of poverty is absurd.'

p24006
aS'As such, the problem is certainly capitalism itself.'

p24017
aS"Oh, I know this will be an uphill struggle convincing the proletariat and fellow lumpenproletariat of revolution, though certainly a less uphill battle with fellow lumpen as we tend to be more class conscious than proletariat, at least in this country, contrary to what Marx claimed, though consistent with Bakunin's evaluation."
p24018
aS'That is not, to me, the question.'
p24019
aS'The question, to me, is how to move forward with revolt to seize liberty for all.'

p24037
aS"The problem isn't really the system, exactly."

p24041
aS'Greedy evil fuckers.'
p24042

p24047

p24048
aS"There may well be structural issues and economic issues - but fixing those things won't do much to help until the real problem is admitted and dealt with."
p24049
aS'There are a small number of people who are doing a large amount of harm.'
p24050
aS'Time to deworm ourselves. '
p24051
aS'Are you kidding me?'
p24052
aS'The problem is totally the system.'
p24053
aS'The system creates economic hierarchy by giving the owners power over the producers.'
p24054
aS'This is where the problems come from.'
p24055
aS'Indeed, in every example you have given, there was economic hierarchy, which is one of the big reasons that each of them had oppression *from the start* and that said oppression *never went away*.'
p24056
aS'However, if you compare it to, say, Zapatista controlled land in Chiapas, you find that they have been around for over a decade without the same sort of oppression you find under capitalism, feudalism, or state socialism.'
p24057
aS'Why?'
p24058
aS'Because they are lacking in the same economic hierarchies and, indeed, are mostly organized along libertarian socialist lines.'
p24059
aS'Similarly, the Free Territory in Ukraine during the Russian Civil War and Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War, though both lasted much less time than the Zapatistas in Chiapas, both were absent of the same sort of oppression found under the systems of economic hierarchy.'
p24060
aS'Again, this is because they were organized along libertarian socialist lines, with these ones being anarchist and communist.'
p24061
aS'So all these systems of economic hierarchy have contained within them this systemic oppression that one just does not find in the systems without economic hierarchy.'
p24062
aS'This tells me that the problem does not lie with, as you termed it, "a bad case of the worms" which are making the system oppressive.'
p24063
aS'Rather, the systems themselves are oppressive, and the worms you speak of are either not needed or created by the systems themselves.'
p24064
aS'you did not hear me.'
p24065
aS'You are pointing to examples where things actually work.'
p24066
aS"Well, if they do, that's because intelligent, honest and honorable people were involved."
p24067
aS'If you can create such people, they can make about any system work.'
p24068
aS"And communism works fine up to a point; it just doesn't *scale* well."
p24069
aS'My criticism is "that needs working on.'
p24070
aS'"\n\nBut no system can work if the corrupt and the greedy and the stupid take it over.'
p24071
aS'If there are no inbuilt safeguards, they will.'
p24072
aS'EVERYONE needs to work on that.'
p24073
aS'In your last paragraph, you dismiss "worms" and try to blame the system.'
p24074
aS'But people *designed* the system.'
p24075
aS'People *eroded* the safeguards.'
p24076
aS'People *subverted* the markets (in the capitalist system) and the planning nexi (in the communist systems).'
p24077
aS'And then of course each structure staggered on - growing and evolving at the direction of their zombie virus masters.'
p24078
aS'In other words, we are not even argued yet.'
p24079
aS'Even if you are correct and the structure is the problem, who do you think *built* it?'
p24080
aS'So people made these systems of hierarchy.'
p24081
aS'So?'
p24082
aS'My argument is that the hierarchical economic systems lead to oppression.'
p24083
aS'I backed this up by pointing out that every time people have built a system without such hierarchical economic power structures, there has been little to no oppression.'
p24084
aS"On the other hand, I can't think of a single system with hierarchical power structures that can say the same."
p24085
aS"I mean, of course they are made by people, though I would argue that the capitalistic markets and central planning were never subverted and functioning just as designed, but this doesn't mean that the system is not what is at fault here."
p24086
aS'&gt;My argument is that the hierarchical economic systems lead to oppression.'
p24087
aS"Can't argue that point."
p24088
aS"But then I wasn't."
p24089
aS"It's rather underlined by the hierarchal powers structure that the Communist International tried to become and that most Communist countries did become."
p24090
aS'The theory was used to conceal the actual practice.'
p24091
aS'And if you are gong to sputter "but, but CAPITALISM," I\'m gonna just nod and grin atcha.'
p24092
aS'The system was designed to advantage faulty people at the expense of *sincere* people.'
p24093

p24094
aS"Hell, I'd be good with targeted drone strikes, but then, I'm not always a nice or patient person."
p24095
aS"I'm only reluctant about that because I doubt it would actually WORK."
p24096
aS'The only thing that will work is arranging things so that nobody can accumlate that much power over others.'
p24097
aS"Once you have that, people can figure out for themselves what structure works best for them under what circumstances - and I expect there really shouldn't be any one particular answer to that question."
p24098
aS'The problem with the countries run by communists that spread through the world in the 20th century was marxist-leninism and the leninist theories of state power as well as the idea of the vanguard party.'
p24099
aS'Because of their theory of the state, they constructed a hierarchical structure in order to create a non-hierarchical structure.'
p24100
aS'This was a mistake.'
p24101
aS'In all the examples I gave that were good, they were constructed non-hierarchically from the start.'
p24102
aS'You see, by having no hierarchical structure, there is no way for people to gain power over anyone else.'
p24103
aS'This is especially true if the there is a culture of fierce egalitarianism, which will certainly happen if people just fought a revolution/insurrection to create a non-hierarchical society.'
p24104
aS'By doing that, you keep people from accumulating any power over others.'

aS'Your mistake is thinking that it was a *mistake.'

p24235
aS'This is source of my statement that bringing people out of poverty being the entire point.'
p24236
aS'The entire point is that the more people participating in the market place, trading more freely in self-interest, creates greater aggregate economic well-being than previously known.'
p24237
aS"And I think this is historically true, even if there exist better alternatives, I don't think it's deniable that the shift from dynastic central planning, to mercantilistic central planning, to unplanned markets and the promotion of a consumer class has been a progression towards lower global aggregate poverty."

aS'Capitalism has mechanisms by which power can be aggregated and wielded.'
p24259
aS"But I don't think that Capitalism was invented by tyrants to continue their strangehold."
p24260
aS'Ultimately, capitalism and market-driven economies are what made dynasties obsolete as liquidity increased and societies became more willing to trust more people in economic dealings.'
p24261
aS'We will continue to expand that trust, to continue to make power aggregation obsolete, and maybe even eliminate the idea of private ownership.'
p24262
aS'Alternatively, we may find ways to use private ownership in ways that enable collective self-sufficiency and ultimately chip away at the bastions of illegitimate power and tyranny.'

aS'In America,  regulated greed is also a problem.'
p24566
aS'Many American libertarians may be born in reaction to greed that is regulated through government corruption; one way to approach this problem is to reduce the government which is corrupt;  the cause of "good government" is lost in the USA (in my opinion).'

aS'The author simply states his position without making his case at all.'
p24573
aS'The USA is not a libertarian paradise, although it does have some features that are attractive (constitutionalism, judicial review, enumerated individual rights) these features are prized by the entire political spectrum in the US.'

aS'Furthermore, there are other features of American democracy that libertarians especially regret: unfettered power of majority, legislation favoring big business over small business, poor monetary policy and banking policy...'
p24575
aS'I am not really sure what the author means when he says that libertarians cannot be called pro-liberty if they oppose increased regulation of the activities of businessmen.'
p24576
aS'We are not in general pro-liberty if that means political liberty (ex: right to vote) except as a means to an end.'
p24577
aS"The end libertarianism pursues is individual liberty - the freedom to choose one's own activities and life without government interference."
p24578
aS'There are necessary and wise limits to this liberty, most obviously the prohibition on violence, effected through the criminal code, police, and penal system.'
p24579
aS'Nonetheless, the goal of a libertarian is to increase as much as possible this personal freedom, this private sphere of individual self-determination.'
p24580
aS'So much as is possible, both the richest and poorest should have freedom to determine the course of their own lives.'
p24581
aS'A few objections might be made here, the most common of which is that the extreme poor lack the power to determine their lives due to their economic condition.'
p24582
aS'In the most severe cases it may be appropriate for the government to provide for them on an emergency basis (temporarily, and based on need).'
p24583
aS'A second reply is that not all good things are automatically/necessarily the province of government - the extreme desirability of increased opportunity or care for the poor does not imply that it is government which should provide this care.'
p24584
aS'Income redistribution as a stated goal is difficult for me to accept.'
p24585
aS'Relief in times of personal emergency has a naturally limited character to it, while income redistribution will tend to cease its own operation only upon reaching total equality of all persons in material condition.'
p24586
aS'This equality depends on government control (preventing the immediate and drastic de-equalization as people make different choices with different results for their material well-being).'
p24587
aS'This is obviously a situation of drastically reduced liberty, and one which I believe no one is arguing in favor of.'

p24589
aS'Unfortunately it will take some time and require restraint on the part of government.'
p24590
aS'These are not features which are popular in policy, but are often wise.'
p24591
aS'Largely the task is to allow the poor and middle class to begin to accumulate wealth - if their standard of living is rapidly increasing, there is no case except envy which justifies excessive taxation or restraint of the rich.'
p24592
aS'One obvious move would be to reform US agricultural policies, and stop holding wheat, milk, and other staple foods at fixed, high prices.'
p24593
aS'This policy essentially robs from the poorest members of society to line the coffers of arbitrarily and randomly selected big business farmers (who otherwise would be forced to compete in offering higher-quality and more nutritious foodstuffs).'
p24594
aS'Another would be to abandon rent controls where they have been adopted - these are well-meaning but have resulted in no end of grief for all involved, including shortage of housing.'
p24595
aS'Another obvious policy move would be to reform taxation, ending many of the tax loopholes that interfere with decision-making and overall raise the tax burden of the poor and middle class.'
p24596
aS'Of course, there is a case to be made for direct emergency provision, but whether the government ought to provide this or a competent national charity, does not seem to be an already-decided issue.'

aS"But I'll restate it, because I was once a Libertarian and I'd still consider myself a champion of individual rights."

p24621
aS"If you were, you'd be anti-capitalism."

p24640
aS"Since I do believe that it's possible to have a future in which almost everyone has far more practical freedom than now while living in a world that is far less violent and nobody needs to be subject to the whims of any great power - well, the fact is, a LOT of people need to have a fair deal more power and smallish number will have to settle for less - and a handful need to submit to the inevitable."

p25514
aS'If you have hired a militia and bring it to bear against others you are in violation of the social contract and are therefore now eligible for punishment by the collective.'
p25515
aS'In most Libertarian formulations, this punishment is enacted by collectively managed private armed forces that are only used against violent aggressors that have broken the social contract.'

aS"I think you're confused about the difference between positive and negative rights. "

p25574
aS'It has even come up with a crowning principle to draw it\'s line in the sand - the "non-aggression" principle.'
p25575
aS'Drawing a line that states violence, in all forms, is unequivocally wrong, is itself a redeeming quality to Libertarian philosophy.'

aS'And in these 2 simple, possibly simplistic, understanding of Libertarian philosophy, you now have the ability to contend directly with its supporters and come to common understandings.'
p25577
aS'In arguing that Libertarianism would lead to serfdom, you must first make the case for how a serfdom comes about and then demonstrate that these steps are all inline with Libertarian values.'
p25578
aS'This allows you to make the case that Libertarianism has, at the very least, no baked in safeguards against this outcome.'
p25579
aS'If the argument has not been decided in your favor, most likely it is because the supporter of the Libertarian position has moved to saying that a serfdom is not undesirable.'
p25580
aS'At which point, you now have to make the argument that a system of serfs and lords is (A) NOT representative of a system with maximal personal liberty and (B) does not afford the opportunity, within the framework of Libertarian rules, for the growth of personal liberty over time.'
p25581
aS'If you manage to make this argument, you have successfully demonstrated that Libertarianism cannot achieve its stated goals without some reformulation, at the very least.'
p25582
aS'At which point, a true constructive dialog begins.'

aS'This is all so fucking beautiful and charming, and completely devoid of any rooting in reality.'
p25589
aS"Libertarians would stand by their principles, and then a bunch of sociopaths with largely looser 'moral codes' would take advantage of it."

p25609
aS"I don't think the issue is that people accuse Libertarians of advocating immorality directly."
p25610
aS'The accusation is a bit more subtle (though not much): Libertarians are prescribing a world in which immoral behavior goes unpunished, and as a result, those who are willing to engage in it can achieve an unfair dominance over those who are restrained by virtue.'
p25611
aS'A political ideology is not defined by what the people say it is.'

aS'Simplistically put, only the police get to kill people.'
p25616
aS'As such, it would seem that by removing the powers of the governing body to regulate behavior by a defined the corpus of law that now people can behave unchecked.'
p25617
aS'However, one of the common refrains you hear from the Libertarian camp is that the judicial branch of the government, which would still stand, is the avenue by which citizens can wield the power of government against any entity that would do them harm.'
p25618
aS'Currently, tort law has many limitations about who can sue, caps on damages, which behaviors are exempt, etc.'
p25619
aS'Under the ideals of Libertarianism, any citizen who is damaged can seek redress for those damages in court.'
p25620
aS'In this way, large transgressions, like dumping in a river and causing thousands to fall ill, would likely result in very large suits that would effectively regulate an immoral actor from taking said action or sufficiently and fairly punishing said actor if they carried out the transgression.'
p25621
aS'There are many problems with this position as I have put it forward.'

aS'(Edit for punctuation/spelling)'
p26430
aS"I think you're correct although I'm nowhere near educated enough to know what to do about the issue."
p26431
aS"It's too multifaceted to simply be a part of a taxation scheme though, it would also require significant education efforts (show the rich what being poor in America is), a realignment of corporate priorities and focus (toward their communities and employees rather than their shareholders) and probably a bit of magic as well."
p26432
aS'I guess the issue is it\'s basically the government drawing a line and saying "X is too much money".'
p26433
aS'Once you start taxing something at 90% you are disincentivizing anyone to make anything beyond that.'
p26434
aS"You're not gonna work that much harder just to have nearly all of it go to the government."
p26435
aS'So in theory that money would go to other employees or R&amp;D or whatever and ultimately help the economy. '
p26436
aS"You know, I don't think that's the case."
p26437
aS"Perhaps this kind of policy might lower a corporation's profit drive (which wouldn't be a bad thing, especially if that money was funnelled into employee pay and benefits, yeah?"
p26438
aS'), but in terms of the individual, my understanding is that the vast majority of people who make beyond X too much money are doing so through capital gains, meaning that their *money* is making too much money.'
p26439
aS"They aren't earning it, their money is - and I don't think you can put your money in a bank and say, sorry, I don't want that high an interest rate."
p26440
aS'When you set X at a high enough number, say, above a million, you do a pretty good job of excluding most wage earners and instead tax the capitalists (whose capital is just fine, earning money).  '
p26441
aS'Well, keep in mind that these are *marginal* rates.'
p26442
aS"When people talk about, for example, a 50% tax rate on top earners, that doesn't mean 50% of their *entire* income-- just the portion that's over and above a certain threshold."
p26443
aS'As for 30% being ridiculously high...I hate to tell you this, but the current top tax rate (on income over ~$407K) is already 39.6%.'
p26444
aS"There's no bracket/rate above that."
p26445
aS"So, the way it averages out, if you make $500K, you're paying about 31% of your total income, while if you make $2M, you're paying about 37.4%."
p26446
aS"So, I really don't know how this 30% rate on incomes over $1-2M would have actually worked."
p26447
aS'Not surprisingly, the article is pretty short on details.'
p26448
aS'I guess maybe an *extra* 30%, or 69.9% on income over $1M?'
p26449
aS'If that were the case, your $2M earner would pay an extra $300K.'
p26450
aS"I'm not going to debate whether that's fair or not; that extra amount is still about 50x more than I've ever made in a year."
p26451
aS"But, as other commenters have pointed out, it still wouldn't be the highest rate we've ever had in this country, and there's been a pretty direct correlation between lowered top tax rates, and rising inequality."
p26452
aS"The average tax rate on middle-incomes hasn't changed much since about 1965, while the top rate has pretty steadily dropped. \n\n\n\n"
